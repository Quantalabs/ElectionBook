Michaelah Montgomery surprised attendees at a rally by criticizing Harris’s impact on the Black community, despite previously expressing her strong support for the former president. Montgomery, a former Republican state employee, was invited onto the stage by the presidential candidate towards the conclusion of his address at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia over the weekend. Eager and confident, Montgomery seized the moment to voice her backing for Trump’s candidacy and vocalized concerns about Harris potentially occupying the White House. “The left is trying to tout this woman as a savior for the black community but all she’s done is hurt the black community since she came into the game,” Montgomery said. The education activist thanked Trump for “saving her historically black college” from closing and said that the former president has been a huge help to many HBCUs. She also gave a quick plug for Conserve the Culture, an organization she founded to recruit college students to historically Black colleges and maintain the community for HCBU alumni. The founder went on to repeat many of Trump’s campaign talking points about immigration and voting issues. A SCHEDULED SURPRISE When Trump first introduced Montgomery on Saturday, he recalled how they met by chance at a restaurant and he noticed that “She lit up the room.” The two reportedly met in early April when Trump visited a Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant after Trump campaigners sought to organize a meeting between the Republican candidate and Black voters, according to the Associated Press. “People find it so hard to believe that there are young Black people who would have loved the opportunity to meet Trump,” Montgomery told the AP in spring. Through her former work with the Georgia Republican Party, she regularly coordinated events for HBCU students seeking to discuss conservative ideas and meet local politicians. So when she heard through her network that Trump would be coming to town, she quickly mobilized a group of students and alumni to meet the former president. “Everybody got together at around 9:30 in the morning and walked on over to the Chick-fil-A and then we sat there and waited until the president showed up,” Montgomery said. The joyous moments were captured in multiple viral videos on social media. “It’s really disheartening to see that the media makes it seem like we just stumbled into a Chick-fil-A and he bought us milkshakes.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA BLACK activist has won over the crowd at a Trump rally&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Michaelah Montgomery, a glamorous activist, criticizes Kamala Harris during a speech at a Trump rally following her viral Chick-fil-A surprise. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/michaelah-montgomery-a-glamorous-activist-criticizes-kamala-harris-during-a-speech-at-a-trump-rally-following-her-viral-chick-fil-a-surprise/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Glam-activist-Michaelah-Montgomery-rips-Kamala-Harris-in-Trump-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 01:00:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":253325138,"title":"Ben Affleck, 51, unveils midlife crisis makeover as he emerges amid Jennifer Lopez divorce drama with faux hawk, rocker tee and NO ring","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Aug 4th 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 15°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Looters take advantage of riots to steal wine, phones and crocs as they ransack shops in Liverpool, Hull and Manchester while anarchy sweeps Britain, with police officers hospitalised by thugs and clashes between rival groups Man whose arms and face melted after he touched 11,000-volt live cable while 'trying to steal scrap metal' thanks the paramedics who helped save his life William and Kate say no to having servants at their Windsor home as they prefer to raise their three children George, Charlotte and Louis on their own PETER HITCHENS: It's time that responsible, conservative patriots stood up to Faragism.

JLo, 55, and Ben, 51, have not been seen together in two months, and sources tell DailyMail.com they have prepared divorce documents to file at a later date. Just this Thursday evening, JLo was spotted stepping out without her wedding band, and with her engagement ring moved to her right hand. Now Ben has revealed his own jaw-dropping new look, complete with a tiny faux-hawk and a Red Hot Chili Peppers t-shirt. He rounded off the outfit with skinny jeans, aviators and black leather jacket that appeared undersized - but went noticeably without his wedding ring. Ben Affleck unveiled a shocking midlife crisis makeover when he surfaced in Los Angeles over the weekend amid his marital woes with Jennifer Lopez JLo, 55, and Ben, 51, have not been seen together in two months, and sources tell DailyMail.com they have prepared divorce documents to file at a later date The sides of his head were shaved down almost completely, with only the barest bit of scruff left over as he took a stab at a punk rock aesthetic. He was spotted strolling through a parking lot before he hopped aboard his electric motorcycle, placed his helmet safely on his head and drove off. During his separation from his first wife Jennifer Garner - the mother of his three children - Ben also made a dramatic alteration to his look. He acquired a massive back tattoo of a phoenix that he initially claimed was 'fake for a role' after fans began remarking on it on social media. However, years later, after being mocked for 'his enormous, garish tattoo' in the New Yorker, he admitted the body art was real. The New Yorker piece was called The Great Sadness Of Ben Affleck, prompting him to retort on Twitter: 'I’m doing just fine. Thick skin bolstered by garish tattoos.' Ben's latest makeover comes after a friend close to him told Dailymail.com that JLo's alcohol venture was 'one of the things that broke the camel's back'. However, it’s understood that the drinks company was started prior to them getting back together and Ben was aware and supportive of the business. Now Ben has revealed his own jaw-dropping new look, complete with a tiny faux-hawk and a Red Hot Chili Peppers t-shirt The sides of his head were shaved down almost completely, with only the barest bit of scruff left over as he took a stab at a punk rock aesthetic After his failed early-aughts engagement to JLo, Ben went on to marry Jennifer Garner in 2005, and they had three children together, before splitting in 2015 and finalizing their divorce three years later He was spotted strolling through a parking lot before he hopped aboard his electric motorcycle, placed his helmet safely on his head and drove off Ben's latest makeover comes after a friend close to him told Dailymail.com that JLo's alcohol venture was 'one of the things that broke the camel's back' Indeed, they go so far as to say it contributed to Ben, not Jen, being the one to pull the plug on their union amid speculation that their marriage is finally at an end During his separation from his first wife Jennifer Garner - the mother of his three children - Ben acquired a massive back tattoo of a phoenix (pictured 2018) Be the first to commentBe one of the first to commentComments Was it wrong to promote the brand when your spouse is an alcoholic?Comment now Indeed, they go so far as to say it contributed to Ben, not Jen, being the one to pull the plug on their union amid speculation that their marriage is finally at an end. Why was Ben so infuriated by this high-profile commercial enterprise? Friends say that, as a recovering alcoholic, he felt his wife selling vodka and tequila tipples was insulting to him. He had, after all, spent many years battling his addiction. When the label was first launched last year, he was said to be devastated. His hurt was only heightened by his belief that her motivation for launching her drinks' brand was purely financial — for cold, hard cash. First seeking help for his alcoholism in 2001, Ben has since been in rehab multiple times. To make matters worse, J-Lo then went on a very public promo campaign where she told the Press how much she loves to drink to 'relax and let loose'. Even this week, she released an image of herself lounging on a sunbed in a swimming costume to advertise the latest addition to the range. One friend of the actor told the Mail: 'Ben had to fight to get his life back after overcoming alcohol. Knowing how he lost everything including the love of his family, knowing that he could possibly relapse, Jen decided to start her own spritzer line for more money, as if she did not have enough. JLo and Ben are pictured reuniting in mid-May amid the already gathering suspicion that their marriage of just two years was on the rocks Friends say that, as a recovering alcoholic, he felt his wife selling vodka and tequila tipples was insulting to him His hurt was only heightened by his belief that her motivation for launching her drinks' brand was purely financial — for cold, hard cash First seeking help for his alcoholism in 2001, Ben has since been in rehab multiple times To make matters worse, J-Lo then went on a very public promo campaign where she told the Press how much she loves to drink to 'relax and let loose' 'Knowing how he lost everything including the love of his family, knowing that he could possibly relapse, Jen decided to start her own spritzer line for more money, as if she did not have enough,' said a source 'This was one of the things that broke the camel's back,' said an insider: 'But Ben saved his sobriety' Last week, the Mail revealed how Jen and Ben have prepared their divorce paperwork and will file at the end of the summer 'This was one of the things that broke the camel's back. But Ben saved his sobriety.' Last week, the Mail revealed how Jen and Ben — who starred in Oscar-winning movies such as Good Will Hunting and Argo — have prepared their divorce paperwork and will file at the end of the summer. In May 2023, Ben moved out of their sprawling Beverly Hills mansion, which they bought shortly after they married in July, 2022. After a final attempt at reconciliation in recent weeks failed, the couple's divorce documents 'are finalized, but not yet turned in', multiple sources have claimed. One said: 'They are waiting for the right time to drop them. At that time, they will release a joint statement that will say how they have much love for each other and how they fought to make it work, but couldn't. 'Honestly, in the end, they could not come to a compromise. What they had before is gone and they have both accepted it.' It's a sorry end to what looked like being an inspiring tale of rekindled lost love. The pair got together in 2002, became engaged, but split in 2004 before they got married.

Jo-Lo went on to marry singer/songwriter Marc Anthony, with whom she had 16-year-old twins. Their marriage lasted ten years. In 2021, following J-Lo's doomed engagement to baseball player Alex Rodriguez, Ben and the singer got back together, delighting fans and fascinating the world's Press by equal measure. The following year they tied the knot in Las Vegas, then held a second lavish ceremony at Ben's $9 million (£7) plantation property in Georgia. However, the couple have not been seen together for weeks, with Ben staying away from J-Lo's Bridgerton-themed 55th birthday party last month. Instead, he bought a $20 (£16) million bachelor pad in Los Angeles after the couple put their $68 million (£53) million house in Beverly Hills up for sale. But as far back as last year there were issues. When J-Lo launched her drinks brand Delola in April 2023, to Ben this was a warning sign that she valued her career more than him.

While he made efforts to accommodate her need for publicity, their different attitudes to their careers shook the foundations of their marriage. A friend said: 'Ben was the one to pull the plug on their marriage here. Jennifer had him believe she was the same person that she was when they fell in love the first time, so he saw this as picking right back up. He doesn't like the celebrity red carpet thing, but he did it because she loved it. 'Her obsession with fame became too much for him. She needed to be photographed and adored. She would share so much of herself with the world that he felt there was nothing left sacred for him. She needed to do this. This had become a part of who she was — fame. 'It wasn't just a job, but a way of life for her and she could not give this act up in the end. She chose fame over him, just as she did with her previous three marriages.' Indeed, J-Lo appeared to be molding much of her new, lucrative commercial output around their revitalized romance. Some go so far as to say that he was fuming that her new album centered around him — and that he was entirely opposed to her TV documentary, This Is Me... Now: A Love Story. This documentary told the story of Jen's journey to love through her own eyes, and was relentlessly mocked, flopping among audiences and losing millions. A source close to the couple say Ben was furious. 'He didn't want her to do this at all. She asked him to invest in it and be involved in a project he was absolutely against. While he made efforts to accommodate her need for publicity, their different attitudes to their careers shook the foundations of their marriage 'He doesn't like the celebrity red carpet thing, but he did it because she loved it,' the insider said of Ben 'Her obsession with fame became too much for him,' an insider asserted 'It wasn't just a job, but a way of life for her and she could not give this act up in the end,' said the source: 'She chose fame over him, just as she did with her previous three marriages' Some go so far as to say that he was fuming that her new album centered around him — and that he was entirely opposed to her TV documentary, This Is Me...

It too destroyed their marriage. 'Ben didn't want it [their love story] to be told. Only she did. 'They lost £18 million and [it] ruined Ben's trust in her. Ben seeing her spread their love letters on a table for others to read [as she did onscreen] infuriated him. This is when he knew that she put fame above love.' But friends say that J-Lo apparently sold it to Amazon at a profit after having self-financed it for that amount. Indeed, during the documentary, J-Lo showed a book to the camera, saying: 'This book is a book Ben gave me on our first Christmas back together. It is every letter and every mail that we wrote each other from 20 years ago and today.' She highlighted one note that read: 'The Greatest Love Story Never Told by Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck 2001-2010... and counting…' But a friend of Ben's said: 'He asked her to not do the documentary because he wanted to keep this stuff private — and because it cost too much money — but she did it anyway. He asked her to pull back from doing red carpets and events so much and she wouldn't listen. She dragged him out anyway. It was never about him. It was always about her.' Certainly, back in May, the pair looked tense at the premiere of J-Lo's Netflix film The Mother. She later revealed they had clashed over her outfit choices, saying: 'He'll joke with me sometimes ... he'll say things like, 'Where's the rest of that shirt?'. 'Ben seeing her spread their love letters on a table for others to read [as she did onscreen] infuriated him,' the insider stated: 'This is when he knew that she put fame above love' A friend of Ben's said: 'He asked her to not do the documentary because he wanted to keep this stuff private — and because it cost too much money — but she did it anyway' 'I'm like, 'Oh, this one doesn't have anything else'.' Then, suddenly, J-Lo called off her upcoming summer tour, telling fans she was 'taking time off to be with her children, family and close friends.' Shortly afterwards, Ben was pictured with actress ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, taking their son Samuel, 12, to basketball practice in Santa Monica. The next day J-Lo arrived to also see Samuel play and shared an awkward-looking kiss with her husband. The Batman actor has been seen recently without his wedding ring, while his wife has kept hers on. Then there was their house — that £53 million whopper in Beverly Hills. Ben, it seems, simply thought it was too expensive. Friends say J-Lo thought this would make the family — her twins Emme and Max, 16, and Ben's kids Violet, 19, Fin, 15, and Samuel, 12 — happy. It didn't. 'Buying that massive house was another huge red flag,' said one close to Ben. 'He didn't want that house because it cost a ridiculous amount of money. It never felt like home to him and he cannot even believe that he moved into the home. 'She didn't want a marital home for them to grow old in. She wanted a massive structure that cost more than anyone else's home to flaunt her wealth and her marriage in. She thought that this would make everyone happy. They fought relentlessly about this.'

'She became less popular, less people wanted to see her perform and this made her irate and she took it out on Ben. She started to realize her star was fading and he told her it was her own fault because she was overexposed. 'She took the fact that her documentary and album was a flop out on Ben because, as her husband, he was the closest one to her. He asked her to take a step back and she didn't. He wasn't a huge fan of her new album being so centered around him and she thought it was beautiful.' Sources say that their five children are keen to stay in touch, despite the fraught emotions that surrounded the very public demise of their parents' romance. A source said: 'It is hard on the kids, but in the end they are all pretty grown up. Enough grown up to be able to see that it was not working between their parents. The kids will be okay and will still be close. Becoming a family for a minute was fun and this will always be special in their hearts.' J-Lo, though, is now single at 55 with four marriages under her belt. Friends fear she sabotages her romances. 'She knows she destroyed it all and was super apologetic, but it was too late,' one said. 'He tried for a couple weeks, giving her the benefit of the doubt, and even wore the ring because she asked him to so that they could get a little space from the hounding Press, but he's done. 'He found his own home and she is not living in it. It is in his name. She knows this and now it is time for them both to move on.' 'She started to realize her star was fading and he told her it was her own fault because she was overexposed,' said a source Sources say that their five children are keen to stay in touch, despite the fraught emotions that surrounded the very public demise of their parents' romance Ben, apparently, is giving his estranged wife 'time to rebrand' Ben, apparently, is giving his estranged wife 'time to rebrand'. Friends of the singer say she has changed the way she dresses and the way she presents herself. 'She is smiling in public, and she is not acting all like a diva. Her social media is bright and happy, and she is speaking about her true feelings of being fragile. 'She is staying out of the spotlight and keeping her life private. Basically, Jennifer is now pretending to be the person that Ben thought she was all along. This made him fall in love with her, but he is not going to fall a third time. Two strikes she's out. They are done.'

The event, which drew a packed house, highlighted Trump's strategy and messaging as he faces a tightening race against Vice President Kamala Harris in this crucial battleground state.Trump's appearance came just days after Harris' own rally at the same venue this week, which attracted an estimated 10,000 supporters, including a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion.The former president had no musical guests but invited other Republican politicians and community leaders onto the podium throughout his speech.Here are the main takeaways from Saturday's rally in Atlanta:Relitigating the 2020 Election and Attacks on Local LeadershipTrump continued to falsely claim victory in Georgia, stating he won the state twice. He attacked Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who had refused to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump suggested, without evidence, that they were working against him in the 2024 election.The former president earlier in the day took to Truth Social to blast Kemp being disloyal to the Republican party while ripping apart his crime record in the state.The Georgia governor responded on X, formerly Twitter, asking Trump to leave his family alone: \"My focus is on winning this November and saving our country from Kamala Harris and the Democrats - not engaging in petty personal insults, attacking fellow Republicans, or dwelling on the past.\"He ended the post with, \"You should do the same, Mr. President, and leave my family out of it.\"Newsweek contacted Kemp and Trump's office via email on Saturday for comment.Focus on Legal ChallengesThe former president discussed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and the Georgia election interference case against him, making mocking and provocative comments about Willis's relationship with former lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.In June, lawyers for Trump filed an opening brief in the Georgia Court of Appeals seeking to remove Willis from the former president's election subversion case in Georgia.In a statement, Trump's lead defense counsel Steve Sadow argued that Willis' improper relationship with former Fulton County prosecutor Wade is grounds to have the district attorney disqualified from the case.The former president and 18 other co-defendants face racketeering charges accusing them of attempting to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden in the state of Georgia.Relations with RussiaThe former president commented on a recent prisoner swap involving Russia. Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin, asserting that the deal was favorable for the leader while criticizing the terms for the United States.The historic prisoner swap with the Biden administration this week that resulted in the release of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and security contractor Paul Whelan. \"I'd like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal,\" Trump said of the Russian president.He concluded: \"Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals.\"Outreach to Black votersPrior to the rally, Trump reportedly met backstage with Black business leaders, signaling an effort to expand his support among African American voters. During the rally, Trump invited Black political consultant and Conserve the Culture founder Michaelah Montgomery on stage with him twice, further emphasizing his attempt to appeal to Black voters.Montgomery praised Trump for \"saving\" her beloved Clark Atlanta University, a prominent Historically Black College and University (HBCU), located in Georgia. In 2019, Trump signed a bipartisan bill intended to provide more than $250 million a year to historic Black colleges, reported the Associated Press.However, previously speaking to The Washington Post, Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and authority on HBCUs, said Trump's involvement was likely to have been limited.\"Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it,\" Gasman said.As the election approaches, both campaigns are intensifying their efforts to mobilize supporters and win over undecided voters in Georgia. The state's 16 electoral votes could prove crucial in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, making every campaign stop and policy position in Georgia potentially significant in this hotly contested race.","summary":"The former president said he didn't need any musical guests at his Atlanta rally.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-georgia-atlanta-rally-key-takeaways-1934261","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442421/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:48:58","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":253325090,"title":"Josh Shapiro, a Potential Vice Presidential Pick, Defends Israel Amid Controversy Over Decades-Old College Essay","text":"Pennsylvania’s Governor, Josh Shapiro, found himself in a position where he needed to justify his views on Israel. This challenge arose after an opinion piece he wrote over thirty years ago resurfaced. In the op-ed, he discussed his experience as a volunteer in the Israeli army and made negative comments about the Palestinian population. “Since he wrote this piece as a 20-year-old student, Gov. Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania,” Shapiro’s spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital in a statement. “The Governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years – and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today,” Bonder continued. The Philadelphia Inquirer uncovered the essay that Shapiro wrote for the Campus Times, the student newspaper of the University of Rochester, from which Shapiro graduated in 1995. In the article, Shapiro stressed his view that “Palestinians will not peacefully coexist,” because “they do not have the capabilities to establish their own homelands and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States.” “They are too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own,” Shapiro wrote, identifying himself as a “past volunteer in the Israeli army.” He referred to the Arab world as divided and “belligerent.” The comments have resurfaced as part of a thorough review of Shapiro as he edges closer to a potential vice-presidential nod for the Democrat ticket topped by current Vice President Kamala Harris after she secured the nomination this week. Shapiro’s support for Israel has been controversial inside the Democratic Party due to the strong pro-Palestinian views of the party’s far-left flank. Those who oppose his candidacy launched the “No Genocide Josh” campaign and continue to pressure Harris to pick another running mate. Some Jewish members of Congress have said that criticism of Shapiro is unfair and assumes that Jewish politicians cannot be objective on Israel. “I think there is that sense that somehow we’re not objective [on Israel] because we’re Jewish, which is just not true or fair,” Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, told Axios. “There are a lot of members who are pro-Israel who have been protested against — I think as Jews it feels particularly intense and personal.” Bonder pushed back on the idea that the newspaper op-ed, written decades ago, provides any indication of the governor’s current thinking regarding Israel. “As the Governor has made clear for years, he supports a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live together peacefully – and he believes it is critical for leaders on both sides of this conflict to take meaningful, necessary steps towards a lasting peace,” Bonder stressed. “Governor Shapiro has worked hard to bring people together, listen, and keep our communities safe and heard – and he will always be a Governor for all Pennsylvanians,” Bonder added. Addressing the self-identification as a “past volunteer in the Israeli army,” Bonder said, “While he was in high school, Josh Shapiro was required to do a service project, which he and several classmates completed through a program that took them to a kibbutz in Israel where he worked on a farm and at a fishery.” “The program also included volunteering on service projects on an Israeli army base. At no time was he engaged in any military activities,” Bonder said. When asked about the article during a Friday press conference, the 51-year-old Shapiro stressed his age and the time that has passed since publishing the article. He reiterated his belief that the only way forward for the region is a two-state solution that allows both Israelis and Palestinians “to determine their own futures and their own destinies,” the Times of Israel reported. Shapiro also had earlier this year called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “one of the worst leaders of all time” and blasted him for steering Israel “in a wrong direction,” according to the Times.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPennsylvania&#8217;s Governor, Josh Shapiro, found himself in a position where he needed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Josh Shapiro, a Potential Vice Presidential Pick, Defends Israel Amid Controversy Over Decades-Old College Essay first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/josh-shapiro-a-potential-vice-presidential-pick-defends-israel-amid-controversy-over-decades-old-college-essay/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Potential-Harris-VP-pick-Josh-Shapiro-on-defense-over-Israel.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:48:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":253324962,"title":"Potential Harris VP pick Josh Shapiro on defense over Israel after decades-old college essay surfaces","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has had to defend his stance on Israel after an op-ed he penned more than three decades ago, in which he wrote of being an Israeli army volunteer and disparaged the Palestinian people, resurfaced. “Since he wrote this piece as a 20-year-old student, Gov. Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania,” Shapiro’s spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital in a statement. “The Governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years – and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today,” Bonder continued. The Philadelphia Inquirer uncovered the essay that Shapiro wrote for the Campus Times, the student newspaper of the University of Rochester, from which Shapiro graduated in 1995.

The former president, 78, declared that “Laken’s blood is on Kamala Harris’ hands,” during a rally at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta Saturday — where Harris, 59, ripped Trump during a campaign event days earlier. “Kamala Harris let in the savage monster who killed Laken Riley,” Trump railed. “Kamala is responsible for the death as though she were watching it herself,” he added. Riley, a nursing student at the University of Augusta, was jogging on the campus of the University of Georgia on Feb. 22 when she was attacked and killed. Her battered body was found in a wooded area near Lake Herrick. Officials determined she died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her killer, 26-year-old Venezuelan national Jose Ibarra, entered the US illegally in El Paso, Texas, in September 2022, but was released after about a day in custody. He has been linked to the Venezuelan gang El Tren de Aragua. Ibarra pleaded not guilty to 10 charges linked to her murder. “Kamala Harris should not be asking your vote, she should be begging Laken Riley’s family for forgiveness,” he said to cheers. During his 90-minute remarks, Trump also “congratulated” Russian President Vladimir Putin for making “another great deal” in the latest prisoner swap with the US that saw Wall Street Journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan and 14 others released from a Russian prison Thursday. “They released some of the greatest killers anywhere in the world,” Trump said of those President Biden, 81, and other Western leaders turned over to Russia to secure their release. “It’s nice to say we got them back but does that set a bad precedent,” he warned. Trump also chimed in on the controversy over Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who was previously disqualified from an international female boxing competition but was cleared by the IOC to compete in the Olympics, where she secured a medal on Saturday. Trump recalled the fight in which her Italian opponent, Angela Carini, quit just 46 seconds into the fight. He referred to Khelif, who was born a biological female, as “he.” “[Carini] got hit so hard she didn’t know what the hell hit her … he was a good male boxer. And she didn’t even go down. He hurt with two jabs and she said ‘I’m out,’” he said. Trump has repeatedly promised to keep men out of women’s sports, if elected.","summary":"\"Kamala is responsible for the death as though she were watching it herself.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/03/us-news/trump-blames-harris-for-laken-rileys-murder-allegedly-by-illegal-migrant/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-t94dxud4n-1722730264721.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722715931&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kZFRjMvM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:29:15","author":"Patrick Reilly","authors":["Patrick Reilly"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.534},{"id":253324682,"title":"Josh Shapiro picked Israel as the setting for the most significant moment in his early life instead of America, an older report reveals","text":"Last Updated on August 3, 2024 Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, who volunteered for the Israel Defense Forces, chose Israel as the site of his marriage proposal instead of the United States of America. Shapiro admitted to making the pro-Israel decision in his own life, according to a December 2013 article on Phillyburbs.com: “When Josh Shapiro was deciding on the location of the biggest moment in his young life, he chose Israel.“Important life events, like the night I proposed to my high school sweetheart, happened in Israel,” the Democratic chairman of the Montgomery County Commissioners told the large gathering at the “Standing United With Israel” celebration at Temple Sinai in Upper Dublin on Tuesday night.That memorable moment is among many why Israel stays close to his heart.During his remarks, Shapiro also illustrated why Israel should be close to the hearts of all Americans, citing the strong similarities between the Declaration of Independence and the Israeli declaration.” Shapiro’s spokesman tried to explain away the traitorous move, stating, “While he was in high school, Josh Shapiro was required to do a service project, which he and several classmates completed through a program that took them to a kibbutz in Israel where he worked on a farm and at a fishery.

He has had to step aside at the height of his re-election campaign, but immediately endorsed his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, to head the Demo-cratic ticket. He thereby averted any party chaos from his premature departure, giving his country and the world a chance to avoid disaster. Thank you, Joe. It led to a flood of support for Kamala Harris. In the first week of her campaign alone, she raised “a record-shattering haul” of US$200 million, with 66% coming from first-time donors, indicating “tremendous grassroots support”. Over 100,000 new campaign volunteers signed up in the first four days. Leading party figures Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jefferies, state governors and congressmen/women endorsed the new candidate along with the critical black and Hispanic caucuses. Identity groups have expressed support: the Black Women, White Women, South Asian Americans, Black Men for Harris and White Dudes for Harris. She leads nationally among blacks, Asians, Latinos, women, independents and younger voters including Generation Z. National Interest editor Jacob Heilbrunn, speaking in the Financial Times, thinks she can win big. She hit the campaign trail with confidence, wisely focusing first on the six swing states—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia—where polls show the race tightening as Harris gains ground. In just one week, “Harris and Trump are now neck and neck nationally,” says the Financial Times. At a massive rally in Atlanta, she challenged Trump to the September debate, telling him stop throwing insults from afar. “Say it to my face,” she declared, and the crowd roared. There is great enthusiasm among Democrats. Crowds are dancing, celebrities are turning up, all auguring well for turnout, paramount in this election. Kamala now has enough delegates to -secure the party’s nomination tomorrow. “I couldn’t be prouder,” says Joe Biden. The world is watching, the majority hoping fervently for a Harris victory. They see the threat from Donald Trump and know Harris will fundamentally follow the global path pursued by Biden, strengthening world democracy in its battle against autocracy, a critical challenge facing humanity. It is a danger that would be potentiated irretrievably with Donald Trump leading the most powerful nation on earth, threatening human rights and freedoms in America and the world. He recently exhorted evangelicals to go out and vote, promising that if he wins America will be “fixed” and they “would never have to vote again”. This man wants to eradicate elections in the United States! At the international level, he berated European leaders while coddling dictators Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un and threatening to withdraw America from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Biden quickly repaired the transatlantic relationship, critical for countering the threat from the world’s major autocracies, China and Russia supported by North Korea and Iran. He also ensured NATO grew stronger. Finland and Sweden joined, adding their potent militaries, making it a 32-nation military organisation, critical for the defence of its members. The Asia Pacific also received significant attention. Biden revitalised the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with the US, Japan, Australia and India for a free and open Indo Pacific; created AUKUS with the US, UK and Australia to help Canberra acquire nuclear-powered submarines to counter Beijing; and established a three-way defence pact involving the US with its two East Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. His bilateral pacts rein-force the multilateral arrange-ments. The US now has access to multiple airfields and naval bases in the Philippines, reducing the necessity for aircraft carriers that could be targeted by China’s long-range missiles and submarines. Also, to strengthen the US/Japan Mutual Defence Treaty, Washington is sending the most advanced Tomahawk cruise missiles to Japan and has established a Marine Corps regiment on Okinawa capable of fighting from small islands and destroying ships at sea. The Australian government hosts US Marines in the north of the country, and Washington also has a new security agreement with -Papua New Guinea. Biden also developed a major defence partnership with India, a world military power, as they face a common challenge—China. He has also been actively supporting Taiwan in strengthening its military capabilities against a Chinese invasion. Through “Integrated Deterrence” and “force multiplication” among US allies, Biden produced an amazing network of bi-lateral and multi-lateral alliances for the protection of global democracy. “Alliances make a difference,” he has said. In the Middle East he was about to achieve a historic rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world, particularly Saudi Arabia. This was deliberately derailed by Iran with its sponsored Hamas attack on Israel, knowing it would precipitate the present war in Gaza and push back Biden’s new paradigm for the Middle East where all-out war now looms. This President has had phenomenal achievement in foreign relations. If Donald Trump wins in November, the Biden architecture for the protection of global democracy would be destroyed. The world is depending on a Kamala Harris victory to avert that tragedy. —Ralph Maraj","summary":"History will record Joe Biden as one of the best presidents of the United States, with outstanding achievements, particularly in the economy and international affairs.

The announcement drew a sharp reaction from Harris, who criticized Trump for what she saw as an attempt to avoid a fair confrontation.Trump announced his social media platform, Truth Social, saying that the debate would feature a \"full arena audience\" and take place in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.Trump's proposal echoes the format of the first debate he had with President Joe Biden, who has since exited the reelection race. The second debate was originally planned for September 10 on ABC News, but Trump suggested moving it to Fox News, a network favored by his supporters. Harris, who officially secured the Democratic nomination on Friday, responded by reaffirming her commitment to the original debate date.The change, which Trump announced, raised objections from the Harris campaign and appeared to throw a potential showdown between the rivals into question. 112256753A campaign official for Harris on Saturday accused Trump of scheming up the Fox News debate to distract from reneging on his commitment to the ABC debate. Trump had agreed to that debate in May, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” Michael Tyler, communications director for the Harris campaign, said. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”Tyler said that the Harris campaign was open to discussing further debates if Trump honored his commitment to the ABC debate.A spokesperson for ABC News would not say whether the network would go ahead with its debate and give time only to Harris, reported NYT.Harris took a direct jab at Trump, questioning his sudden change of plans. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” Harris remarked. She reaffirmed her commitment to the scheduled debate, adding, “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.”— KamalaHarris (@KamalaHarris) According to Trump’s post on his social media site, the Fox News debate would take place on Sept 4 at a to-be-determined location in Pennsylvania. The network’s anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would moderate.Trump said on social media that the Fox News debate would have a live audience; the previous debate between him and Biden was hosted by CNN in an empty venue. Although both campaigns agreed to the format of the first debate, Trump had bemoaned the lack of a crowd.Besides, at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday night, Trump continued to take jabs at Harris, this time targeting her racial identity. He falsely suggested that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage, an accusation he made earlier to the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, identifies as both Black and Asian.During the rally, Trump mocked the pronunciation of Harris’ first name and called her a \"lunatic,\" further escalating the personal attacks that have characterized his campaign rhetoric.Trump also claimed that the ABC debate was \"terminated\" due to Biden’s withdrawal and his own ongoing litigation with the network. However, ABC had recently outlined qualification requirements for the debate without mentioning any specific candidates. These requirements, including polling support and state ballot access by September 3, reflect the tight race between Harris and Trump, who had maintained a lead over Biden after the first debate.ABC News and Fox News have both declined to comment on the status of the debate. Trump's proposal for the Fox debate came just after the Democratic National Committee launched an ad campaign accusing him of being \"afraid to debate\" and questioning his stance on abortion.David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, took to social media to criticize Trump’s move. “Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,\" Plouffe wrote, highlighting the age difference between Trump, 78, and Harris, 59.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-withdraws-from-abc-news-debate-proposes-fox-news-faceoff-with-harris-vp-taunts-safe-space-politics/articleshow/112256749.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112256758/112256758.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:20:57","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.004},{"id":253324556,"title":"Bernie Sanders and labor leaders set their sights on Gov.

The FCDO added that Border Force, consular officials and military personnel had been deployed to support embassy staff there. Foreign secretary David Lammy warned “tensions are high and the situation could deteriorate rapidly”. The US embassy in Beirut, meanwhile, urged its nationals to “book any ticket available” out of Lebanon noting that several flights had already been cancelled and that military evacuations were rare.

It comes amid concerns of full blown regional war, after Iran vowed vengeance following the assassinations of Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday and Fuad Shukr, senior commander in Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel - that has been blamed for both killings - has vowed to eliminate leaders of Palestinian militant group Hamas over its 7 October attack on Israel that sparked Israel’s heaviest ever bombardment of Gaza and a siege. Hamas, which rules the besieged enclave, killed over 1000 people and took more than 250 hostages in the 7 October massacre. Since then the Palestinian health ministry says Israel’s ferocious bombing of Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, the majority women and children and the siege has sparked famine. US president Joe Biden has said he is “very concerned” that the violence in the Middle East could escalate, adding that the killing of a top Hamas leader, who was also a negotiator in ongoing talks, has “not helped” efforts to negotiate a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Mr Biden told reporters he had a “very direct” conversation with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. “We have the basis for a cease-fire. He should move on it and they should move on it now,” he added, echoing calls for a truce from his Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. Israeli media reported that the Thursday call which Vice President Kamala Harris also joined, had gone so badly President Biden allegedly told Mr Netanyahu to “stop bullshitting me” over his claims of progress in a hostage ceasefire deal with Gaza. This exchange, first reported by Israel’s Channel 12 on Saturday night, was allegedly followed by the American leader telling Mr Netanyahu “don’t take the president for granted.” The US is Israel’s biggest supplier of weapons. The Independent reached out to the Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office for comment but has yet to receive a reply. Mr Netanyahu has said Israel was determined to win nothing less than “total victory” against Hamas, and that he was working for a cease-fire he hoped to have soon. On Saturday, an Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief arrived in Cairo, according to Egyptian officials. However Mr Netanyahu has been accused of putting his personal interests first and deliberately prolonging the war, with Israeli media publishing alleged leaks of a recent heated meeting between the premier and his security and defence chiefs. In the meeting Channel 12 - citing sources familiar with the incident - said the premier allegedly shouted at his team, who accused him of introducing conditions in the truce hostage deal that he knew Hamas would not accept. The Independent also reached out to the PMO’s office for comment but has yet to receive a reply.Meanwhile airlines, including US carriers United and Delta as well as Germany’s Lufthansa group have scrambled to re-route away from the Middle East airspace and have also cancelled some flights, amid surging concerns of regional instability. Israeli media reported on Saturday that some internal flights within Israel had been cancelled. On Saturday Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps reiterated its pledge to retailate. In a statement carried by Iranian state TV it accused the US of supporting Israel’s alleged attack on Haniyeh in the Iranian capital. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the inauguration of newly elected Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.Israel continued its ferocious bombardment of Gaza, with an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killing at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday. It came hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said. The Israeli military said the first of two West Bank airstrikes hit a vehicle in a town near the city of Tulkarm, targeting a militant cell it said was on its way to carry out an attack.","summary":"The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Saturday night Britons should leave the country","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/uk-us-plea-citizens-conflict-violence-b2590831.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/04/00/SEI215475997.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8mdKiSD1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:59:43","author":"Bel Trew","authors":["Bel Trew"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":253324068,"title":"Trump says he’ll skip an ABC debate with Harris in September and wants them to face off on Fox News","text":"By Meg Kinnard | Associated Press CHAPIN, S.C. — Donald Trump says he is pulling out of a scheduled September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC and wants them to face off on Fox News, making it increasingly unlikely that the candidates will confront each other on stage before the November election. In a series of Truth Social posts late Friday, the Republican nominee and former president said his agreement to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC “has been terminated” because he will no longer face Democratic President Joe Biden, who ended his campaign last month after a disastrous performance in their first debate. Trump now says he will appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania with rules that he called “similar” to his debate with Biden, but with a full audience instead of a mostly empty studio. Trump said that if Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, does not agree to the new network and date, he will do a “major Town Hall” with Fox News. Michael Tyler, a Harris spokesperson, said Trump “is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.” It was not immediately clear whether ABC would turn its Sept. 10 event into a Harris town hall in Trump’s absence. Tyler said Harris is committed to the time slot and would appear “one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.” In a subsequent Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, Trump said of Harris, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” Trump has gone back and forth on debating with Harris since she entered the presidential race. He had told reporters he felt an obligation to debate but also said in a recent Fox News interview that he thought Americans “already know everything” about both candidates Harris has pressed Trump to keep the commitment he made when Biden was in the race. Noting Trump’s criticisms of her, Harris dared him recently to “say it to my face.” In his Truth Social posts, Trump also cited his litigation against ABC News as “a conflict of interest” in his participation in the network’s debate. Trump sued the network in March following an assertion by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped. But Trump agreed, two months after filing his lawsuit, to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC, as well as the June 27 debate on CNN that helped knock Biden out of the race. David Muir and Linsey Davis, not Stephanopoulos, are set to be ABC’s debate moderators. Trump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates.

Nancy Pelosi addressed reports that she worked to orchestrate President Joe Biden stepping aside as the Democratic Party’s candidate in a new interview for “CBS Sunday Morning.” When asked what she’d told Biden to persuade him to step aside, the House Speaker Emerita told CBS’s Lesley Stahl, “Well, I’ve never shared any conversations with a president of the United States publicly, no.” Pelosi was then asked about reports that Biden is “furious” with her, to which she responded, “Well, he knows that I love him very much.” Watch the excerpt previewing Sunday’s interview with Pelosi here: Stahl noted that Pelosi clearly didn’t want to “own” this action, but pointed to the extensive reporting around the campaign that led to Biden choosing to step aside. “No, I wasn’t the leader of any pressure in this party,” Pelosi responded. “Let me say things that I didn’t do: I didn’t call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, ‘I never called anybody.’” Pelosi appeared on “CBS Sunday Morning” in connection with the promotion of her book, titled appropriately enough, “The Art of Power: My Story as America’s First Woman Speaker of the House.” It’s set for release on Tuesday. She has served 19 terms as a Democrat from the San Francisco Bay area and details her influence as a member of Congress and longtime speaker of the House in the new book. Their interview also covers the violent attack on her husband Paul Pelosi at their home that nearly killed him — the speaker emerita herself was the intended target — as well as the Jan. 6 Capitol Insurrection, her advice for Kamala Harris in her race against Donald Trump and her thoughts on the choice of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate. In an excerpt from Pelosi’s book shared with CBS, Pelosi argues that being speaker “is probably the most challenging position in government.” Contrasting it with being president, she writes, “You have to address the same vast array of issues as the president (but lack the advantage of making appointments across the executive branch and proposing judicial nominees).” She lays out in the excerpt that members of Congress are normally given time through hearings, town halls and other methods to “act deductively” as they make their decisions, but that “the speakership is different. It is both a uniquely powerful and an executive position that requires a combination of a policy background, strategic knowhow, and, above all, intuition.” In the speaker role, Pelosi writes, you can’t ever be surprised and must know all the possibilities at all times. “The minute you hesitate, your options are diminished,” she states. “The longer you wait, the more your options are diminished. Everyone with an agenda will chip away at your delayed decision.” She emphasized the importance of constant communication with the members of her caucus, both for your own information and to give them “confidence in your knowledge and judgment.” Pelosi closes the excerpt by emphasizing the importance in her work of “respect.” You can read the full excerpt from Pelosi’s new book here and see the full interview on this week’s “CBS Sunday Morning.”","summary":"The House speaker emerita faces questions about what she told the president and reports that he is \"furious\" with her\n\n\nThe post Nancy Pelosi Says She Didn&#8217;t Make Any Calls to Get President Biden to Leave Democratic Ticket in Carefully Worded Answers | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/nancy-pelosi-biden-interview-art-of-power/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CleanShot-2024-08-03-at-16.44.29@2x.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:47:05","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.353},{"id":253323914,"title":"Race 2024: Vance’s ‘Childless Cat Ladies’-The Economic Realities","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Childless cat ladies Reddit In an election race that is starting to feel like a fever dream for many Americans, this week delivered contentious attack, against the experiences of childless Americans and their deserved 'stake' in the nation's future. In a resurfaced 2021 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, then-Senate-candidate J.D Vance launched a tirade against democrats and their choices (or not) in family life, suggesting that as single people, they do not have a \"direct stake\" in the country, describing them as, \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" Attack on a growing electorate His remarks earned a rare rebuke from America's sweetheart actress Jennifer Aniston, whose childless life has been a media obsession throughout her blazing career. The 55-year-old called out Vance's highly insensitive stance towards the many women who, like herself, didn't have the opportunity to choose their outcomes, humanizing the pain of infertility and a glaring lack of empathy, compassion, and rational judgment from a man who sees himself as a born leader. Aniston is not alone. His words have come under fire from women across the broad spectrum of society, considered not just insensitive but poor politics. Most notably it is also in sharp contrast with a recent campaign tagline of Donald Trumps at the Republican National Convention' declaring himself a 'President for ALL Americans.' Just not the childless ones, aka 38% of the population. Childless Americans are a growing electorate with national fertility rates reaching a historic low in 2023 (the lowest level since the U.S. began tracking birth rate data in 1979). National health statistics data shows that now twenty percent of American women are childless at the age of 44, with the share of U.S. adults under 50 who say they are unlikely to have kids rising from 37% in 2018 to 47% in 2023.

JD Vance , Megyn Kelly, Jennifer Aniston - cat lady controversy X Via Outlook Where is the tally on past President's biological children? It is no coincidence these comments have come at a particularly jarring political moment, where American voters are less than four months away from deciding their next President, and all eyes are on Vice President and democratic nominee Kamala Harris, who Vance gave a specific mention in his remarks. Harris is not believed to have a cat; instead, she has two stepchildren who refer to her as 'Mamala.' She is most certainly a parent, just not the version Vance views as relevant. Instead he views the modern family as a manifestation of a godless America, where secularity threatens tradition and the choices of a significant segment of the electorate, particularly LGBTQ+ and women, are portrayed as \"anti-family and anti-child.\" A pointed reminder that this election is not being fought on facts, but instead, it is a cultural war on gender and free choice.

(Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images This glaring undertone of misogyny against Harris is evident by the fact that we have never before tallied the children of presidential candidates as a form of political meritocracy. George Washington, viewed as the nation's founding father, was also a stepparent. President James Madison, coined \"Father of the Constitution,\" had no children, and John Tyler, ranked among the worst U.S. presidents of all time, was a father of fifteen. Seven childless men have held the Oval Office, which has long been a mere trivial fact, irrelevant to political stature. That is until now when a woman with progressive views and a modern family took office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In defense of Vance, Donald Trump described him as a man who 'loves family,' somehow attempting to put a wholesome, innocent spin on the whole debacle. Yet, if these past eight years have taught us anything, its that a more wholesome America is not the goal here. Yet if, instead, we strip away the cultural baggage and look at this from the lens of what matters most to Republicans, the pursuit and protection of wealth, Vance's moral outrage also falls short on economics. He has run a political rise on the quest of rebuilding the economic foundation for those society has left behind. Yet ironically, for women who are deliberately childless their math makes a lot of sense. The economics of 'SINKs' IFS Survey May to June 2021 institute for family studies These are women who seem to confuse and infuriate men like Vance the most . They are not following tradition but living their lives according to their own ideals. They come from various backgrounds and experiences, and unlike the stereotype of 'childless cat ladies,' research has shown they are often happier than the average mom. They are educated professionals who prioritize careers, travel, and personal development, and dare they say, simply do not want children. There is financial merit to this choice in life path which The Skimm labeled as SINKs, aka \"Single income, no kids\" women, who are building more wealth as a result. They point to a study that shows single, childfree women had an average of $65,000 in wealth in 2019, compared with $57,000 for single, childfree men. The figure for single mothers was only $7,000 (aka motherhood penalty), and America has the highest rate of children living in single-parent households worldwide, leading to a significant wealth gap, compounded by a lack of access to childcare. A solution Vance has called a \"class war against normal people.\" J.D. Vance on universal childcare via X J.D Vance X Instead, he remains staunch in his nostalgia for the world of the 1950s, where Americans lived a form of traditional bliss via the nuclear family, aka one parent works, and the other raises the children at home (spoiler alert- that's mom's job). A romantic notion for a structure that would be almost impossible to replicate these days without government intervention. Which is a glaring anathema to Vance and republicans. This delusionary fixation on what Atlantic writer David Brooks calls a 'freakish historical moment' (1950-1965) when the nuclear family was the cornerstone of American life is a far cry from the world of 2024. Americans in the 1950's were united by a sentiment that coincided with a postwar patriotism, the cultural relegation of women to the home, high unionization, and above all, made possible by economics. In 1961, the median American man aged 25 to 29 earned nearly 400 percent more than his father had earned at about the same age. Fast forward to 2024 and Americans are more divided than ever. Patriarchy, Power, and Pay: The Transformation of American Families, 1800–2015 Report Ruggles Vis Springer Fast forward to 2024, and the current economic climate is a significantly more depressing picture. These days people are faced with the realities of skyrocketing house prices and stagnant wages. Gen Z dollars have 86% less purchasing power than baby boomers in their twenties. There is a stark disparity between family values and economic realities, underscoring the urgent need for a new approach that addresses wealth and gender inequality. The 'childless cat lady' trope is not just offensive but a way to deflect from economic realities grounded in systemic inequality. Vance can politicize nostalgia all he wants, but it is only with the right policies that support working families, affordable childcare, and financial security, we can empower women to make decisions that align with their aspirations and circumstances. This is a hopeful vision for the future, one that is far from the pantomime of the culture wars.

It may be another story when it comes to a running mate. As Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have emerged as among the possible finalists, both have faced criticism from some organizations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes, potentially undermining the party’s newfound unity barely two weeks after Harris entered the race. The vice president’s team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected Monday. The next day, she and her running mate will appear together at a rally in Philadelphia, then visit six more swing states. In addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Walz changed his weekend travel plans, but his office didn’t answer a question Saturday about whether it was for an interview with Harris. “The governor’s schedule has changed, and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend,” Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann said. Some congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse attacks by the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who argues that Biden administration’s immigration policies are too relaxed. Shapiro has high-profile supporters, too, including Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate — appearing to suggest that the mayor had inside knowledge about Harris’ decision. But a person with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking said the video was simply a case of Parker showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker’s friend, would be the vice presidential pick. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Both Kelly and Shapiro have also seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris’ closes in on a decision. While that may not ultimately sway Harris, it is an indication that the honeymoon period for the vice president, where the distinct wings of the Democratic Party coalesced behind her, may be ending in the less than two weeks since President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her. Some labor groups have criticized Kelly, saying he opposes proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. The senator’s office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it on the floor. Still, Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly as a potential running mate. Fain also said the union does not favor Shapiro, who has previously proved willing to join with Republicans in calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Fain did single out Beshear, Walz and Pritzker for praise. “She’s probably got a thousand people telling her the same thing, you know, of what they think,” Fain said in an interview. “And so she’s got to make the decision based off of what she feels is, you know, is best for her.” The nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been publicly vocal, saying in a statement that Shapiro “is not the right candidate for the job, and selecting him would be a step in the wrong direction.” Shapiro, who says he plans to be at Harris’ rally Tuesday in Philadelphia, has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. Shapiro called out universities for not acting quickly to tackle antisemitism and he became a prominent critic of the University of Pennsylvania’s president, Liz Magill. She resigned after testifying at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy. Shapiro has also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power. The governor has been criticized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations for not condemning Israel for the killing of civilians in Gaza or for not calling for Israel to stop the fighting in the territory. Shapiro has countered that he has met with Muslim Americans and understands their pain. The progressive activist organization RootsAction.org opposes Shapiro’s views on Israel, school vouchers and the environment, among other issues. It says that in considering Shapiro, Harris “has set off alarm bells among young people, racial justice organizers, Arab Americans, Muslims and others whose votes and campaign activism were crucial to defeating Trump four years ago.” Meanwhile, The Philadelphia Inquirer resurfaced an opinion article Shapiro wrote in 1993 as a 20-year-old college student at the University of Rochester where he said peace “will never come” to the Middle East and that Palestinians were “too battle-minded” to coexist with Israel. Asked about it, Shapiro responded, “I was 20” adding that he long has supported a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. “It is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,” he said. Also opposing Shapiro are some environmental leaders and residents of the rural town of Dimock, Pennsylvania.

As he was leaving a local grocery store in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden fielded one question from a reporter across the street on his way to his limousine. “I hope so,” Biden said when asked if he thinks Iran will stand down. “I don’t know.” Earlier in the week, Israel conducted airstrikes in Beirut and Tehran, Iran, killing senior leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, respectively. Both groups are Iranian proxies, and on Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ordered a direct strike on Israel. While that has not come to fruition, the threat of retaliation remains. On Thursday, Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis,” according to a White House readout of the call. “The President discussed efforts to support Israel’s defense against threats, including against ballistic missiles and drones, to include new defensive U.S. military deployments,” according to the readout, which also noted Vice President Kamala Harris was on the call. “Together with this commitment to Israel’s defense, the President stressed the importance of ongoing efforts to de-escalate broader tensions in the region.” In a separate call, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Friday. “The Secretary reiterated ironclad U.S. support for Israel’s security and informed the Minister of additional measures, to include ongoing and future defensive force posture changes, that the Department will take to support the defense of Israel,” according to the readout of that call. “Secretary Austin highlighted that further escalation is not inevitable and that all countries in the region would benefit from a de-escalation in tensions, including through completing a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. However, he also stressed that the unprecedented scale of U.S. support for Israel since October 7 should leave Iran, Lebanese Hizballah, and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups with no doubt about U.S. resolve.”","summary":"President Joe Biden said Saturday that he hopes Iran will stand down after a chaotic week in the Middle East.

One topic that frequently resurfaces is her past relationship with former San Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown. The narrative often spun by opponents aims to cast doubt on her qualifications and accomplishments, but the truth is both straightforward and less scandalous than some might suggest. In the 1990s, while serving as the Speaker of the California State Assembly, Brown, who had been separated from his wife since 1982, began dating Harris, as reported by TIME. Their relationship was not a secret and took place after Brown’s separation. A while ago, Brown even opened out that part of their lives, “Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago…Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” He also supported Harris in her first race for San Francisco District Attorney, just as he has supported many other California politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom. Nevertheless, critics continue to question her rise in politics. A while ago, Fox News personality, Tomi Lahren, infamously suggested the same on social media. She penned, “Kamala did you fight for ideals or did you sleep your way to the top with Willie Brown.” However, she later apologized for the remark. Brown seems to have taken a lighthearted approach to these presidential inquiries about his past with Harris. Known for his wit, he humorously quipped that if Harris ever becomes president, \"She'll deport my ass.\" He later used a new variation. \"She may send me back to Mineola. Sending me back to Texas would be a deportment!\" Despite the recurring focus on her past relationships, Harris’ credentials and career achievements speak for themselves. Before becoming Vice President, Harris served as the Attorney General of California from 2011 to 2017 and as a U.S. Senator from 2017 to 2021. She has been married to Doug Emhoff since 2014, who has two children from a previous marriage. Harris, adorably known as \"Momala\" by her stepchildren, has often spoken about the significance of family in her life. She said, “Children need consistency. I didn’t want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn’t want to disappoint them. There’s nothing worse than disappointing a child… Cole and Ella could not have been more welcoming. They are brilliant, talented, and funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.” As per The Independent, public figures and supporters have defended Harris against personal attacks about her love life. Grammy-winning rapper, Cardi B, took to X to question, “What does Kamala Harris's husband or relationships have to do with her credentials? Do y’all hire people based on who they f***ing??”","summary":"As the scrutiny around Harris increases with the election nearing, Brown has taken a lighthearted approach to the inquiries about his past with her.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/the-truth-about-whether-kamala-harris-dated-former-sf-mayor-willie-brown-while-he-was-still-married","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708856/uploads/baeade40-5176-11ef-a1d4-0748df1c1873_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:30:12","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.223},{"id":253323160,"title":"Doug Emhoff, the Second Gentleman, recognizes that an affair played a role in the end of his first marriage.","text":"WILMINGTON, Del. – Second gentleman Doug Emhoff acknowledged Saturday that he had an extramarital affair years ago that contributed to the breakup of his first marriage. “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” Emhoff said in a statement, first reported by CNN. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.” He issued the statement after the Daily Mail reported on the matter.

Harris’ stepchildren, Ella and Cole Emhoff, were teenagers when their father remarried. Kerstin Emhoff has spoken positively of Harris as a “co-parent” of her daughters and as “loving, nurturing, fiercely protecting and always present.” She issued a statement supporting her ex-husband after he acknowledged the affair. “Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago,” she said. “He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.” ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. – Second gentleman Doug Emhoff acknowledged Saturday that he had&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Doug Emhoff, the Second Gentleman, recognizes that an affair played a role in the end of his first marriage. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/doug-emhoff-the-second-gentleman-recognizes-that-an-affair-played-a-role-in-the-end-of-his-first-marriage/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Second-gentleman-Doug-Emhoff-acknowledges-affair-contributed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:25:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.823},{"id":253323248,"title":"This Week in Texas: HPD changes, vouchers, and CenterPoint on the hot seat","text":"This Week in Texas, Mayor John Whitmire hired a new police chief.

During the trial, West—then an attorney at the San Francisco law firm Morrison & Foerster, which was known for defending enemy combatants detained by the United States—dismissed claims that Lindh was a terrorist. “He is not a terrorist,” West said of Lindh during a 2002 Washington Post interview. “He did not go to Afghanistan to kill Americans.” Lindh, who also goes by Sulayman al-Faris and Abu Sulayman al-Irlandi, was later sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has refused to renounce his Islamic extremist ideologies. In May 2019, Lindh wrote letters to reporters and authors praising Afghan Taliban jihad and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) which prompted recipients to label him unrepentant after his release into American communities, according to Breitbart News. He initially expressed remorse about jointing the Taliban but later said he was proud “to take part in the Afghan jihad,” the outlet said.

In reaction to his release in 2019, then President Donald Trump said, “I don’t like it at all,” Breitbart News reported. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) nominated Harris as the party’s presidential candidate. According to Breitbart News, the move ignored the 14 million Democrats who voted for President Joe Biden (D) in the primary. Breitbart News noted: The expeditious coronation underscored the speed at which Democrats moved to coronate Harris, who has received exactly zero presidential primary votes in her political career. Harris dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before the Iowa caucuses and did not enter the race in 2024 until Biden endorsed her.

Alleged details of the relationship were published by Britain’s Daily Mail. Rumors of the affair were first shared online by far-right commentator Laura Loomer earlier this week. “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” Emhoff said in a statement to CNN. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.” Emhoff and ex-wife Kerstin ended their 16-year marriage in 2009, with a divorce settlement filed in 2010. He did not address the specifics of the Daily Mail’s report, which stated that Emhoff had cheated on his first wife with their daughter Ella’s nanny. The story also alleges that Emhoff impregnated the woman, who also taught at their children’s private school in Culver City. Harris and Emhoff met in 2013 on a blind date while he worked as an entertainment lawyer and she was California’s attorney general. They married the following year. CNN reported that Joe Biden’s vetting committee was aware of the relationship and surrounding circumstances during Harris’ vetting process to become his running mate in 2020, citing an anonymous source familiar with the conversations. Emhoff also told Harris about the affair before they married. In a separate statement reported by CNN, Kerstin said, “Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.” Emhoff has regretted the circumstances around his affair for a long time and knew it was possible they would become public, a source familiar with Emhoff told CNN. Kerstin has spoken positively of Harris on multiple occasions, including defending her recently from attacks by Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance. Emhoff has been on the campaign trail in support of his wife’s candidacy. The campaign just released merchandise featuring a throwback photo of Emhoff earlier this week, which had gone viral after many online noted how attractive Emhoff appeared in the image. Posts that spread on social media Saturday, including a popular parody post retweeted more than 5,000 times with more than 420,000 views, pointed out the irony of his marriage being questioned by Donald Trump due to his own history of repeated affairs and being an adjudicated rapist. Citing a close friend with direct knowledge of both the affair and the pregnancy, the Daily Mail adds that their source said the woman did not keep the child. However, her social media does show a video of a baby in 2009, when her child would have been born. Another source confirmed the affair and that the woman did not keep the child. The woman did not deny the story when approached by the Daily Mail, according to the outlet. She declined to comment on the allegations but said, “I’m kind of freaked out right now.” Emhoff’s ex-wife Kerstin did not comment when reached by the Daily Mail. A mother whose children attended the school prior to 2009 told the Daily Mail that she was aware of the affair, expressing disgust with Emhoff but praise for the woman. Several other sources told the Mail that they would not comment further without the woman’s permission. Since the alleged affair, the woman went on to work for Broadway Video and later Amazon’s Audible.","summary":"Doug Emhoff says that he \"took responsibility\" and since the affair, has \"worked through things as a family\"\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris&#8217; Husband Acknowledges Affair During 1st Marriage appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/doug-emhoff-affair-nanny-pregnant-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2162696466.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:16:06","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.603},{"id":253323814,"title":"Emmerdale's Sammy Winward 'cuts off daughter Mia, 19, after she sets up an OnlyFans account to sell racy pics'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Aug 3rd 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 15°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Looters take advantage of riots to steal wine, phones and crocs as they ransack shops in Liverpool, Hull and Manchester while anarchy sweeps Britain, with police officers hospitalised by thugs and clashes between rival groups Man whose arms and face melted after he touched 11,000-volt live cable while 'trying to steal scrap metal' thanks the paramedics who helped save his life Kate WILL join William and their three children for summer getaway at Balmoral this month in what will be the Princess of Wales's longest journey since her cancer diagnosis PETER HITCHENS: It's time that responsible, conservative patriots stood up to Faragism.

Despite the former first lady sometimes skipping the chance to be by her husband Donald Trump’s side during his intense campaign for the 2024 presidency, she made it clear where she plans to be at the start of 2025 by stepping out in New York City Saturday carrying Louis Vuitton luggage decorated with a “FLOTUS” tag. She also had “FLOTUS” emblazoned on a clothing bag a worker carried for her as she exited her husband’s Trump Tower. She did not travel lightly, utilizing three luggage pieces from the luxury Italian brand: the Sirius 55 Monogram Canvas ($2,490), Keepall 55 Monogram Canvas ($2,210) and the Cruiser Bag 45 ($3,050). Melania, 54, also chose to tote around a nearly $4,000 Burberry Belt handbag during her Saturday outing. Styling her outfit to match it, she wore wide-legged green trousers and a plain white T-shirt. She accessorized with oversized aviator sunglasses and finished her simple yet sophisticated look with gold sandals. Her hair was left down and parted in the middle. Once her pricey bags were loaded into a Secret Service vehicle, she hit the road for New Jersey. Meanwhile, Donald, 78, traveled to Atlanta Saturday to campaign at the Georgia State University Convocation Center with his vice president pick, J.D. Vance. Kamala Harris, who secured enough delegates to become the official Democratic nominee on Friday, held a rally at the same location and spoke in front of 10,000 supporters. Melania has remained fairly quiet throughout the former president’s bid for president this year, though she did speak out following his assassination attempt in July. “When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron’s life, were on the brink of devastating change,” she said in a statement. “I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.” Days before, she raised $1.4 million at a Trump Tower fundraiser wearing a red Valentino dress with appliqué flowers and Christian Louboutin heels.","summary":"The former first lady headed into a Secret Service vehicle after exiting Trump Tower in NYC as her husband campaigned in Atlanta.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/03/style/melania-trump-steps-out-with-4k-burberry-bag-flotus-luggage/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/86903344.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZDvNCuqV-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:05:35","author":"Sara Whitman","authors":["Sara Whitman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.28},{"id":253323770,"title":"Julia Louis-Dreyfus is 'delighted' by 'Veep' resurgence after Harris bid, hopes it helps her campaign","text":"\"Veep\" star Julia Louis-Dreyfus said that she is \"delighted\" by the resurgence of the political satire show since Vice President Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and thinks that it could help her campaign. \"It's been a wild thing to witness. Viewership went up something insane, like 350 percent,\" Louis-Dreyfus told Entertainment Weekly. \"I'm delighted. I'm happy people are getting a kick out of it. And I know that Kamala Harris is — big time.\" \"Veep,\" which aired on HBO from 2012 to 2019, starred Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a comically inept fictional female vice president, Selina Meyer. In recent years, comparisons between the titular character and Harris went viral with detractors calling out the VP's so-called \"word salads.\" On the day after President Biden bowed out of the race, the television show gained a 353% increase in viewership for its first season on HBO Max, according to Luminate’s Streaming Viewership data. NEW YORK TIMES SPINS KAMALA HARRIS' PAST WORD SALADS AS ‘CELEBRATORY ARTIFACTS’ WITH CANDIDACY UNDERWAY After being asked if the show's viral popularity would help the Harris campaign, Louis-Dreyfus replied, \"I certainly hope so. Please vote, ladies and gentlemen, please vote.\" However, Veep series creator Armando Iannucci and executive producer David Mandel have rejected comparisons between Louis-Dreyfus' character and Harris. \"Selina Meyer is not Kamala Harris,\" Iannucci told The Hollywood Reporter. \"When we were making Veep, we didn’t have anyone in specific in mind…it really is not based on anyone.\" \"It’s nice that Veep has been watched again, but I wouldn’t want people to think that Kamala Harris is like Selina Meyer,\" he added. ‘VEEP’ PRODUCER ASSAILS ‘A-HOLES’ WHO COMPARE KAMALA HARRIS TO HAPLESS VP ON THE SHOW \"Veep\" executive producer David Mandel also told THR this week that while he's happy that Harris is reportedly a fan of the show, he hates it when \"a-holes\" use clips of \"Veep\" to \"diminish her.\" \"There are people really enjoying Selina’s moment of telling her staff that she’s running for president; there’s a joy there that’s fun and nice and celebratory,\" he added. \"And then there are a--holes who are using it differently. Surprise, surprise, Kamala is a woman of color, and it seems like those people are using it as a simple way of insulting her. So I don’t like that part.\" The Harris campaign has embraced the influx of pop culture memes celebrating her campaign on social media. Mandel said the HBO show is ready to help assist her campaign if asked. \"The Veep team is standing by and ready to do their part! I think there’s a generational thing going on. It’s so TikTok heavy.

(AP) — Donald Trump says he is pulling out of a scheduled September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC and wants them to face off on Fox News, making it increasingly unlikely that the candidates will confront each other on stage before the November election. In a series of Truth Social posts late Friday, the Republican nominee and former president said his agreement to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC “has been terminated” because he will no longer face Democratic President Joe Biden, who ended his campaign last month after a disastrous performance in their first debate. Trump now says he will appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania with rules that he called “similar” to his debate with Biden, but with a full audience instead of a mostly empty studio. Trump said that if Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, does not agree to the new network and date, he will do a “major Town Hall” with Fox News. Michael Tyler, a Harris spokesperson, said Trump “is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.” It was not immediately clear whether ABC would turn its Sept. 10 event into a Harris town hall in Trump’s absence. Tyler said Harris is committed to the time slot and would appear “one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.” In a subsequent Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, Trump said of Harris, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” Trump has gone back and forth on debating with Harris since she entered the presidential race. He had told reporters he felt an obligation to debate but also said in a recent Fox News interview that he thought Americans “already know everything” about both candidates Harris has pressed Trump to keep the commitment he made when Biden was in the race. Noting Trump’s criticisms of her, Harris dared him recently to “say it to my face.” In his Truth Social posts, Trump also cited his litigation against ABC News as “a conflict of interest” in his participation in the network’s debate. Trump sued the network in March following an assertion by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped. But Trump agreed, two months after filing his lawsuit, to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC, as well as the June 27 debate on CNN that helped knock Biden out of the race. David Muir and Linsey Davis, not Stephanopoulos, are set to be ABC’s debate moderators.

The audience continued with interjections and cheers throughout the 37-minute conversation with Trump and Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News, Harris Faulkner, anchor of \"The Faulkner Focus\" and co-host of \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News, and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor. Trump's sparring with the moderators, particularly Scott, elicited audience responses from cheers to outbursts of \"Jesus Christ\" to \"That's false.\" These 10 Trump quotes evoked the most reaction from audience members, which included convention attendees and members of the press. 'You don't even say hello' Scott launched the conversation with a lengthy first question \"addressing the elephant in the room,\" calling out a number of racist actions from Trump such as questioning the citizenship of his Republican presidential opponent Nikki Haley and former President Barack Obama to describing Black district attorneys as \"animals\" and \"rabid\" and dining with a white supremacist. \"Now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust after you have used language like that?\" Scott asked. Trump's immediate response led to an uproar of shrieks and laughs from the audience. \"Well first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner, first question. You don't even say, 'Hello. How are you?'\" Trump said. 'Fake news network' Trump proceeded to ask Scott, \"Are you with ABC? Because I think it's a fake news network, a terrible network,\" prompting even more shrieks from the audience. \"I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I've done so much for the Black population of this country,\" Trump continued, garnering a few claps amidst more cheers. \"Historically black colleges and universities were out of money, stone-cold broke, and I saved them, and I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it,\" Trump said, which led to some applause. 'False pretenses' Trump called the introduction \"very rude\" and that he expected his Democratic opponent to be in attendance, whether it was President Joe Biden, who has since dropped out of the race, or Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"I was invited here, and I was told my opponent, whether it was Biden or Kamala. I was told my opponent was going to be here. It turned out my opponent, isn’t here. You invited me on under false pretense,\" Trump said. Audience members shouted out the correct pronunciation of Harris' first name, which is kahm-uh-luh not kuh-mahl-uh, as Trump pronounced it. 'Best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln' As Scott tried to ask another question, Trump continued, \"I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,\" which led to a roar from the audience. One solo person shrieked when Trump called himself the best. \"Better than President Johnson who signed the Voting Rights Act?\" Scott, asked, which Trump ignored. 'Now she wants to be known as Black' Scott moved on to ask Trump if Republicans calling Harris a \"DEI hire\" was \"acceptable language,\" prompting Trump to push her for a definition of the term, which she pointed out stands for \"diversity, equity and inclusion.\" When pushed by Scott if Harris is \"only on the ticket because she is a Black woman,\" Trump said he has known Harris for a long time indirectly. \"She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" Trump said. \"I don’t know is she Indian or is she Black?\" Shock from the crowd was audible, yet Trump continued. \"You know, I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person,\" she said. 'Black jobs' Faulker took over and asked why Trump came to speak at the convention during such a divided time for the country. \"What is your message today?\" she asked. Trump said his message is to \"stop people from invading our country.\" \"A lot of the journalists in this room are Black,\" Trump said at the event for Black journalists, prompting laughter from the crowd. \"I will tell you that coming from the border are millions and millions of people that happen to be taking Black jobs,\" Trump said. \"What exactly is a Black job, sir?\" Scott followed up. \"A Black job is anybody that has a job that’s what it is. They’re taking the employment away from Black people. They’re coming in. They’re invading,\" Trump said. 'Friendly manner' Goba asked Trump questions about his vice presidential running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) who made comments about \"childless cat ladies\" running the country. \"He has a lot of opinions about childless women like myself or divorced people like yourself,\" Goba said, which elicited laughter. \"But at least it was said in a friendly manner,\" Trump said. Goba continued, \"My point is do you think the Republican Party is getting a little bit too judgy about people’s lives when you think about abortion or when you think about what J.D. Vance is saying? \"I think that the Democrat party is really the one that has the problem,\" Trump said. 'Mentally, he’s shot' Goba asked Trump if he'd consider stepping down if his health was declining. \"If you win, you’ll still be president at 82, which is older than Biden is right now,\" she said. \"But not mentally. Mentally, he’s shot. He’s shot,\" Trump said to audience laughter. Trump proceeded to say \"absolutely,\" he would know if he needed to step down if he were re-elected. 'I’d pardon them' When discussing the assaults on 140 officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Trump said of those arrested for their involvement in the riot, \"If they’re innocent, I’d pardon them.\" Scott retorted, \"They’ve been convicted,\" which elicited laughter from the audience. \"Well, they were convicted by a very tough system,\" Trump said. Scott asked Trump about rioters beating officers with flagpoles and dragging them down stairs. \"Have you seen that video?\" Trump instead discussed other protestors who clashed with police in places like Seattle and Minneapolis for comparison. \"But what about the police that are ushering everybody into the Capitol, 'go in, go in,' what about that?\" Trump said. \"I was there. That's a lie,\" shouted an audience member. 'I like you very much' When talking about inflation, Trump said, \"Your grocery bills are up 40, 50, 60 percent, right?\" then pointed at an audience member. \"She screamed to me. Oh, she’s agreeing, I like you very much,\" Trump said, which prompted more audience laughter.","summary":"CHICAGO — Right before former President Donald Trump was about to be introduced for a question-and-answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention Wednesday, the crowd erupted into cheers over the announcement that the conversation would be fact-checked in real-time.\n\nThe audience continued with interjections and cheers throughout the 37-minute conversation with Trump and Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News, Harris Faulkner, anchor of \"The Faulkner Focus\" and co-host of \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News, and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor.\n\nTrump's sparring with the moderators, particularly Scott, elicited audience responses from cheers to outbursts of \"Jesus Christ\" to \"That's false.\"\n\nThese 10 Trump quotes evoked the most reaction from audience members, which included convention attendees and members of the press.\n\n'You don't even say hello'Scott launched the conversation with a lengthy first question \"addressing the elephant in the room,\" calling out a","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/black-female-journalist-fight-with-trump/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=53099104&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C164","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:37:18","author":"Alexandria Jacobson,Raw Story","authors":["Alexandria Jacobson","Raw Story"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.137},{"id":253323228,"title":"Walz could ‘speak up’ for working class as vice president: Bernie Sanders","text":"Sen.

A day earlier, he spoke highly of the governor, who is reported to be on Harris’s vice presidential short list, in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio. “I am very impressed by” Walz, Sanders said. “I think you have an excellent governor who understands the needs of working families, so I hope very much that the vice president selects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests, and I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that.” The senator and two-time Democratic presidential candidate was asked what he would like to see in Harris’s running mate, and he expanded on his plea to help working-class families. “At a time when 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck, there’s a lot of pain out there,” Sanders said. “Working people are struggling, and they’re seeing massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and what they want is political leadership in Washington, and all over the country, to start paying attention to their needs.” Walz is among the likes of Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) as a top contender to be selected as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, an announcement Harris is likely to make in the coming days. She secured the party’s presidential nomination Friday during a virtual delegate vote, more than two weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention. In addition to receiving praise from Sanders, an adviser to Joe Biden said this week that the president thinks Walz is “just a blast” and that Biden was “in the best mood ever” during a Wisconsin-Minnesota trip earlier this year. Last week, Sanders endorsed Harris at a rally in Portland, Maine, several days after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, making him one of the last Democratic-aligned politicians to fall in line behind the new standard-bearer.","summary":"Sen.

Star Tribune August 3, 2024 at 10:33PM Gov. Tim Walz took questions on July 23 about speculation he was being considered as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris. (Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune) Gov. Tim Walz has canceled his plans to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire this weekend, as Harris interviews a half-dozen potential running mates — a list believed to include Walz. ”The governor’s schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend,” Walz’s spokesman Teddy Tschann said. The vice president’s vetting team has been examining prospective running mates in a whirlwind process since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Harris is interviewing finalists this weekend ahead of an announcement expected early this coming week. Walz is on Harris’ interview list, the Associated Press reports, along with Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Others under consideration for the job have also reportedly canceled public appearances this weekend, including Shapiro, adding fuel to the heated speculation around the looming decision. Harris will hold her first rally with her running mate Tuesday in Philadelphia, her campaign has said, followed by a tour of other battleground states. Walz had planned to campaign for Harris on Sunday in New Hampshire. He was expected to speak at an event in Manchester with U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and local Democratic lawmakers. The Harris campaign’s announcement for the event said it would contrast “Donald Trump’s and MAGA Republicans’ Project 2025 agenda” with Harris’ and Democrats’ “positive vision that would strengthen our democracy, protect reproductive freedom and ensure every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get ahead.” Walz’s national profile has quickly risen in recent weeks as he has stumped for Harris and landed on her short list. His comments calling Republicans “weird people” went viral, giving Harris and Democrats a label they have embraced. Staff writer Briana Bierschbach contributed to this report.

Now he has to face off against Kamala Harris things look very different. Trump has good reason to be scared. He might even lose, again, although it is quite likely he will claim he won, against all the evidence. But he knows now he is in a race. US presidential elections are usually consequential, even if those consequences are often surprising. After all, it was not the non-WASP US golden boy JFK who ended the Vietnam war. That was forced on Tricky Dickie Nixon, who was later forced to resign from office in disgrace. But it is quite possible that this could be one of the most consequential US presidential elections of modern history, which could affect every country on the planet. To understand the historical dynamics, we need to look into the background to the current contest. When Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency in 2016 he lost the popular vote by almost three million. This is because, as jurists from the US right now like to remind us, the US is not a democracy but a “constitutional republic.” In the electoral process, this means each state casts votes for the presidential rivals in a 538-strong electoral college that takes place after the popular vote has taken place. Ever since its founding as the modern United States after the civil war, smaller states have had a disproportionate weight in the delegates to the electoral college. Currently, these are skewed to the smaller, more rural or suburban states. But they are historically the smaller slave-owning states that were defeated in the civil war. The constitutional republic is built on a compromise with slavery. This largely explains the anti-democratic nature of the system which means that the last Republican president to win the popular vote was George W Bush in 2004, having lost the popular vote but won the presidency in 2000 to Al Gore. It was a massively increased turnout in 2020 that did for Trump, the first incumbent president to lose an election in almost 30 years. Joe Biden’s vote surged by almost 16 million votes compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016, an increase of almost a quarter. It is one of the great ironies of modern US politics that Biden’s presidency was secured by the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the fact that his whole career had been one of complete opposition to the most modest attempts to combat racism in the US. Yet it was this factor and this movement which defeated Trump. Black Lives Matter took off in 2013 after a series of cop killings of unarmed black people. Typically, no officers were ever charged, let alone convicted. These killings have become endemic in US society. Just this week Sonya Massey, an unarmed black woman, was shot dead by police officers in Chicago after she had called 911 to report a possible intruder. She was shot in her home while talking to the police officers. Years of painstaking work by Black Lives Matter activists erupted into an enormous national movement after the killing of George Floyd, a movement with international resonance as we saw nightly, on our TV screens. It is estimated that up to 16 million people took part in one or more Black Lives Matter protests. Floyd was another unarmed black man murdered in broad daylight by a cop. But, because of all that activism, and because it took place in an election year, it lit a touch paper of protest. It is no exaggeration to say that 2020 was the Black Lives Matter election. The New York Times produces an excellent breakdown of the exit poll demographics for each national election. They are far superior to the various attempts here to shoe-horn data into a preconceived narrative. Think Ashcroft or various distortions of National Readership Surveys provide. What the Times exit poll shows is that this was a “stop Trump’s racism” election: 90 per cent of black women voted for Biden and he easily led in every ethnic category except white (where he lost 58:41). Racial inequality topped the list of voter concerns, identified by 92 per cent of Biden supporters. To underline why people came out in such great numbers, 53 per cent of Republicans said they voted mainly for Trump, while 68 per cent of Democrats said they voted against Trump. By 2020, voters in general, but all ethnic minorities in particular, had seen enough of Trump to repel them. They either did not know or put to one side Biden’s history of allying with the Senate far right to oppose school desegregation or to incarcerate vastly more black and Latino men on minor charges. In a similar fashion, the 2022 midterm elections were widely expected to be a rout of the Democrats in both houses of Congress. But “Stop Trump” again became the battle cry after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade protections for a woman’s right to choose. In these elections, strangely, Democrats lost the popular vote by a wide margin but won every single battleground seat. This was based on the differential in turnout of women. Essentially, where a Republican could be defeated, women turned out in their droves to oppose further curbs on the right to choose. Which brings us up to date in 2024. Biden was always set to lose to Trump even before the shooting. He presided over the biggest decline in US living standards since the Great Depression. He was politically incapable of galvanising the coalitions that had previously opposed Trump precisely because he agreed too much with him. On the economy, women’s rights, racism, trade union rights and war, Biden offered nothing different to Trump. The question now is whether Harris can mobilise the same forces, or at least enough of them to successfully stop Trump. The short answer is yes, she can. But it will not be easy. Political movements cannot just be conjured out of the air. And Harris may suffer by association with the deeply unpopular Biden. The more she can reasonably distance herself from her boss the better. Opinion polls offer some encouragement, with Harris narrowly ahead since Biden announced he was stepping aside. But it is very tight, and certainly not enough to overcome the bias of the electoral college. The stakes are enormously high and the consequences could be profound.

Biden also endorsed Harris the day he withdrew from the race and she is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.The sudden change in Walz's schedule comes as Harris is reportedly in the final stages of vetting candidates in her search for a running mate.CNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote on X, formerly Twitter, about Walz's change in travel plans: \"A little more veepstakes NEWS: from Tim Walz's spokesman: 'The governor's schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend.'\"Harris is expected to meet with her vetting team today for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists. These briefings, lasting between 60 to 90 minutes each, are designed to provide Harris with comprehensive information on the candidates' backgrounds, qualifications, and potential impact on the ticket.The list of finalists reportedly includes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, alongside Walz.The presentations may result in a narrowing of the field, with Harris expected to conduct final interviews, possibly in-person on Sunday, according to CNN.Newsweek has contacted the Harris campaign and Walz's press office via email on Saturday for comment.Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose law firm is conducting the vetting process, was seen arriving at the Naval Observatory on Saturday morning, underscoring the high-stakes nature of these deliberations.Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach with a 24-year career in the Army National Guard, brings a unique blend of experiences to the table. As a congressman, he represented a deep-red district in Minnesota, demonstrating an ability to appeal to voters across the political spectrum. His background in education, military service, and agriculture could potentially resonate with voters in key battleground states, particularly in the Midwest.In a recent op-ed for Newsweek, former Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, made a case for Walz as Harris' running mate. Ryan emphasized the importance of selecting a candidate who can connect with working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt. He highlighted Walz's understanding of issues critical to Midwestern voters, such as job creation, health care access, and education.The timing of Walz's schedule change is particularly noteworthy, mirroring a similar move by Shapiro who recently canceled a fundraising trip to the Hamptons in New York. These parallel developments have intensified the buzz around both governors as potential VP picks.Harris' top consideration in selecting a running mate is reportedly electability. The choice will not only impact the campaign's strategy, but also signal the Democratic Party's priorities and vision for the future.With Harris expected to announce her running mate before a planned campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the political world is on high alert for any further schedule changes or announcements from the potential VP candidates.","summary":"The Minnesota governor canceled his trip to New Hampshire as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to vet running mates.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-cancels-new-hampshire-trip-kamala-harris-running-mate-1934241","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442398/tim-walz-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:25:47","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.301},{"id":253322904,"title":"'It reeks': Law enforcement balks at Trump's 'Secretary of Retribution' plan","text":"The self-styled “secretary of retribution” for Donald Trump, who created a “Deep State target list” a prominent congressman describes as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans,” received an audience earlier this month with the very people he’s sought to attract: law enforcement officers. Ivan Raiklin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel with designs on conducting “live-streamed swatting raids” against the more than 350 politicians, federal employees, journalists and others on the list, detailed his plans to about two dozen police officials gathered earlier this month for a sheriffs’ association conference in Fort Worth, Texas.RELATED ARTICLE: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested Raiklin’s 20-minute presentation to the Texas law enforcement officials took place in a private meeting room on July 22 in a restaurant in Fort Worth, according to a video reviewed by Raw Story. During his presentation, Raiklin laid out a legally dubious plan in which he suggested the law enforcement officials could investigate various high-ranking Democrats by reviewing their private communications on the social media platform X, and then correlating the geo-located data to their local counties. In previous interviews on right-wing podcasts, Raiklin has suggested that the communications, were they to be disclosed, would provide digital evidence of crimes that would then justify law enforcement investigations and “swatting raids” — the latter term apparently referring to arrests. Raw Story has confirmed that at least two county sheriffs were among the law enforcement personnel attending the event, which one sheriff said was hosted by an organization called Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs. “We are pleading with you at the county level,” Raiklin told the group, adding that he plans to “use capabilities like some people have in this room to sift through all of their digital assets.” With Trump now facing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, Raiklin predicted that the next six weeks in American politics would get “spicy,” and he presented a conspiratorial narrative about supposed ruthless “Deep State” agents willing to go to any lengths to maintain their hold on power. RELATED ARTICLE: Trump ‘secretary of retribution’ won't discuss his ‘target list’ at RNC “They may have already assassinated Joe Biden, for all we know,” Raiklin said during his talk, which took place one day after President Joe Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race. (Contrary to speculation by right-wing conspiracy theorists, Biden is alive.) “They are willing to go to any length to retain their power, and we have to go to the mat to make sure that we get our constitutional order back in place,” Raiklin continued. “And it requires everybody in this room and your colleagues at the county level — local action, national impact — to reset and body-check this lawlessness.” The law enforcement personnel in the audience participated in Raiklin’s classroom-style presentation by engaging in a call-and-response session. For example, Raiklin asked the sheriff officials to name a business mogul who had recently moved his company headquarters from California to Texas. “Elon Musk,” one man responded. Raiklin also called on them to name the local Texas counties where they worked. “We want to see all forms of communication between Twitter employees and their emails, and their internal Slack channels, and their Twitter direct messages inside the Twitter platform with the geo-tagged, geo-located metadata applied to everyone on the Deep State target list,” Raiklin said. “And then decide where a criminal interaction took place by jurisdiction. Anything that has Texas on it in county….” Raiklin paused, and then called on one of the audience members. “What county?” he asked a stocky man with piercing blue eyes. That man, Sheriff Edward A. Miller, volunteered to Raiklin that he leads the sheriff’s office in Shackelford, a county with a population of 3,105 that is roughly 125 miles west of Fort Worth and not near any interstate highways. With this tangible piece of information, Raiklin continued his hypothetical, asking the law enforcement officials to imagine that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) — a prominent, liberal congressman who previously expressed concern about Raiklin to Raw Story — was “driving through Shackelford County.” RELATED ARTICLE: Texas news station removes press release praising Trump's ‘secretary of retribution’ Then, perhaps recognizing the remote likelihood of the hypothetical, Raiklin abruptly asked for another volunteer. An unidentified man volunteered the name of McLennan County, located on Interstate 35 between Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth region. Its county seat is the city of Waco. Then, Raiklin moved on to a more plausible place where Raskin might travel. “Who is near a major airport?” he asked. “Anyone?” A woman attending Raiklin’s presentation volunteered the names of Tarrant and Dallas, the two counties across which Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport stretches. Miller, the sheriff of Shackelford County, Texas, told Raw Story by phone that Raiklin’s presentation was put on by Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs. Sheriff Parnell McNamara of McLennan County told Raw Story that someone he didn't know invited him to the restaurant for a steak dinner while he was eating lunch at the Fort Worth Convention Center, where the Sheriff's Association of Texas Annual Training Conference and Expo was held from July 20 to July 23. McNamara said he ate the steak, but didn't stay for the presentation. He told Raw Story he doesn't know Raiklin and hasn't communicated with him before or since. After reviewing social media posts showing Raiklin mingling in the exhibition hall at the conference, Skylor Hearn, executive director of the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, confirmed that they show Raiklin wearing an \"exhibitor\" badge issued by the association. Some of the posts depicting Raiklin at the sheriffs' conference show him seated in front of large placards for two different organizations — one that provides legal support to defendants charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the other promoting the hand-counting of election ballots. One post includes a photograph showing Raiklin speaking with Morris County, Texas, Sheriff Jack Martin. The caption indicates that Martin had been “informed to be prepared” to receive a tranche of private messages from X “and let his district attorney know it’s coming for Deep State Target List development.” Martin did not return multiple messages from Raw Story seeking comment on Raiklin’s pitch. Nor did the sheriffs’ offices in Tarrant and Dallas counties, which were both referenced by one of the audience members during Raiklin’s presentation. “We get a wide variety of vendors,” Hearn told Raw Story. “If someone is willing to stop and listen to them, they can talk about their widgets or their worldview.” McNamara, the sheriff in McLennan County, said he was similarly enticed when he received the invitation to Raiklin's presentation at the restaurant. \"Different vendors are wanting you to come and wanting to buy you dinner, and I thought that's what this was about,\" he said. The sheriffs' conference included official trainings that allow participants to earn credits through the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, but Hearn said Raiklin’s presentation to the sheriffs at the restaurant “was definitely not part of our programming.” Raiklin, who attended the sheriffs conference only three days after appearing at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee as a credentialed guest, did not respond to requests for comment on this story. When Raw Story approached Raiklin last month at the Republican National Convention, Raiklin refused to answer various questions, including those about his \"target list\" and plan to work with largely rural, conservative county sheriffs to deputize some 75,000 military veterans to arrest people on his list. The video of Raiklin's presentation shows a man who appears to be Kirk Launius, founder and director of Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs, assisting Raiklin by selecting a slide for his audio-visual presentation. Launius' LinkedIn profile describes him as a Dallas-based \"global internet entrepreneur, mobile business coach, social media strategist and philanthropist\" who was previously employed as a Dallas police officer. Launius ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Dallas County in 2012 and 2016. Launius could not be reached for comment for this story. ‘America will respond in kind’ Since the beginning of the year, Raiklin has zealously promoted his plan to enlist sheriffs to detain federal employees and others who have run afoul of Trump and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser. On podcasts and social media, Raiklin often presents a bill of particulars against individuals on his “target list” based on a dubious legal framework and dubious claims, such as suggesting without evidence that the unidentified person responsible for setting pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee on Jan. 6, 2021, was “a subordinate-surrogate of the Capitol Police Board,” which oversees the Capitol Police. Raiklin’s claims carry an undercurrent of violence: He accuses perceived Trump enemies of treason, and his social media followers sometimes make the logical leap that people on Raiklin’s “target list” should face the punishment of death. Raiklin has forged a close relationship with Flynn, who was his former boss at the Defense Intelligence Agency, a federal entity where Raiklin worked during the past decade. Following an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate from Virginia in 2018, Raiklin became an avid Trump supporter, and worked in tandem with Flynn to overturn the 2020 election. Over the course of this year, Raiklin has appeared at events to promote a laudatory documentary film about Flynn. Prior to each screening, Raiklin typically presents a museum-style “evidence wall” arguing that many of the individuals on his “Deep State target list” conspired in a plot to persecute Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its case against Flynn in May 2020, and later that year, then-President Trump issued Flynn a pardon. Raiklin’s rhetoric over the past two months has escalated to the point where he has directly called for violence. In one X post, Raiklin mocked former national security adviser Alexander Vindman, suggesting that he would “speak to him in person” and asking for his “preferred punishment for committing treason.” Raiklin supporters on X responded by suggesting variations on hanging or execution by firing squad. Since the attempt on Trump’s life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, Raiklin has claimed without evidence that members of the so-called “Deep State” are involved in a plot to assassinate the former president and current 2024 Republican nominee for president. In an X post on July 22, Raiklin decreed that “all leading contenders” to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee — Vice President Kamala Harris ostensibly included — “are to be treated as the ones behind ordering the assassination of President Trump.” He further warned that “America will respond in kind unless they turn themselves in.” Lira Gallagher, a spokesperson for the FBI Washington Field Office, declined to comment on whether Raiklin is on the agency’s radar. During his presentation to the Texas sheriffs, Raiklin singled out Raskin, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, for scrutiny. Raskin has previously described Raiklin’s list as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans, and a clear and present danger to the survival of American democracy and freedom.” Raskin called on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to repudiate threats of political violence. Since then, Raiklin has appeared to taunt Raskin by posting a photo of himself clasping hands with Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) at the Republican National Convention. Higgins has falsely claimed that a “ghost bus… filled with FBI informants dressed as Trump supporters” descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\" “What do you think we discussed, @RepRaskin?” Raiklin wrote. “Maybe @SpeakerJohnson can tell you.” Then, on the same day he spoke to the Texas sheriffs, Raiklin accused Raskin of being “involved in the assassination attempt” against Trump, while acknowledging that he has no evidence to back his claim. Miller, the sheriff of Shackelford County, said he came away confused about what Raiklin was asking him to do. “I don’t know where you would come up with a crime if they’re 30,000 feet in the air,” Miller told Raw Story. “It seems like that would be more likely to be investigated as a federal conspiracy.” Miller said he expected Raiklin’s talk to provide sheriffs with insight on how they can follow the Constitution, but that wasn’t what they heard. “My opinion is that the presentation that should have been given is, ‘This is the United States Constitution. We believe that the sheriff and the county should follow the Constitution as it relates to the inalienable rights of the citizens,’” Miller said. “That wasn’t the presentation that was given. It was a presentation on politics.” When Raiklin asked whom in the audience might be “near a major airport,” he zeroed in on the biggest political target of all — Harris — the candidate who is all but certain to go up against Donald Trump in the presidential election. An unidentified woman in the audience volunteered that Tarrant and Dallas counties in Texas encompass Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. “Imagine they flew through there as they’re waiting,” Raiklin said. “They communicate.” He went on to specifically name Harris, while suggesting that the law enforcement officers could investigate her “comms team” based on private emails that they might have exchanged while waiting for a connecting flight. Raiklin’s motivations — and a pitch to law enforcement During his presentation in Fort Worth, Raiklin suggested his motivation for attempting to exact retribution on federal government employees was being placed under surveillance by the Department of Homeland Security following Jan. 6, 2021, when he was spotted on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. In the runup to Jan. 6, Raiklin had promoted a plan called “Operation Pence Card,” which called for then-Vice President Mike Pence to set aside electoral votes in states narrowly won by Biden, which would have effectively flipped the election in Trump’s favor. “And in the case of my situation — top Secret clearance, reserve lieutenant colonel — cleared TSA pre-check,” Raiklin said, apparently referring to a pat down. “But when I go to travel — not anymore — for 21 months, they subjected me to that Fourth Amendment gang rape, as I reported that procedure, okay? Is that cool?” To establish his qualifications, Raiklin told the group assembled for his presentation that he finished his military career teaching “intelligence analysis at the nation’s premier intelligence analytic program in the U.S. intel community at the Defense Intelligence Agency. “I’m not the smartest guy in the room, but I may know what I’m talking about when it comes to conducting structured analytic techniques, link analysis, timeline, chronology — all taking that capability and applying it to something isn’t right in America,” he added. Raiklin’s plan depends on cooperation from a series of powerful actors, as he explained to the law enforcement officers present for his presentation. He told them he wants to see three Republican congressmen who chair House committees — Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, James Comer of Kentucky, and Barry Loudermilk of Georgia — or Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton subpoena X owner Elon Musk for the private direct messages of the 350-some individuals on his “Deep State target list.” A spokesperson for Loudermilk did not respond to a request for comment on the record, and emails to Jordan, Comer and Paxton similarly went unreturned. Prior to speaking with sheriffs in Fort Worth last week, Raiklin had attempted to cultivate relationships with sheriffs through the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which espouses the controversial belief that sheriffs are the highest law in the land and are not legally required to uphold state and federal laws they deem to be unconstitutional.","summary":"The self-styled “secretary of retribution” for Donald Trump, who created a “Deep State target list” a prominent congressman describes as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans,” received an audience earlier this month with the very people he’s sought to attract: law enforcement officers.\n\nIvan Raiklin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel with designs on conducting “live-streamed swatting raids” against the more than 350 politicians, federal employees, journalists and others on the list, detailed his plans to about two dozen police officials gathered earlier this month for a sheriffs’ association conference in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested\n\nRaiklin’s 20-minute presentation to the Texas law enforcement officials took place in a private meeting room on July 22 in a restaurant in Fort Worth, according to a video reviewed by Raw Story.\n\nDuring his presentation, Raiklin laid out a legally dubious plan in which ","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/ivan-raiklin-2668883959/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/trumps-secretary-of-retribution-has-a-target-list-of-350-people-he-wants-arrested.png?id=52667491&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:23:09","author":"Jordan Green,Raw Story","authors":["Jordan Green","Raw Story"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":253321830,"title":"VP Kamala Harris' expected nomination sheds light on 'The Divine Nine'","text":"VP Kamala Harris' expected nomination sheds light on 'The Divine Nine' NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with National Pan-Hellenic Council Chairman Willis Lonzer III about the significance of Black fraternities and sororities ahead of the November election.

Andy Beshear’s efforts to land the No. 2 spot on the national Democratic presidential ticket drew ridicule from prominent Republicans during the Bluegrass State’s premiere political event on Saturday. Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer lampooned the governor for trying to “reinvent his image from a wimpy choir boy to a liberal attack dog.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell fired his own zingers at Beshear during the political speeches at the annual Fancy Farm picnic in western Kentucky. Beshear, who proved to be an effective counterpuncher in prior years at the picnic, wasn’t on hand to defend himself. Instead, he was among a half-dozen Democrats being interviewed this weekend by Vice President Kamala Harris as she closes in on choosing a running mate. Her interview list also includes Govs. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people were granted anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. The suspense over whether Beshear will be asked to join the ticket has dominated headlines in Kentucky. On Saturday, Republicans got in their word as they dominated the stage at the picnic grounds. “The leader of the (Kentucky) Democratic Party, the governor, I hear is spending the weekend with Vice President Harris. I’d a lot rather be with you guys,” McConnell told the picnic crowd, which by tradition was divided between boisterous supporters for Republicans and Democrats. McConnell said Democrats had chosen an even worse presidential nominee than Biden. “At least Biden poses as a moderate,” the senator said. “Vice President Harris doesn’t try to be anything but a San Francisco liberal.” At a GOP breakfast on Saturday, McConnell said: “Who would have thought that most of the drama in the last month would have been on the Democratic side, but it has been.” After President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign last month, Democrats quickly coalesced around Harris. Poking fun at Beshear’s praise of Harris, McConnell said it was “no surprise for a guy used to having jobs served up to him on a silver platter.” Beshear, the son of former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, has won three tough elections in ruby red Kentucky — once for attorney general and twice for governor. The McConnell-Beshear rivalry dates back to the 1990s when McConnell defeated Steve Beshear in a Senate race. McConnell promoted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name twice during his picnic speech, saying his return to the White House would “bring our economy roaring back.” McConnell endorsed Trump in March, a remarkable turnaround from the onetime critic who blamed the then-president for “disgraceful” acts in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Comer, chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, was even more biting with jabs at Beshear on Saturday. Noting that Beshear was applying for a new job, Comer said: “He wants to be vice president so bad that when Kamala Harris asked him what his pronouns were, Andy replied ‘pretty and please.’” Democrats chalked it up as another round of futile attacks on the popular governor. “They don’t work because families know Andy and they know he is genuine, compassionate and he shows up over and over again to deliver for Kentuckians,” Jonathan Levin, a spokesman for the Kentucky Democratic Party, said in a statement. One of the few Democrats on the Fancy Farm stage defended the governor. Erin Marshall, who is challenging Comer in the November election, said she wanted to continue Beshear’s work. “It is time to bring back more jobs to the district, support our farmers, revitalize our small towns and protect a woman’s right to make her own health care choices,” she said. Political speaking is as much a tradition as the barbecue at the Fancy Farm picnic, and it’s become a right of passage for candidates seeking statewide office. As usual, the crowd of Republicans and Democrats tried to outdo the other with chants putting down the opposition. With no statewide office on the ballot this year, the biggest contest is over a proposal constitutional amendment. If the ballot measure is ratified by voters, the state’s GOP-dominated legislature could then decide whether to steer public funds to private or charter school education. Beshear is a leading opponent of the proposal, having said that “public dollars should only go to public schools, period.” Bruce Schreiner, The Associated Press","summary":"Kentucky Gov.

Just two years ago Buffett called the stock one of the four giants of his conglomerate's business alongside Berkshire insurance, utility and BNSF railroad businesses that it owns outright. That gave investors the impression that Buffett might hold onto Apple indefinitely like he has with the Coca-Cola and American Express shares he bought decades ago. READ MORE: Man allegedly hit with metal pole during suspected arson attack However, he has trimmed the Apple stake over the past year and has recently also sold off some of his stock in Bank of America and Chinese EV maker BYD while doing very little buying. As a result, Buffett is now sitting on nearly US$277 billion ($424 billion) in cash, up from what was already a record $294 billion just three months earlier. \"This could could alarm the markets especially given the news from last week\" with weak tech earnings, a disappointing jobs report and uncertainty about the future of interest rates, Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said. READ MORE: Disqualification drama hands Kaylee bronze﻿ Buffett has consistently lavished praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha in May, and talked about the way consumers are feverishly devoted to their iPhones and don't like to switch. He did trim more than 10 per cent of Berkshire's Apple stake in the first three months of this year when he sold off more than 116 million shares, but the sale disclosed on Saturday was a much bigger move. Berkshire didn't give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday's report, but it estimated the investment was worth $129.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $363.9. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake was worth $207.9 billion. READ MORE: Donald Trump says he'll skip debate with Kamala Harris in September The death of the iPod: The evolution of the device that changed musicView Gallery Shanahan estimates that Berkshire still holds about 400 million Apple shares. Still, while CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she looks at the Apple sale more as responsible portfolio management because the tech giant had become such a large portion of Berkshire's holdings, it does look like Buffett may be preparing for a downturn. \"This is a company girding itself for a weaker economic climate,\" Seifert said. Berkshire reported a small drop in its bottom-line earnings because a drop in the paper value of its investments. The company said it earned $46.6 billion, or $32,435 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That's down from $51.1 billion, or $38,000 per A share, a year ago. Buffett has long cautioned investors that it's better to look at Berkshire's operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew more than 15 per cent to $17.8 billion, or $12,395 per Class A share, from $15.4 billion, or $10,638 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire's businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results. The results easily topped the $10,028 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted. Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.

Bernie Sanders energizes voters at Minneapolis rally for Rep. Ilhan Omar","text":"News & Politics Sen. Bernie Sanders energizes voters at Minneapolis rally for Rep. Ilhan Omar Sanders visited Minneapolis to support U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s primary election campaign. Star Tribune August 3, 2024 at 10:15PM U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders addressed a rally Saturday backing U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar's reelection bid in Minneapolis. (Kyeland Jackson, Star Tribune) U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders stopped in northeast Minneapolis on Saturday to lead hundreds in a get-out-the-vote rally for U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar as she seeks a fourth term in Congress. Sanders, the Vermont independent who has twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, told the crowd at Thomas Edison High School that Omar, a Democrat, “is one of the outstanding members of the United States Congress” and that he was proud to work with her. “She knows that her job is not to represent big money interests, but to represent working people” as well as children, senior citizens, and “vulnerable people in our society,” said Sanders, who spoke Friday night at Minnesota State University Mankato. The Omar campaign said at least 700 people attended the rally at Edison High, where Omar graduated in 2001. Supporters lined up along the walls of the packed auditorium, shouting Sanders’ and Omar’s names while waving “Ilhan for Congress” signs. U.S. Sen. Tina Smith also addressed the rally, voicing her support for Omar. The Minnesota Democrat said the campaign’s momentum has surged in recent weeks since President Joe Biden decided not to seek re-election and opened the door to the presumptive nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris. “The energy, the grassroots enthusiasm, that is real,” Smith said. “That is organic, because people can see that there should be hope and joy in politics. There is joy in fighting for what we believe in.” Supporters greeted Omar with a standing ovation and cheers. She told them that Edison High and Minnesota had made her feel welcome after her family, Somali immigrants, arrived here in the 1990s. “I am also a proud mom of three Minneapolis public school students and will always fight hard to ensure our educators have the resources that they need,” Omar said. She alleged that her opponent in the Aug. 13 primary, former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels, accepted $200,000 from “right-wing billionaires who want to dismantle public schools.” “That is not Minnesota values. That is not the values of our neighbors and that’s not the values that I carry,” Omar said. In a statement, Samuels said Omar had sought support from the likes of Sanders because their race is expected to be tight. In the 2022 primary for the Fifth Congressional District seat, Samuels lost to Omar by 2 percentage points, coming closer to unseating her than previous candidates. It’s déjà vu all over again, Samuels said in the statement. “Like in 2022, Rep. Ilhan Omar is calling in national support because she knows this race is close and that our grassroots campaign is growing every day,” he said. “We believe voters realize that August 13th is their opportunity to choose leadership focused on the people, not their own agenda.” Most Read News & Politics Cargill billionaire’s foundation quietly closes after giving out unprecedented $500 million News & Politics Viral trail camera video captures rare footage of Canada lynx in northern Minnesota News & Politics Police raids shed light on Minnesota’s weak laws, fragmented oversight of animal rescues News & Politics Minnesota cities opposed a bill allowing accessory dwelling units -- but many are permitting them Most Read News & Politics Cargill billionaire’s foundation quietly closes after giving out unprecedented $500 million News & Politics Viral trail camera video captures rare footage of Canada lynx in northern Minnesota News & Politics Police raids shed light on Minnesota’s weak laws, fragmented oversight of animal rescues News & Politics Minnesota cities opposed a bill allowing accessory dwelling units -- but many are permitting them Much of Saturday’s rally focused on the presidential race as Omar urged the crowd to support Harris.

Walz, Sanders said, “understands that we live in a society of massive income and wealth inequality, and the time is long overdue for government to pay attention to working families and not just wealthy campaign loans.”","summary":"Sanders visited Minneapolis to support  U.S. Rep.

But Trump did. And now the GOP is dealing with the fallout. In Chicago, Trump told attendees of a National Association of Black Journalists convention that Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was \"Indian all the way\" until “she became a Black person” in recent years. (Harris’ mother is Indian and originally from India, her father is Black and originally from Jamaica.) So Raw Story took Trump’s claim to 10 Senate Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). ‘What?’ “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) about Harris, who served in the U.S. Senate from 2017 to 2021. “What?” Tuberville exclaimed. “That came up for debate yesterday by the head of your party,” Raw Story explained. ALSO READ:'That's a lie': The 10 quotes Trump said to Black journalists that led to outbursts “I don’t get in those debates,” Tuberville said. “Is she an American — that's what I don’t know. Is Trump an American? If they’re both Americans, naturalized citizens, hey, they get an opportunity to run for president.” “Are you convinced that she is?” “A citizen?” Tuberville asked. “Yeah, yeah.” “Some people are saying Trump's comments yesterday are a throwback to birtherism under Obama.” “I don't get in that debate. Come on,” Tuberville said. “We need to talk about policies.” “Curious — is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story then asked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) after he voted in the Capitol on Thursday. “Yes, we know what her ancestry is. She's half Indian, half Jamaican,” Johnson replied. “Do you need to educate the former president on that?” Raw Story asked of Trump. “Or do you think he knows that?” “He's just pointing out that she's kind of claimed different heritages at different times in her political career. That's true, isn't it? He's pointing out the truth,” Johnson said. “You can question whether that was the smart thing to point out, but he's just pointing out what the truth is.” Trump made GOP leaders — present and next gen — squirm “Senator McConnell, is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked the Senate minority leader and he and his security detail made their way to the Senate floor. “It seems to be up for debate in your party.” McConnell — who’s announced he’s stepping down as the Republican Senate leader after the November elections — smiled and, per the leader’s usual, said nothing as he walked onto the Senate floor. The next generation of Republican leaders weren’t so stoic. “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked McConnell’s former right hand man, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who’s vying to replace him. “I can assume we're all a combination of different genetic gene pools, so I don't know,” Cornyn told Raw Story. “I think we're all sort of a mixture.” McConnell’s current number two appeared annoyed by the question. “As far as I know,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) — who’s also running to replace McConnell — told Raw Story. “I'm focused on the issues.” The third Senate Republican running to replace McConnell came with a proverbial doctor’s note. “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked as an elevator took Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) up to the Senate floor for a vote. “I didn't hear the comments,” Scott told Raw Story. “He said ‘she turned Black recently,’” Raw Story noted. “I’m always talking about issues,” Scott said. Another reporter interjected: “Do comments like that make you feel uncomfortable in any way?” “I didn't see the comment,” Scott replied. “Do you avoid TV and the paper just to not have to talk about Trump?” Raw Story pressed. “Actually, I don’t watch enough TV,” Scott said as he laughed. “Actually at the time I was giving a speech on the Senate floor.” “Yeah?” “I really was,” Scott said. “Saved by the bell.” GOP war on Democrats’ identities But Democrats fear this bell has only begun to ring as Harris and Trump — and their revved up bases — now sprint toward the election. “I assume so. She says so,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told Raw Story while walking to his office after voting. “I think she's Jamaican-American, right? And Indian.” “What’d you make of that exchange yesterday?” Raw Story pressed. “Here's what I think. My issue is not how she describes herself or her heritage — that’s totally up to her — my issue is what she says she’s going to do as president,\" Hawley said. “It's with her policies, which I think are insane.” “Some people say it’s Trump stoking Charlottesville — ‘they will replace us’?” Raw Story said, referencing the racist Unite the Right demonstrations of 2017 that left one woman dead. “Well, you will never convince me that Donald Trump is racist,” Hawley — who infamously revved protestors up by raising his clenched fist on Jan. 6, 2021 — said. “I don't think he's racist at all.” Hawley continued: “I thought he was needling her a little bit and that racial identity politics are just inherently malleable. And, frankly, absurd. I mean, yes, she's an Indian-American. She's a Jamaican-American. Most Americans are multiple — something-American. And, you know, they've got ‘White Dudes for Kamala’ and ‘Asian Pacific Islanders for Kamala.’ I mean, the whole thing is just, most people look at this, like, ‘this is ridiculous.’” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) — who views the entire exchange as “careless politics” — let out a squeak of laughter when asked, “Is Kamala Harris Black?” ALSO READ:Texas sheriffs engage conspiracy theorist who created Trump enemies 'target list' “Well, she's a woman of color,” Cramer replied. “And she said — and she's a — from what I know and what I read — she's a Black. Part Black. She's part Indian. And both are wonderful.” Cramer continued by offering that “when identity politics play a role — or racial identity — plays a role in hiring practices or nominating, you can hardly complain about it if that's the credential that got you the job. In her case, I think what … President Trump's intent was, she's the one that wasn't Black in her own mind —- not in anybody else's — and then when it's convenient, she becomes Black. That's his point.” Cramer added: “I've seen interviews of some other people of color that were really good, because what I think happens is … I think, it's already baked in to those people. To other people who don't want color to be the reason that people look at them as successful, they're offended by her,” Cramer said. “But again, it's not that he's necessarily wrong. As entertaining as it is, there's no need to do it.” As for Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), she, too, said she wasn’t that familiar with Trump’s take on Harris’ race. “I didn't really see it. Obviously, it's been in the news,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) told Raw Story. “I think sticking to the policies is the better strategy here. And so I'll leave it at that.” Outside the Senate chambers Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) trashed Harris’ record as vice president and highlighted her connection with Biden. “She and Joe Biden have spent four years undermining our friends and allies and showing weakness and appeasement to our enemies, which has led to endless wars and chaos abroad,” Cruz said. “Is she Black?” Raw Story asked Cruz of Harris. Cruz didn’t reply as he walked away onto the Senate floor to vote.","summary":"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans weren’t ready for former President Donald Trump to wade into the realm of Vice President Kamala Harris’ race and ethnicity while speaking Wednesday to a room of Black journalists.\n\n\nBut Trump did.

The Sunbelt refers to states including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, and the Blue Wall includes Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President Joe Biden won all six of those states in 2020 by thin margins, but just weeks ago, his campaign said the Sun Belt and North Carolina looked increasingly out of reach. Harris’ takeover of Biden’s campaign has injected new energy, money and enthusiasm into the race, which is translating into a shift in polls that show her pulling even with Trump or ahead in some battleground states. Since Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris on July 21, 200,000 volunteers have joined the Harris campaign, while over 350,000 supporters attended their first phone bank, rally or other campaign event — an over 350% increase in event attendees, Kanninen said. Her campaign announced on Friday it raised $310 million in July, fueled by small-dollar donations. In the next two weeks, the campaign will add 150 more staff in the “Blue Wall,” and will more than double its staff in Arizona and North Carolina, Kanninen said. Harris campaign’s operations on the ground are more extensive than Republican nominee former President Donald Trump, he said. “In Nevada, Team Harris has 13 offices, while Trump has just one,” Kanninen wrote. “In Pennsylvania, we have 36 coordinated offices while Trump has just 3. In Georgia, we have 24 offices while the Trump team didn’t open their first until June.” The Trump campaign did not immediately confirm the accuracy of those numbers, and did not respond to a request for comment. This week Trump’s campaign was set to launch a $10 million advertising blitz in six battleground states. A super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz after it said it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris. Some political experts have questioned Trump’s lack of campaign infrastructure in recent days. “Those of us who are interested in voting are like, ‘Why don’t you need a ground game?’” political historian Heather Cox Richardson said in a Facebook livestream. “It really takes feet on the ground, knuckles on doors, meetings with people, everything to get money circulating … He is not trying to get enough votes.” Harris held a marginal one-percentage-point lead over Republican Donald Trump in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, closing the gap that opened in the final weeks of President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. The three-day poll showed Harris supported by 43% of registered voters, with former President Trump supported by 42%, within the poll’s 3.5 percentage point margin of error.","summary":"WILMINGTON, Del. >> Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s presidential campaign is staffing up in battleground states over the next two weeks including in the &#8216;Sun Belt&#8217; that increasingly looked out of reach for President Joe Biden, citing momentum for her White House bid as grassroots engagement and fundraising soar.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/03/breaking-news/harris-campaign-staffs-up-in-battleground-states-sun-belt/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-03T162415Z_1341370258_RC2859AGESBM_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS-CAMPAIGN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:13:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":253321510,"title":"Donald Trump Agrees to Fox News Debate in September as Kamala Harris Sticks to ABC Debate Plan Even If He Doesn’t Attend","text":"Former President Donald Trump is pushing for — and says he has already agreed to — a new presidential debate hosted by Fox News after citing former opponent Joe Biden's absence as one of the reasons for him not proceeding with a previously scheduled ABC News debate. As the new Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris has since announced her intention to stick to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News — previously announced in May between Trump and Biden before he dropped out — even if Trump doesn't show up. In the late hours of Friday, Aug. 2, the Republican candidate, 78, announced on his Truth Social platform that he \"agreed\" with Fox News to debate Harris, 59, on Sept. 4. In the post, he claimed his ABC News debate was \"terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant.\" Fox News had previously invited Trump and Harris to debate on Sept. 17. Trump cited a \"a conflict of interest\" while announcing his decision to not participate in the ABC News debate, writing that he's \"in litigation against ABC Network\" and George Stephanopoulos. As previously reported, Trump filed a lawsuit against the political commentator, claiming that Stephanopoulos defamed him during an interview when he used the word \"rape\" when mentioning Trump being found liable for sexually abusing and defaming former Elle advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a civil trial last year. While Trump is now citing the litigation as a reason for his debate move to Fox News, he initially filed his suit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos in March — weeks before he and Biden agreed to the debate. Trump wrote on his social media platform that the he's since shifted his focus on the Fox News debate, which he said would be held in Pennsylvania at a \"site in an area to be determined,\" with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators. \"...And the Rules will be similar to the Rules of my Debate with Sleepy Joe, who has been treated horribly by his Party,\" Trump claimed. \"BUT WITH A FULL ARENA AUDIENCE!\" On Saturday, Aug, 3, Harris responded to a screenshot of Trump's post with a message on X (formerly Twitter): “It’s interesting how ‘anytime, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe place.' I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there,\" Harris wrote, referring to the previously agreed upon ABC News debate. In her response, Harris appeared to quote a message Trump shared with his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin in April, when he called on Biden to debate him \"any time, any place\" and \"any way you want.\" Trump then claimed on Truth Social after Harris' post that she \"doesn’t even want to debate me\" during his proposed debate time after he backed out of the ABC News debate. He also claimed that she was \"afraid to do it.\" Meanwhile, Harris Campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler told ABC News in a statement that Trump is \"running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.\" \"He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10,\" Tyler told the outlet. \"The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience. We’re happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to. Mr. Anytime, Anywhere, Anyplace should have no problem with that unless he’s too scared to show up on the 10th.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In a Fox News interview earlier this week, per PBS, Trump claimed he could \"make a case\" for not participating in a debate against the vice president, and said he'd \"probably end up debating\" Harris. In May, both Biden and Trump agreed upon two debates — the one that already took place on CNN in June and the upcoming ABC News debate in September. The agreement came after the Biden campaign announced, per NPR, that the current president would not participate in terms laid out by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has facilitated presidential debates since 1988. The Republican National Committee also shared in April 2022 that it was quitting the Commission on Presidential Debates, per the outlet.","summary":"“It’s interesting how ‘anytime, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe place,’ ” Harris said about Trump","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-agrees-to-fox-debate-in-september-kamala-harris-stands-by-abc-news-debate-plans-8689968","image":"https://people.com/thmb/rymYa3oAOmo1GZHpxse7JG2yqP0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x258:741x260)/Kamala-Harris-trump-072124-1-d3abe68cf06c45818b279683834b3222.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:11:06","author":"Brenton Blanchet","authors":["Brenton Blanchet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":253321400,"title":"Inside Georgia's newest breathtaking voter suppression scam","text":"Republicans in Georgia have been champions at pioneering new ways to disenfranchise Democratic voters. Their latest scam is breathtaking. First, the background. When Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp was Secretary of State — the state’s top elections official — and running against Stacey Abrams for Governor in 2018, Abrams’ organization had registered 53,000 people (70% African American) to vote. Kemp put those registrations on hold so they couldn’t vote in the 2018 election, which he won by 54,723 votes. But that was just the beginning for Kemp. By the year prior to the 2018 election he’d purged a total of 1.4 million voters from the rolls, claiming he was just removing people who’d died or moved. On a single night in July 2017 he removed half a million voters, about 8% of all registered Georgia voters, an act The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said “may represent the largest mass disenfranchisement in US history.” ALSO READ: We asked 10 Republican senators: ‘Is Kamala Harris Black?’ Things got weird fast. Investigative reporter Greg Palast hired the company Amazon uses to verify addresses and ran the names and addresses of those 534,000 people Kemp purged that July day through their system: 334,000 of them, most Black, had neither died nor moved. But they’d sure lost their right to vote. Then Kemp shut down 8 percent of all the polling places in Georgia just before the election, the majority — recommended as a “cost saving move” by a white consultant Kemp had hired — in Black neighborhoods. Did I mention that he “won” that election by only 54,723 votes? In 2020, when Stacey Abrams again challenged Kemp for the governorship, Kemp’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (pronounced “Raff-ens-purger”) purged another 309,000 voters from the rolls; Palast hired the company again and found that 198,351 of them had neither died nor moved. It’s worth noting that if Brian Kemp wanted to take away a gun from any Georgia resident, Republicans on the Supreme Court have ruled that he’d have to go to court and prove his case; to purge voters from the rolls and take away their votes, though, Republicans on the Supreme Court have also ruled that Kemp doesn’t even need to notify those voters. This year, Kemp signed a new law allowing any citizen to present a list of voters they believe must be purged from the rolls; one person, Marjorie Taylor Greene ally and Republican activist Pam Reardon, submitted a list of 32,000 voters, and the Chairman of the Ft. Benning area GOP, Alton Russell, challenged over 4,000 voters. A total of 149,000 voters were challenged by a handful of white Republican activists. These tricks have helped keep Republicans in charge of Georgia politics, a state that would almost certainly be blue if every citizen were allowed to easily vote. But there was some blowback to Kemp’s and Raffensperger’s “mass purge by vote vigilantes” strategy, so now comes Kemp’s latest trick. This week Georgia rolled out a new website where people can let the state know they’ve moved (or their relative has died) and cancel their voter registration online. It’s super easy; you just plug in your information and, poof, your voter registration vanishes. This would seem to be a solution in search of a problem. For example, over the past 50 years I’ve lived in Michigan, New Hampshire, Germany, Georgia, Vermont, Oregon, Washington DC, and then Oregon again: I never once let a state know I’d moved. . Instead, states track death records and the expiration of drivers’ licenses to determine who’s died and moved so they can then cancel registrations appropriately. My being registered to vote in both, say, Washington DC and Oregon when I only live in Oregon, is not a problem for DC if I don’t try to vote there. And nobody ever tries to vote twice just because they’ve moved; it’s a form of “voter fraud” that just doesn’t happen in any meaningful numbers. But “keeping the voter rolls clean” — as if it were an urgent imperative making the wait for drivers’ licenses to expire just too dangerous — is the new excuse for Kemp’s Georgia website. Nobody’s believing the GOP’s “mass voter fraud” schtick anymore, so they’re reverting to this rational-sounding new way of getting Democrats removed from the voting rolls. The problem with the new “cancel my registration” site is that bad actors, if they know a person’s name, address, DOB, and either Social Security or drivers’ license number, can simply go in and cancel other people they don’t want voting. The “safety barrier” is that Republican activists who want to delete voter registrations in areas they know are heavily Democratic might be deterred from trying to do that with this new site, because they don’t have all that data on every Georgia voter. Until this week. For an hour Monday, the entire Georgia voter database — including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security and drivers’ license numbers — was publicly posted on that very site. Oops, Kemp said! Anybody could download it and share it with others, including Republican activists who might want to keep on purging Democratic voters. As the Executive Director of the Georgia Democratic Party said, “This portal is ripe for abuse by right-wing activists who are already submitting mass voter challenges meant to disenfranchise Georgians.” When the Associated Press — which downloaded and printed out the list — showed it to the Georgia State Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler, she was horrified, pointing out, “If someone knows my birthdate, you could get in and pull up my information and change my registration.” This is nuts. Vice President Kamala Harris has promised that if she’s elected president and gets a Democratic House and Senate, the first piece of legislation she’ll sign will be the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will put an end to Kemp’s games in Georgia and similar Republican stunts across the nation. If you think it should be harder to take away your vote than your gun, double-check your voter registration (especially if you live in a Red state) and show up this fall!
