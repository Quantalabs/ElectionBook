I'm sorry - he's a slave,' Fishback began. \n\n'He is a slave to his donors. He is a slave to the corporate interests, to the tech bros that want to turn our state into his own words, a financial capital.' \n\nHis remarks quickly caught attention online, where some critics slammed the 30-year-old for employing racially charged language.\n\n'Byron Donalds has spent his life as a strong, black, conservative voice defending President Trump and the America First Agenda, so he is used to and unfazed by racist Twitter trolls who attack him for that,' Ryan Smith, a spokesman for Donalds' campaign, told the Daily Mail in a statement. \n\nIn a statement given to the Daily Mail, Fishback tripled down on his attack: 'If Byron Donalds doesn't want to be called a slave, then he should stop being a slave to his corporate donors.'\n\n'He’s taken $30 million in corporate money, which has compromised his judgment,' he continued. \n\nFishback, who has posted over half a dozen times on social media calling Donalds a slave, is now drawing backlash from conservatives, including the conspiratorially minded who see him as a distraction.\n\n'Fishback is a chaos agent most likely in the race to peel votes from a serious challenge to Byron Donalds,' lamented Florida-based John Cardillo. \n\n'I’d advise against calling the Trump endorsed, black GOP Congressman running for Governor of Florida a “slave,\"' conservative pundit Laura Loomer wrote on X. \n\nFishback later responded to her, doubling down and once again referring to the congressman as a slave. \n\nDespite his provocative, seemingly veiled racial attacks, Donalds is currently seen as the frontrunner in the race. \n\nA new poll from American Promise shows that 43 percent of likely GOP voters back Donalds, while all other Republican candidates, including Fishback, failed to surpass even two percent support. \n\nThe congressman also has the much-coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump. \n\nThough that may not concern Fishback, who has positioned himself as the heir to Governor Ron DeSantis' dynasty. \n\nThe 30-year-old investment firm CEO wrote in his announcement video that he wants to carry on DeSantis' legacy and keep DEI out of the Sunshine State while clamping down on H1-B foreign worker visas. \n\nHe also wants to abolish property taxes, a major DeSantis priority, and cancel AI data centers. \n\n'I’ll fight to preserve Governor DeSantis’ wins by keeping Florida free from DEI, radical transgenderism, Soros-backed prosecutors, child predators, voter fraud and the millions of illegals that invaded our country on Kamala Harris’ watch,' the 30-year-old candidate said. \n\nDonalds, meanwhile, has been endorsed by President Donald Trump and is seen as the mainstream MAGA candidate in the competition.\n\nDeSantis has yet to endorse a candidate in the race, though it is an open question whether he would back Donalds, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential contest over the Florida governor.","summary":"An insurgent candidate for Florida governor has come out swinging, launching a seemingly racially charged epithet against black Republican candidate Byron Donalds.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15326095/florida-republicans-battle-racist-slur-byron-donalds.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/25/22/104187295-0-image-m-54_1764108400006.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 22:46:26","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":382219234,"title":"BBC chair admits broadcaster took too long to address Trump documentary editing scandal","text":"British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Chair Samir Shah on Monday admitted the broadcaster took too long to address the controversial documentary that President Donald Trump has called \"false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory.\" Shah was grilled by the United Kingdom’s Culture, Media & Sport Committee, which held a hearing questioning the BBC’s leadership as the news organization has come under intense scrutiny over a documentary about Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Critics claim the documentary was misleading because it omitted Trump's call for supporters to protest peacefully, and the president has suggested a multibillion-dollar lawsuit is looming. The BBC \"Panorama\" documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance?\" omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, creating the impression that he was calling for violence. TRUMP PLANNING LAWSUIT OF UP TO $5 BILLION AGAINST BBC OVER EDITED JAN 6 SPEECH DOCUMENTARY \"I’d like to take this opportunity, first of all, to apologize, to all the people who believe in the BBC, care for it, and wish for it to survive and thrive,\" Shah said to begin his remarks before the committee. \"I regret the mistakes that have been made and the impact that it’s had,\" Shah said. Trump's legal team issued the BBC a legal threat, demanding a full retraction and an apology as well as financial compensation. The broadcaster did issue an apology and said it had \"no plans\" to re-air the documentary but stopped short of fulfilling Trump’s demands and insisted there was no basis for the defamation claim. Shah said that executives, including now-former BBC News CEO Deborah Turness, wanted to publicly apologize for the documentary sooner, but he didn’t think their plan was sufficient. \"I heard the news wanted to apologize for the splicing of the edit… I thought that a necessary thing to do but wasn’t sufficient,\" he said. BBC APOLOGIZES TO TRUMP AMID $1 BILLION LEGAL THREAT \"I think the real issue here was the impression left that President Trump, in the 6th of January speech, had encouraged, called for violent actions,\" Shah continued. \"What we had to apologize for was that, as well as the splicing of the edit.\" Shah said editing interviews is \"normal journalistic practice,\" and therefore a simple edit was not the problem. \"The problem was the impression that it led, an impression that President Trump had called for direct violent action and that wasn’t the case. That is what I thought needed to be apologized for,\" Shah said. He was then asked why it took so long to apologize, as the BBC board met about the debacle in May but didn’t apologize to Trump until November. \"Looking back, I think we should have made the decision earlier,\" Shah said. \"We should have pursued it to the end and got to the bottom of it,\" he continued. \"And not wait as we did until it became public discourse.\" BBC CHAIR TELLS STAFFERS IT'S DETERMINED TO FIGHT TRUMP LAWSUIT OFF, NO BASIS FOR DEFAMATION CLAIM Trump’s legal team has continued to say the documentary defamed President Trump. \"The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election. President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception, and fake news,\" a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital. The controversy began with a bombshell report from The Telegraph that featured excerpts from a whistleblower dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, a communications advisor hired by the BBC to review its editorial standards. The dossier led to the resignations of Turness and BBC Director-General Tim Davie. Prescott was also present for the hearing and insisted he sounded the alarm out of \"love\" for the British broadcaster. \"At the most fundamental level, I wrote that memo, and let me be clear, because I am a strong supporter of the BBC. The BBC employs talented professionals… and most people in this country, certainly myself included, might go as far to say that they love the BBC,\" Prescott said.

Over the weekend, Elon Musk’s X revealed the location of every account on the site, and the results were eye-opening. Viral MAGA influencers ranting about “my tax dollars” funding foreign wars were exposed as Pakistani or Russian. Thirst traps of attractive Israeli soldiers turned out to be run by Indians. Heartbreaking stories of Gazan suffering were found to be posted from Europe. And many overtly racist accounts championing Nick Fuentes, the young white supremacist and Hitler aficionado, were revealed to be foreign-run. This discovery led some to suggest that anti-Semitism on the app was in fact an inauthentic intrusion into the American debate with little organic appeal.\n\n“Groypers are in shambles right now,” crowed Eyal Yakoby, a student activist who once testified before Congress about anti-Semitism on college campuses, referring to the supporters of Fuentes. “It’s all a foreign psyop,” he added. “Liberals point to these accounts and say, ‘See, here’s the evidence that Trump’s base, the MAGA movement, is racist and anti-Semitic to its core,’” the libertarian journalist Robby Soave wrote. “Well, guess what? A substantial number of them are based in the Middle East—Pakistan in particular. They’re not MAGA or America First. They’re cosplaying as America First in order to discredit MAGA.”\n\nThe notion that American anti-Semitism is an outside influence operation rather than a homegrown menace is a comforting story. Unfortunately, it’s not true. Fuentes followers punch above their weight in American discourse because they are young and disproportionately online; some foreigners no doubt found this far-right niche useful for generating engagement and revenue. But the rise of American anti-Semitism is not a foreign phenomenon, and it is not an online illusion.\n\nLast year, David Shor, a data scientist who did polling for Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, surveyed nearly 130,000 voters and found that a quarter of young people had an “unfavorable opinion” of Jews—not Israel, Jews—far more than their elders. Today, some of the top podcasts in the country regularly feature overtly anti-Semitic conspiracy content, whether it’s Tucker Carlson rehabilitating Hitler, Candace Owens claiming that Israel had a hand in the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Charlie Kirk, or Joe Rogan hosting a conspiracy theorist who fulminated about how a “giant group of Jewish billionaires is running a sex-trafficking operation targeting American politicians and business people.”\n\nAnd it’s not just words. When far-right activists, including a college student named Nick Fuentes, marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 and chanted “Jews will not replace us,” that wasn’t a foreign psyop. When a white supremacist animated by that same fear—that conniving Jews were replacing the white race through mass migration—massacred worshippers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, he wasn’t taking cues from abroad. Neither were the Black nationalists who shot up a Jersey City kosher supermarket in 2019, nor the anti-Israel assassins this past year who attempted to incinerate Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and murdered three people, including a young Jewish woman allegedly shot in the back in Washington, D.C., and an 82-year-old burned to death in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThe reasons for this anti-Jewish eruption are manifold. Holocaust memory has attenuated with the passing of older generations. Outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza has led some self-styled Palestinian partisans to perpetrate or justify attacks on Jews thousands of miles away. Social-media platforms lowered the barriers to spreading anti-Semitic invective, allowing bigots to find and amplify one another more easily. Algorithms often privilege novel inflammatory content—including conspiracy theories—over careful, factual reporting. Sites such as X no longer pretend to moderate this material, not that they ever did much to impede it in the first place.\n\nThe upshot is this: Whether anti-Semitic content comes from America or abroad, the supply is simply rising to meet demand. Viral Groyper content only goes viral in the first place because it appeals to Americans who share the sentiment. Outside spending and propaganda cannot manufacture what isn’t already there.\n\nConsider an analogy: In 2022, the Democratic Party spent millions to boost pro–Donald Trump primary candidates who denied the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The strategy succeeded—many of these extreme candidates won their primary, only to be defeated by Democrats in the general election. Some Republicans groused about Democrats interfering in their party’s processes to promote weaker contenders, but the complaints were copes—a way to avoid blaming their own voters. After all, the Democrats didn’t lie to Republican voters about the election deniers. They simply hyped up extreme candidates—and the GOP-primary electorate liked what it heard. Foreign Groyper accounts, like those election-denying candidates, are merely marketing lies that many people are already predisposed to accept.\n\nTo be clear, astroturfed campaigns can and do distort discourse and stoke conflict. For the online marketplace of ideas to function, users need to know what’s authentic and what’s inauthentic, what’s foreign and what’s domestic. X’s location update was a small but salutary step in that direction. But no one should fool themselves into thinking that American pathologies—including anti-Semitism—are primarily paid propaganda. Foreign actors may exploit our divisions, but they don’t create them. They can fan the flames, but they didn’t start the fire. We did that ourselves—and we will have to put it out.","summary":"Rising American anti-Semitism isn’t a foreign influence operation.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/online-antisemitism-groyper-problem-foreign-accounts/685064/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/L7BE9_aP8raNvJ1g2xAoRVjxsMQ=/0x0:3859x2171/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/11/2025_11_25_Foreign_Groyper_Accounts_On_X_Are_An_American_Problem/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 21:50:16","author":"Yair Rosenberg","authors":["Yair Rosenberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.249},{"id":382215928,"title":"Duggan won’t say if Trump’s execution threats go too far","text":"Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan had an opportunity this weekend to say whether he thinks President Donald Trump’s threats of jailing and executing political opponents has gone too far. \n\nAppearing on WXYZ’s Spotlight on the News over the weekend, Duggan, who is running for governor as an independent, was asked about Trump accusing Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, of “seditious behavior.” Trump suggested their actions could be “punishable by DEATH” after they released a video reminding military members they can refuse illegal orders.\n\nInstead of answering, Duggan dodged the question, as he often has when asked about Trump’s dangerous behavior and policies. \n\n“I’ve stayed out of these national debates,” Duggan said. “I’m not going to get involved in the national debate.”\n\nHost Chuck Stokes quickly moved on, promising to come back with “some more positive things.” \n\nThe exchange has become all too common in the local media. Rather than press Duggan on his position, Stokes let the mayor dodge a question that is important for many voters as they continue to ask: Who is Mike Duggan now and where does he stand on many issues? The former Democrat is trying to appeal to independents and Trump supporters, and he has refused to touch controversial issues. \n\nAsked why Duggan wouldn’t respond to Stokes, campaign spokesperson Andrea Bitley tells Metro Times that the mayor “answered the question clearly.”\n\n“He is running for state office, not federal office, and has made it his practice in this campaign to stick to state issues,” Bitley says.\n\nBut Trump’s rhetoric and policies have become state issues. Trump has ordered federal immigration raids that rely on state cooperation, pushed to deploy U.S. troops into American cities, and threatened to withhold funding to some states. His administration’s policies deal with everything from health care access and public safety to immigration enforcement.\n\nLast week, Trump’s dangerous rhetoric drew widespread condemnation, even from members of his own party. Slotkin reportedly received a bomb threat last week. \n\nSo far, Duggan isn’t willing to talk about it. \n\nIn posts on his Truth Social platform, Trump called Slotkin and five other Democratic lawmakers “traitors” and wrote that their video urging troops to refuse unlawful orders amounted to “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted a supporter’s call to “HANG THEM,” prompting a wave of threats against the lawmakers and forcing some to adopt 24/7 security. \n\nOn Tuesday, Slotkin said the FBI has signaled it has opened what appears to be an investigation into her and others who released the video.\n\nSlotkin, appearing on ABC’s This Week, called Trump’s language “a tool of fear” and said the goal was to intimidate critics and distract from other damaging news.\n\nEven some Republicans denounced Trump. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said calling opponents “traitors” and threatening the death penalty was “reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible” and warned it could inspire unstable people to commit violence. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a longtime Trump ally and Republican from South Carolina, called the president’s comments “over the top.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Michael McCaul told ABC he didn’t “speak for the president in terms of hanging members of Congress” and urged everyone to “tone down the rhetoric.”\n\nWhile some Republicans who support Trump were willing to say his threats crossed a line, Duggan has chosen to remain silent.\n\nInstead, he touts his ability to “bring Democrats and Republicans together.”\n\nHere’s the exchange on WXYZ:\n\nStokes: “We now have a controversy with the president now about sedition and making charges against Democratic politicians, one of our own Senator Slotkin … that it could lead to sedition and could lead to hangings and shooting politicians.”\n\nDuggan: “Yeah, so the reason that we have been successful is, I’m the mayor of Detroit, and I am dealing with issues that relate to Detroiters. I’ve stayed out of these national debates, and I think Detroit has done extremely well by paying attention to what we’re doing in the city, and so I’m not going to get involved in the national debate.”\n\nStokes didn’t press him. There was no follow-up or questions about whether Duggan thought threatening lawmakers with death was wrong. \n\nThat has become a pattern in Duggan’s 2026 governor’s race. He casts himself as a post-partisan problem-solver while dodging questions about Trump’s most extreme actions and rhetoric, even when the target is a fellow Michigan officeholder.\n\nDuggan’s silence stands in stark contrast to the mayor that Detroiters have seen for most of the last decade.\n\nFor nearly 40 years in public life, Duggan said he was a proud Democrat. He campaigned for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he mocked Trump’s many bankruptcies and called him “the most phony party nominee” he’d ever seen. When Trump falsely claimed voter fraud in Detroit in 2020, Duggan called the allegations “utter nonsense” and “a real threat to everything we believe in … that everybody’s vote counts the same.”\n\nHe praised Biden and Harris as “real partners” who helped Detroit recover and said “the best thing that happened in Detroit was when Donald Trump left office.”\n\nNow, Duggan insists he hasn’t changed his views “on any issue,” just his party label.\n\n“I haven’t changed any positions, other than that I think the toxic relationship between the two parties is badly damaging the state and we need a different approach to get Republicans and Democrats to work together,” Duggan told conservative Detroit News columnist Nolan Finley this summer.\n\nBut his public posture has shifted. He’s far more likely these days to attack Democrats than Trump or Republicans, accusing his former party of caring only about hating the GOP and Trump and claiming “people are fed up with this Democratic Party in Michigan.” On social media and in TV interviews, he repeatedly says both parties are broken, and he is above partisan bickering.“I don’t answer to party bosses. I answer to you,” Duggan’s campaign page tweeted last week. \n\nDuggan’s statements come as his campaign relies heavily on a coalition of Republican donors and Trump supporters. As Metro Times previously reported, Duggan is raising millions of dollars from the Republican establishment and Trump megadonors, such as billionaire Roger Penske, former Michigan GOP chair Ron Weiser, charter school mogul J.C. Huizenga, and other heavyweights who have poured money into Trump, the GOP, and conservative causes for years. Many have given Duggan the maximum contribution, and family members and business associates have also donated. \n\nIn October, a Duggan fundraiser was co-hosted by controversial millionaire Anthony Soave, who donated $100,000 to a Donald Trump political action committee and has been linked to multiple corruption scandals involving city contracts.\n\nDuggan’s team openly boasts that he’s “pulling unprecedented support from Democrats and Republicans,” citing polling that shows him closing in on Democrat Jocelyn Benson and Republican John James in a three-way race. If the election were held today, a recent internal survey from Duggan’s campaign suggested he would garner 26%, while Benson would get 30%, and James 29%. \n\nDuggan’s refusal to condemn Trump for threatening the lives of Slotkin and others is a sharp departure from his past criticism of the president. Either Duggan has changed his position on Trump, or he’s willing to tolerate the threats and bigotry of the administration. \n\nOne of them is political theater. \n\nIn ordinary times, dodging a question on a popular TV news show might not be a big deal. But the sitting president is telling the country that a Michigan senator and her colleagues are “traitors” whose actions are “punishable by DEATH,” while they report an alarming increase in threats.\n\nDuggan says he wants to leave the “us vs. them” politics behind him, but many voters also want to know whether a would-be governor believes it’s acceptable for a president to suggest that his critics are “traitors” who deserve death.\n\nDuggan chose to duck on live TV when given the chance to condemn Trump’s dangerous rhetoric.\n\nThe real question in this campaign may not be whether he’s a Democrat, Republican, or independent. It’s whether Michigan voters will accept a governor who won’t say where he stands when it really matters.","summary":"Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan had an opportunity this weekend to say whether he thinks President Donald Trump’s threats of jailing and executing political opponents has gone too far. \n\n\nThe post Duggan won’t say if Trump’s execution threats go too far appeared first on Detroit Metro Times.","url":"https://www.metrotimes.com/news/duggan-wont-say-if-trumps-execution-threats-go-too-far/","image":"https://www.metrotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54946424433_4c91e5ba6e_c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 21:30:59","author":"Steve Neavling","authors":["Steve Neavling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":382193694,"title":"Jennifer Lopez performs for Donald Trump Jr. and others at Indian billionaire’s wedding","text":"Jennifer Lopez has once again taken what must be a big paycheck to do a private concert for people with a lot of money. This time, it was an opulent three-day wedding in India, hosted by an Indian American billionaire on behalf of his daughter and her groom, a San Francisco-based tech entrepreneur.\n\nSeveral things have sparked controversy surrounding Lopez’s Friday concert for the wedding of Netra Mantena, daughter of pharmaceutical entrepreneur Rama Raju Mantena, and her groom, Vamsi Gadiraju, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe first is that one of the guests, for whom Lopez performed, was Donald Trump Jr. The socially and politically divisive son of President Donald Trump joined A-list Bollywood stars and other uber-wealthy people at the wedding spectacle, which showcased luxury and grandeur in iconic locations across the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur in Western India, reports sid. The location, which was featured in the 1983 James Bond film “Octopussy,” incidentally gave the wedding its 007 theme, according to the Daily Mail. Trump Jr.’s date for the wedding was Bettina Anderson, the Palm Beach socialite he reportedly left fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle to be with.\n\nLopez’s fans have taken issue with the gossip site TMZ blasting news about her performance at the wedding with a sub-headline that said she “performed for Trump Jr.” These fans seem to know it’s not a good look for Lopez to be seen socializing with a Trump family member, given that she endorsed the president’s three opponents, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, in their respective elections in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Lopez also performed “American the Beautiful” at Biden’s January 2021 inauguration — two weeks after Trump Jr. joined his father in denying the results of the 2020 election at a rally of supporters ahead of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMultiple people on X admonished TMZ for its sub-headline, with one saying, “You mean (to say) Jennifer Lopez performed as a paid performer at the billionaire couple’s wedding, where Trump’s son happened to be one of the many guests. The insinuation that J.Lo has anything to do with any Trump family member is misleading.”\n\nSeveral people also said, “Trump Jr. just happened to be there,” and “She is not responsible for who was invited.”\n\nBut others said people were offering “excuses” for Lopez, who suggested she said was doing the gig “for the money” she doesn’t said. One person said, “My question is, did she know he was going to be there ? If not, can’t blame her. If she did know, well (add) another name to my D.E.I. list ‘Don’t Engage Ignorance.'”\n\nThe Daily Mail’s report mentioned another potential controversy: Reports in the Indian media that the wedding spectacle, which reportedly cost $6.7 million, has come under fire for being “a sheer wastage of money.” In addition, the Daily Mail focused on Lopez performing some of her hit songs in a series of “skimpy” outfits, including a semi-sheer black bodysuit with a G-string backside.\n\nLopez previously faced backlash in 2013, after she traveled to Turkmenistan to perform for a private concert. Vanity Fair reported that Lopez was paid from $1 million to $1.5 million to sing three songs for guests who included Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, the former president of Turkmenistan, whom the Wall Street Journal dubbed a “dictator.”\n\nCritics accused Berdimuhamedow of human rights violations, prompting an outcry over Lopez’s decision to serenade him with “Happy Birthday” during the performance. Her representative later issued a statement, explaining that the event was not sponsored by Turkmenistan’s government and saying she would not have attended if she had known about the human rights issues, E! News said.\n\nWhatever backlash that Lopez might face for performing at the wedding in India — while Trump Jr. “happened to be there” — the president’s oldest son appeared to have a wonderful time with Anderson. Trump Jr. and Anderson “looked more in love than ever as they laughed and smiled during the festivities,” the Daily Mail reported. “They couldn’t keep their hands off each other throughout most of the nuptials, with Bettina throwing her arms around a grinning Don Jr at one point.”\n\nThe Daily Mail said that MAGA insiders recently said that Trump Jr. and Anderson are considering marriage, with one saying: “Don is in love with Bettina.

On November 17, 26-year old Bethany MaGee was riding Chicago's Blue Line L train when 50-year-old Lawrence Reed — a serial offender with 72 prior arrests — allegedly doused her in gasoline and lit her on fire, reportedly shouting, “Burn alive, bitch.”\n\nAlthough MaGee escaped from the train, she now remains in critical condition, hospitalized in a burn unit with severe injuries covering approximately 60% of her body.\n\nReed was arrested the following day and charged with a federal terrorism offense.\n\n“So, he could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted, which, like, let’s do that, okay? Let’s just do that,” says BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales, who’s nauseated at the extensive leniency Reed was shown by Chicago’s justice system over decades, despite his staggering criminal record, which includes multiple felony convictions for violent crimes.\n\nBack in August this year, Reed was hit with an aggravated battery charge for assaulting a social worker in a hospital, but Cook County Judge Teresa Molina-Gonzalez overruled prosecutors’ pleas for detention and freed him on electronic monitoring, ignoring the fact that he had a history of felony aggravated arson convictions for setting occupied buildings on fire, plus scores of violent battery and assault cases.\n\nAccording to court transcripts, Molina-Gonzalez stated, “I can’t keep everybody in jail because the state’s attorney wants me to.”\n\nFurther, a resurfaced video clip from a Hispanic Heritage Month interview shows Molina-Gonzalez stating: “You know, being a Latina in the office, people would tell me, like, ‘Don’t you feel like you’re prosecuting your own people?’ But it’s true, there are a lot of defendants that look like me. However, I had a chance as a prosecutor to make a difference as to what cases come in. I had a chance as a prosecutor to decide what offers were appropriate.”\n\nIn the same video, Molina-Gonzalez also admits that she “always [offers] them the opportunity to do community service.”\n\nIn other words, Sara explains, Judge Molina-Gonzalez isn’t committed to justice; she’s committed to DEI. “The problem is that these law schools are producing people like Kamala Harris and Ketanji Brown Jackson and Fani Willis and this dumbass judge.”\n\n“The fact that [Molina-Gonzalez] was able to go through law school, was able to pass all the tests, was able to get to her position, and still think that it is her place to be offering up what she thinks the offender will like best is insane,” Sara adds.\n\nWhen blue-city judges prioritize perpetrators above victims, they think they’re exercising restorative justice, but all they’re doing is creating career criminals that wreak havoc on innocent civilians — people like Iryna Zarutska, Logan Federico, and now Bethany MaGee.\n\nJudge Molina-Gonzales, Sara says, is exactly “why President Trump is bringing in the National Guard into these s***hole cities.”\n\nTo hear more of Sara’s scathing commentary, watch the episode above.\n\nWant more from Sara Gonzales?\n\nTo enjoy more of Sara's no-holds-barred takes on news and culture, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/sara-gonzales-unfiltered/burn-alive-offender-with-72-prior-arrests-set-free-by-dei-obsessed-judge-then-allegedly-sets-woman-on-fire","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62238128&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 21:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":382230716,"title":"Senator Mark Kelly Is in the Wrong Job","text":"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth apparently thinks that Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona is in the wrong job. Kelly was one of six Democratic legislators who released a video reminding the officers and enlisted people of the U.S. military that they are bound by their oaths to disobey illegal orders. Now Hegseth wants to recall Kelly, a decorated combat veteran and former astronaut, back to active duty in the Navy so that Kelly can be court-martialed for what Hegseth sees as riling up the troops against the commander in chief.\n\nHegseth has a point: Maybe Kelly shouldn’t be in Congress. But the secretary is wrong about putting the senator back in the naval service. In a more sensible and serious world (and, yes, I know this is not the one we live in right now), Hegseth would be fired—and Kelly would take Hegseth’s job as secretary of defense.\n\nKelly is at least as qualified to lead the Pentagon as other recent appointees, and would probably be an easy addition to any future Democratic administration’s shopping list for senior defense or national-security roles. (He was also shortlisted to be Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024.) A Navy pilot, Kelly flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm. He has a uniform heavy with awards, including medals with the combat “V,” a special addition that denotes valor and heroism. After the senator posted a picture of those medals yesterday on social media, Hegseth, one of the most eager and petty trolls in an administration full of them, immediately took to social media and claimed that they were in the wrong order. He also warned “Captain” Kelly—putting Kelly’s rank in scare quotes—that he will have to submit to a uniform inspection once he’s recalled.\n\nAfter his combat service, Kelly joined the astronaut corps, and piloted or commanded multiple Space Shuttle missions. (His twin brother, Scott, also became an astronaut.) In 2011, he retired—not to kick back and get rich, but to help his wife, the former member of Congress Gabby Giffords, who had been nearly killed in a shooting earlier that year.\n\nKelly’s had some business ventures, but he’s a bit light on management experience. Still, he’d be a far better choice than Hegseth, who is now vying to snag the never-coveted title of Worst Secretary of Defense in Modern American History.\n\nHegseth, for the moment, is in no danger of taking the crown from Robert McNamara, a brilliant man who nonetheless kept sending American boys to Vietnam even when he knew the war was lost. The day is young, however, and Trump seems determined to start a war in Latin America that could offer Hegseth the opportunity to give McNamara a run for his money.\n\nBut unlike Hegseth, McNamara also did some good during the frostiest days of the Cold War, including modernizing Pentagon procedures and updating American nuclear strategy. So did other flawed secretaries: Melvin Laird created important new Defense Department institutions while privately (and ineffectively) opposing the expansion of the Vietnam War to Cambodia; Jim Schlesinger and Harold Brown did what they could to arrest the free fall of American power in the 1970s; Les Aspin tried, and failed, to kill national missile defenses; Donald Rumsfeld initiated post–Cold War reforms but stubbornly refused to think about the post–Gulf War administration of Iraq.\n\nEven James V. Forrestal, the first modern secretary of defense, was also better at his job—and he was fired in 1949 after a conflict with President Harry Truman and a nervous breakdown. (He killed himself later that year by jumping out of a window at Bethesda Naval Hospital.) Whatever his shortcomings, Forrestal was an honorable and hardworking public servant, which is why a building in Washington, D.C., and an aircraft carrier were both named in his honor.\n\nAll of these secretaries were competent men with records of achievement before coming to the Pentagon. They were professionals and patriots who cared about the security of the United States and the people who served in uniform. Hegseth, by comparison, is a dude-bro sporting some questionable tattoos, a creation of television who’s acting as if he won The Apprentice: The Nuclear-Weapons Season. He seems to believe that his job is hectoring young men about being fat and forcing Black men out of the military for having beards. He has no understanding of national strategy, and no real experience managing anything.\n\nNor is he a man who can serve as a model for his organization. Hegseth wants to recall Kelly so that he can level charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice against him, but when Hegseth was a serving officer, he could have faced the UCMJ himself: By his own admission, he was an adulterer with an alcohol problem. (Apparently, military justice for thee and not for me is the new rule in Hegseth’s Pentagon.) His tenure so far has featured a series of appalling security lapses and janky public performances that call into question not only his character but his emotional stability.\n\nThe Trump White House knows that Hegseth is nothing like Forrestal, or Aspin, or even Rumsfeld, for that matter, and that he is unqualified to do anything but push-ups. This realization is probably why Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll, and not the actual head of the Pentagon, is the person meeting with the Russians in Geneva trying to stop the biggest war in Europe since 1945. Trump seems to like Hegseth, but the administration also seems to be taking care not to let Hegseth near anything breakable or dangerous.\n\nOf course, Hegseth is still the secretary of defense, and thus the person who, in theory, must advise the president of the United States on the most dire issues of war and peace. He is also the official likely to be in the room and who would verify the orders if the commander in chief calls for the use of nuclear weapons. The idea that Hegseth would have to advise Trump in a moment of crisis is genuinely terrifying: The president is already showing increasing signs of panic and irrationality, and Hegseth is hardly the kind of stable or prudent aide one hopes would be nearby in times of danger.\n\nFor now, the White House seems content to let Hegseth preen and strut and yell, but the United States still needs an actual secretary of defense, and Pete Hegseth is completely unqualified for any position of public trust, elected or appointed, in the government of the United States.\n\nTrump should look around and choose one. He has plenty of options—including Mark Kelly.","summary":"He should be secretary of defense.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/mark-kelly-military-trump/685065/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/guCn8mOPEl-RLiUnfqqimpi1JiE=/0x0:6000x3375/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/11/2025_11_25_Mark_Kelly-1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 20:17:25","author":"Tom Nichols","authors":["Tom Nichols"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":382163450,"title":"The rise of resistance cinema in the era of Trump – Hartford Courant","text":"By Mark Leydorf, Bloomberg News\n\nA year ago, a passionate woman of color found her voice and took on an older, white carnival barker who was stoking bigotries to seize unchecked power.\n\nI’m not talking about Kamala Harris, but Elphaba Thropp from the box-office smash “Wicked.” The Democratic nominee for president was unable to defy gravity in the end, but over in Oz, the battle is still raging.

When we last saw Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) at the cliffhanger ending of “Wicked,” she was preparing for war. The not-so-Wicked Witch of the West is back in theaters this weekend, and she’s ready to rumble.\n\nWhen “Wicked: For Good” starts, though, she’s pretty down and out. The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) remains as Trumpy as ever, waging a vicious campaign to demonize and deport Oz’s animal citizens. Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), his PR manager, has stirred up propaganda to discredit our heroine, branding her as, well, it’s in the title. Meanwhile, Elphaba’s boy toy, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), and her bestie, Glinda (Ariana Grande), have accepted shiny new jobs in Oz: He’s now Captain of the Wizard’s Guard, and she’s been promoted to Glinda the Good, which basically involves floating over to Munchkinland in a nifty bubble to give pep talks.\n\nHiding out in the woods, the best Elphaba can do is an occasional guerrilla action, freeing the enslaved animals building the Yellow Brick Road. But those who saw “Wicked” — and that’s a lot of us; the film made more than $750 million worldwide, according to BoxOfficeMojo — know better than to count her out.\n\n“Wicked: For Good” is not, alas, that good. As fans of the Broadway musical on which it’s based know, all the best bits are in the first installment. And yet this brassy, candy-colored “Battle of Algiers” takes one of the clearest stands against authoritarianism and white supremacy you’ll find in theaters. It couldn’t be more timely.\n\nAccording to Gallup, people worldwide have more worry, stress, sadness and anger than they did a decade ago. Its recent surveys in the U.S. find that only 29% of Americans are satisfied with the direction their country is going, and they strongly dislike their leader: The only president to have had a lower average approval rating than Trump 2.0 (42%) so far was Trump 1.0 (41%). There’s a reason Republicans were routed in the off-year elections and 7 million people marched against the administration in the latest No Kings protest, on Oct. 18.\n\nFilmmakers the world over are stepping into the breach. Probably the most notable political movie this year is Paul Thomas Anderson’s raucous, violent takedown of America’s immigration policy: the excellent and polarizing “One Battle After Another.” The auteur’s latest epic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Teyana Taylor as scrappy activists facing off against a racist police state embodied by a villainous Sean Penn. The movie has made a tidy $200 million, and stands to rake in more if its director and stars take home Oscars as expected.\n\nThe taut if somewhat clichéd political thriller “A House of Dynamite” offers a more subtle critique of the government. (The movie’s box office was negligible; it barely paused in theaters before its producer, Netflix Inc., released it online.) By keeping her main actor — the president — off-camera until the conclusion of the film, director Kathryn Bigelow leaves his character, ethics and intellect a mystery. For most of the movie, we’re engaged in a thought experiment: What would happen if a rogue nuclear missile launched over the Pacific, and our president was, say, the current occupant of the White House?\n\n“The Mastermind” takes on the spread of shameless self-dealing. In this marvelously sly film from Kelly Reichardt, a clueless petty thief (Josh O’Connor from “Challengers”) gets tripped up in Vietnam War-era social unrest. You’d almost miss the connection to national politics, except that the director keeps deviously flashing Richard Nixon’s grim mug on the televisions in the background of many scenes. (The movie’s made only about $1.3 million, but that’s pretty good for the slow-cinema auteur.)\n\nWith headlines on Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and the Venezuelan boat bombings serving up stories of brutal aggression almost daily, it’s a great time to revisit “Nuremberg.” James Vanderbilt’s polished movie about the precedent-setting trials at the end of World War II isn’t great — Russell Crowe is terrific as Hermann Göring, but Rami Malek is painfully hammy as the shrink tasked with figuring him out — but it did manage a respectable $9 million in its first week.\n\nThe list goes on: “Eddington,” “Bugonia,” “Sirāt” — there’s a reason directors are digging into stories of conflict, paranoia and cataclysm. Taken together, these films, most of which were conceived and went into production during Donald Trump’s interregnum, between the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, and MAGA’s triumphant return to power, have coalesced into a troop of cinematic resistance amid the conflicts and crises defining his political era and the rightward, nationalistic turns happening broadly around the globe.\n\nAnd lest you think this is a strictly art-house phenomenon, edgy political fare has made it to the megaplex too. In his blockbuster “Sinners,” a gorgeous revenge fantasy worthy of Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler took a broader view of America’s problems. This big-budget horror film, which raked in $368 million, imagined a pair of Black brothers in 1932 facing off against the vampires (actual vampires, in this case) of white supremacy.\n\nJames Gunn took on the destructive influence of the world’s billionaires with his loopy, overstuffed “Superman,” which made $617 million this summer. Its villain, the erstwhile Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), will sound familiar: He’s a megalomaniac inventor manipulating a corrupt federal government. Along the way, the movie also looks at xenophobia, foreign misadventures and online disinformation — no wonder our critic called it a pro-immigration, anti-Trump blockbuster.\n\n“Superman” is also mordantly funny in places, but then, contemporary politics have taken a darkly comic turn. Did you ever imagine a president would post an AI video showing him dumping excrement on protesters, say, or take a wrecking ball to the East Wing of the White House without warning? No film this year leaned harder into the almost cartoonish nihilism in Washington than the sci-fi satire “Mickey 17.” Its villains, an interstellar CEO (Mark Ruffalo) and his wife (Toni Collette), were so on-the-nose, the movie was hard to watch. That may explain why the March release, from “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho, didn’t break even with its modest $133 million haul.\n\nHollywood, of course, has a famously liberal bias; and the best of the year’s resistance films will romp during awards season even if they weren’t box-office juggernauts. Certainly there have been other recent films about less charged topics: “Sentimental Value,” “Hamnet” and “Frankenstein” are three acclaimed movies that don’t get anywhere near contemporary politics (they describe more intimate family struggles) and ought to win their share of awards. But more and more filmmakers are responding to the urgency of world events with movies that have an urgent, starkly political point of view.\n\nFor my money, the two must-see political films this year are Kleber Mendonça Filho’s “The Secret Agent” (in theaters Nov. 26), about a man on the run from Brazil’s military regime in the 1970s, and “It Was Just an Accident,” shot in secret in Tehran by Jafar Panahi. They stand out partly because they don’t take on the corrupt regimes directly. No generals or mullahs appear in these films. They’re focused instead on how we ourselves change living under authoritarian systems.\n\n“Accident” is especially devastating. Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), who spent time in jail, abducts Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), whom he suspects tortured him there. Vahid can’t be 100% sure he’s got the right guy — he was blindfolded in prison — so he searches for other victims to corroborate the man’s ID and help him decide how to repay him. What does justice look like in such a world? What do we ourselves begin to look like?\n\nFrom the Yellow Brick Road to a dusty highway outside Tehran, something is going on. As corporations, universities and news media are criticized for cowering in fear, filmmakers are getting more emboldened. Their movies share the same insistent message: Wake up, world.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

May as well ride those out by shining a spotlight on the crank Democrats chose to run in the R+10 congressional district.\n\nSo far, Aftyn Behn has made quite a name for herself as the Democrat nominee. The state legislator has had to fend off a cornucopia of unearthed statements, tweets, and videos from the past few years that paint her, as David wrote earlier, as something of a sociopath. That might have been a bonus for a political career, had it been married to an intellect that could take advantage of an utter lack of conscience. However, Behn has come across as someone who acts less out of intellect and more from regurgitation of progressive clichés woven into word salads that would make Kamala Harris jealous enough to run through an entire box of wine.\n\nFrankly, this statement from 2020 about \"birthers\" and unionization needs all the alcohol it can get, emphasis mine:\n\n2020 video of Tennessee State Rep. Aftyn Behn resurfaces:\"I think we have as birthers... men and women who can give birth... we can maybe leverage that as collective bargaining.\"pic.twitter.com/9fpfPUsMib— Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) November 25, 2025\n\nBEHN: I think, as an organizer and as an activist, like, we really have an opportunity here in this country to talk about what kind of policy – progressive policies we want to see as young women. And I think we have, as birthers, as women who can give birth, men and women who can give birth, we can maybe leverage that as collective bargaining. That is the basis of this book that I'm not – I've just started reading called Birthstrike, and how we can really leverage collective bargaining when it comes to having children in this country. And so, for example, like, I'm not going to give birth until the United States government concedes A, B, C, D. What do you think about that?Q: Hmmm. Seems a little much.BEHN: Really?\n\nHow much insanity can one politician pack into 45 seconds of conversation? Let us count the cray-crays. First off, does Behn understand that the term \"birthers\" means something else politically in the US? Does she really want to associate herself with that?\n\nSecond: men cannot give birth. Let me state that one more time, with feeling: men cannot give birth. Females give birth. It doesn't get much more basic in biology than this fact. It does not matter what feelings men and women have; biology dictates reproductive function. If Behn doesn't know that, she's too ignorant for public office. If she does know that, then she's too interested in pandering to progressive activists to represent the voters of TN-07, who are primarily social conservatives, except for a small portion of Nashville added to the district in the 2020 redistricting.\n\nAnd we all know how Behn feels about Nashville. \n\nNext: Who in their right mind would think that the collective fertility of a league of extraordinary birthing gentlemen would have leverage over \"the United States government\"? We have a Congress to set policy, as well as a president elected by the states. That's the position Behn wants now, in fact, and that is how constitutional republics work, not through social-justice extortion. Despite Behn's inflated sense of self – part of the sociopathy David notes – no one really cares whether hyperventilating radicals procreate. In fact, a strike on the fertility front by the hard Left might provide some benefits. \n\nSpeaking of hyperventilation, the 2019 book Birth Strike focuses on using fertility for leverage over \"the hidden fight over women's work.\" That certainly seems to be at odds with Behn's weird inclusion of men as \"birthers,\" given the blurb on Amazon. However, the broader \"birthstrike\" movement is actually a climate-change protest strategy, which emerged before the book got published:\n\nPepino believes that there will be an “ecological Armageddon” and founded BirthStrike at the end of 2018. BirthStrike is a group of people who are declaring their decision not to have kids because of “the severity of the ecological crisis.” ...The BirthStrikers have decided they can’t bring children into a world facing an ecological breakdown, and where scientists predict climate change will bring bigger wildfires, more droughts, and food shortages for millions of people.In 2018, the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the planet only has 11 years to prevent catastrophic climate change.“You are gambling with someone else’s life,” said Cody Harrison, a 29-year-old who recently joined the group. “If things don’t go well, that human is not going to have a very good life.”“When climate change gets worse, it multiplies other things. It’s like dominoes that are falling,” said Lori Day, another member of BirthStrike. “It goes beyond sea level rise and storms. It affects food production, migration, resources and war.”BirthStrike is one of a number of groups around the world that are questioning the ethics of having children in a warming world. Conceivable Future, a network of women in America, was founded in 2015 to bring awareness to “the threat climate change poses to reproductive justice,” although that group’s members haven’t discounted having children.\n\nThis is the same Malthusian obsession that has gripped the Left since the publication of The Population Bomb in 1968. The Smithsonian's magazine revisited Paul Ehrlich's book fifty years later, just as the Birthstrike movement began. The review recalled the book's hyperbolic predictions, and worse yet, how it drove \"human rights abuses around the world\":\n\nDriving the criticism of The Population Bomb were its arresting, graphic descriptions of the potential consequences of overpopulation: famine, pollution, social and ecological collapse. Ehrlich says he saw these as “scenarios,” illustrations of possible outcomes, and he expresses frustration that they are instead “continually quoted as predictions”—as stark inevitabilities. If he had the ability to go back in time, he said, he would not put them in the book.It is true that in the book Ehrlich exhorted readers to remember that his scenarios “are just possibilities, not predictions.” But it is also true that he slipped into the language of prediction occasionally in the book, and more often in other settings. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” he promised in a 1969 magazine article. “Sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come,” Ehrlich told CBS News a year later. “And by ‘the end’ I mean an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.”Such statements contributed to a wave of population alarm then sweeping the world. The International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Population Council, the World Bank, the United Nations Population Fund, the Hugh Moore-backed Association for Voluntary Sterilization and other organizations promoted and funded programs to reduce fertility in poor places. “The results were horrific,” says Betsy Hartmann, author of Reproductive Rights and Wrongs, a classic 1987 exposé of the anti-population crusade. Some population-control programs pressured women to use only certain officially mandated contraceptives. In Egypt, Tunisia, Pakistan, South Korea and Taiwan, health workers’ salaries were, in a system that invited abuse, dictated by the number of IUDs they inserted into women. In the Philippines, birth-control pills were literally pitched out of helicopters hovering over remote villages. Millions of people were sterilized, often coercively, sometimes illegally, frequently in unsafe conditions, in Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In the 1970s and ’80s, India, led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay, embraced policies that in many states required sterilization for men and women to obtain water, electricity, ration cards, medical care and pay raises. Teachers could expel students from school if their parents weren’t sterilized. More than eight million men and women were sterilized in 1975 alone. (“At long last,” World Bank head Robert McNamara remarked, “India is moving to effectively address its population problem.”) For its part, China adopted a “one-child” policy that led to huge numbers—possibly 100 million—of coerced abortions, often in poor conditions contributing to infection, sterility and even death. Millions of forced sterilizations occurred.\n\nBehn's not just an idiot. She's not just a potential sociopath. She's a dangerous crank, if a mildly entertaining one. Republicans need to turn out in TN-07 hard to keep this seat out of the hands of a radical nut.

Jennings asserted on the podcast that Republicans’ arguments for supporting Harris were an effort to “liberalize” conservatism rather than preserve it. (RELATED: Billionaires Bankrolling Kamala Harris’ Tough-On-Crime Campaign Wanted To Defund Police, Install Soros Prosecutors)\n\n“During the 2024 campaign, I kept hearing these Republicans say things like, ‘In order to save conservatism, we have to vote for Kamala Harris.’ And as someone who had to sit out there and debate these issues every night, I could never sort of figure out why they were saying that, what they meant by that,” Jennings said. “And then I started to think about the underlying arguments they were making, the other statements they were making, and I realized that they weren’t trying to save conservatism. They were trying to liberalize it.”\n\n“A lot of these people no longer vote for any Republican. A lot of these people no longer are pro-life. A lot of these people no longer really believe in any of the conservative stuff that we have all supposedly been fighting for for the last 25 years,” he continued. “They let their personality conflicts or problems with Donald Trump completely and totally change what they claim to be fighting for. Heck, look around.”\n\nJennings particularly called out former George W. Bush administration official Nicolle Wallace, who currently is an anchor on MS NOW. She called herself a “self-loathing former Republican” during a 2021 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n\n“We relied upon her for communications advice in the Bush White House. Now, this is somebody who built their career supposedly communicating with the American people about George W. Bush’s conservative agenda,” he said. “And now she is one of the most deranged looney tunes in American media … Did you ever believe any of it? … Bush was a conservative guy.”\n\nJennings also turned his ire on “The Bulwark Podcast” host and MS NOW analyst Tim Miller. Miller announced his departure from the Republican Party in a 2020 Substack piece after being a GOP operative, including on former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n“Tim Miller, this other looney tunes. He was supposedly a Republican operative. Now, he is one of the most liberal people in our political affairs ecosystem,” he said. “Did you ever believe any of it? And what is it about Donald Trump that made you change every single thing that you supposedly ever believed in? And I just, I don’t understand how one person could break so many supposedly smart and experienced people.”\n\n“And to this day, I still do not understand people who claim to be Republicans running around having voted for Democrats in each of the last three elections, having advocated for Democrats to win the Senate, having advocated for Democrats to win the House, having advocated for pro-abortion policies, having advocated for every liberal social crusade, and then look me in the eye and say, ‘You’re hurting conservatism by supporting Donald Trump.’ F all the way off,” he added.\n\nWhen host Emily Jashinsky laughed about Jennings’ criticism of Miller, he added more.\n\n“I don’t know if I’ve ever been around anybody who was less good at their job, but more condescending,” Jennings said. “His talent to condescension ratio is so far off it’s ridiculous.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

This weekend it was the NFL, college football, Formula 1, F1 Academy, Premier League soccer, and the National Women's Soccer League title game—with a little bit of college hockey, NHL, and the PGA Tour on the side. But whenever I get overwhelmed, I also feel thankful: I think back a few short years ago to the beginning of the pandemic, when all we had to watch for two months was classic replays, online racing simulators, documentaries, and marble races.\n\nWe've come a long way in the last five years, and have even more to watch now than we used to. Live sports are the absolute hottest commodity in TV, and major events are cultural cornerstones. More and more leagues are starting up, confident they can turn a profit off our attention (just look at the ability of the United Football League, TGL (TMRW Golf League), and Unrivaled women's basketball to make it past their first seasons).\n\nCapitalism has blessed us with the ability to watch almost any game we want, whenever we want, and wherever we are. If you want to stream the second half of North Dakota against Hawaii in basketball at 1 a.m. while you ride the night bus to New York City, you can do that thanks to the ESPN app and a monthly subscription.\n\nWe even get to watch and play sports on holidays. Thanksgiving and football go hand in hand. Turkey trot 5Ks are on the rise. The NBA dominated Christmas until the NFL came along, while college football gets to dominate New Year's Day. And everyone in the family gathers around the TV after dinner on Christmas Eve to watch the Hawaii Bowl (OK, maybe that's just my brothers).\n\nEven if we can't be thankful for the current state of our favorite teams, we can be thankful for the memories we've created because of them, the connections to family and friends that they've fostered, and the hope they give us that glory is always around the corner.\n\nSpeaking of being thankful, everyone who likes watching football on Thanksgiving can express thanks to my Detroit Lions. \"The Lions weren't the first team to play on Thanksgiving, and football on Thanksgiving didn't even start with professionals,\" I wrote in 2020 for the Washington Examiner. \"But the Lions did bring Thanksgiving football to the masses.\"\n\nIt started in 1934, their first season in Detroit. Owner George Richards also owned a major radio station in Detroit. \"Knowing the publicity potential of radio, Richards along with NBC Radio, set up a 94-station network to broadcast the Lions-Bears showdown,\" the Pro Football Hall of Fame says. It was a huge game too, with the Lions coming in at 10-1 and the Bears undefeated.\n\nUnfortunately, like most of their Thanksgiving games, the Lions did not prevail. But a major tradition was born. (The Cowboys didn't join the feast until 1966, and they took a couple years off in the '70s.)\n\nWhen the Lions were bad (year after year, after year after year, after year after year), there was a lot of moaning from football fans about the hapless, mismanaged Lions getting such a great time slot. But as CBS' Jim Nantz once told Sports Illustrated, \"The ratings are probably going to be the same no matter what the matchup was in that window….The ratings will not plummet. It's just part of the Thanksgiving tradition.\" For example, as I noted in that Examiner piece, the 2019 game was one of the league's top-five most-viewed games that year, even though it had a bad Lions team playing a bad Bears team. Neither was a playoff hopeful.\n\nWhat's surprising is that the NFL put the Packers in the Thanksgiving game this year against the Lions, along with the Chiefs against the Cowboys. They could have put the Lions or Cowboys up against awful teams, and for TV purposes it wouldn't have mattered because the game gets great ratings no matter who's playing.\n\nFor that time-honored tradition, you can thank the Lions.\n\nReplay of the Week\n\nAs much as I would love to just post \"North London is red\" and leave it at that, you can all laugh at UCLA instead.\n\nUCLA tried a blind pitch fake FG and it worked about as well as you'd expect pic.twitter.com/YhpQXRzHij\n— CJ Fogler ????

Why? | Opinion","text":"What does Sen. Roger Marshall have against Netflix? And why does it matter?\n\nThe junior senator from Kansas last week wrote to the Justice Department, expressing “serious concern” that the streaming giant is bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, the media conglomerate that includes both the legendary movie studio as well as famous brands such as HBO, Food Network and — this might be most important for our purposes — CNN, the cable news network. More about that later.\n\n“If a deal comes to fruition,” Marshall wrote to the government’s top lawyers, “I ask that you act decisively to prevent further anticompetitive consolidation in the entertainment industry.” (He published the letter in a press release.)\n\nNetflix is reportedly bidding only for WBD’s movie studio and streaming services. If that deal succeeds, Marshall wrote, Americans might get fewer movies to see at their local multiplex. That in turn would harm “thousands of workers whose jobs depend on a robust and diverse pipeline of film and television projects.”\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nMore media consolidation “threatens consumer welfare, market dynamism, and the diversity of creative expression that is essential to a healthy democratic society,” Marshall concluded. He asked the DOJ to “evaluate carefully” any Netflix-WBD deal “to act decisively to prevent anticompetitive consolidation in this vital sector.”\n\nHere’s the thing: Marshall is right. Too many major media properties are in too few hands.\n\nThe problem? You wouldn’t know it from Marshall’s letter, but Netflix isn’t the only company bidding for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery. So are cable giant Comcast and — more important — Paramount. Both of those companies should also have antitrust problems if they take control of WBD. Media consolidation is media consolidation, after all.\n\nWhy isn’t Marshall asking the Justice Department to scrutinize those bids?\n\nIt is here we note that Paramount is largely owned by billionaire Larry Ellison. Who just happens to be President Donald Trump’s good buddy.\n\nCBS News, TikTok, CNN\n\nWouldn’t you know it: The Guardian reported last week that Ellison has already been in talks with the White House about his bid to take over WBD, reportedly musing about firing CNN anchors “whom Donald Trump is said to loathe, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar.”\n\nWhich means the takeover fight is about more than a “diverse pipeline of film and television projects.” It is also — and perhaps mostly — about control of one of America’s most-watched news networks, and about making our thin-skinned president happy with the picture of himself he sees on cable TV.\n\nTrump-friendly Fox News, Newsmax and One America News Network aren’t enough, apparently.\n\nOf note: Ellison and his son David acquired control of Paramount earlier this year. And Paramount owns CBS, which in turn owns CBS News.\n\nYou might have heard about some of the pre-merger maneuvering. Ahead of the deal, Paramount’s previous owners settled a lawsuit Trump brought against CBS’ “60 Minutes” for its interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris — a lawsuit most legal observers said was without merit — in an apparent attempt to ease the federal government’s regulatory scrutiny of the deal.\n\nAfter the takeover, the Ellisons installed Bari Weiss — an “anti-woke” journalist with no significant television experience — to run CBS News. She has reportedly looked at putting Fox News anchor Bret Baier in the chair once held by Walter Cronkite.\n\nOne more thing: Trump has also talked about handing control of the American version of TikTok (where a lot of young Americans get their news, believe it or not) to … Larry Ellison.\n\nMedia consolidation indeed.\n\nIf you think this all seems reminiscent of Hungary, where strongman Viktor Orbán helped put his country’s media in the hands of a few regime-friendly oligarchs to create what the Associated Press called a “sprawling pro-government media empire,” well, you’re not alone.\n\nSilence from Marshall’s office\n\nWhich brings us back to Roger Marshall and his crusade against Netflix.\n\nI had three questions for his office: Does the senator plan to also oppose a Paramount-Ellison purchase of WBD? If not, why not? And if not, what’s the difference?\n\nI emailed Marshall’s press shop. I also emailed a couple of officials in his office directly. And then I left a phone message — though I never talked to an actual human to do so.\n\nNobody responded.\n\nSo let’s acknowledge the possibility that Marshall has a very good reason for opposing Netflix’s bid for WBD while remaining silent on Paramount’s effort. Maybe he has a good explanation for how that stance serves his Kansas constituents. If so, I’d still love to hear it.\n\nOtherwise, it appears that — intentionally or not — Marshall’s letter has the effect of putting a thumb on the scale against Netflix’s bid and for Paramount’s. And that thumb — coincidentally or not — just happens to coincide with the president’s apparent inclinations about what Americans get to see and hear.\n\nDraw your own conclusions.","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article313100793.html","image":"https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/omtehg/picture313099239/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/roger%20marshall.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 15:13:56","author":"Joel Mathis","authors":["Joel Mathis"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.131},{"id":382105714,"title":"Media Goes on Offense as Trump Steps Up His War on Journalism","text":"When Elon Musk called the New York Times “government-funded media” in February after his Department of Government Efficiency identified government media subscriptions, the storied outlet didn’t take the criticism lying down.\n\nThe Times responded on X with a bulleted statement explaining the nature of those subscriptions. After Donald Trump attacked the paper in April for a line in a story that noted how legal experts have called his CBS lawsuit “baseless,” saying the Times should be held liable for its “likely unlawful behavior,” the paper said his comments were the latest in “a long list of legal threats aimed at discouraging or penalizing independent reporting about the administration.”\n\nThe Times’ proactive approach stands in contrast to journalists who traditionally let their work stand on its own, and it underscores the shifting environment of a media business under more scrutiny than ever. While mistakes in the past may have once been relegated to a corrections section, the stakes are now much higher, with the wrong words igniting a social media frenzy, or drawing legal threats from the president. \n\n“Letting the journalism speak for itself is an approach from a bygone era,” Patrick Healy, the Times’ assistant managing editor for trust and standards, told TheWrap. “Our audience is understandably asking really tough questions about why and how we publish what we publish — that’s fair, and I think we want to do a better job of opening up our process and how we work in that regard.”\n\nThat defense of proper journalism is critical at a time when mistakes can have devastating consequences. The BBC’s mangled editing of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech in a 2024 documentary prompted him to threaten a lawsuit for somewhere between “$1 billion to $5 billion.” The Times of London, meanwhile, was embarrassed last month after claiming to quote former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio railing against mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — only to apologize for mistakenly quoting a different man with the same name. De Blasio later questioned whether the Rupert Murdoch-owned U.K. outlet had “abandoned meaningful journalistic standards and ethics.”\n\nAll news organizations have protocols for assessing the veracity of what they publish, though the administration of standards can range from handling grammatical and style matters to CNN’s “triad” approach, which includes a trio of newsroom editors, lawyers and standard-specific editors who drill into a story before it runs. Though integral to newsrooms, standards can be part of the business, with outlets having different practices and processes, and several declined to discuss their specific approaches.\n\nBut today’s perilous legal environment has forced news organizations to be extra-cautious in buttoning up copy and upholding already high standards, while also being willing to defend their journalism in new ways. Several outlets, including the Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian U.S., opened up with TheWrap about operating in a second Trump era and in an era of declining trust in the mainstream media. \n\nAnd while accuracy is important, Healy said, it’s also about “making really public statements, comments on social media and elsewhere, defending our journalism, explaining our journalism, standing up for our reporters and other journalists when they come under attack.”\n\nThe new battleground\n\nIn September, Trump sued the Times and three of its reporters for $15 billion for libel over a series of stories the paper published about the president, his family and his businesses, mostly in the years before his second term.\n\nHealy reiterated the Times’ position that Trump’s lawsuit against the paper has “no merit,” characterizing it as “an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention.” But he said such tactics informed the Times’ public approach to handling attacks on its journalism, recognizing that news organizations are facing greater scrutiny from a public inherently distrustful of the outlets that produce the news.\n\n“We’re just very aware of the pressure campaigns and activists from all sides who want the news media to referee and the Times to bend our standards and change our language in their favor, and President Trump and his administration are a big part of that,” Healy said. \n\nTrump’s camp, however, remains consistent in its attack on media.\n\n“President Trump is committed to continue holding those who traffic in lies, deception and fake news accountable for their reckless and politically motivated efforts to defame him and the MAGA movement,” a spokesperson for the president’s outside legal team told TheWrap.\n\nIn this litigious climate, how a news organization commits to its standards department is of new relevance. After a year of legal turmoil over its editorial policies, CBS News lost its head of standards, Claudia Milne, in October in the wake of Bari Weiss’ appointment as its editor-in-chief. \n\nWeiss has since considered dismantling the network’s standards department for “holding too much power,” according to the Independent, after CBS News axed its race and culture unit during layoffs last month. Both departments questioned CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil’s handling of an interview with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates over the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting Weiss to defend him in a Free Press editorial last year.\n\n“She also asked openly, ‘What’s the point of standards?’” a CBS News source told the Independent. (CBS News did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for its standards department.)\n\nHealy wouldn’t discuss Weiss’ management of CBS News’ standards department. But he said the Times has increased its standards desk by roughly 10 editors over the last several years. “The standards desk has grown just as the work has grown commensurate with the newsroom expanding,” Healy said.\n\n“Other news organizations are going to make their choices,” Healy added. “I really can’t pass judgment there, but I know for us, standards are core to what the Times does, and having an organized and robust standards desk of really excellent editors is essential to our journalism.”\n\nThe Guardian U.S. has also been “doubling down” on its commitment to its newsroom standards, deputy editor for news Paul Harris told TheWrap. Harris said the U.K.-based paper’s U.S. edition had already maintained a high bar for accuracy — ”We’re not a casual news organization at the best of times, and we’re super not a casual news organization now” — but the president’s hostility toward the press forces the Guardian to work to prevent those who see it as a “political enemy” from latching onto mistakes.\n\n“There’s obviously no doubt that Trump does see the press as the enemy of the people, and the Guardian, as a proudly progressive news organization, is probably not his favorite,” Harris said. “So we would have high newsroom standards anyway, for ethical reasons, but there is now a very solid, obviously practical reason to have them as well.”\n\nHarris said the paper has “definitely” been conducting more legal reviews of its stories than it did in the past, ensuring it was “more careful” in making sure its work stood up to scrutiny. It is also one of the few outlets that continues to employ a public editor, which it calls its “readers’ editor,” to serve as its internal conduit for its audience to scrutinize the newsroom’s reporting and hold it accountable for mistakes. \n\n“We deal with them all the time,” he said. “Sometimes in ways that, as a head editor, you’re on the wrong end of, but that’s just the way it is and it’s also the way it should be.”\n\nThe Journal’s stories aren’t generally receiving additional legal scrutiny, said Elena Cherney, the paper’s head of standards and ethics, but reporters continue to have access to legal advice in the course of their reporting. She said the paper’s ethos of reporting all sides of a story and getting as much information on the record was its north star, one that dated back to when she first started at the Journal in 2000.\n\n“Even then, many other news organizations didn’t expect the same level of reporting rigor from reporters as the Journal did and still does,” she wrote in an email. “Our standards put a big onus on our journalists to go the extra mile.”\n\nTrump continues to issue threats, suggesting in September that he might sue ABC for airing late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and last week called for the host to be fired. He has yet to file a lawsuit against the BBC, though he signaled it would be soon; a spokesperson for the legal team did not answer questions on the lawsuit’s timing. In its apology to Trump last week over the documentary’s editing, the BBC said it believed there was no basis for a defamation claim.\n\nHarris said his paper would remain undeterred in covering the Trump administration, though he noted that even if news organizations report accurately, they could still face legal action. “If the White House wants to come for you, it will anyway,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily need you to have got your facts wrong to launch a multibillion-dollar lawsuit.”\n\n“The ultimate goal is to kill reporting”\n\nThere’s a reason Trump isn’t hesitating to file one lawsuit after another: He’s been successful at putting various media outlets on their heels.\n\nThe president in December extracted a $16 million settlement from Disney from his defamation suit last year against ABC and George Stephanopoulos, in which the president took issue with Stephanopoulos’ on-air claim that a jury found Trump liable for “rape” instead of its actual finding of “sexual abuse,” a legal distinction in New York. \n\nTrump likewise got a $16 million settlement in July from CBS-parent Paramount over a lawsuit related to how “60 Minutes” edited a Kamala Harris interview, a move critics saw as the company paving the way for regulatory approval of its merger with Skydance. \n\nThe two settlements, paid toward his impending presidential library, appear to have emboldened Trump in his quest to fight news organizations over unflattering stories, forcing companies to shell out millions and alarming media law experts in the process. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to kill reporting and to kill journalism that is less favorable to him.” – Katie Townsend, former Reporters Committee for Free of the Press deputy executive director\n\n“You’re inflicting pain by engaging in the lawfare, whether or not the outcome is ultimately in your favor,” said Katie Townsend, a Gibson Dunn partner and the former deputy executive director and legal director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “Donald Trump is very smart about that.

Democrats are fighting to improve the lives of rural Americans and farmers.\"\n\nTrump has defended his economic agenda and plans to bring the message out into the country soon, an administration official recently told NPR.\n\nDemocrats' spending in rural communities is part of an \"eight-figure investment,\" according to a DCCC press release first shared with NPR. DelBene said the DCCC has a full-time staffer who will be focused on \"strategic rural engagement across the country\" for the midterms. She said the party has begun working with rural community groups and leaders in key competitive districts — including in newly redrawn districts in South Texas.\n\n\"When we look at the swing districts across the country, the districts that are going to determine the majority in the House of Representatives, we know that rural voters are key in those districts,\" DelBene said.\n\nAnthony Flaccavento, co-founder and executive director of the Rural Urban Bridge Initiative, said economic frustration among most voters could provide an opening for Democrats, and that rural voters tend to align with economically populist policies.\n\n\"It's very clear to us that a progressive, populist economic stance is what is needed,\" he said. \"It's what is needed in substance. Like we need the anti-monopolies, antitrust, pro-union-and-investment-in-infrastructure-type things that go with that.\"\n\nBut it is an open question whether an economic message will help Democrats win back parts of a voting bloc that has been abandoning the party in droves.\n\nWinning back rural voters could be \"hard as hell\"\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in last year's presidential election Trump won 69% of voters who describe their communities as rural, compared with just 29% for Kamala Harris.\n\nFlaccavento said winning back at least a slice of those rural voters is likely to be \"hard as hell\" for Democrats. But, he said, it's a problem the party needs to confront head on.\n\n\"We focus on rural, but because there's so much overlap in why people have left the Democrats and why they have so much disillusionment, it's a lot of commonality between working-class folks in small towns and cities and rural people,\" Flaccavento said. \"When you put those two together, rural voters and blue-collar, working-class voters, then you have the biggest voting bloc in the country.\"\n\nFlaccavento, a small farmer in southwestern Virginia who's a self-described liberal Democrat, ran twice to represent Virginia's 9th Congressional District. He said he had high hopes for his run in 2018.\n\n\"We held over 100 in-person town hall meetings with close to 7,000 people attending. We had great social media. We raised a million bucks. We did everything right,\" he said. \"And I still got annihilated at the voting box 2 to 1.\"\n\nFlaccavento said the negative perception of Democrats in the countryside has long been hard to overcome as the party dismisses concerns that working folks and rural people have had.\n\n\"Primarily economic concerns,\" he said. \"They've been downplayed.\"\n\nNicholas Jacobs, a political scientist at Colby College in Maine, said Democrats haven't just dismissed the concerns of rural voters, he said the party has \"actively push[ed] them away.\"\n\nJacobs said the party began clawing back campaign investments in rural America when Democrats abandoned their 50-state strategy. Instead, he said, the party focused on mobilizing their base voters in big cities, and persuading independent-leaning voters in the suburbs.\n\n\"Ultimately, what you get is a complete buy-in to the approach articulated no better than Chuck Schumer himself did, that 'for every rural working-class person we lose, we'll pick up two more in the suburbs,'\" he said, paraphrasing the Senate Democratic leader. \"And as 2016 showed, it was a foolish approach, but it didn't seem to change anything for the next eight years.\"\n\nFlaccavento agreed it's been \"a losing strategy\" for the party.\n\nBut he said it will take more than targeted investments in a few swing districts to really shore up some of the support that has been lost in rural America.\n\n\"My hope would be that it's a serious commitment, not a token commitment, and that it's a commitment that goes beyond a handful of targeted races,\" he said. \"We have to start long-term investment and long-term work across every rural congressional district. It might be five or 10 years or more before some of them become competitive, but we've got to start that work now.\"\n\nJacobs said he hopes Democrats have started to \"wake up\" to the fact that rural areas cannot be neglected.\n\n\"If you are going to build a national party and compete at a national level, you need to represent the entire nation and all of its wonderful and complex messiness,\" he said. \"And that includes how rural Americans fit into your idea of the nation.\"","summary":"Democrats are announcing a new investment to win over voters in rural areas — where the party has suffered deep losses in recent elections — by leaning on an economic message.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/25/nx-s1-5615326/rural-voters-congress-health-care-voting-invest","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7643x5095+0+0/resize/7643x5095!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F46%2F89896f364887881f55e38fbc9544%2Fap24310538359147.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 13:00:00","author":"Ashley Lopez","authors":["Ashley Lopez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":382041472,"title":"Welcome to the Gerrymandering Apocalypse","text":"If anyone has a reason to oppose gerrymandering, it’s U.S. Representative Doug LaMalfa. For the past 12 years, LaMalfa, a Republican, has represented California’s first congressional district, a sprawling, mostly rural expanse in the northeast corner of the state. But thanks to Proposition 50—California’s counter to Republican gerrymandering efforts in Texas—LaMalfa’s home will soon lie in a new district that reaches from the Nevada border all the way to the affluent wine country of Sonoma, near the Pacific Ocean. Another successor district will connect the remote Oregon-California-Nevada vertex to the suburbs of San Francisco, an eight-hour drive away. It will be shaped almost exactly like the 19th-century political cartoon that coined the term Gerry-Mander.\n\nLaMalfa can still run for Congress next year, taking his pick of either of those two new districts. This gives him the option of losing to a Democrat by perhaps 30 percentage points, based on last year’s results and current polling, or merely by about 15. Either way, he’s toast. “It’s a real dirty scheme,” LaMalfa told me.\n\nSo what does LaMalfa think Congress should do about gerrymandering? Nothing. “I don’t support the federal government trying to dictate to every state individually how they do things,” he said. Most Republicans seem to agree—even the ones who, like LaMalfa, are losing their seat as the redistricting wars heat up.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because at this point, the only effective solution to partisan gerrymandering would be federal legislation. All of the other factors that once constrained the practice are fast disappearing. Although nearly 6 million registered Republicans live in California, very little prevents the state from drawing a map that has no Republican seats at all—just as very little is stopping Republican-led states from drawing maps that have no Democratic seats. (Under Prop 50, California will go from 11 districts that voted for Donald Trump to five.) America is quickly moving toward a system in which tens of millions of blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats effectively have no congressional representation at all.\n\nIn the states where one party controls the redistricting process, the incentives are simple: Draw the districts such that your party has the easiest path to winning the most seats. Give as little power to the other party as you possibly can.\n\nTraditionally, however, there have been some limits. The first was the custom of drawing new districts only every 10 years, after a new census. The second is the court system. Because the electorate is racially polarized, many Republican efforts to secure more seats have effectively done so by disenfranchising Black or Latino voters, and have therefore been struck down for violating the Voting Rights Act. Federal courts can’t touch purely partisan gerrymanders, as the Supreme Court affirmed in 2019, but state courts sometimes strike down particularly egregious examples under their state constitution. This happened in North Carolina and Maryland in 2022. The self-interest of incumbents has also traditionally constrained gerrymandering. If you eliminate Republican districts, Democratic incumbents will suddenly have more Republican voters in their districts, making their reelection campaign harder to win. Representing a safe seat is a much easier job than holding a competitive one, and few people, in Congress or otherwise, readily sign up to do a harder job with no raise.\n\nThe specter of a “dummymander”—a backfiring gerrymander—also looms over redistricting efforts. Trump won North Carolina by three points in 2024, meaning the Republican state legislature could hypothetically draw all 14 of its districts to be Trump +3. But that wouldn’t be wise, because if the state shifted four points to the left in 2026, Republicans could lose all 14 seats.\n\nEvery one of these limitations is falling away. The norm of redistricting only every 10 years is the latest to be obliterated by Trump. In a currently pending case, the Supreme Court is all but certain to overturn or at least severely restrict Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which has long served as a barrier to Republican gerrymanders in the South. (The VRA arguably constrained California’s most recent gerrymander too: In many parts of California, including San Diego and San Francisco, Latino voters voted for Trump at a higher rate than white voters did.) And what little power the courts have is being subordinated to the electoral system. In recent years, state-supreme-court elections in North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Ohio have been dominated by concerns about whether a given candidate would or wouldn’t strike down a gerrymandered map. In North Carolina, the Democratic-controlled state supreme court struck down a gerrymander in 2022, only for two of the Democratic justices to be replaced by Republicans, who then reversed that decision.\n\nIncumbents, meanwhile, have become team players, mostly willing to take on a tougher job in service of punishing the other team. For example, Prop 50 caused Ami Bera’s congressional district in California to absorb enough Republicans to go from a Kamala Harris +14 district to a +8 district. Mike Thompson’s went from +31 to +15. Both Bera and Thompson were proud supporters of Prop 50. One of the only things keeping California from gerrymandering even more aggressively was the opposition from progressive identity-based interest groups, which didn’t want to see the influence of their communities potentially diluted, Paul Mitchell, the Sacramento-based consultant who drew the new California map, told me.\n\nState legislators are feeling national pressure to conform. In the Indiana Senate, Republican holdouts prevented the state from redrawing its map this year. This led to a reprimand from their governor and a Truth Social post from Trump calling out the group’s leaders by name and urging voters to “get them out of office, ASAP.” Some lawmakers’ houses have been swatted in the days since. In Maryland, Bill Ferguson, the president of the state Senate, has been one of the few bulwarks against re-gerrymandering a state that already has only one Republican district to Democrats’ seven. His argument isn’t especially high-minded; it’s primarily a worry that courts might rule the map illegal and force the state to draw a 6–2 or a 5–3. Even this pragmatic critique has been rejected by Maryland Governor Wes Moore, many of Ferguson’s senate colleagues, and prominent national Democrats including Hakeem Jeffries, Steny Hoyer, and Chris Murphy. Earlier this month, Ferguson drew a primary challenge, his first since 2014. The message to other would-be Bill Fergusons is clear.\n\nEven the odds of a dummymander have decreased as fewer places are up for grabs from election to election, and as drawing perfect maps becomes easier and easier. Free user-friendly technology has democratized disenfranchisement, allowing election geeks across the country to propose ever more precise gerrymanders to their state legislators. Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered Alabama to use a state legislative map made by a high schooler. (In that case, the citizen map replaces an illegal racial gerrymander.)\n\nOne of the only constraints left appears to be sloppiness. Last week, a federal district court struck down the Republican Texas gerrymander, citing a letter from Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, that instructed the state to “rectify” so-called coalition districts that are majority-minority. Dillon wrote that the districts were unconstitutional; the court, in an opinion by a Trump-appointed judge, called that belief “legally incorrect” and found that Texas’s reliance on Dhillon’s legal theory itself amounted to illegal race-based districting. If she had merely told the state to disenfranchise as many Democrats as possible, there would be no legal grounds to overturn the map in federal court. And even her clumsiness might not end up mattering. The Supreme Court has since stayed the ruling while it considers the matter, meaning the gerrymander is still in effect.\n\nIn a fun-house-mirror image, Democrats in California also managed to bring legal scrutiny to their own gerrymander by repeatedly talking about it in racial terms. Mike McGuire, a California state senator, wrote in a press release that the new map would “empower Latino voters.” The DOJ sued, citing McGuire’s statement; the case is now before a federal district court in California. The election-law scholar Richard Hasen has argued that the DOJ doesn’t have much of a case, both because the racial motivations would have to be “predominant” to strike down the map and because the state’s voters, not just the legislature, passed the map. Of course, the Texas ruling also came as a surprise. If Democrats had simply said, “We want poor, rural Californians to have no say in who represents them,” they might not even be in court.\n\nWith so few constraints left, the rhetoric on gerrymandering has heated up. L. Louise Lucas, a Democratic state senator in Virginia, has been posting multiple times a week about her desire to draw a map that leaves only one Republican district out of 11 in Virginia. In Florida, the biggest state still poised to redistrict, ambitions are perhaps even greater. The state’s Republican Party executive director recently told a Tallahassee political forum that, if called upon by the legislature, he’d “sit down over a weekend and draw a map where there’s not a single Democratic member of Congress from Florida.”\n\nThanks to Democratic efforts to retaliate, this war may wind up being a wash for the partisan makeup of the 120th Congress. But although Democratic gerrymandering is effective at canceling out Republican gerrymandering, it only doubles the number of voters being disenfranchised.\n\nThe way out of this spiral is clear: a federal ban on congressional gerrymandering. (Such a law would not address the practice of gerrymandering state legislative districts, however—a pernicious problem in its own right.) What has kept this from happening is that few Republicans are interested in passing one. In 2021, all but one House Democrat voted for a bill that required, among other things, independent redistricting commissions in every state. Not a single Republican voted for the bill, and no organized Republican effort to reform redistricting has emerged since. Some Republicans, such as Doug LaMalfa, have philosophical reasons for opposing redistricting reform. Others, such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, argue that the GOP is positioned to come out ahead in a gerrymandering arms race.\n\nOne of the rare exceptions is Kevin Kiley, a second-term Republican congressman. In August, Kiley introduced a bill that would ban mid-decade redistricting and reverse the changes made to state maps this year. He also supports having independent redistricting commissions in every state. Nonstop gerrymandering, he told me, “really makes it a lot harder for people to represent their districts and for representative government to work properly.”\n\nBut Kiley is running out of time. His district is among those gerrymandered out of existence by Prop 50. After the midterms, he probably won’t be a congressman anymore—just another disenfranchised California Republican.","summary":"America is quickly moving toward a system in which tens of millions of blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats effectively have no congressional representation at all.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/gerrymandering-escalation-congress/685052/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HFAkQU4ctsBF3r2rg_qitluFQuw=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/11/Gerrymandering/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 12:00:00","author":"Marc Novicoff","authors":["Marc Novicoff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":382057340,"title":"Grace and disgrace: Amidst the latter, we're reminded of the former","text":"In an America presently diseased by crudeness and cruelty, the scene last week at Washington’s National Cathedral for the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney was a welcome display of grace by leaders who embrace an ethos currently out of vogue. It’s an ethos of bipartisanship, of respect for public service. It’s an ethos of affirming human decency, of affirming democracy itself — regardless of sharp political differences.\n\nFierce political enemies of Cheney’s and of one another came to church to pay homage not only to Cheney’s career spent trying to defend America as he deemed necessary, but to what one of Cheney’s daughters said was her father’s credo. “Bonds of party,” former Representative Liz Cheney said he believed, “must always yield to the simple bond we share as Americans.”\n\nThere was former President Joe Biden, routinely trashed by President Donald Trump in language that casts considerably more doubt on Trump’s mental condition than Biden’s. Fresh from treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, Biden nevertheless made a point of being there — because that is what being a model of moral leadership is about. There was former Vice President Al Gore, present to pay tribute to the man who succeeded him in an election not just bitter but subject to permanent doubt. “There’s an old saying,” Gore took to saying after his gracious concession speech in 2000, “You win some, you lose some — and then there’s that little known third category.”\n\nCheney was eulogized by the president he served, George W. Bush, who entered the White House courtesy of a Supreme Court that ordered a recount of Florida’s dispositive election terminated before the votes could be tallied. It must be painful for Gore to be in Bush’s presence, but he came. It was an act of grace.\n\nThere was former Vice President Kamala Harris, sitting just feet from former Republican Vice Presidents Mike Pence and Dan Quayle. There was former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi chatting with former Republican House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nCheney, reviled by those on the left and some on the right for his support for the Iraq war, was as conservative a Republican as the mainstream GOP had to offer. But he had stepped forward to condemn Trump and his wrecking crew in stark terms. Trump, Cheney said after the unsuccessful coup attempt on Jan. 6, 2021, was a “coward,” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”\n\nIn September 2024, rather than stay silent, Cheney went out of his way to announce that he was voting for Harris. “In our 248-year history,” he said, “there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He can never be trusted with power again.”\n\nLiz Cheney has pulled even fewer punches than her father and has paid dearly for it. She promptly condemned Trump after Jan. 6 for inciting the mob and for placing America in “maximum danger.” For this truth-telling, she was stripped of her leadership position in the House Republican Conference and then defeated for reelection in a Republican primary. Repeatedly threatened by Trump, who accused her of being a criminal who should be jailed, she is already properly recorded as a profile in courage, an honor that historians will reaffirm.\n\nIt was another week proving how right Dick and Liz Cheney were. “Quiet, piggy!” snapped the President of the United States at a female journalist who asked him a question he didn’t like. When Democratic members of Congress, who, unlike Trump, had actually served in the military, reminded America’s soldiers of the truism that it is illegal to follow illegal orders, the president who faked “bone spurs” to avoid serving his country called them “traitors” who could be punished “by death.” Kissing Vladimir Putin’s extremities for the umpteenth time, Trump blamed Ukraine for “starting” the war that Putin had started by invading Ukraine.\n\nWhen even Marjorie Taylor Greene can no longer bear Donald Trump, things have turned truly ugly in our beloved country. Whatever one’s critique of Dick Cheney, his funeral did remind us that, with a great deal of luck, that beloved country may conceivably be returned to us.","summary":"In an America presently diseased by crudeness and cruelty, the scene last week at Washington's National Cathedral for the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney was a welcome display of grace by leaders who embrace an ethos currently out…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/opinion/columnists/jeff-robbins-grace-and-disgrace-amidst-the-latter-were-reminded-of-the-former/article_a083ce87-1c48-469d-ae31-c860a2671e84.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/aa/aaa75761-0f76-4293-ba49-e42e541e154e/6924c9f36fd10.image.jpg?crop=1769%2C929%2C0%2C121&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 10:30:00","author":"By Jeff Robbins","authors":["By Jeff Robbins"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":382015520,"title":"Mark Z. Barabak: California is having its most wide-open governor's race in decades. Why's that?","text":"Today we discuss Texas, overreaction and the voluminous field of candidates for California governor.\n\nIs there anyone who is not running for governor?\n\nI'm not. And neither are my two cats. At least they weren't as of this morning, when we discussed the race before breakfast.\n\nThat leaves us somewhat short of the 135 candidates who ran in California's 2003 recall gubernatorial election. But not by much.\n\nI count nearly a dozen serious candidates, with possibly more to come. Why so many?\n\nOpportunity.\n\nThis is the most wide-open race for California governor in decades. By comparison, you'd have to go back to at least 1998, when Lt. Gov. Gray Davis surged past a pair of moneybag candidates, Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman, in the Democratic primary, then stomped Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren in November to win the general election.\n\nNow, as then, there is no one who even remotely resembles a prohibitive front-runner.\n\nPolling in the governor's race has shown former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter and Chad Bianco, Riverside County's Republican sheriff, narrowly leading the field. But with support for both in the middling 13%-to-21% range, we're not talking about a pair of world-beaters.\n\nLike nature, political ambition abhors a vacuum.\n\nSpeaking of moneybags...\n\nTom Steyer!\n\nAfter making a bundle as a hedge fund manager, the San Francisco billionaire and environmental activist has been panting after public office for years. Running for president didn't work out in 2020, even after Steyer spent more than $345 million on his effort. (That's close to what the Dodgers spent on their 2025 payroll.)\n\nSo now Steyer is running for governor, a move he appeared to telegraph by airing nearly $13 million in self-promotional ads that, oh yes, supported passage of Proposition 50, the Democratic gerrymander initiative.\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nLongtime readers of this column - both of you! - will know I make no predictions.\n\nBut California voters have never looked favorably upon rich candidates trying to make the leap from political civilian to the governorship or U.S. Senate. In fact, over the last 50-plus years, a gilded gallery of the well-to-do have tried and spectacularly failed.\n\nPerhaps Steyer will display the policy chops or the razzle and dazzle they all lacked. But his launch video certainly didn't shatter any molds. Rather, it presented a stereotypical grab bag of redwood trees, potshots at Sacramento, multicultural images of hard-working-everyday-folk, a promise to fight, a pledge to build more housing and, of course, a dash of profanity because, gosh darn it, nothing says \"unbridled authenticity\" like a political candidate swearing!\n\nMaybe his fellow billionaire, Rick Caruso, will show more creativity and imagination if he gets into the governor's race.\n\nAt least Democrats have been showing signs of life.\n\nIndeed. Dare I say, the party's mood swing from near-suicidal to euphoric has been quite something.\n\nWinning gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia - not by a little, but a lot - and prevailing in down-ballot contests in Pennsylvania and Georgia had a remarkably transformative effect. (Zohran Mamdani's mayoral victory in sky-blue New York City was no big surprise once the democratic socialist prevailed in the primary.)\n\nLiterally overnight, Democrats seized the momentum heading into the 2026 midterm election, while Republicans have begun scrambling to reposition their party and recraft its messaging.\n\nAll that being said, even before their buoyant off-year performance those widespread reports of Democrats' demise were greatly ... well, we'll leave that Mark Twain chestnut alone. As analyst Charlie Cook points out, 2024 was a deeply disappointing year for the party. But it wasn't a disaster.\n\nDemocrats gained two House seats. There was no net change in any of the 11 gubernatorial races and legislative contests across 44 states ended in something close to a wash. The party lost four Senate seats - and control of the chamber - but three of those losses came in the red states of Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\"This is not to argue that Democrats had a great night in November 2024, but it certainly wasn't a massacre or a party-wide repudiation,\" Cook wrote in a recent posting. \"If voters had intended to take it out on the party as a whole, the results would have looked quite different.\"\n\nRather than a wholesale takedown of Democrats, the result seemed very much a rejection of President Biden and, by extension, his hasty replacement on the ballot, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhat does that mean going forth?\n\nIf you're asking whether Democrats will win control of the House or Senate...\n\n...I haven't a clue.\n\nDemocrats need to gain three seats to take control of the House and both history and Trump's sagging approval ratings - especially as pertains to the economy - augur well for their chances. The president's party has lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections and, according to Inside Elections, the fewest number of seats that flipped was four.\n\nThat's why I thought Proposition 50, which sets out to all but decapitate California Republicans in Congress, was a bad and unnecessary move, effectively disenfranchising millions of non-Democratic voters.\n\nAn appeals court last week tossed out a Republican gerrymander in Texas, putting Democrats in an even stronger position, though the legal wrangling is far from over. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the decision, pending review. And still to come is a high court ruling that could gut the Voting Rights Act and yield Republicans a dozen or more House seats nationwide.\n\nSo the fight for control is far from decided.\n\nAs for the Senate, Republicans stand a much better chance of keeping control, given how the seats contested in 2026 are located on largely favorable GOP terrain.\n\nBut until the votes are counted, nobody knows what will happen. That's the thing about elections: they help keep wiseacres like me honest.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

But questions were raised recently about Becerra's judgment when federal prosecutors revealed the then-secretary didn't notice that a top aide had raided his dormant political account for $225,000. Becerra wasn't implicated. The aide pleaded guilty.\n\n–Antonio Villaraigosa, 72, former Los Angeles mayor and state Assembly speaker. No one is more qualified to be governor.

Eric Swalwell. Cloobeck shared this news while appearing alongside Swallwell on CNN, saying that the San Francisco Bay Area Democrat will be the \"greatest leader of this great state California.\" \"I'm happy to say tonight that I'm going to merge my campaign into his and give him all the hard work that I've worked on,\" said Cloobeck. The announcement puts an end to the entrepreneur and philanthropist's first-ever political campaign, which he funded through a fortune amassed in the real estate industry. In a recent UC Berkeley poll co-sponsored by The Times, Cloobeck received less than half of 1% of the support of registered voters polled. Cloobeck said he had launched his run because he could not find a single qualified candidate — that was until Swalwell tossed his hat into the ring last week, sending an infusion of energy into the relatively sleepy race. Pin now affixed to the lapel of his navy blue suit, Swalwell thanked his pal for the support and said he was looking forward to drawing on Cloobeck's expertise as he worked to bring more housing and small business to the Golden State. Swalwell, a former Republican who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, has said he is seeking the governorship to combat the threats President Trump poses to the state and to increase housing affordability and homeownership for Californians. During his Monday evening interview, Swalwell doubled down on his proposal to implement a vote-by-phone system, despite the sharp criticism it invoked from the White House and two of his Republican challengers for governor, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative political commentator Steve Hilton. Swalwell said the proposal would make democracy more accessible, contending that if phones are secure enough to access finances and healthcare records, then they can be made secure enough to cast a ballot. The backing of Cloobeck, a major Democratic donor, is good news for the congressman, who seeks to make a splash in an unusually wide open race to lead the world's fourth-largest economy and the country's most populous state. About 44% of registered voters said in late October they did not have a preferred candidate for governor. The recent decisions of former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla to opt out of the running further solidified that the state's top job is anyone's to win.

Home prices have risen more than 50 percent since the pandemic. About a third of Americans households now spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time homebuyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record.\n\nThe core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I've seen estimates ranging from 2 million to 5 million. It's a shortage decades in the making — and one we're nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.\n\nEvery White House since President Barack Obama's administration has recognized the need to build more homes but the results, under both Democrats and Republicans, have been anemic. Housing is a hard problem to solve from the Oval Office. Zoning and building rules are set at the state and local levels. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve. In 2024, Kamala Harris promised to build 3 million new homes and released a plan that no housing expert I spoke to thought could come anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\n\" The thing that I think we learned is that federal housing policy is stuck in a really weak equilibrium,\" said Jared Bernstein, who led President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisers. \"There is just far too little asked of cities and states. They won't do much to push back on the barriers that are blocking affordable housing.\"\n\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wants to change that. He's among the authors of a new housing plan that tries to deliver the next administration a set of solutions nearer to the scale of the problem.\n\nAt the core of the center's plan is an idea it calls \"Rent Relief for Reform.\" I don't love the name, but I like the idea: Places with a housing shortage — and that's a lot of them — get a choice. Build the housing and the federal government will give all the renters in the city up to $1,000 off their rent — or don't build the housing and lose access to certain federal grants.\n\nThe Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank, recently proposed a similar idea. In that version, cities and other places that hit ambitious housing targets would qualify for a federal rebate that would give every household — so both homeowners and renters — a check equal to the average increase in rent over the last year. In other words, build enough housing and the federal government will give the people who live near that housing money.\n\nBoth those ideas are trying to solve the hard problem at the heart of housing politics: It's the people who already have homes who have a voice in local politics and planning. They often like their neighborhood the way it is. They don't want more traffic or new neighbors or the hassle of nearby construction. What's in it for them?\n\n\"You can put this kind of crassly as you're incentivizing renters to show up at local elections and push their elected officials to do things that are renter-friendly, which I don't hate as a strategy,\" said Jenny Schuetz, who leads housing policy at Arnold Ventures. \"If most renters showed up in the primaries and demanded that their mayor and City Council actually do good things, we could have some pretty different outcomes. But mostly renters don't show up — particularly in the primary — and so you get these homeowner-dominated coalitions in cities that make it hard to build.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other problem is that even a housing policy that does benefit a community will do so slowly. It takes years to plan and build new homes. It takes time for new supply to lower costs. That time breaks the feedback loop between good policy and good politics. \" If you're a politician and you have a four-year term, you really need to do all of your housing stuff in year one if you want to have people feel the benefit within that single term,\" said Aaron Shroyer, who served as special assistant to Biden for housing policy and co-authored the Searchlight plan.\n\nSome polling Searchlight did is telling here. Seventy-nine percent of Americans say housing costs are \"too high\" or \"way too high.\" Sixty-two percent say it's become harder to find housing they can afford. But only 24 percent think building more housing in their community would lower costs. People do not believe building housing near them will benefit them. So policymakers need to create that benefit; they need to turn the indirect and slow gains of growth into something more visible and immediate for the community that is creating that growth.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other big idea in the Center for American Progress plan is to change the way we build housing in America. \"If you go back to 1910, somebody showed up with a toolbox and a hammer to build a house,\" Bernstein said. \"And if you go to 2025, it's the same damn thing. This is the one sector where productivity has been literally falling for five decades while everything else has been going up.\"\n\nThe comparison that often gets made here is to manufacturing. Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector — how much you could produce with the same number of workers — rose by more than 900 percent. That's a big part of why everything from tables to televisions is cheaper today than decades ago. But over the same period, productivity in the construction sector has fallen. That's not the only reason housing is so expensive today, but it's part of it.\n\nBut you can manufacture housing — constructing homes in an off-site factory much the way we construct cars and then shipping them for final assembly. This is technology pioneered in the United States when George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, served as secretary of housing and urban development during the Nixon administration. But the United States never figured out the rules nor the financing to make an industry out of it. Instead, it's taken hold elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, more than 40 percent of new homes — and more than 80 percent of single-family homes — are fabricated off-site.\n\nThe Center for American Progress's plan proposes a slew of projects to take this industry America invented and make it one where America is a leader. They want the government to seed a major research program to fund innovation in housing construction. They want to have the federal government leverage its purchasing power to become an initial buyer for modular housing — one idea here would be to have the Department of Defense upgrade its military base housing using modular construction. They want to modernize building codes to make modular easier — removing, for instance, an outdated federal requirement to attach a permanent steel chassis to all modular construction — and updating federal insurance and financing rules to make sure modular production qualifies.\n\nYou could imagine states and cities acting even before the federal government does. \"New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production,\" says Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's housing plan. \"But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit.\"\n\nLeft unsaid in his plan is that publicly subsidized, affordable housing has become monstrously expensive to construct because the public money triggers rules and process and reviews and negotiations that market-rate housing doesn't contend with. A Rand study found that, per square foot, affordable housing cost more than 1.5 times as much to build in California as market-rate housing; a Washington Post investigation revealed an affordable housing development in D.C. where the units cost $800,000 each to build, even as the same developer was building market-rate units for $350,000 next door. One reason we don't build enough affordable housing is we've made affordable housing unaffordable to build.\n\nMamdani proposed investing $100 billion to build 200,000 \"publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes\" over the next decade. That works out to $500,000 per unit — if all goes well. What if New York City became a test case for how modular construction could allow public housing, ordered and built at massive scale, in unionized factories, to become cheaper and faster to build than market-rate housing? If it was only $350,000 per unit, that would mean building almost 300,000 units for the same cost.\n\nOne problem the modular housing industry has faced is the absence of steady demand to keep the factories running and work out the kinks of construction. A place like New York City that wanted to build public housing at scale, over a long period of time, could create that steady demand and use it to seed an industry — New York could become America's leader in modular construction.\n\nPerhaps that's fanciful. But our thinking on housing — both public and private — has been far too small for far too long. We've accepted shocking cost increases paired with stagnating productivity. We've made it impossible for tens of millions of families to build the lives they want in the cities they'd ideally choose. At this point, making it possible to build more housing just isn't enough. We need to change how we build housing. I don't know if modular housing is really the answer. But it's worth trying.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The housing market keeps getting worse.

Butler faces several years behind bars after making repeated threats against former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. The threats, which were delivered through a series of crude phone calls and messages, have resulted in a five-year prison sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Thomas T. Cullen, as announced by authorities on Friday.\n\nButler was found guilty of seven counts of knowingly and willfully threatening the president and other successors to the presidency. This verdict followed a two-day bench trial, underscoring the serious nature of his offenses.\n\nIn response to the sentencing, acting United States Attorney Robert N. Tracci emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of the political process. “Threats of violence against elected officials affront the political process and the rule of law,” Tracci said. “This office will seek clear accountability against those who threaten public officials with acts of violence.”\n\nDetails from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia revealed that Butler made several alarming phone calls in early December 2022. During these calls to a state probation and parole office, Butler threatened the lives of then-President Biden and then-Vice President Harris.\n\nProsecutors highlighted voicemails in which Butler expressed his intentions to kill the top officials in the nation. He made explicit threats, stating plans to arm himself with a “MAK 90,” a type of semiautomatic firearm, and expressed a desire to “jump over the fence” at the White House to carry out his threats against the President.\n\nAs detailed in the criminal complaint, one specific incident occurred on December 1, 2022, when Butler left a voicemail for a state probation officer. In the message, he declared his intention to kill President Joe Biden, saying, “whenever I get the chance, Imma kill the President Joe Biden” and adding, “I’m going to DC one way or another and I’m gonna do it.”\n\nThat same day, he spoke to a different probation officer and made multiple threats, including telling her he was going to “buy a gun from a street” and “aim it at the Secret Service people,” followed by, “I’m just going to kill the President.”\n\nIn an interview with federal agents, prosecutors say Butler admitted to making the calls. He also explained that he planned to obtain a gun from a friend and travel to the nation’s capital, where he would kill multiple Secret Service members to get to the president.\n\n“Butler stated that he is an anarchist and believes that he must kill President Biden because of the evil that has been done by the military and actions taken by former President [Barack] Obama when Biden was the Vice-President,” federal agents wrote in a probable cause affidavit included with the complaint.\n\nButler was convicted in 2014 in the Eastern District of Virginia for making similar threats against then-President Obama and then-Vice President Biden, court records show.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft: US President Joe Biden speaks at Florida Memorial University on Nov.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Man Sentenced for Threatening President Biden and VP Harris: Justice Served in High-Profile Case first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/man-sentenced-for-threatening-president-biden-and-vp-harris-justice-served-in-high-profile-case/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Man-who-threatened-to-kill-Biden-Harris-is-sentenced.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 03:09:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":381894658,"title":"Majority of Hispanic Republican voters say president’s policies are ‘harmful’ – up double-digits from first term: poll","text":"Hispanic Republican voters appear to be turning on President Trump – with a majority indicating that the commander in chief’s policies have been “harmful” to Latinos, according to a new poll. \n\nThe Pew Research Center survey of nearly 5,000 Latino adults, released Monday, found Hispanics, including Republicans, are far more critical of Trump’s second term than his first – and the president’s support among the key voting bloc is eroding as his latest stint in the White House progresses. \n\nOverall, 78% of Hispanics rated the Trump administration’s policies as harmful to Latinos – up from 69% in 2019. \n\nAmong just Hispanic Republicans, 55% said Trump’s policies have been harmful – a 17 percentage point increase from the president’s first term, when only 38% of Hispanic Republicans suggested Trump’s agenda was hurting Latinos. \n\nHispanic Republicans have also soured on the president’s immigration agenda – marked by a ramp-up in arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants and federal law enforcement and troops sealing off the southern border. \n\nAbout half, 47%, indicated Trump is doing “too much” when it comes to deportations, a nearly 20 point jump from the 28% who thought the president was overdoing it in March. \n\nHispanic Trump voters overwhelmingly continue to approve of the president’s job performance, but the president’s 81% support from MAGA Latinos is down from the 93% approval he had at the start of his second term, the poll found. \n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson touted Trump’s second-term accomplishments and said the president “will continue delivering” for Americans. \n\n“In a short time, President Trump has already delivered on many of the promises he was elected to enact, but there will always be more to accomplish,” Jackson told The Post. \n\n“He’s secured the border; tackled Biden’s inflation crisis; lowered drug prices; ended taxes on tips, overtime, and social security; cooled inflation; deported criminal illegal aliens; implemented important reforms putting American workers first; and more,” she added. “Every single day he’s working hard to continue fulfilling the many promises he made and he will continue delivering.”\n\nJaime Florez, the Republican National Committee’s Hispanic communications director, blamed Trump’s lagging poll numbers on the way the media has covered the administration’s immigration crackdown and the “complete disaster” the Biden administration wrought on the economy. “I think that one of the reasons why some Hispanics are not very happy with the president has to do with the coverage – the biased coverage — some media is doing about the policy of deporting illegal immigrants,” Florez said. “The perception people have is completely negative,” the RNC spokesman said of Trump’s immigration policy. “This is nothing different from what happened in other administrations. You know, there were more deportations during the Obama administration than they were during the first Trump administration, but the perception is that Trump is anti-immigrant, which is not a fact.”\n\nOn the economy, Florez said Hispanics, like all Americans, “want prices to go down,” but they may not be coming down “as fast as expected” under Trump. “It’s not a matter of if it’s happening or it’s not happening,” he said of prices. “It is the speed that people are concerned about.” \n\nThe good news for Trump in the Pew Research Center survey, conducted in October, is that Hispanic Republicans were far more satisfied with the state of the economy under him than former President Joe Biden. \n\nThe share of Hispanic Republicans describing the US economy as excellent or good has more than doubled since last year – 19% to 40%. \n\nAdditionally, 39% of Hispanic Republicans indicated that since Trump took office, his policies have improved economic conditions – higher than those who said Trump’s policies made conditions worse (31%) or have had no effect (29%).\n\nTrump’s huge gains with Hispanics helped propel him to victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, but the Pew Research Center survey is the latest in a string of unfavorable Latino-centered polls for the president. \n\nLast week, CNN data expert Harry Enten expressed shock at one of the outlet’s surveys pegging Trump 38 points underwater on the issue of immigration compared to October 2024 – when Latino voters gave Harris only a slight, 2 percentage point edge over Trump on immigration. \n\n“Whatever Donald Trump is doing in office in the minds of Latinos, it is not working,” Enten said. “They have turned against him in massive, massive numbers.”","summary":"Among just Hispanic Republicans, 55% said Trump’s policies have been harmful – a 17 percentage point increase from the president’s first term, when only 38% of Hispanic Republicans suggested Trump’s agenda was hurting Latinos. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/24/us-news/majority-of-hispanic-republicans-say-presidents-policies-are-harmful-up-double-digits-from-first-term-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Untitled-1-35-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mru02mMg-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-25 01:39:34","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":381899918,"title":"Latinos report growing pessimism under Trump's administration, finds new survey; Major disapproval against US immigration and economic policies","text":"ReutersResidents of a Hispanic neighbourhood watch a gathering of fellow community members and activists across the street from the site of a concluded raid by federal authorities as they expand their crackdown on illegal immigration, in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nLatinos have grown markedly more pessimistic in the year since the 2024 presidential election, with many saying their personal situation and the nation’s direction have worsened. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that large shares of US Hispanics are critical of President Donald Trump’s second-term performance, especially on immigration and the economy - two issues that played a major role in their voting decisions last year.According to the survey, 70% of Latinos disapprove of Trump’s job performance, while 65% are dissatisfied with his administration’s approach to immigration. Another 61% say Trump’s economic policies have made national conditions worse. These findings underscore a significant erosion of confidence even among a demographic that shifted toward Trump in 2024. Nearly half of Latino voters backed him that year - a sharp rise from 2020 and 2016.The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 8,046 US adults - including 4,923 Hispanics - from October 6 to 16, using samples from the probability-based American Trends Panel and the SSRS Opinion Panel. A second survey, fielded September 22–28, 2025, included 3,445 US adults and 629 Hispanics, and was also drawn from the American Trends Panel.(Image Credit: Pew Research Center)TRUMP’S APPROVAL AMONG LATINOS DECLINEStill, Latino views remain deeply polarized along partisan and electoral lines. Among Latinos who voted for Trump, 81% continue to approve of the president’s performance, though this is down considerably from 93% at the start of his second term. Conversely, nearly all Latinos who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 election express strong disapproval of Trump, mirroring the broader divisions seen across the US population.Live EventsTrump’s second term has brought sweeping policy changes. His administration has implemented aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, stepping up detentions and deportations of undocumented immigrants. On the economic front, the White House has advanced major tariff initiatives and enacted the 'Big Beautiful Bill', a tax and budget package that has reshaped federal priorities.Latinos now make up one-fifth of the US population and remain one of the fastest-growing groups in the electorate and labor force. The new survey, based on responses from 4,923 Latino adults in October 2025, provides a detailed look at how this influential community views its place in America and the direction of the Trump administration.APA sign protesting deportations is part of an 'ofrenda' for the commemoration of Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) at El Colegio High School in Minneapolis on November 1.LATINOS SAY THEIR SITUATION IN AMERICA IS DETERIORATINGHispanics express growing pessimism about their standing in the United States. Nearly two-thirds (68%) say the situation of US Hispanics is worse than it was a year ago, while only 9% believe it has improved and 22% say it has stayed the same.This marks the first time in nearly 20 years of Pew Research Center Hispanic surveys that a majority say their situation has deteriorated. By comparison, 39% said conditions had worsened in 2019, late in Trump’s first term, and just 26% said the same in 2021.Views of the Trump administration’s impact have also turned sharply negative. Today, 78% of Hispanics say the administration’s policies harm Hispanics, while only 10% say they help. These assessments are more critical than in 2019, when 69% viewed Trump’s earlier policies as harmful.Feelings of belonging have eroded as well. More than half of Latinos (55%) report serious concerns about their place in American society under Trump’s presidency, up from 48% in 2019.(Image Credit: Pew Research Center)UNREST AMONG LATINOS OVER IMMIGRATIONAccording to 2024 American Community Survey estimates, 44% of Latino adults - about 21.1 million people - are immigrants, reported new Pew Research. Immigration has been central to Donald Trump’s second-term agenda, marked by expanded efforts to detain and deport immigrants living in the country without legal status. As enforcement has intensified, concern within Latino communities has risen sharply. Today, 52% of Latino adults say they worry a lot or somewhat that they, a family member, or a close friend could be deported, up from 42% in March. This concern is especially common among younger Latinos, immigrants, Harris voters, and those with Central American roots.A majority (59%) also report seeing or hearing about ICE raids or arrests in their communities in the past six months. These enforcement actions have prompted shifts in daily behavior: 19% of Latinos say they have altered their routines out of fear of being asked to prove their legal status, and 11% now carry documents showing citizenship or immigration status more frequently.Criticism of the administration’s deportation approach has grown, with 71% saying it is doing too much - up from 56% in March. Despite these concerns, most Latino adults (82% in 2023) hold full legal status, while 18% are unauthorized immigrants.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump administration immigration policiesHispanic voter sentiment 2025economic policies Trump disapprovalTrump economic impact on HispanicsUS Latino community perspectivePew Research Center Latino surveyHispanics views on AmericaPew Research CenterlatinosDonald Trump\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Según AP VoteCast, el 43% de los votantes hispanos a nivel nacional apoyaron a Trump, frente al 35% en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020, que perdió ante el demócrata Joe Biden.\n\nLa gran mayoría de los hispanos que informaron haber votado por Trump en 2024 (81%) aprueban el desempeño del presidente, comparado con 93% que tenía al inicio de su segundo mandato. Casi todos los votantes hispanos de Harris desaprueban el desempeño de Trump.\n\nLos hallazgos de Pew reflejan una encuesta de octubre de The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, que encontró que el 25% de los adultos hispanos tienen una opinión “algo” o “muy” favorable de Trump, frente al 44% en una encuesta de AP-NORC realizada justo antes de que el republicano asumiera el cargo en enero.\n\nEl cambio en la opinión subraya cuán preocupados e insatisfechos se sienten muchos adultos hispanos.

Estas opiniones son más negativas que en 2019, cuando 7 de cada 10 dijeron que las políticas de la primera administración de Trump eran más perjudiciales que beneficiosas para los hispanos.\n\nLos hispanos que son demócratas o se inclinan hacia el Partido Demócrata piensan abrumadoramente que los hispanos en Estados Unidos están peor, como grupo, que hace un año, pero también lo piensan el 43% de los republicanos hispanos y los que se inclinan hacia el Partido Republicano.\n\nAmplias preocupaciones sobre la represión migratoria\n\nEn los últimos meses, las comunidades hispanas han sido un objetivo de la mano dura del presidente contra la inmigración.\n\nHoy en día, el 44% de los adultos latinos son inmigrantes, sumando 21,1 millones, según un análisis que hizo el Pew de las estimaciones de la Oficina del Censo de Estados Unidos con datos de la Encuesta de la Comunidad Estadounidense de 2024.\n\nAnte el aumento de las redadas migratorias, el 52% de los adultos hispanos dicen que les preocupa “mucho” o “algo” que ellos, un familiar o un amigo cercano puedan ser deportados.

According to AP VoteCast, 43% of Hispanic voters nationally supported Trump, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe vast majority of Hispanics who reported voting for Trump in 2024 — 81% — approve of the president’s job performance, although that’s declined from 93% at the start of his second term. Nearly all Hispanic Harris voters disapprove of Trump’s performance.\n\nPew’s findings echo an October survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which found that 25% of Hispanic adults have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of Trump, down from 44% in an AP-NORC poll conducted just before the Republican took office in January.\n\nThe shift in opinion underscores how worried and dissatisfied many Hispanic adults feel. Although many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year’s election, recent polls indicate that Hispanic adults continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans overall.\n\nHispanic voters made up 10% of the electorate in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, and the number of eligible Hispanic voters has been growing rapidly in recent decades.\n\nRising anxiety about Hispanics’ place in the U.S.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the situation for Hispanics in the U.S. is worse than it was a year ago.

Smith recorded an unplanned podcast late Friday evening, addressing Jason Whitlock, whom he called the \"devil in the flesh.\" Smith said that although he had promised never to mention Whitlock's name again, he felt compelled to respond to comments Whitlock made about his father on Sage Steele's podcast last week. \"Do a deep dive on Stephen A’s book and the way he went after his father in his book, as opposed to what he used to say about his father in interviews,\" Whitlock said when Steele asked him about the inconsistencies he found in Smith's 2023 memoir. \"You can go look up, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, what Stephen A said about his father — no criticism at all, mostly praise. Certainly no criticism,\" Whitlock continued. \"And then he comes out with this book where he basically says he had an absentee father, that he can’t stand his father, and that it’s all about his mother. That’s trying to put Stephen A in the feminist lane, in the ‘support of the matriarchy’ lane … he had a completely different narrative about his dad than he does now.\" Appearing in a split screen with his business partner Kevin Frazier and nephew Josh, Smith insisted he \"never spoke negatively\" about his father because his \"mother asked [him] not to.\" \"My mother’s exact words to me were, ‘Do it when I’m dead and gone. Don’t do it when I’m alive and I have to live with the words that you have to say about your father,’\" Smith said, quoting his late mother. \"What I did in speaking about my father was talk about what he did and the effect that it had on our family. I never said that I didn’t love him. I never said that I hated him. I never said any of those things. What I said was that I resented the impact that it had on our family and on my mother. But I never spoke about it because my mother always asked me to be quiet until she was dead and gone.\" In other words, Smith admitted that the version of his father’s story he tells now isn’t the one he told early in his career. So why the emergency 45-minute rebuttal? Because, as OutKick has long noted, Smith reflexively launches into emotional, rambling monologues whenever he’s under attack. His first instinct is to overcompensate or deflect attention elsewhere. Last month, Smith faced backlash from what he called the \"black community\" after questioning whether Rep. Jasmine Crockett was more interested in viral media attention than in representing her constituents. While initially claiming he wouldn’t \"back down,\" we predicted he would quickly cave. Since that prediction, Smith has: – Apologized to Crockett, calling her a \"sister.\"– Apologized to Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama for reasons unknown.– Appeared on CNN with Laura Coates, challenging anyone who thinks he’s conservative to listen to his liberal views.– Backtracked on his previous support for Trump deploying the National Guard.– Challenged LeBron James to be more supportive of black journalists.– Blamed Trump for the NBA gambling investigation, despite it predating Trump.– Suggested the Miami Dolphins unfairly fired general manager Chris Grier because he's black. It’s reminiscent of last year, when Smith cited a poll during a Fox News appearance about black male support for Trump. After the usual outrage, he launched another week-long apology tour, praising Michelle Obama and accusing white people of racism. When reached by OutKick earlier this month, Smith said he didn’t like, agree with, or respect my coverage. Unfortunately, he didn't offer specifics. After he cooled down, I left an open invitation for him to address anything I had written about him in any media format he chose. We hope he eventually agrees to a discussion. The core issue for Stephen A. Smith is that he’s trying to play too many roles at once, trying to satisfy too many different power players. At ESPN, he must placate his Disney bosses, \"the black community,\" WME, and NBA athletes. Elsewhere, he needs to continue convincing his touring partners, Chris Cuomo and Bill O’Reilly, that he’s the anti-woke centrist between their political extremes. On right-wing talk radio, Smith plays the disillusioned Democrat who's coming around on Trump. On CNN, he fans the flames about the GOP's supposed lack of respect for democracy. All the while, he understands he cannot draw the ire of the Democratic leaders, in the event he launches a campaign in 2028. Now, add the NFL to the list of groups he must appease. The NFL is in the process of acquiring a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Smith is also now a contributor to Monday Night Football, which he touted as part of his new $100 million contract. He’s well aware of how much influence the leagues have over pregame programming. As the story goes, the NBA had previously blocked ESPN from allowing Smith to appear during the Finals. Commissioner Roger Goodell, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft are the three most powerful figures in the NFL. Smith has already cozied up to Jones, recently sitting with him in a suite during a Cowboys game. But his recent comments likely didn’t sit well with Kraft or Goodell. Last week, Smith hosted First Take from Bethune–Cookman, a private HBCU, alongside Ryan Clark and Cam Newton. Playing to the crowd, he called white Patriots quarterback Drake Maye a \"liar\" for claiming he didn’t know Newton was on First Take. \"[Drake Maye] is a liar… First Take is the number one morning show… don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that. Don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that Cam Newton is on this show. You lying,\" Smith said. The outburst was popular on set but not elsewhere. Even media watchdogs criticized him for belittling the 23-year-old quarterback simply for not watching his show. \"Self-manufactured Drake Maye feud shows the biggest flaw of First Take,\" Awful Announcing wrote. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy demanded an apology: \"You call the MVP of the league a liar? Well, you owe us. Me, Drake Maye, the Krafts, all Patriots fans, an apology.\" And that’s where Jason Whitlock comes in. There’s one tried-and-true way to get back into the good graces of the sports media establishment. And that's to shift the negative attention back toward Whitlock, Clay Travis, or me. Take the former, bitter sportswriter who now pens a weekly Substack column to convince the cool kids he's on the right side of the culture war. His most-read story is a factually challenged hit piece about me. His fifth most-read is another hit piece, one about Jason Whitlock. It’s not hard to see why. Mina Kimes and Jemele Hill loved the stories and shared them with the audiences the author wants to impress. Likewise, Smith successfully deflected the attention away from his juvenile remarks about Maye by inserting Whitlock into the discussion. The same blogs criticizing Smith early last week now credit him for \"destroy[ing]\" Whitlock by calling him fat and a \"walrus.\" Just like that, Smith is the good guy again. Whitlock is the boogeyman. It’s a familiar play. Two years ago, Smith faced widespread criticism after Terrell Owens and Marcellus Wiley called out his poor treatment of his former white co-host, Max Kellerman, whom Owens previously declared \"blacker\" than Smith. In response, Smith posted a profanity-laced rant in which he branded Whitlock \"worse than a white supremacist.\" The cool kids of sports media loved Smith's attack. Now you see why Smith suddenly accused LeBron James of favoring white reporters after a BLM leader accused Smith of favoring white members of Congress. Or why he called me a \"liar\" on New York radio in 2021 after my report about his control over First Take, which he later confirmed and bragged about. Deflection is his only defense. Amusingly, Smith says he wrote his memoir to reveal the \"real Stephen A.\" But the real Stephen A. is the one we see – someone who is willing to play any role for fame and fortune, quick to conjure a boogeyman when he needs to redirect blame. That’s why he broke his own rule and said Whitlock’s name again last week.","summary":"Here&apos;s the truth about Stephen A.

I think that is — that’s all behind what campaign finance reform was all about. We’re inheriting a world that was created by the intersections of the attack on voting rights and the attack on campaign finance reform, right? This is the world bequeathed to us by the Supreme Court, given to us by the most dominant person on that Supreme Court right now, which is Clarence Thomas.\n\nSo, what is it that money is allowing politics to become? How is it that a coherent project of dismantling the government, and the societal consensus that there is work to be done — and will continue to be work to be done — to make this a truly multiracial democracy? It’s always going to be a post-slavery, post-genocide, post-segregation society, but what kind of ‘post’ that looks like?\n\nIs it going to be a complete repudiation of that history, a dismantling of that history, and a building of a new democracy built on the foundation of repudiating that stuff? Is it going to be that — is that what we mean by post? Or is it just, oh, that happened a long time ago, we don’t talk about it anymore, and, in fact, we’re going to create laws that make it impossible to talk about it? Because if you don’t talk about it, you don’t name it, you don’t see it playing out in contemporary society, then that undermines the very basis for doing anything about it. It undermines equal opportunity. It undermines the Voting Rights Act, which we may lose because of this effort to push history off the table.\n\nSo the last and most important part of our report on anti-Blackness is how to connect it with the assault on museums, the assault on critical race theory, the assault on books. When we look at books that are being censored, 40% of them are written by people of color, women, or queer people. The idea is just to take the words out of our mouths, take the audience away — so what we saw in 2020 doesn’t happen again.\n\nBacon: This obviously matters. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be trying to ban them.\n\nCrenshaw: Exactly. My mentor always tells me, Kim, dogs don’t bark at parked cars. They’re coming after critical race theory, 1619, intersectionality because these ideas mobilized people; they gave them the language to actually articulate what they were seeing with their own eyes. When you see something, you look for a way to express it, a way to represent your outrage about it. These were the kinds of conversations that the George Floyd–Breonna Taylor moment created for the entire society.\n\nSo, did we see backlash coming? Absolutely. I mean, that is the history of America. Whenever we go two steps forward, we go a few steps back. The problem was: were we going to go further back than two steps? Were we going to be like the end of Reconstruction, where we had eight years in power and nearly eight decades of racial tyranny? Is it going to be that kind of backlash? And I think that’s the moment that we’re in right now.\n\nIt’s clear that it’s a backlash. It’s clear that all those companies that jumped out there — Target, McDonalds, we can go on and on — that declared their commitment to racial justice are now on a whoops, we went too far, and now they’re correcting. And the question is: is that correction going to be for the rest of this century? The rest of our lifetimes? It’s definitely going to go beyond 2028, and that is precisely why we are trying to call liberals and progressives into the conversation, because the distance that this will go is not really going to be determined by MAGA. They’re on brand. They’re going to ride this to the end of the earth and beyond.\n\nThe question is: are we going to be able to galvanize our resources and our commitments? Remember what happens when race gets erased. Remember what it was that galvanized so many people in 2020, and galvanized people in 1964, and galvanized people in 1863. Are we going to remember that those are the true moments where we were making our democracy? When we were willing to step back and make deals and disenfranchise entire groups of people — that is when our democracy faltered, and that is when we lost our power.\n\nBacon: So, Pete Buttigieg was at the Texas Tribune’s Festival maybe two weeks ago, and he gave this speech about how we lost our way because we started talking about identity so much. That was the only thing people heard from us. Okay, so that’s what he said. I think, due respect to Pete Buttigieg, he’s someone who wants to be elected president. I think he’s trying to figure out where things are.\n\nWhat do we want the sort of aspiring Democrat to sound like when talking about the sort of race — the place of where we are in race right now? What do we want that person to sound like? Because a President Buttigieg is not going to bring us forward very much. We need the next administration to move us out of this.\n\nAnd what is that? What do you want — a language that is both appealing to maybe middle America but also moves us in the right direction?\n\nCrenshaw: Yeah, I’m going to be frank at this moment. Pete should be the last one talking about identity at this moment as being the problem. I’m sure he wouldn’t say that marriage equality is about identity politics. I’m sure he wouldn’t say his right to raise his children is identity politics gone too far. But what would he say about affirmative action, or what would he say about issues that have to do with the history of Blackness being a constraint.\n\nSo, number one, I would be very cautious about giving an inch to the idea that what Democrats have failed to do is to distance themselves from identity politics. The party of the Democrats gave us the Voting Rights Act. It gave us Medicaid, Medicare. It gave us the things that we take for granted and that we build on to expand rights. We can’t start then dismantling that stuff because what that basically means is we’re drawing divisions between some constituencies whose rights have come out of this moment, this movement, and others. That’s a disaster for us.\n\nI think the second thing that I would want our politicians to do is stop listening to the pollsters who are making stuff up, finding groups of people to convey that stuff. We did polling and focus group work in Virginia in the aftermath of Youngkin’s victory, and we found very different things than the folks who are looking for evidence that its identity politics that defeated us. We heard from white voters — likely white Democratic voters — who were pissed off, angry that their party, the party that they cast their votes for, the party that they believe has their best interests in mind were so anxious to throw overboard a whole range of interests that they believed in, in search for the Reagan voter who left a generation ago and is unlikely to come back. \n\nThey want a full-throated argument for the kind of democracy that they think Democrats embrace. They don’t want a lot of pivoting — and I call it shucking and jiving — around the question of how our democracy has broken and what we need to do to fix it.\n\nSo, I think there is a polling industrial complex that has gotten behind the idea that there are certain things we can’t talk about. I think you hear it bubbling up with Ezra Klein and the whole thing about how Charlie Kirk practiced politics the right way, and Democrats who are willing to say we should model him. The only way they can do that is to not talk about white supremacy and racism. And the only way you can do that is to say: you folks who have to deal with that, deal with that on your private time — we’re not bringing this into mainstream politics.\n\nThat, to me, feels like disenfranchisement. It’s not that the Democrats are signing on to you can’t vote. They’re signing on to we’re going to remove things for you to vote for, right? We’re not going to talk about the things that really matter to you. We’re not going to talk about the racism that is now everywhere. We’re not going to talk about the fact that Coast Guard has now said that a noose and a swastika are no longer hate symbols. \n\nPeople need to see what is happening, know that the history tells us that the last time that the party of racial justice decided to step back and negotiate a settlement with the party that represented white supremacy, we lost our right to vote. And with it we lost a whole range of policies for generations. We can’t afford that now.\n\nBacon: Let me do my democratic pundit, white pundit imitation here. Did you know that Donald Trump won more Black voters than any Republican since Ronald Reagan? Did you—you know, maybe Perry Bacon and Crenshaw educated people with college degrees, but the regular working-class African Americans really like Donald Trump, and maybe BLM turned them off.\n\nHow do you respond to that?\n\nCrenshaw: That is what they say. I have a couple of things. First of all, we are still talking about 87-plus percent of Black people — Black men — voting against Donald Trump.\n\nBacon: Have you interviewed every black man who voted for Donald Trump?\n\nCrenshaw: No, you definitely got to start with your baseline of single-digit percentages. And you also have to deal with the disproportionate number of Black women who saw the handwriting on the wall, understood what was happening when they went after Kamala Harris and Claudine Gay, and said hell to the no.\n\nAnd let’s also point this out: Black people are disproportionately working class. Black women are disproportionately working class. Black women’s median wealth is less than a hundred dollars. So, what I push back on is: if it was really about class, explain to me why Black women — who have more incentive than anybody else to vote for the class-forward president — understood exactly what he was going to do, which is make life harder for working-class people.\n\nSo, I turn that around: that’s your identity politics showing right now, right? You’re writing Black people and Black women out of your class concern, and you’re putting white middle-class people in. I remind them that the January 6th people were not working-class people. These were people, middle income if not higher, who were basically in communities that have undergone dramatic demographic shifts.\n\nNow, if you want to talk about identity politics, let’s talk about that. And if you think that not talking about xenophobia, not talking about — and trying to disabuse people of the idea that because Trump is white and he’s talking to their whiteness, that he’s got them on speed dial and he’s concerned about them…\n\nYou cannot disconnect them from their investment by not talking about it. That is magical thinking. And that magical thinking has gotten us into trouble before, and it’s going to get us into trouble now if we’re willing to let our base go and let our values go, trying to pursue the people who don’t want you.\n\nBacon: Let’s finish. That was great, I’m glad you said this. I’m late, but let’s finish with this: Donald Trump is president for another three years, sadly. So, what do we do? If anti-Blackness is the trope — one of the powerful weapons he’s using — what do, we do for these next three years?\n\nCrenshaw: I think the number one thing that we have to do is insist on refusing to comply — refusing the preemptive concession.\n\nThis is what we’re seeing everywhere. We’re seeing it. I teach at Columbia University. We’re seeing it in law firms — I’m a lawyer — we’re seeing people comply without sometimes even being fully forced to. And we see the compliance first coming on DEI, first coming on the places where their commitments were weak.\n\nWe cannot allow that compliance to be cost-free. Because unless we change the equation on the ground, there really is no reason for Target, for the law firms, for the foundations to say, Look, this is a hot potato. We know he doesn’t like this stuff. He’s shown us he doesn’t like it. Let’s give in on it.\n\nWhen that happens, our institutions and our allies — they’re not becoming neutralized. They become part of the army that’s dismantling our democracy. I used this analogy the other day and some of my friends said, “you watched that?” I used to be a big Game of Thrones fan, and I remember when the evil army would kill the good folks, let’s say. It wasn’t just that the army we were rooting for lost their soldiers and weapons — those people became the army on the other side.\n\nSo, I remember when the dragon got killed and I was like, ‘Oh, dang — she lost her dragon.’ And then when it rose again as the ice dragon, I was like, that’s a double loss. Every time they take somebody out, they come back on the other side, and they become a weapon for dismantling a democracy.\n\nSo, look at the law firms. The law firms not only have been pushed out of defending people like us — now some of them are taking on Trump’s agenda. So, they’ve become the ice dragon on the other side.\n\nThe same with our universities. Not only are our universities backing away from active recruiting, but they’re also buying into this idea that there’s such a thing as too many Black people on campus — because that will raise questions about what we’re doing. So, across the board, I’m seeing our allies saying the one thing that we can do to be safe is not talk about your stuff and not realizing that not talking about our stuff is undermining all of us.\n\nWe’re all about trying to say: look, number one, a lot of this stuff is not legal, it’s not required. You have got to be willing to fight — people shed blood and gave their lives to get to this point. So, it’s not for you to be comfortable. Fascism doesn’t thrive because people resist comfort; it thrives because they can still go to the restaurants, they can still go to movies, and they can still kick people under the bus.\n\nWe’ve got to understand what kind of fight we’re in, and it does mean discomfort. It does mean the willingness to fight, and sometimes that fight has to be our own cave. We often say that the call is coming from inside the house, right? The horror movie — when you think it’s all out there, but it’s actually in the house. We’ve got stuff in the house, and that’s why we did this report: so, people can figure out where in the house they need to look, and where they need to fight back.\n\nBacon: Dr. Crenshaw tell people when they can find this report.\n\nCrenshaw: You can find the report at our website is www.aapf.org. AAPF stands for the African American Policy Form so you can find the report there.\n\nAnd check out Freedom to Learn. Because we’re trying to defend the Smithsonian, and all of the black history that they’re destroying as a way to make us illiterate.\n\nAnd when you’re illiterate, you’re easier to control. We all know that.\n\nBacon: And then where, since you’re such a brilliant thinker, where can we find your thoughts? Are you on social media anywhere?\n\nCrenshaw: So, I’m old school and a little bit of new school. So, my largest, my largest following used to be on X. But I don’t post there anymore. You can find me on BlueSky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nBacon: That’s a lot. Are you doing a newsletter? Everybody’s a newsletter these days. Where are you writing these days?\n\nCrenshaw: My producer would kill me if I didn’t say that we have a podcast, an award-winning podcast called Intersectionality Matters. We just won a Silver Anthem award for our special episode on Selma 60 years later. If you don’t listen to anything, please go and listen to that. It gives you both the understanding about why voting rights are so vital right now and what we need to do to defend it. And we also have a special series in the podcast on the true history of critical race theory called The United States of Amnesia. So, if you want receipts, you have a sense that what you’re hearing isn’t quite right, but you don’t have time to read that big red book, go check out Intersectionality Matters. We have a special series on critical race theory there.\n\nBacon: And we’ll stop there. I’ve met you a couple of times, and I’m always excited to talk to you — somebody I read when I was in college, not to make you feel old, but hopefully to help you understand you’ve had an impact on so many people. So, thanks for joining me, and I appreciate it. Good to see you.\n\nCrenshaw: Thank you, Perry. A pleasure.","url":"https://newrepublic.com/article/203616/transcript-anti-blackness-core-ingredient-trump-politics","image":"https://images.newrepublic.com/5fec79098ef2ed9e9c7ab6e1d19bf0648ce29d84.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:00:00","author":"Right Now With","authors":["Right Now With"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":382157230,"title":"AOC BUILT HER OWN POLITICAL MACHINE. NOW SHE’S DECIDING HER NEXT MOVE.","text":"AOC BUILT HER OWN POLITICAL MACHINE. NOW SHE’S DECIDING HER NEXT MOVE.\n\n\n Staff \n November 25, 2025 \n\n\n\nSeven years after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leapt onto the national stage as an outsider, she’s learned an inside game and is considering a run for Senate or president.\n\nEarlier this year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received an unlikely request: A former colleague who once excoriated her brand of left-wing politics wanted her assistance.\n\nThe New York Democrat was happy to help.\n\nShe sent out a fall fundraising email calling centrist candidate Abigail Spanberger “a brawler for the working class” — putting her stamp of approval on a former congresswoman who once fumed after a disappointing 2020 election season that she didn’t want Democrats to “use the word ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again.” Their mutual embrace — unthinkable just a few years ago — shows the influence the democratic socialist has amassed in a party that once saw her more as hostile actor than helpful supporter.\n\nThe same early November night that Spanberger romped to victory in the Virginia governor’s race, Ocasio-Cortez squeezed her fellow democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in a tight hug after he was elected mayor of New York, putting an exclamation point on an election season in which she was in high demand across the party spectrum. At his victory party, she made her way from news camera to news camera, telling the establishment Democrats watching that his win — boosted by her early endorsement — had put them on notice.\n\n“The Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future,” she told CNN from the celebration in Brooklyn.\n\nOnce dismissed by Nancy Pelosi as a social media phenomenon with no real power on Capitol Hill, Ocasio-Cortez, 36, has become one of the most significant Democrats in a party shaken to its core by another Donald Trump victory and searching for a winning identity. A leadership vacuum has opened the door to new standard-bearers, and a furious base is hungry for politicians who show more fight. This dynamic has created an opportunity for Ocasio-Cortez, a -238125109537500rebellious outsider who has learned to play the inside game.\n\nSeven years after catapulting onto the national scene with a seismic primary upset, Ocasio-Cortez remains a polarizing figure nationally, with more Americans holding an unfavorable view of her than a favorable one, according to a Washington Post-Ipsos poll conducted in September. But some things have changed. Establishment Democrats who once shunned her are eager to work with her. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), the two-time presidential candidate who is now in his 80s and unlikely to run again, is promoting her at every turn. And she has built a massive war chest and loyal small-dollar fundraising base that rival those of anyone in the party.\n\nNow Ocasio-Cortez is at a crossroads, facing decisions about what to do with the movement she has built and the relationships she has developed. She is seriously weighing a Senate or presidential run in 2028, according to three people familiar with her plans, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations. The former path could pit her against Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer, while the latter would make her an entrant in what many expect to be a crowded and wide-open Democratic primary.\n\n“I know I’m being asked about New York — that is years from now,” Ocasio-Cortez recently told reporters, referring to the possibility of a Senate run. “I have to remind my own constituents, because they think that this election is this year.”\n\nThis portrait of her political trajectory is based on interviews with more than a dozen Democratic operatives, lawmakers and activists.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who declined an interview request for this article, feels an obligation to the populist, liberal movement she has championed to have a voice in the next presidential election, according to the three people familiar with her thinking.\n\n“I think in their most ambitious moments they say: The progressive movement, is it going to survive if there’s no one leading it in a presidential race?” one of the people said of Ocasio-Cortez and her team.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez would not make a symbolic run, according to a person who has spoken to her, and she does not believe she needs to be the progressive standard-bearer in the race provided another person steps up to fill that role. “If she runs, she wants to win,” that person said.\n\nNot all Democrats welcome the prospect of an AOC presidential run, especially so soon after Kamala Harris, whom Republicans painted as a radical San Francisco liberal, lost to Trump. Republicans have attacked Ocasio-Cortez as an extremist for years. Trump has insulted the Latina congresswoman— calling her “one of the ‘dumbest’ people in Congress” and suggesting she and other members of the House’s “Squad” of liberal women of color “go back” to where they came from — while right-wing influencers have gone after her in sexist terms. Democrats reject these attacks but some fear they’ve damaged her. Others believe the party must tack to the center on social issues and crime to win presidential elections — not run one of its most liberal figures.\n\n“I think the right wing’s done such a number on her that I think she’ll have a difficult time,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, a former union leader and Sanders ally. “I hope she runs for the Senate.”\n\nMany grassroots liberals are angry at Schumer’s handling of his caucus in the Trump era, and in April a Siena College poll of registered voters in New York state found that Ocasio-Cortez had the best favorability rating among eight elected officials. Several House members have called for Schumer to step aside — although Ocasio-Cortez has not joined them.\n\n“This problem is bigger than one person,” she said of Senate Democrats voting with Republicans to fund the government this month. “It actually is bigger than the minority leader in the Senate.”\n\n‘I want to represent the bartenders’\n\nWhen Ocasio-Cortez began running for Congress in 2017, her pollster, Celinda Lake, approached her to suggest she push back on attacks stating that she was simply a bartender and unqualified for the job. Perhaps she could highlight other aspects of her résumé, Lake suggested. (After graduating from Boston University with honors, she worked on Sanders’s 2016 campaign and launched a book publishing company.)\n\n“Celinda, I don’t want to correct that,” Ocasio-Cortez responded immediately, Lake recalled. “I want to represent the bartenders and waitresses of this district.”\n\nThat pitch resonated with voters in a deep-blue district spanning the Bronx and Queens, and she entered the House in 2019 at 29 after defeating a sitting congressman, Democrat Joseph Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez assembled a pugilistic team that had plans to systematically dislodge more Democratic leaders.\n\n“Crowley was intended to be the start, not the finish,” said Corbin Trent, who served as Ocasio-Cortez’s communications director in those early days.\n\nPelosi, then the speaker of the House, extended a chilly welcome to the freshman congresswoman, who participated in a sit-in at her office over climate change during her first week in Washington. The California Democrat said a “glass of water” could win in districts as blue as Ocasio-Cortez’s and dismissed her “Green New Deal” climate proposal as the “Green Dream.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez faced “social isolation and pressure” from other Democrats who disliked her approach, according to one person who worked for her at the time. “She represented that you could lose your job,” the person said.\n\nIn 2019, Ocasio-Cortez distanced herself from members of her team who had clashed with other Democrats, as Trent and her chief of staff left her office. She told people around her that her fellow members had the wrong impression of her as a firebrand who was after their jobs, Trent said.\n\n“I think they saw her as someone who took on every issue like a dragon that she needed to slay,” said former Democratic National Committee executive director Patrick Gaspard. “What they didn’t realize about her is that she’s actually a very nimble political athlete.”\n\nIn 2020, she endorsed a handful of liberal candidates challenging moderate House Democrats, which was controversial in the caucus but represented a smaller break with party leadership than her earlier team had hoped for. House Democrats, including Spanberger, faced a torrent of GOP-funded ads that year tying them to “socialist AOC,” heightening tensions in the party.\n\nBut by 2021, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) gave her a leadership role on the House Oversight Committee, seeing an eager student of the legislative process and an effective communicator. Ocasio-Cortez built an alliance with Joe Biden when he became president that year. When Harris replaced Biden on the presidential ticket last year, Ocasio-Cortez spoke glowingly of her in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n“One of the biggest changes I’ve seen in her is the desire to listen to everybody,” said Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan), who recalled the congresswoman taking seriously her position that labor unions needed to sign on to the “Green New Deal” before she could support it.","url":"https://thenewpeople.net/news/world-news-64501","image":"http://www.thenewpeople.net/assets/uploads/news-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gi","sentiment":0.146},{"id":381892264,"title":"New poll finds most Hispanic adults critical of Trump","text":"As the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term comes to a close, two new polls from the Pew Research Center find that Hispanic adults are increasingly unhappy with the way his administration is handling the economy and immigration, issues that were key for voters during last year’s election.\n\nThe surveys of more than 5,000 Hispanic adults in the U.S., conducted in October and September, found that a year after Trump eroded the Democrats’ traditional advantage with Latino voters, most Hispanic adults are feeling worse about their place in the country, and they’re more likely to be worried that they or someone close to them could be deported than they were earlier this year.\n\nDeclining approval of Trump\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults overall disapprove of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration, while 61% say his economic policies have made conditions worse.\n\nHispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the 2024 election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris. According to AP VoteCast, 43% of Hispanic voters nationally supported Trump, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe vast majority of Hispanics who reported voting for Trump in 2024 — 81% — approve of the president’s job performance, although that’s declined from 93% at the start of his second term. Nearly all Hispanic Harris voters disapprove of Trump’s performance.\n\nPew’s findings echo an October survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which found that 25% of Hispanic adults have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of Trump, down from 44% in an AP-NORC poll conducted just before the Republican took office in January.\n\nThe shift in opinion underscores how worried and dissatisfied many Hispanic adults feel. Although many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year’s election, recent polls indicate that Hispanic adults continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans overall.\n\nHispanic voters made up 10% of the electorate in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, and the number of eligible Hispanic voters has been growing rapidly in recent decades.\n\nRising anxiety about Hispanics’ place in the U.S.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the situation for Hispanics in the U.S. is worse than it was a year ago. That’s higher than in 2019, during Trump’s first term, when 39% thought U.S. Hispanics’ situation had worsened over the past year. \n\nSimilarly, about 8 in 10 Hispanic adults say Trump’s policies harm more than help them. These views are more negative than in 2019, when about 7 in 10 said the first Trump administration’s policies were more harmful to Hispanics than helpful.\n\nThe Hispanics who are Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party overwhelmingly think U.S. Hispanics are worse off, as a group, than they were a year ago, but so do 43% of Hispanic Republicans and Republican-leaners.\n\nBroad worries about immigration enforcement\n\nOver the past few months, Hispanic communities have been a target of the president’s hard-line immigration tactics.\n\nToday, 44% of Latinos adults are immigrants, numbering 21.1 million, according to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates from the 2024 American Community Survey.\n\nAmid the heightened enforcement, 52% of Hispanic adults say they worry “a lot” or “some” that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. This is up from 42% in March. \n\nThe tough immigration environment has also affected the way some Hispanic adults live their everyday lives, with 19% saying they have recently changed their daily activities because they think they’ll be asked to prove their legal status, and 11% saying they carry documents proving their citizenship or immigration status more often than they normally would.\n\nThe Pew Research Center survey of 8,046 U.S. adults, including 4,923 Hispanics, was conducted Oct. 6-16 using samples drawn from the probability-based American Trends Panel and SSRS Opinion Panel.

Remember, Trump tapped Halligan to serve as interim U.S. attorney after her predecessor reportedly did not have enough evidence to criminally prosecute James. \n\nJames and Comey have long been on Trump’s enemies list. While the indictment was ostensibly for allegedly lying when he testified before Congress in 2020, Trump despises Comey for his leadership during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. That played a role in Trump sacking Comey as FBI director in 2017. \n\nThe Justice Department under Trump has made targeting the Comeys a family affair. In July, the DOJ fired Maurene Comey, the former director’s daughter, who worked as a prosecutor in Manhattan’s Southern District of New York.\n\nTrump’s beef with James is also rooted in investigations. As attorney general of New York, James launched a civil fraud investigation case against the Trump Organization, which ended in Judge Arthur Engoron ordering Trump to pay a $354 million fine along with interest. \n\nNo doubt, the Trump team will appeal this, though it will struggle to make a case in higher courts. But it will likely face the same problems it does in the lower courts.\n\nIt’s also just the latest humiliation for Trump world. \n\nLast week, Trump changed his mind on a vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein and gave Republicans his blessing to vote for it. This came after he had spent months calling it a “Democrat hoax.” In the end, all but one Republican voted to release the files. The Senate used unanimous consent to consider it passed as soon as it hit the upper chamber’s doorstep.\n\nThen on Friday evening, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene dropped a bomb on Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson when she announced she would resign from Congress in January. That came after Trump had unendorsed Greene.\n\nWhile Trump gloated about the resignation, it actually makes his and House Speaker Mike Johnson’s job much harder because, for the time being, they will have one less vote. \n\nAll of this should make Trump want to quit while he’s behind. But – in the words of the late Charlie Murphy on Chappelle’s Show – Trump is a habitual line-stepper. \n\nHence on Monday, the Pentagon announced that it would perform a “thorough review” of “serious allegations of misconduct” against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). The Pentagon said Kelly could be recalled for active duty “for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.”\n\nKelly is a popular senator in Arizona, a state Trump won. He also served in the U.S. Navy as a captain and as an astronaut — he flew four space missions and his identical twin brother Scott is also a retired NASA astronaut — before he ran for Senate in 2020 after his wife, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head in a political assassination attempt in 2011. Kamala Harris had him on her shortlist to be her running mate. \n\nBut he sent Trump into a rage last week when he – along with fellow Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Democratic Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlahan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris DeLuzio – released a video telling active duty U.S. servicemembers that they could refuse to obey illegal orders. \n\nTrump responded by calling the behavior seditious and said that it could be punishable by death. Republicans either outright defended Trump’s words or they pretended not to see it. \n\nThis case will likely fall apart in the same manner Trump’s attempts to prosecute Comey and James.\n\nAnd it will likely cause just as much backlash and make Kelly a hero among Democrats the same way that Gavin Newsom did after Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles without the governor’s permission. \n\nKelly for his part does not seem bowed by Trump’s attack on him. But it is just another example of how Trump is using the federal government to exact revenge against anyone he perceives as his political enemies and equating his enemies with the country’s enemies.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s enemies-list prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James were tossed by a federal judge on Monday, writes Eric Garcia.

The text chain also included Trump’s frenemy Rupert Murdoch, 94, and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, 60.\n\nFollowing his father’s stepping down as chair of News Corp—Fox’s parent company—MAGA media criticized Lachlan as “woke,” despite the successor’s conservative-leaning speeches suggesting otherwise. \n\nLachlan’s texts were released as part of court exhibits in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit, in which the global election technology company aims to prove that Fox Corp deliberately spread misinformation about its voting systems as part of the false claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. \n\nFox Corp says any allegations against Smartmatic came from the president, not the company, and that it was simply reporting a “newsworthy story.” Its bid to dismiss the lawsuit in January failed.\n\nFurther court exhibits show that viewership among Fox’s dedicated Republican base had been falling after the network became the first to call Arizona for presidential candidate Joe Biden during the 2020 election. \n\nEmails between Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan show that on Nov. 23, 2020, the father wrote, “Getting killed in audience numbers,” emphasizing the need for a discussion.

Now a familiar power broker has stepped forward: Former President Bill Clinton. The 42nd president has reportedly indicated which contender he believes offers Democrats their strongest shot at reclaiming the White House.\n\nAccording to a Democratic source speaking to Jonathan Martin of Politico, Clinton has been telling allies that California Governor Gavin Newsom is the one Democrat who looks ready to win the White House. \n\nThe former president, who interviewed Newsom at this fall’s Clinton Global Initiative, has told people how impressed he is by Newsom’s talent, a well-connected Democrat relayed to me recently. Clinton said he thought his dedicated student had what it takes to be elected president. -Politico\n\nMartin called Newsom the clear front-runner. “No Democrat has had a better two years than Gavin Newsom,” he writes. “And because of it, the California governor — a national figure since he was a 36-year-old boy mayor — has claimed a new title: front-runner.”\n\nPolling certain bears that out. The latest Atlas Intel poll had Newsom at 37%, a full 16 points ahead of the nearest opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose chances of winning the nomination are slim after her billion-dollar defeat in 2024.\n\nThough he’s made no official declaration, Newsom’s White House ambitions are no secret, and he’s been positioning himself to run for president for years now. He has been using social media and public appearances to position himself as a counterweight to President Trump. In September, he signed multiple laws aimed at restricting Trump’s immigration enforcement, including limits on officers’ access to schools and health facilities, requirements for officers to identify themselves, and bans on wearing face masks while on duty.\n\nNot all Democrats are convinced that Newsom is the future of the party, however. Earlier this month, Sen. John Fetterman called out Newsom’s “shift to the center” as pure political theater, and not representative of his true values.\n\nFetterman on Newsom Moving to Center:\n“Everyone’s going to go into the middle. But people [forget] that the Internet exists forever and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they’ve said or they’ve done ... ” pic.twitter.com/wToIvB7zJn\n— Trump2024_no_matter_what (@TexasTrump2024) November 2, 2025\n\n\"Everyone's going to go into the middle,\" Fetterman said. \"But people forgets [sic] that the internet exists and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they've said or they've done, that's going to have about 20 or 30 million dollars that can pound you for those things.\"\n\nNewsom has been trying to have it both ways on cultural issues. In 2023, he vetoed AB957, legislation that would have allowed state courts to weigh a parent’s affirmation of a child’s “gender identity” in custody disputes. His veto was widely seen as a calculated effort to appear more moderate on transgender issues. But three years earlier, he signed SB145, ending automatic sex offender registry requirements for certain adults who commit sexual acts with minors, which was deemed unfair to the LGBTQ community.\n\nFetterman made it clear he thinks Newsom and other Democrat contenders for the 2028 nomination won’t be able to hide from their radical records.\n\n\"They'll pander, scream to the base,” he said. “Then they're going to have to try to just walk it back, or now just pretend that all these things weren't said or done. That's how it works. And that's one thing I refuse to do.\"\n\nBy signaling his support for Gavin Newsom, Clinton is weighing in significantly early on the battle for the 2028 Democratic Party nomination. But whether his endorsement will translate into real momentum is far from certain.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/bill-clinton-reveals-which-democrat-he-thinks-can-win-white-house-2028","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/clinton%20in%20dress.jpg?h=e2cb83ef&amp;itok=7foBwX9m","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 21:40:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":381848962,"title":"Donald Trump’s reputation ‘probably’ not tarnished by Panorama edit, MPs told","text":"The reputation of US president Donald Trump has “probably not” been tarnished by a Panorama edit that spliced together parts of one of his speeches, the author of a leaked memo raising concerns has said.\n\nMichael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee, faced questions from MPs on Monday after he raised concerns that Trump: A Second Chance? included selective editing of a speech made by Mr Trump before disorder at the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nMr Prescott told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that there are “issues of denial” at the BBC and said “the management did not accept there was a problem” with the Panorama episode.\n\nThe memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to “fight like hell”.\n\nMr Trump threatened the BBC with a billion-dollar litigation after the report was made public while US regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), launched an investigation.\n\nAsked if the documentary had harmed Mr Trump’s image, Mr Prescott said: “I should probably restrain myself a little bit, given that there is a potential legal action.\n\n“All I could say is, I can’t think of anything I agree with Donald Trump on.”\n\nPressed on the subject again, and asked if he agrees that Mr Trump’s reputation has been tarnished, he said: “Probably not”.\n\nThe former journalist also told the CMS Committee he did not know how his memo, which he had shared to the DCMS and Ofcom, was leaked to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nMr Prescott said: “At the most fundamental level I wrote that memo, let me be clear, because I am a strong supporter of the BBC.\n\n“The BBC employs talented professionals across all of its factual and non-factual programmes, and most people in this country, certainly myself included, might go as far as to say that they love the BBC.\n\n“What troubled me was that during my three years on the BBC Standards Committee, we kept seeing incipient problems which I thought were not being tackled properly, and indeed I thought the problems were getting worse.”\n\nMr Prescott added: “There was no ideology at play, no party politics.\n\n“If you take the example of the US elections report that came before the committee, if it had found that had been Kamala Harris misrepresented, not Donald Trump, I would have acted in exactly the same way.”\n\nHe continued: “I never envisaged events playing out in the way they did, I was hoping the concerns I had could, and would, be addressed privately in the first instance.”\n\nAsked if he thinks the BBC is institutionally biased, he said: “No I don’t… I do not think it’s institutionally biased.\n\n“Let’s be very clear.\n\n“Tons of stuff that that the BBC does is world class, both factual programming and non-factual programming.”\n\nThe former journalist spoke of “incipient problems” with “systemic causes” at the corporation and said: “There’s real work that needs to be done at the BBC.”\n\nAlso on Monday, BBC board member Sir Robbie Gibb told MPs the idea he led a “a broad-level orchestrated coup” at the corporation is “complete nonsense”.\n\nIt comes following the resignation of BBC director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness and amid criticism that the background of the non-executive board member, who was the director of communications for Theresa May when she was in Downing Street, could undermine the corporation’s independence and impartiality.\n\nAfter Mr Prescott’s report, BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised on behalf of the BBC over an “error of judgment” and accepted the editing of the 2024 documentary gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action”.\n\nDespite the apology, Mr Trump said he would proceed with legal action for “anywhere between one billion dollars (£759.8 million) and five billion dollars (£3.79 billion)”.\n\nBBC News reported that the broadcaster had set out five main arguments in a letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nMr Prescott told MPs Mr Davie did a “first-rate job” as director-general but said he had a “blind spot” toward editorial failings.\n\nThe job position for director-general has now gone live on the BBC Careers website.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-reputation-probably-not-180012919.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TrfVJeJW4Wage7iCdFAiaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/4f574b8342d4a6ace9d6a37f6563dc32","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 21:23:19","author":"Hannah Roberts, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter","authors":["Hannah Roberts, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":381867084,"title":"Are Other Republican Lawmakers on the Way Out?","text":"It’s possible that other Republican lawmakers might follow Rep.

ALL. And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen. That is the sentiment of nearly all — appropriators, authorizers, hawks, doves, rank and file. The arrogance of this White House team is off putting to members who are run roughshod and threatened. They don’t even allow little wins like announcing small grants or even responding from agencies. Not even the high profile, the regular rank and file random members are more upset than ever. Members know they are going into the minority after the midterms.“More explosive early resignations are coming. It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower. Mike Johnson will be stripped of his gavel and they will lose the majority before this term is out.”Of course, Johnson’s team points out they have impossibly small margins and believe they are doing what they can with the hand they were dealt.But the idea that Republicans could lose their majority this Congress is no longer far-fetched. If Johnson were to lose another House Republican in the middle of this term to retirement, death or illness, there’s a decent chance that the GOP can end up in the minority at some point in 2026.\n\nPunchbowl News did not include the names of Republicans considering an exit, so this should be taken with a grain of salt. After all, it could simply be wishful thinking.\n\nHowever, if other Republican lawmakers decide to leave their positions over the issues with Trump, it could place the GOP in a precarious position leading up to the next midterm elections. As the report noted, Republicans have six more seats than Democrats. But if they lose even half of this, the upcoming elections could threaten their majority.\n\nThe math. Republicans have 219 seats and Democrats have 213. There’s a special election in Tennessee on Dec. 2 to fill former Rep. Mark Green’s (R-Tenn.) seat. Democrats and Republicans are pouring piles of money into that district, which Trump won by more than 20 points.If Republicans win, their margin will remain the same after MTG’s retirement.But Democrats will gain a seat in Houston at the end of January when voters choose the late Rep. Sylvester Turner’s (D-Texas) replacement. And on April 16, New Jersey voters will choose Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s replacement. That’s a seat that former Vice President Kamala Harris won by nine percentage points in 2024.Let’s say Democrats are able to steal the Tennessee seat based on subpar GOP turnout — unlikely but possible — Johnson would have 218 members to Democrats’ 214. Texas and New Jersey would bring Democrats to 216. If any members retire or fall ill, Johnson would be sunk.House retirements and resignations are common after holidays. How appealing is it to return to the Capitol when the House spends most of its time voting on censure resolutions or meaningless messaging bills?\n\nIf other Republican lawmakers decide to call it quits, it would further fuel speculation about the GOP's future. It would highlight the growing rift on the right.\n\nWhile most GOP lawmakers have stood with Trump during his second term, some, like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), have clashed with him on several occasions. Depending on how things shake out, it would not be surprising to see other GOP lawmakers begin pushing back as well.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made a surprising announcement last month: The moderate Democrat said he would no longer accept donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nSpurning AIPAC was not, on its face, shocking. In the more than two years since Israel’s onslaught in Gaza began, numerous members of Congress have pledged not to accept money from the lobby, all from the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But for Moulton, who leans heavily on his background as a Marine who served multiple tours in Iraq, to join that cohort was surprising. Now gearing up for a potentially bruising primary as he challenges progressive stalwart Ed Markey for his Senate seat, Moulton apparently decided that turning his back on AIPAC and its allies was more politically advantageous than costly.\n\nThe growing list of members of Congress rejecting funding from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups marks a stark turnaround from the primacy those organizations recently held in the halls of power.\n\nFor decades, AIPAC focused entirely on lobbying members of Congress and did not directly support individual candidates. That changed in 2021, when AIPAC launched several Political Action Committees (PACs) expressly designed to help pro-Israel candidates win their races. These PACs — the awkwardly named AIPAC PAC and the AIPAC-affiliated Super PAC, United Democracy Project — quickly became major players in the national political scene. They were soon joined by other pro-Israel PACs, most prominently Democratic Majority for Israel, whose leadership was closely aligned with AIPAC.\n\nIn 2022, these groups spent nearly $60 million in direct support or on behalf of candidates, placing AIPAC and its affiliates among the top 10 spenders that cycle. Among their targets was Michigan Rep. Andy Levin, a Jewish member of Congress and president of his synagogue. After 2020 redistricting that merged Levin’s district with that of another Democrat, Haley Stevens, the two faced off in the Democratic primary. AIPAC and its allies, apparently upset over Levin’s critique of Israel’s illegal annexation of Palestinian territory, poured more than $4 million into backing Stevens, who won the nomination handily.\n\nIn 2024, AIPAC’s reach broadened further. In the first major election cycle after October 7, AIPAC targeted some of Israel’s harshest critics in Congress, spending heavily to unseat progressives like Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. It spent a “record-shattering” $14.5 million to support George Latimer against Bowman, and another $8.5 million in St. Louis in support of Wesley Bell against Bush. Both Bowman and Bush were defeated. (The AIPAC watchdog site Track AIPAC rates Bell and Latimer as the top all-time recipients of AIPAC donations.)\n\nBy the end of the primary season, progressives and critics of Israel’s Gaza policy were publicly despairing. Bernie Sanders warned that AIPAC’s success would embolden the lobby to suppress critical voices wherever it found them.\n\nThen, something shifted. As Israel’s assault ground on, public sentiment on Israel-Palestine began to fracture. Surveys in mid-2024 showed clear divides in American opinion, with younger people and Democrats increasingly saying the Biden administration was too favorable toward Israel. Within the Democratic Party, these splits were even sharper: Nearly 50 percent of Democrats aged 18–29 said they sympathized more with Palestinians, compared with only 17 percent of those over 65.\n\nThese intraparty tensions were amplified by the Uncommitted movement, which urged Democratic voters in key states to select “uncommitted” during the party’s primary to protest the administration’s stance. In swing-state Michigan, the movement garnered more than 100,000 votes. Rifts deepened further when Democratic National Convention organizers denied speaking time to Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian-American Georgia House Representative recommended by the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, coalitions like Reject AIPAC pressed members of Congress to declare they would refuse AIPAC’s funding. By late 2024, with Kamala Harris facing Donald Trump in the general election, the Biden administration’s unqualified support for Israel had become a top issue. Harris, unwilling or unable to distance herself from Biden’s legacy, gave voters little reason to expect a shift in policy.\n\nUltimately, Harris hemorrhaged support among constituencies crucial to Biden’s 2020 win. Her backing among voters aged 18 to 49 dropped by 10 points from Biden’s 17-point margin in 2020. A pre-election analysis also showed that her support among Muslim voters lagged far behind Biden’s. In swing states like Michigan — where Harris lost by just over 80,000 votes — the significance of the more than 100,000 Uncommitted primary voters in that state was impossible to ignore. While the Uncommitted movement had aimed to serve as a warning to Democrats about the electoral liabilities of its Gaza policy via mounting a protest in the Democratic primaries, it had now become a grim predictor of Democrats’ weakness in the general election.\n\nNow, still reeling from their 2024 wipeout, and with Democratic support for Israel continuing to crater through 2025, the party finds itself at a crossroads. Many Democrats have decided that the electoral risks of taking AIPAC money now outweigh the benefits.\n\nMoulton is just one striking example of how quickly the tide is turning. Recently, former Missouri Rep. Cori Bush announced she would run again for her old seat, directly challenging the AIPAC-backed candidate Bell who unseated her last year. That Bush is mounting a comeback so quickly underscores how rapidly Bell’s close ties to the pro-Israel lobby have shifted from a strength to a liability.\n\nThis pattern is emerging elsewhere as well. In New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayorship thanks in part to his support for Palestinian rights, progressives are eyeing multiple congressional seats — including that of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — for primary challenges. Many of the representatives currently holding these seats — including Jeffries, Dan Goldman, and Ritchie Torres — are well-known for their close ties to the pro-Israel lobby. Torres, for example, has sponsored bills in Congress that lean heavily into AIPAC-promoted narratives about antisemitism on college campuses. He has also gained a reputation as one of the most ardent defender of Israel’s actions in Gaza on social media. Goldman, meanwhile, has been one of the most unwavering voices in supporting Israel’s “right to defend itself.”\n\nProgressives are betting that these affiliations, plus general outrage with mainstream Democrats’ feeble response to the Trump administration, will propel progressive challengers to victory.\n\nWith such a dramatic swing of the pendulum, the ball now appears to be back in AIPAC’s court. After funding the two most expensive Democratic primaries in history in 2024, AIPAC and its allies are likely to enter the 2026 cycle with ample resources. Whether the same scorched-earth spending strategy remains politically viable is unclear. The lobby will undoubtedly work to defend its closest allies and beat back challengers like Bush and the New York progressives. But it will have to consider how visibly it operates. Its reputation took another hit after Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo — twice — despite Cuomo’s vocal backing from pro-Israel billionaires and donors tied to Donald Trump, many of whom tried to make Mamdani’s criticism of Israel a central campaign issue.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that AIPAC will relent in its quest to influence electoral outcomes within the Democratic primary. It does mean, however, that it may have to go to lengths to either obscure or downplay its role in campaign contributions and independent expenditures on behalf of candidates.\n\nAIPAC and its affiliates have long obscured their actual gripes with candidates they oppose in political advertising — their stances on Israel — instead focusing on those candidates’ stances on controversial domestic policies. They may push this trend further in coming cycles, making it harder for the average voter to determine when they’re subjected to messaging from the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nWhether this will be an effective adjustment in its strategy remains to be seen. As the political landscape continues to shift, the coming cycles may determine whether AIPAC can retain its once-unassailable influence — or whether rising skepticism of U.S. support for Israel signals a lasting realignment among Democrats.","summary":"Backing AIPAC may now be a political liability for candidates facing progressive challengers in Democratic primaries.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/is-the-tide-starting-to-turn-against-aipac/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2078448808.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 20:38:47","author":"Sam Rosenthal","authors":["Sam Rosenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.009}]}
