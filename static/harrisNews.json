While he promised during the 2024 campaign to bring down the cost of living, his trade policies now may rock the global economy and push up inflation. \n\nRoughly one in four Trump voters said in the poll that the tariffs are damaging the ability of the U.S. to negotiate trade deals with other countries. The president’s supporters are also evenly split on whether Trump should have the power to impose tariffs, with 44 percent saying he should have Congress’s approval versus 45 percent who say he should have the authority to put in place the levies. \n\nTrump has said that he may put in place yet another round of tariffs on August 1, threatening a 30 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and the European Union. The tariffs, which Trump has claimed will bring in “big money” to the U.S., are paid by the importer, and many companies pass those costs on to the customer. \n\nForty-six percent of Trump voters said they back tariffs on China “even if it increases prices at home.” Meanwhile, 32 percent say they only support tariffs if it doesn’t raise prices, and nine percent said they oppose tariffs. Twenty-five percent of Trump voters said the tariffs on China hurt U.S. companies. \n\nHowever, 55 percent said that while it will be challenging to get a deal with China, they expect that the president “will be able to do it.” Eighteen percent said it won’t be difficult to reach an agreement. Twelve percent said Trump won’t be able to get a deal with the second-largest economy in the world. \n\nAmong those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, 47 percent said the same. Eighty-six percent of Harris voters said the tariffs are damaging to the U.S. ability to arrange better trade deals.","summary":"Only half of Trump voters think his tariffs on China will benefit U.S. companies","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-tariffs-poll-voters-b2787994.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/12/21/11-88efd82867e543d0bfca2fb7f0e00322.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/am4xLKX4-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-13 00:46:53","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":341025934,"title":"Trump says he's considering 'taking away' Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship","text":"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he is considering “taking away” the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.\n\n“Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nIf anyone still harbors doubts that Gavin Newsom is contemplating a run for the White House in 2028, this week’s sojourn into South Carolina for some schmoozing with local politicians and photo ops with common folk should dispel them.\n\nAlthough South Carolina is a strongly Republican state, in 2024 the Democratic Party, at the behest of then-President Joe Biden, designated it as the first state to have a presidential primary. It could play that role again in 2028.\n\nThus, Democratic politicians who see themselves as potential candidates are — to no one’s surprise — finding reasons to visit the state. Newsom’s rationale is that he wants to know how cuts in federal health care programs are affecting South Carolinians.\n\nEver since winning a second and final term as governor three years ago, Newsom has obviously been building a national profile, all the while insisting that he had no presidential ambitions.\n\nHowever, after spending half of his 57 years climbing the political ladder one rung at a time, it seemed unlikely that he would simply retire from politics after his governorship ended and return to running his wine and hospitality business.\n\nLast month, Newsom acknowledged the possibility of a 2028 run in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, saying “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.” This week’s visit to South Carolina proves that he’s headed down that path.\n\nCould Newsom pull it off?\n\nWhen Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump last year, it opened the door for all Democratic hopefuls. The party is undergoing a post-election upheaval after losing not only the presidency but control of both houses of Congress.\n\nThere’s a sense that the nation’s voters are not buying what the party has been selling, but there’s no consensus on how it should change to win back disaffected voter blocs, nor is there a commanding figure to lead its transformation.\n\nNewsom has been a vocal critic of the party’s failure to connect with blue-collar voters, particularly young men, but has yet to articulate an alternative approach. He’s also been slowly edging away from his previous image as a California progressive — much to the dismay of environmentalists, gay and transgender rights advocates and other left-leaning groups.\n\nThe lack of an obvious leader in what could be a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls creates an opening for Newsom to offer himself as someone who could put together a coalition of voter blocs capable of defeating the 2028 Republican candidate — most likely, at this early stage, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nEarly polling does place Newsom among the upper tier of potential Democratic candidates, although with barely double-digit support. Nevertheless, Newsom’s path to the White House — or at least to the Democratic nomination — is also filled with potholes, beginning with the inescapable fact that he’s from California.\n\nThe state’s image these days is a far cry from the land of sunshine and opportunity that it once enjoyed. Its chronic housing shortage, its squalid encampments of homeless people in the state’s major cities and its self-designation as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants are potent campaign fodder for Newsom’s rivals — and his Republican opponent, should he win the nomination.\n\nTo many, Newsom also comes across as slick and glib rather than sincere, someone who bends reality to portray California and himself as leaders to be emulated. If Newsom is to become acceptable to South Carolinians and other voters across the nation, he will have to persuade them that his eight years as governor of California has earned him a promotion to the top rung on the ladder.\n\nThat won’t be easy.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

She talks like a truck driver,” Trump told “The Insider” in 2006. \n\nIn August 2015, during the Republican primary debate, then-Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Trump about his use of language like “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “disgusting animals” to describe women.\n\n“Only Rosie O’Donnell,” he retorted.\n\nIn April, O’Donnell accused Trump of paying “no mind to any of the laws that the founders stood by and that our country stands for and that is a beacon of shining light and freedom for the rest of the world,” in an interview with CNN explaining her decision to leave the US. \n\n“It’s bad as they promised and even a little bit worse and it’s been heartbreaking and personally very very sad to watch,” she said of Trump’s second stint in the White House. \n\nO’Donnell told NewsNation host Chris Cuomo in June that she believes she can be a better mother in Ireland than in the US under Trump. \n\n“Coming to Ireland was totally a way to take care of myself and my non-binary autistic child, who’s going to need services and help and counseling and all the things that he’s [Trump is] threatening to cut in his horrible plan of the big, beautiful bill,” she said on the “Chris Cuomo Project” podcast. \n\nO’Donnell found coping with Trump’s first term while living in the states “very difficult,” she said.\n\n“I was very, very depressed. I was overeating. I was overdrinking,” she told Cuomo.","summary":"“Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Saturday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/us-news/trump-threatens-to-strip-rosie-odonnells-us-citizenship/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/president-donald-trump-leaving-white-108051948.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YxAHNytr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-12 16:36:44","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":340944766,"title":"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Mamdani? Democrats Don’t Have an Answer","text":"The meteoric rise of New York City Democrat mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani poses a major question for Washington Democrats—is his brand of Palestinian activism, economic interventionism, and pro-LGBTQ+ rhetoric the future of their party?\n\nThe 33-year-old state assemblyman’s trouncing of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the city’s party primary has brought to light a host of controversial positions: supporting taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries on his campaign website, proposing government-run grocery stores, and refusing to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” among other things.\n\nAsked how he views a candidate who does not condemn phrases which many consider genocidal, Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, chose a live-and-let-live approach.\n\n“There’s no candidate in this party that I agree 100% of the time with,” he replied. \n\n“To be honest with you, there’s things that I don’t agree with Mamdani that he said. But at the end of the day, I always believe … that you win through addition, you win by bringing people into your coalition. We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have labor progressives like me, and we have this new Democrat, which is the leftist.”\n\nBut what works in New York City might not work in the swing districts and swing states that decide who has power in Washington.\n\nBut Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has consistently supported Israel, said of Mamdani, “Everything that I’ve read on him, I don’t really agree with virtually any of it politically. So that’s just where I’m at as a Democrat. I mean, he’s not even a Democrat, honestly.”\n\nFetterman, much like swing-state Democrat Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, has generally chosen moderated rhetoric over doubling down on progressive rhetoric since Republican President Donald Trump’s victory in November.\n\nSlotkin, asked shortly after Mamdani’s mayoral primary victory how she interpreted the development, chose to focus on Mamdani’s cost-of-living proposals, while shying away from commenting on his more controversial platform planks.\n\n“People, just like in November, are still really focused on costs and the economy, and their own kitchen table math, and they’re looking for a new generation of leadership,” Slotkin said, adding, “It reinforces that you may disagree on some key issues, but understanding that people are concerned about their family budget, that is a unifying thing for a coalition.”\n\nSlotkin, who narrowly won her Michigan Senate seat in November by just over 19,000 votes out of more than 5.57 million cast, or 48.6% to 48.3%, emphasized economic issues throughout her campaign and warned as early as September 2024 that the Democrats’ presidential candidate, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, was “underwater in our polling.”\n\nFor now at least, Democrats in Washington appear to not know what to do with Mamdani.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has still not endorsed Mamdani, despite his primary win. When asked, he consistently chooses to mention Mamdani’s proposals to address the high cost of living in New York City. \n\nJeffries has applied a bit of pushback against Mamdani’s rhetoric on the Israel-Hamas war, though, particularly his repeated refusals to condemn “globalize the intifada.”\n\n“‘Globalizing the intifada,’ by the way of example, is not an acceptable phrase, and he’s going to have to clarify his position on that,” Jeffries said after Mamdani’s victory. \n\n“With respect to the Jewish communities that I represent, I think our nominee is going to have to convince folks that he is prepared to aggressively address the rise in antisemitism in the city of New York.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how Mamdani’s rise as a national face of the Democratic Party will affect Democrats’ chances outside of their dark-blue urban centers of support.\n\nDemocrats are seeking Senate seat pickups in 2026, for example, in states such as Maine and North Carolina—far removed from New York.\n\nVice President JD Vance has accused Mamdani of creating a coalition of “downwardly mobile, college-educated people” and carved-out ethnic blocs by pandering to shared hatreds.\n\n“That’s an interesting coalition. Maybe it works in the New York Democratic primary. I don’t think it works in the United States at large,” the vice president said in a July 5 speech in San Diego.\n\nRural America and moderate voters appear to be the target for Democrats going into the midterms.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is now running ads against GOP incumbents such as Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, accusing them of attacking rural hospitals with the recently passed Republican budget reconciliation bill’s restructuring of Medicaid.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., is also trying to appeal to moderate voters ahead of a difficult 2026 reelection campaign. \n\nAs Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” was considered, he joined just three other Democrat senators to vote for an amendment to the bill that would have discouraged states from issuing Medicaid payments to illegal immigrants. \n\nThat’s a far cry from Mamdani who has openly called for “standing up for our sanctuary city policies” in New York City.","summary":"The meteoric rise of New York City Democrat mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani poses a major question for Washington Democrats—is his brand of Palestinian activism, economic...

Conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson accused Bondi of 'covering up crimes.'\n\nBut a survey of more than 1,000 registered voters conducted by J.L. Partners for the Daily Mail reveals that Trump voters are sticking by Bondi for the most part. \n\nTwenty-one percent of Trump 2024 supporters think Bondi should resign, compared to 43 percent who are against it.\n\nThat compares to a 54 percent majority of Democrats and – concerningly for Republicans – a 35 percent plurality of Independents.\n\nAmong Kamala Harris supporters from last year, 59 percent think she should resign, compared to 11 percent who don't. \n\nThe poll results came as FBI Director Dan Bongino stayed home from work Friday and was reportedly considering quitting amid the fury over the Epstein matter.\n\nAn insider at the DOJ even told the Daily Mail that Bongino will quit if Bondi doesn't step down or get fired. 'I don't see a scenario where Dan stays if Bondi remains,' the insider said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail on Tuesday that Trump is 'proud' of Bondi.\n\nOne source close to Bongino told Axios, 'he ain't coming back.' \n\nThe sensitivity of the issue was on display this week when Trump suddenly erupted at a reporter who asked him about the case. \n\n'Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?' Trump vented during his cabinet meeting. 'This guy's been talked about for years.' \n\nBondi herself went into damage control after the DOJ released the surveillance video on Monday in an attempt to quell rampant speculation that the billionaire pedophile was killed in prison. \n\nSkeptics had homed in on a missing one-minute segment of the video.\n\nBondi explained that it was part of a daily reset that takes place at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\n'The video was not conclusive, but the evidence prior to it was showing he committed suicide,' Bondi said.\n\n'There was a minute that was off the counter, and what we learned from the Bureau of Prisons is every night they redo that video... every night should have the same minute missing,' he said.\n\nThat hasn't stopped calls for her ouster.\n\nIt was Bondi herself who had raised expectations during a FBI 21 interview on Fox News when host John Roberts asked her if DOJ would release a 'list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients.'\n\n'It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,' Bondi, the former Florida AG and longtime Trump loyalist answered.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Loomer from continuing to post about the hubbub. She wrote Friday that FBI Director Kash Patel and Assistant Director Dan Bongino 'are livid' with Bondi over her memo. \n\n'Pam Blondi has brought total embarrassment to President Trump' and others, she wrote. She said she had 'lied' to the nation and that 'I'm told Kash and Bongino are furious with Blondi and the blowback she has caused them with her lack of transparency,' using a deliberate nickname.\n\nOverall, 37 percent say Bondi should resign, compared to 26 percent against and 37 percent who are unsure.","summary":"Donald Trump's Attorney General has faced an onslaught of criticism, months after she appeared to say she had the pedophile financier's 'client list' on her desk.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14898073/trump-supporters-pam-bondi-epstein-files-client-list.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/23/100237899-0-image-m-23_1752271199291.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 13:17:06","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":340926292,"title":"World News | Year After Trump's Near-assassination, Friends and Allies See Some Signs of Changed Man","text":"Washington, Jul 12 (AP) President Donald Trump was on stage at the Iowa State Fairgrounds earlier this month, kicking off the country's 250th anniversary celebration, when he heard what sounded like fireworks in the distance. “Did I hear what I think I heard?” Trump remarked as he spoke from behind a wall of thick, bulletproof glass. “Don't worry, it's only fireworks.

The attack dramatically upended the 2024 campaign and launched a frenzied 10-day stretch that included Trump's triumphant arrival at the Republican National Convention with a bandaged ear, President Joe Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid and the elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. One year after coming millimeters from a very different outcome, Trump, according to friends and aides, is still the same Trump. But they see signs, beyond being on higher alert on stage, that his brush with death did change him in some ways: He is more attentive and more grateful, they say, and speaks openly about how he believes he was saved by God to save the country and serve a second term. “I think it's always in the back of his mind,\" said Sen.

Earlier this year, he began displaying a bronze sculpture of the tableau in the Oval Office on a side table next to the Resolute Desk. And while he said in his speech at the Republican convention that he would only talk about what had happened once, he often shares the story of how he turned his head at just the right moment to show off his “all-time favourite chart in history” of southern border crossings that he credits for saving his life. During a press conference in the White House briefing room last month, he acknowledged lingering physical effects from the shooting. “I get that throbbing feeling every once in a while,\" he said, gesturing to his ear. “But you know what, that's OK. This is a dangerous business. What I do is a dangerous business.” Trump will spend Sunday's anniversary attending the FIFA Club World Cup soccer final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Crediting divine intervention Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who as his then-campaign chief was with him at the rally, said in a podcast interview released last week that Trump walked away from the shooting believing he had been spared for a reason. “I would say I think he believes that he was saved. I do. And he would never — even if he thought it before, I don't think he would have admitted it. And he will now,\" she told “Pod Force One.” She, too credited divine intervention. The chart, she noted, “was always the last chart in the rotation. And it was always on the other side. So to have him ask for that chart eight minutes in, and to have it come on the side that is opposite, caused him to look in a different direction and lift his head just a little because it was higher. And that just doesn't happen because it happened. It happened because, I believe, God wanted him to live.” As a result, she said, when Trump says things that “are perfunctory — every president says God bless America' — well, it's more profound with him now, and it's more personal.\" She also credited the attack with helping change public perceptions of Trump during the campaign. “For the American public to see a person who was such a fighter as he was that day, I think, as awful and tragic as it might have been, it turned out to be something that showed people his character. And that's helpful,\" she said. “You know, I have an obligation to do a good job, I feel, because I was really saved,” Trump told Fox News Friday. “I owe a lot. And I think — I hope — the reason I was saved was to save our country.” Roger Stone, a longtime friend and informal adviser, noted that Trump has had other brushes with death, including a last-minute decision not to board a helicopter to Atlantic City that crashed in 1989 and another near-assassination two months after Butler when US Secret Service agents spotted a man pointing a rifle through the fence near where Trump was golfing. Stone said he's found the president “to be more serene and more determined after the attempt on his life” in Butler. “He told me directly that he believed he was spared by God for the purpose of restoring the nation to greatness, and that he believes deeply that he is protected now by the Lord,” he said. Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, agreed. “I think for people who know the president, it is commonly believed that it changed him. I mean, how could it not? Imagine if you were who he was and if you don't turn your head at that instant,\" he said. “He knew he was lucky to be alive.” Given how close Trump came to a very different outcome, Reed said, “it's hard not to feel on some level that the hand of providence protected him for some greater purpose. And there are people that I've talked to who said they were confident that he would win for that reason. That there must have been a reason.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Imagine if you were who he was and if you don’t turn your head at that instant,” he said. “He knew he was lucky to be alive.”\n\nGiven how close Trump came to a very different outcome, Reed said, “it’s hard not to feel on some level that the hand of providence protected him for some greater purpose. And there are people that I’ve talked to who said they were confident that he would win for that reason. That there must have been a reason.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Nicole Winfield contributed to this report from Rome.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was on stage at the Iowa State Fairgrounds earlier this month, kicking off the country's 250th anniversary celebration, when he heard what sounded like fireworks in the distance.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/a-year-after-trumps-near-assassination-friends-and-allies-see-some-signs-of-a-changed/article_a07f50fe-9f6a-5156-aa08-bb1390260311.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/51/851892a0-001c-5a10-89a4-308a06cc146d/68725cccef914.image.jpg?crop=1620%2C851%2C0%2C114&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 13:00:04","author":"Jill Colvin The Associated Press","authors":["Jill Colvin The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.104},{"id":340926840,"title":"Faith-Based 'Tradpop' Music Makes Comeback as Conservative Ideals Ascend in Culture","text":"Faith-based “traditional pop” music, also known as “tradpop,” is reportedly making a comeback as conservative ideals become more mainstream following a broader cultural shift in the United States and President Donald Trump’s landslide 2024 election victory.\n\nAlex Warren’s faith-based love song, “Ordinary” — which features lyrics mentioning the Lord, holy water, angels, heaven, an altar, and Hallelujah — reached the No. 1 song in the U.S. this week, and has remained on Billboard’s Hot 100 for the past 20 weeks.\n\n“The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we found something so heavenly — something so out of the ordinary,” Warren sings in the chorus of “Ordinary,” adding, “You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch, oh, Lord, return me to dust.”\n\n“Hopeless Hallelujah, on this side of Heaven’s gate. Oh, my life, how do ya breathe and take my breath away? At your altar, I will pray you’re the sculptor, I’m the clay,” the song’s lyrics add.\n\nCountry star Morgan Wallen also topped the charts for a fifth week in a row with his recently released album, “I’m the Problem,” breaking his own record from 2023 for the most songs ever charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in a single week.\n\nSingers Jelly Roll, Thomas Rhett, Benson Boone, and Shaboozey, meanwhile, have country-pop and folk style songs topping Billboard’s charts.\n\n“It’s a stark cultural contrast from last summer,” Semafor noted, recalling last year having been “defined” by the rise of “boundary-pushing” pop stars like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Charli XCX, whose “brat summer” trend “was embraced by Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.”\n\nBut in the summer of 2025, “things are looking very different” with regards to which musician are popular in the United States, pop music commentator and podcaster Sam Murphy pointed out.\n\n“What they’re representing is a shift toward something far more safer, far more traditional, and far more conservative,” Murphy said. “Many of these names have strong religious beliefs or religious backgrounds, [and] it is coming through in the music.”\n\nVeteran pop stars, meanwhile, “haven’t managed to cut through,” the podcaster added, citing Lady Gaga’s 2025 studio album, Mayhem, with singles “Abracadabra” and “Disease” struggling on the charts.\n\n“They both failed to get into the Top 10,” Murphy said, adding that instead, Lady Gaga’s new song, “Die with a Smile” is “the huge single off the record, and that represents something far more traditional.”\n\n“It’s a ballad, it features somebody who is a very safe radio choice in Bruno Mars, and it has a sound that is quite vintage and familiar to people,” the pop music commentator noted.\n\n“Obviously, at the end of 2024, we shift into a conservative government, and so, it makes sense that the culture begins to reflect the time,” Murphy said. “I feel when you push the needle so far one way, it’s inevitable that it’s going to swing back very far in the opposite direction.”\n\nThe popularity of Warren’s “Ordinary” also comes at a time when the online “tradwife” trend is being increasingly embraced and celebrated by younger conservatives who express their desire for more traditional values involving marriage and large families, Semafor remarked.\n\nLast year, as the tradwife trend began to take off, Breitbart News caught up with Gen Z conservatives at Turning Point USA’s annual Young Women’s Leadership Summit, who shared that many students are finding it “rebellious” to identify as right-wing amid the left pushing their propaganda in schools.\n\nWhen it comes to being “a trad wife” and living “the trad life,” it means “upholding and living a traditional life and not allowing the government to control us,” Turning Point USA contributor and Gen Z political commentator Morgonn McMichael told Breitbart News last summer.\n\n“Just bringing to back to the home,” McMichael said of the tradwife concept, expressing hope in “strong nuclear families and continuing to create strong generations that are going to love their country.”\n\nVideo Source: Jack Knudsen / Breitbart News\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The “big, beautiful bill” is law. Ice, his paramilitary immigration force, rivals foreign armies for size and funding. Democrats stand demoralized and divided. 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf, is a book for these times: aptly named, deeply sourced.\n\nKamala Harris declined to speak. Joe Biden criticized his successor in a brief phone call, then balked. Trump talked, of course.\n\n“If that didn’t happen … I think I would’ve won, but it might have been a little bit closer,” he says of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, which set the race alight.\n\nYet 2024 is about more than the horse race. It also chronicles how the elites unintentionally made Trump’s restoration possible, despite a torrent of criminal charges against him, 34 resulting in convictions, and civil lawsuits that saw him fined hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n“Trump always drew his strength from decades of pent-up frustration with the American democratic system’s failures to address the hardships and problems the people experienced in their daily lives,” Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf write.\n\n“In 2024, [Trump’s] supporters saw institutions stacked against them … leading them to identify viscerally with his legal ordeal, even though they had not experienced anything like it before.”\n\nDawsey is a Pulitzer prize winner, working political investigations and enterprise for the Wall Street Journal. Pager covers the White House for the New York Times. Arnsdorf was part of the Washington Post team that won a Pulitzer for coverage of the assassination attempt.\n\nDawsey and Pager are Post alumni. With Arnsdorf, they capture the aspirations and delusions of Trump and the pretenders to his Republican throne, of Biden and Harris too.\n\n“In the weeks after the election, Biden repeatedly told allies that he could have won if he’d stayed in the race,” 2024 reports, “even as he publicly questioned whether he could have served another four years.”\n\nReally? Biden’s approval rating fell below 50% in August 2021 and never recovered. From October 2023, he trailed Trump. A year out, the authors reveal, Barack Obama warned his former vice-president’s staff: “Your campaign is a mess.”\n\nBiden’s aides privately derided Obama as “a prick”.\n\n“They thought he and his inner circle had constantly disrespected and mistreated Biden, despite his loyal service as vice-president.”\n\nAs for Harris, Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf report that she “knew that the race would be close, but she really thought she would win”.\n\nDespite that, David Plouffe, a senior Harris adviser, admitted post-election that internal polls never showed her leading.\n\n“I think it surprised people because there were these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw,” he said. Harris’s debate win never moved the needle.\n\nDawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf contend that the outcome was not foreordained. Rather, they raise a series of plausible-enough “what-ifs”. One is: “If the Democrats got clobbered, as expected, in the 2022 midterms, and Joe Biden never ran for re-election.”\n\nExcept, by early 2022, according to This Shall Not Pass, a campaign book published that year, Biden saw himself as a cross between FDR and Obama.\n\nA telephone conversation between Biden and Abigail Spanberger, a moderate congresswoman now the Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia, captures Biden’s self-perception.\n\n“This is President Roosevelt,” Biden begins, before thanking Spanberger for her sense of humor.\n\nShe replies: “I’m glad you have a sense of humor, Mr President.”\n\nBack to 2024. Biden bristled at being challenged. Pushback risked being equated with disloyalty. His closest advisers were either family members or dependent on him for their livelihoods. He lacked social peers with incomes and personages of their own.\n\nMike Donilon, a longtime aide, tells the authors: “It was an act of insanity by the Democratic leadership to have forced Biden out.\n\n“Tell me why you walked away from a guy with 81m votes … A native of [swing-state] Pennsylvania. Why do that?”\n\nBecause Biden’s debate performance was a gobsmacking disaster. He also found navigating the stairs of Air Force One difficult and needed prompts to find the podium. In May 2025, Biden announced that he had been diagnosed with stage-four prostate cancer – a disclosure that came after 2024 went to press.\n\nThe authors of 2024 pose Republican hypotheticals too. One: “If Trump never got indicted, or if Republicans didn’t respond by rallying to him, or if the prosecutions were more successful.”\n\nRon DeSantis, Florida’s governor, demonstrated a lack of nerve. Glaringly, he failed to use the initial E Jean Carroll trial, over the writer’s allegation that Trump sexually assaulted her, to bolster his presidential ambitions. DeSantis didn’t dispatch his wife, Casey DeSantis, to Manhattan to offer daily thoughts and prayers for the plaintiff, or for Melania Trump. If you want to be the man, first you’ve got to beat the man.\n\nAnother hypothetical: “If Trump and Biden didn’t agree to an early debate …”\n\nThat question hangs over everything.\n\nTrump’s pronouncements leave Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf anxious. After the 2022 midterms, he mused about terminating the constitution. Later, on the campaign trail, he spoke openly of being a “dictator for a day”. When he was back in the West Wing, reporters asked: “Are you a dictator on day one?” “No,” he replied. “I can’t imagine even being called that.”\n\nDawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf then catalog Trump’s unilateral actions on that first day, including stripping political opponents of security clearances. Later that month, he commenced his vendetta against law firms he deemed to be enemies. In February, Trump barred the Associated Press from the White House press pool unless the news agency referred to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”.\n\n2024 contains no mention of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. Perhaps it should have made space. Hungary’s leader is an autocrat in all but name, an elected leader who has removed freedoms regardless. Republicans adore him.\n\n 2024 is published in the US by Penguin Random House","summary":"Deeply sourced narrative charts the delusions of the main players and the disastrous debate that reset the campaign\n\nDonald Trump is on a roll.

Raul Grijalva, a longtime political power broker in Tucson.\n He had become one of the most senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over two decades in Congress. Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita, is one of the contenders, and three Republicans are vying in the GOP primary.\n But the push for younger leaders won’t end there. In next year’s midterm elections, primary challengers have already begun to emerge in states like California and Indiana that will give Democratic voters choices between longtime lawmakers and younger candidates.\n In Georgia, for example, 80-year-old Democratic Rep. David Scott’s decades-long legacy could end with a primary he’s expected to join. This has drawn challengers fed up with his refusal to step aside despite years of concern about his declining health and rare public appearances. The primary got crowded almost a year after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race amid similar scrutiny over his age.\n Challenging well-connected candidates can be daunting, but progressive leaders say the moment calls for urgency.\n “Passing of the torch implies the leaders are handing it off,” said Amanda Litman, head of a group called Run for Something that bolsters progressive young candidates. “What we’re seeing right now is, the new generation is taking the torch. They’re not waiting for it to be passed.” Campaigning online Many Boomer and Gen Z candidates alike have largely abandoned the traditional playbook of spending millions on TV ads in favor of TikTok and social media.

Jasmine Clark, 42; state Sen. Emanuel Jones, 66; and 33-year-old Everton Blair, former chair of the state’s largest school district. Scott’s campaign did not respond to requests for an interview.\n Clark racked up 7,000 TikTok followers after a popular influencer reposted her. She occasionally pops in with solutions to people’s problems on NextDoor and is sometimes recognised as a podcast host instead of a state representative. She says Republicans have done a better job at saturating social media with their messaging.\n “Instead of looking at Republicans and wagging our fingers at them, we could take some lessons from them,” she said.\n Message or messenger?

That gives them a built-in understanding of how information spreads today, he said, but doesn’t replace on-the-ground outreach to voters of all ages.\n He said Scott’s physical absence is palpable, both in the community and as a voice in Congress.\n “A lot of people are upset on a national level because we can’t hit back with enough vigor.” he said.\n Adelita Grijalva carries a household name in Tucson and is regarded as the frontrunner.

Hobnobbing with the One Percent at a waterfront 15-acre, 12 bedroom, 10 bathroom mansion with “guest cottage,” tennis courts, swimming pool, not one but two pool pavilions, and four-story windmill.\n\nNo doubt it was a swell party, but I have to confess that I was more than a little insulted by the cavalier attitude of the so-called party leaders who are supposed to be helping us non-billionaire rank-and-file citizens save what is left of American constitutional democracy. Wagyu beef? Truffle agnolotti? Indeed, to say I was and am outraged at such callous disregard for the situation this country is in would be speaking euphemistically.\n\nHow tone-deaf, stone-cold stupid, and disconnected from reality and American voters can the Democratic leadership be? No wonder they’ve been beaten twice by a narcissistic, infantile, flagrantly corrupt, amoral, lying, hate-spewing, misogynist, racist, philandering sexual predator, huckster, grifter, and convicted felon.\n\nI decided to ask my own Democratic congresswoman, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, that question. I sent her a lengthy e-mail by way of her website, in which I asked her if she approved of how her leadership had spent No Kings Day. I said that if she did approve of it, she should be ashamed of herself. And if she didn’t approve of it, why was she not vocally making it clear to both her party leadership and to the people she represents that she did not approve of it so that poor schlepps like me could feel like at least somebody who represents me in Washington isn’t totally brain dead or happily kissing up to the folks with all the money.\n\nToday I received an e-mail response from Representative Scanlon consisting of eight paragraphs taking up nearly three pages. It begins by saying: “Thank you for contacting my office regarding recent actions by President Trump and his administration.” It goes on through all the following paragraphs telling me how she’s “horrified by the actions of President Trump,” and enumerates his many sins and shortcomings and decisions to place “his personal, political, and financial interests above the well-being of American citizens.”\n\nThat’s all very nice and dandy, but that is not what I wrote to her about. I wrote to her about the outrageous and utterly inappropriate decision of a significant portion of her own party leadership to spend a day enjoying the benefits of hanging around with billionaires instead of spending the day supporting the grass-roots efforts to reclaim the American republic.\n\nNot a word about the actual subject of my letter to her. Not one word.\n\nOf course I am thoroughly and utterly repulsed by our Maniac-in-Chief, who has now dragged us into an unconstitutional war with Iran while his lickspittle lackeys in Congress cheer him on and the rest of our representatives in Congress mill around bleating like the pathetic sheep they are.\n\nBut that’s not what I wrote to her about. It is the behavior of the Democratic party that appalls me, that disgusts me, now even more so than the Retrumplicans.\n\nI expect the party of our Kleptocrat-in-Chief to ignore the interests of the nation and the majority of its citizens in the interests of wealth, wealth, and more wealth. (The bigotry, homophobia, deportations, and all that other mean-spirited garbage is mostly there to make the hoi polloi imagine the one percent who are financially raping them blind are looking out for their interests.)\n\nBut the Democrats are hardly any better. The behavior of what passes these days for party leadership, combined with the utterly unresponsive response to my request for Representative Scanlon’s stand on the behavior of those leaders on June 14th, fills me with a combination of despair and revulsion.\n\nRepresentative Scanlon concludes her letter: “Thank you for contacting my office. I am proud to represent engaged and committed constituents, like yourself, who take the time to let me know their positions.”\n\nBut she doesn’t know my position because neither she nor anyone on her staff ever bothered to read my letter, let alone tried to respond to it.\n\nSo who do I vote for next time around? Her Republican opponent? I’ve never voted for a Republican in my life, but I’m no longer convinced it would make any difference if I did.\n\nW.D.

The annual “summer camp for billionaires” has historically been a deal-making hotbed. \n\nAllen & Co. is a shareholder in The Free Press, along with more than 30 other investors that include venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, and the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, according to the Times, which first reported deal talks.\n\nEllison and Weiss have discussed several potential collaborations, including a role for Weiss in shaping CBS News’ editorial direction, though not in a managerial capacity, the Times added, citing two sources.\n\nSkydance declined to comment. Weiss did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nEllison has reportedly “quietly courted” Weiss to bring her on board at CBS News in some high-profile capacity for months. The duo reportedly met in New York City last year, with news of the meeting ruffling feathers at “60 Minutes,” the Status newsletter reported last month\n\nThe latest talks come as Skydance awaits approval from the Federal Communications Commission on its $8 billion merger with CBS News parent Paramount Global. \n\nThe deal has been throttled by President Trump-nominated FCC Chair Brendan Carr as the agency investigates the network’s alleged liberal media bias, as well as its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives.\n\nLast week, CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump for allegedly deceptively editing a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nA CBS News source told The Post that bringing on Weiss won’t change that network’s “woke” drift, citing its culture of pushing back on authority.\n\n“What Ellison needs to understand is that the anchors and the show executives think they can outlast any executive choice,” the source said, citing a revolving door of news executives and news presidents in the last few years. \n\nThe person descibed a “drag-your-feet” culture, in which new executives try to make bold moves, but they are ultimately ignored by the staff, who pays lip-service to them and wait until they’re pushed out. \n\n“Bari Weiss will have an axe in her head in three minutes,” the person concluded.\n\nIn the spring, longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens quit in protest, citing a lack of editorial freedoms. His boss, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon, followed suit.\n\nWeiss quit the Times opinions sections because she felt that the Gray Lady’s left-wing culture was hostile to moderate and conservative voices.\n\nShe launched The Free Press with her wife, former Times journalist Nellie Bowles, and Weiss’ sister Suzy Weiss, a former New York Post reporter.\n\nThe trio started the publication as an alternative to left-leaning outlets and sought to cover current events with a “common sense” point of view, tackling subjects such as anti-Semitism on college campuses, the debate over transgender rights in women’s sports, media bias and wokism.\n\nWeiss has championed stories that shed a light on antisemitism across America and Europe following Hamas’ October 7 massacre in Israel, as well as developing a podcast series called “The Witch Trials of J. K. Rowling,” featuring interviews with the “Harry Potter” author, and others, over her controversial views on transgender people.\n\nShe also hired veteran NPR journalist Uri Berliner, who resigned from the liberal outlet after being suspended for criticizing how the mainstream media — and his employer — had lost the public’s trust by approaching stories with a progressive bend.\n\nIt also hosts a series of live events that dig into hot topics such as immrigration and crime.\n\nAs of last summer, The Free Press had more than 50 employees and offices on both coasts. \n\nThe site has more than 136,000 subscribers paying around $8 a month, Axios reported in late December.

Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a biting statement, “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.”\n\nAs Democrats have taken up more social issues in recent years such as transgender rights and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, people from both sides of the aisle have accused the party of being too woke. \n\nAnd voters in a new poll conducted by the Democratic super PAC Unite the Country seem to agree, calling Democrats “woke,” as well as “out of touch” and “weak,” The Hill, which obtained the data, reported Friday. \n\nTrump has repeatedly called former President Joe Biden “weak” while trying to promote strength. Biden, now 82, dropped out of the 2024 election following concerns about his physical and mental fitness. \n\nThe new poll isn’t the first time voters have taken this view of the Democratic Party.\n\nPolitico reported in December 2024, citing research by the progressive group Navigator Research, voters who previously supported Democrats described the party as weak and too focused on diversity and the small group of elites in this country. \n\nUnite the Country’s poll, which was conducted between May and June, also found enthusiasm within the party has continued to weaken after the 2024 election. \n\nDemocratic strategist Rodell Mollineau, a senior adviser to the super PAC, told The Hill, “This is the reality of the perception of us as a party, and until we accept that, it’s going to be hard to move forward.”\n\nWhether or not the Democrats can shift voter perception will be seen in the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nThere will be 35 Senate seats up for election, including 22 currently held by Republicans. If they are able to gain four seats, Democrats can take control of the upper chamber. All House seats will also be up for election in 2026.

Haley Stevens (D-MI) is running for Senate – and away from her close Biden ties.\n\nA poll first reported by Politico from the Democrat firm Normington Petts found that Stevens, the current frontrunner in the Michigan Democrat Senate primary, “has a unique vulnerability in the general election: her congressional voting record supporting Biden — which was ‘the most damaging argument against any candidate’ in the poll.”\n\nAs campaign season begins, ties to the Biden Administration are proving to be damaging to Democrats across the nation. Even former Vice President Kamala Harris was advised to differentiate herself from Biden and acknowledge the failures of the administration leading up to the November presidential election.\n\nHarris failed to do so, and Michigan voters delivered her a clear defeat which helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\nWith Biden’s damage to the economy, engineered border chaos, and geopolitical missteps remaining on voters minds, Stevens is particularly vulnerable given her record of voting with Biden 90% of the time — including supporting Biden’s waiver for California’s EV mandate that threatened tens of thousands of Michigan auto jobs.\n\nShe broke from other members of her party, serving as a surrogate for and fierce defender of Biden even following his disastrous debate performance that tanked his reelection campaign.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, after the Presidential debate and just days before Biden dropped out of the race, Stevens posted a clip from her interview on The Pulse, asking “Has Joe Biden ever let you down?” and claiming that his administration had been executing “flawlessly.”\n\nShe also posted a video after the debate captioned, “I’m proudly supporting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for re-election” with a hashtag “JoesOurGuy.” And just one day after the debate, as Democrats begin calling for Biden to drop out, she reposted Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) on X.com, saying “F*** that.” She later told Axios, “I don’t believe President Biden should step aside.”\n\nAmong multiple similar posts, on July 8, almost two weeks after the debate, Stevens posted, “This morning, I woke up more motivated than ever to re-elect the Biden-Harris ticket. I trust our President and know he is the one to finish the job.”\n\nIn May, Stevens doubled down on California’s electric vehicle mandate, which would ban gas-powered automobiles in California by 2035, a move that could threaten tens of thousands of Michigan auto jobs.\n\nStevens is perhaps best known for a bizarre rant from the House floor while wearing pink latex gloves, presumably to protect herself from COVID.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

The tenants were threatened with physical violence if they did not comply, according to reports.\n\nEventually, authorities in the Denver suburb arrested 14 gang members for the acts of intimidation and violence. But not before the whole apartment complex was shut down and dozens lost their homes.\n\nSoon enough, President Trump caught wind of the incident and made comment on the news.\n\nDuring the presidential debate between Trump and Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, Trump blasted the lax situation leading to gang takeovers. He said:\n\nYou look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They’re taking over buildings; they’re going in violently. These are the people that she and [President Joe] Biden let into our country, and they’re destroying our country. They’re dangerous. They’re at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast.\n\nHowever, despite the video and the months of police actions afterward, the mainstream media claimed that Trump was either outright lying or at least “exaggerating” the severity of the situation in Colorado.\n\nThe New York Times led the attack on Trump with a headline blaring, “How the False Story of a Gang ‘Takeover’ in Colorado Reached Trump.”\n\nThis story from September of 2024 called Trump’s claims a “tall tale,” “false,” “misinformation,” and “fear-mongering,” among other things.\n\nBut now the same paper is admitting that the story is true and posted a new story titled, “Democrats Denied This City Had a Gang Problem. The Truth Is Complicated.”\n\nIn its new story, the Times is admitting that violence at the hands of Venezuelan migrants has been rampant in Aurora and Denver, and residents were terrified of the gangs.\n\nIn fact, now the paper is claiming that it was the Democrats who were engaging in all the misinformation.\n\n“The more central Aurora became to Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, the greater the temptation among Democratic politicians and activists to wave away talk of gang activity in the city as a right-wing hallucination,” the Times wrote this month.\n\n“But their refusal to acknowledge the violence that some residents were seeing with their own eyes came off not as reassurance but as erasure,” the paper scolds.\n\nThe Times’ new take on the gang takeover of Aurora, Colorado, is a complete turnaround since the story broke in 2024.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.","summary":"The 'New York Times' has finally admitted that Donald Trump was right when he warned that Tren de Aragua had taken over a Colorado apartment.\n\n\nThe post &#8216;New York Times&#8217; Finally Admits Trump Was Right About Migrant Gang Taking Over Colorado Apartment Complex appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/07/11/new-york-times-finally-admits-trump-was-right-about-migrant-gang-taking-over-colorado-apartment-complex/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Tren-de-Aragua-Member-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 20:56:52","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":340745542,"title":"Evangelicals for Harris posts apology for misusing Billy Graham’s image for their politics","text":"A political organization called Evangelicals for Harris, now renamed Evangelicals for America following Kamala Harris’ catastrophic presidential election loss in 2024, has posted online a multipage apology for improperly using Billy Graham’s image for their politics.\n\nThe organization had used images of the late Christian leader who was in the confidence of presidents for the last 50 years in promoting Harris, who advocated deliberately for the transgender and LGBT ideologies that many Christians find unbiblical and objectionable.\n\nThe Billy Graham Evangelical Associated pointed out the misuse, and abuse of copyright law, and a year later the Harris organization has apologized.\n\nAmong the ads released:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Evangelicals For Harris drops their first media spot TODAY in an effort to win over some of those “on-the-fence” Conservative Evangelicals in swing states who are lukewarm when it comes to Donald Trump.

Graham’s legacy.”\n\nIt continued, “We have taken down and will not repost our ads that incorporated video clips of Rev. Billy Graham…”\n\nNot the Bee explained, “The long and short of it is that they used these clips of Billy Graham, but didn’t get permission from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) to use them in their political attack ads. To avoid being sued into oblivion for lifting these clips and using them for partisan purposes to support an abortion-loving Democratic candidate, they’ve apologized.”\n\nWhen the dispute arose, WND had reported on Billy Graham’s lifelong interactions with presidents, of both political parties:\n\nHe was offered government posts by Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, and politely said no.\n\nHarry S. Truman not only met with Graham, he received him as his Independence, Missouri, home. Dwight Eisenhower asked him about sending troops into Little Rock during a time of civil unrest. John F. Kennedy met with Graham before he was inaugurated.\nGraham was invited to the Johnson family ranch multiple times, and spent more than 20 nights in the White House during his presidency. Graham had known Nixon for years, and the president often asked Graham to pray with him. Gerald Ford explained, “I’ve heard the comments from some sources that Billy mixes politics with religion. I never felt that and I don’t think that thousands and thousands of people who listen to him felt that.”\nJimmy Carter was an honorary chair of an Atlanta Crusade by Billy Graham back in his day, Ronald Reagan once said, “It was through Billy Graham that I found myself praying even more than on a daily basis … and that in the position I held, that my prayers more and more were to give me the wisdom to make decisions that would serve God and be pleasing to Him.” George H. W. Bush called Graham “an inspiration in my life.”\n\nBill Clinton credited Billy Graham with refusing to racially segregate a crusade audience. George W. Bush said a turning point in his faith came during a private talk with Billy Graham in 1985. Graham said he was pleased to have had Barack Obama visit in his home.\n\nAt the time, Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son and now chief of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said, “The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris. They even developed a political ad trying to use my father Billy Graham’s image to help promote her—or rather to try to make Donald J. Trump look bad.\n\n“They are trying to mislead people. Maybe they don’t know that my father was a firm supporter of President Trump in 2016. He appreciated the conservative values and policies of President Trump, and if he were alive today, my father’s views and opinions would not have changed.\n\n“President Trump isn’t perfect—none of us are—but I believe he has changed over the years. This recent assassination attempt has had a huge impact on him—and I thank God that his life was spared.”","summary":"'The long and short of it is that they used these clips of Billy Graham, but didn't get permission … To avoid being sued into oblivion for lifting these clips and using them for partisan purposes to support an abortion-loving Democratic candidate, they've apologized'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/evangelicals-harris-posts-apology-misusing-billy-grahams-image/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/billy-graham-600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 20:28:02","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":340734180,"title":"AT&T Lily Undresses In A Bed Of Flowers, FSU's Iconic Cowgirl Is Pumped For Football & What A National Anthem!","text":"While the Libs are busy putting toddlers to work at a weed farm out in lawless California, us sane Americans snuck right on by to ANOTHER Friday. They let us do it again! Idiots! How dumb can they be? The answer is, \"infinitely dumb,\" for those wondering. Their idiocy knows no bounds. Sad for them. Great for us! Let's make this one count. Welcome to a Friday Nightcaps – the one where we gear up for college football season with famous FSU cowgirl Jenn Sterger, and go from there. What else? I've got the best of the rest from a solid week of #content, AT&T Lily is back with more behind-the-scenes footage, Michelle Obama and Elaine from Seinfeld are being beyond bitchy and insufferable, and we've got a brand-new sign erected at the sight of the most insane golf course beatdown I've ever seen. What a moment for this course. The local economy is about to THRIVE in this Canadian town. Grab you some fries for National Fry Day, wash it down with a free slurpee for 7/11 Day, and THEN settle in for a Friday 'Cap! Are these two the most insufferable women on the planet? I'm quite sure we've done this one before, but I'm gonna need to go ahead and recycle my Mount Rushmore of Fries today. Lord knows there ain't anything else going on. I'd also accept: Chick-Fil-A, although the end pieces of waffle fries are disgusting, so it's a slippery little slope, and … sweet potato! That's right. Some people scoff at sweet potato fries, but, done right, they are electric. Dip those bad boys in some marshmallow sauce and you have yourself a damn party. Plus, you save on calories (not really, but it makes you feel like less of a fat slob). Anyway, down to business … Hate to start a big Friday class with Michelle Obama and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but this little bitch-fest deserves a second look: What a week of #content! Incredible conversation here from two of the wealthiest women in America. To sit there, with straight faces, and talk about how tough you have it – when you're both worth over $300 million – is batshit crazy. It's so delusional, even for a pair of insufferable Libs. And yes, I know Elaine is worth way more than $250 million given her family is LOADED. Believe me, I went to school with her son – I'm well aware. PS: how about beta boy Craig just sitting there and taking it? Doesn't even say a word. Doesn't push back at all. What a simp. Perfect for the Democrat Party. The good news here is that we no longer have to worry about Michelle Obama running for president, because she's clearly an idiot. I used to think she could seriously win. Not after that. I think we're safe. The bad news is that Seinfeld just became a bit of a bummer of a watch. Sad. OK, let's get to the best #content from a big week. Alberta Springs Golf Course bats leadoff today! AT&T Lily takes us behind the scenes, Travis' transformation & what an anthem! A surprisingly strong week, given the time of year. Nice work, internet! Couple thoughts … 1. Sydney Sweeney is literally the only thing that could make me go see a superhero movie at 32. Unless Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Spider-Man. That's it. 2. Is Kamala Harris dumber than Michelle and Elaine? Bacon as a spice? What does that even mean? I truly don't understand. 3. NASCAR's Natalie Decker refuses to stop posting thirst. What a comeback for her this summer. 4. Jenn Sterger! The OG influencer that turned everyone on thanks to some timely B-roll is ready to rock and roll this season. Camp starts in two weeks. We've got Week 0 in about six weeks. Like I always say, NOW is the time to get those summer chores taken care of. Let's be smart, fellas. 5. Emily Mayfield! I believe this is her first time back in this class in at least a year. What a cameo. Think she's ready for Baker to cook this season? Lord knows I am. Speaking of the NFL, let's go ahead and rapid-fire this final class of the week into a big Friday night. First up? Let's go ahead and check in with Travis Kelce! Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Nellie! What a transformation! I knew Travis was a different dude since he started banging Taylor, but it's jarring when you see it laid out like this. Impressive stuff. I don't particularly like either version, but at least the last one was good at football. I ain't TOUCHING him in my fantasy drafts next month. No shot. Won't make that mistake again. Next? Before we hit the sunflower fields with Lily, let's belt out quite possibly the worst rendition of the national anthem … ever? My God. Is that autotune? Is that what we're going for here? Could you imagine being in the park for that, and listening live? I'd walk out. I'd rather listen to Roseanne Barr sing it for 24 hours straight than ever have to sit through that again. At least she'd use her actual voice. Well, on second thought … Yep. Scratch that. I take it all back. What a moment in time that was. An all-timer. OK, that's it for today – and this week! I know Joe covered AT&T Lily's philanthropic efforts earlier this week, but she gave the fans a behind-the-scenes look at how the sausage was made yesterday, and it's probably worthy of another look. Enjoy! See y'all Monday. OutKick Nightcaps is a daily column set to run Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. (roughly, we’re not robots). You donating to AT&T Lily's cause?

Askush nuk e njeh BE-në më mirë se ai”, tha për Politico Phil Gordon, një ish-këshilltar i zëvendëspresidentes së SHBA-së Kamala Harris. Edhe pse rrallë shfaqet publikisht, Seibert është bërë një figurë pothuajse e pashmangshme në politikën evropiane. Një njeri që, sipas fjalëve të një veterani të Brukselit, e drejton Komisionin sipas rregullave. Ose sipas rregullave të tij ose aspak.\n\nZyrtari më i fuqishëm\n\nSeibert njihet në Bruksel si personi që duhet kontaktuar nëse doni të miratohet një dokument i ndjeshëm, të mblidheni në Parlamentin Europian për një votim ose të finalizoni një prokurim fitimprurës, si një vaksinë gjatë një pandemie. “Ai është zyrtari më i fuqishëm europian, dhe bindshëm kështu është”, thotë Mujtaba Rahman i Grupit Eurasia. Ngritja e tij filloi në vitin 2014 në Ministrinë Gjermane të Mbrojtjes, ku Von der Leyen, ministrja e atëhershme, e vuri re si një sociolog të ri të aftë dhe të gatshëm për përpjekje mbinjerëzore. Pesë vjet më vonë, kur ajo u bë Presidente e Komisionit Evropian, e mori me vete në Berlaymont.\n\n“Vrasësi i heshtur”\n\nSot, asnjë vendim i rëndësishëm nuk kalon në katin e 13-të të ndërtesës së Komisionit Evropian pa firmën e Seibert, që nga postimet në mediat sociale nga komisionerët evropianë e deri te përzgjedhjet e stafit. Por centralizimi në rritje po shkakton shqetësim. “Po përballemi me një kthesë autoritare”, paralajmëroi ish-kryenegociatori i Brexit-it, Michel Barnier. Punonjësit e Komisionit ankohen se stili i punës së Seibert ngadalëson proceset dhe demoralizon zyrtarët, me disa që e kritikojnë stilin e tij “shumë gjerman, shumë konservator”. Por edhe kundërshtarët e tij pranojnë se kur gjërat ngecin, ai di si t’i përfundojë ato. Në Bruksel, ai përshkruhet si një “vrasës i heshtur”, një burrë që mban gjithmonë atlete dhe një dosje të rëndësishme, por rrallë shfaqet në publik. Ai është i martuar, baba i dy fëmijëve dhe për vite me radhë një figurë kyçe në hije, tani pothuajse një “nënkryetar” i Komisionit Evropian.\n\nLidhjet me SHBA-në\n\nPushteti i tij deri më tani ishte bazuar në lidhje të ngushta me administratën e Joe Biden. Që prej fillimit të presidencës së Joe Biden, Seibert ka luajtur rolin e ndërmjetësit informal por jashtëzakonisht efektiv midis Komisionit Evropian dhe Shtëpisë së Bardhë, duke ndihmuar në harmonizimin e qëndrimeve transatlantike për çështje si sanksionet ndaj Rusisë, teknologjitë strategjike dhe mbrojtja ekonomike. Ai shihej si një garantues i marrëdhënies speciale midis von der Leyen dhe Washingtonit, një figurë që ka përdorur kapacitetin e tij diplomatik dhe lidhjet personale për të ndërtuar një kanal të qëndrueshëm komunikimi, që shpesh e anashkalon burokracinë tradicionale të Brukselit.\n\nKjo afërsi me Washingtonin i ka dhënë Seibertit jo vetëm peshë në vendimmarrje, por edhe një status të veçantë si “njeriu i Amerikës në Bruksel”, duke e forcuar më tej pozitën e von der Leyen si një nga liderët më të orientuar drejt perëndimit në BE. Megjithatë, rikthimi i Donald Trump në skenën politike amerikane, me qasjen e tij më skeptike ndaj Bashkimit Evropian dhe multilateralizmit në përgjithësi, e vë në pikëpyetje qëndrueshmërinë e kësaj dinamike. Nëse Seibert e ka ndërtuar pushtetin e tij mbi themelet e një aleance të fortë me demokratët në Uashington, atëherë ndryshimi i administratës në Shtetet e Bashkuara mund ta kufizojë hapësirën e tij për ndikim. Në një moment kritik për të ardhmen e marrëdhënieve transatlantike, roli i Seibertit është më i pasigurt se kurrë.","summary":"Brukseli është mësuar me njerëz me ndikim në hije, por pak prej tyre frymëzojnë aq shumë magjepsje sa Bjoern Seibert, shefi i stafit të Presidentes së Komisionit Evropian Ursula von der Leyen.

Paul, Founder of Global Peace Initiative, Believes a New Political Party Can Lead the US into a New Political Future","text":"Calls on Republican and Democratic Leaders to Unite and Save America and the world from Donald Trump:\n\nNEW YORK, July 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Dr. K.A. Paul — the world's most popular evangelist, humanitarian leader, and Nobel Peace Prize nominee — is urgently calling on courageous Republicans and Democrats to break away from their political parties and unite to save America and the world from unprecedented danger.\n\nDr. Paul, who has traveled to 155 countries and personally counseled over 100 world leaders including presidents and prime ministers, has a long history of bipartisan political involvement in the U.S. He advised and supported the presidential campaigns of:\n\nBill Clinton in 1992\n\nGeorge W. Bush in 2000\n\nBarack Obama in 2008\n\nDonald Trump in 2016\n\nJoe Biden in 2020\n\nThough he did not openly endorse Trump or Kamala Harris in 2024, he later decided to support Donald Trump again in key swing states under a set of conditions. This came after Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr. persuaded Dr. Paul's international director, Dave McQuade, to travel with him globally.\n\nIn 2020, Dr. Paul published a book titled \"Save America and the World from Trump — 10 Reasons\".\n\nDr. Paul published the book putting faith in the promises of Trump but Trump proved to be a betrayer and untrustworthy with his actions. So Dr. Paul now says, \"To truly save America, we need leaders from both parties to step up, break away from the system, and unite with us.\"\n\n\"It's not about right or left,\" said Dr. Paul. \"It's about what's right for the people of this nation and the world.\"\n\nA History of Influence and Peacemaking\n\nDr. Paul recounted how he played a key role in preventing the U.S. Senate from convicting President Clinton during his impeachment, advising him spiritually and morally, comparing his sins to biblical King David's. Clinton thanked Dr. Paul in a private letter.\n\nDr. Paul also reminded America of his historic role in Liberia, when President Charles Taylor stepped down after Dr. Paul spent 18 hours in prayer with him in Monrovia's stadium. International media including AP, CNN, and BBC covered the story as a major peace achievement. Taylor later officially stated, \"99% of the credit goes to Dr. K.A. Paul.\" Additionally, Dr. Paul took great personal risks attempting to mediate between India and Pakistan during military tensions, and has worked with global leaders including Tony Blair, Kofi Annan, and President George W. Bush.\n\nAmerica's Real Crisis: Debt, War, Division\n\nDr. Paul points to the $36 trillion national debt, endless wars, and political division as the real threats to America. He warned both parties — Republicans and Democrats — for decades about overspending in war and unnecessary conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, which cost over $8 trillion and countless lives.\n\n\"In 1991, I told then-candidate Bill Clinton that America's debt was $5 trillion and could be paid off in 10 years by allocating $500 billion a year. He said, 'That's great advice,' but never followed it. Now our debt is $36 trillion, and our children's futures are in danger.\"\n\nHe criticized both parties for approving wars that devastated countries like Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Sudan in the name of peace.\n\nAn Urgent Call to Courageous Leaders:\n\nDr. Paul is now calling on Republican senators, governors, and Democratic members of Congress to rise above politics and unite under a new political party. He has recently met with major political figures such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Cory Booker, Tim Kaine, and Bernie Sanders. He believes a new bipartisan movement can restore the economy, strengthen democracy, and safeguard future generations.\n\nDr. Paul's meetings with major US Senators during his DC tour, 2025\n\nWith Elon Musk reportedly ready to spend \\$1 billion to support a viable independent candidate, Dr. Paul believes now is the time for a breakthrough.\n\n\"If Ross Perot could get 18% in 1992, then a united third party can win 45-50% and defeat both major parties,\" Dr. Paul said. \"I supported three Democrats and two Republicans. Most of you remember Promise Keepers Rally 1995-97 which was attended by more than a million men in Washington DC on oct 4 1997 which is the largest gathering in American history, which was started by me, and my dear friend and board member Coach Paul McCarthy who visited India and attended one of my crusades and asked whether we can do this in America, I said yes. Same way we packed every stadium in the US between 1995-97. We can again pack every stadium and make history to save America and the world from Trump.\n\nProposed Goals for a New Political Party:\n\nEnd wars and promote global peaceEliminate national debt and promote fiscal responsibilityRestore American values and directionUnite all Americans — regardless of race, religion, or backgroundSupport youth employment, education, and entrepreneurshipProtect children, veterans, and farmersDefend truth, love, and justice over hate and division\n\nFinal Call to Action\n\nDr. Paul closes with a challenge to the nation:\n\n\"Good is more powerful than evil. Truth is more powerful than lies. Love is more powerful than hatred. If not now, when? If not us, who? Like David, like Daniel, like Joseph — we need leaders willing to walk into the fire and stand for what is right.\"\"Let every American media outlet, every citizen, and every leader hear this call. The time is now to unite and save America — and with it, the world.\"\n\nMedia Office, Global Peace Initiative\n\nEmail: kap.globalpeaceinitiative@gmail.com\n\nPhone: +1 3468126546\n\nWebsite: globalpeacenow.com\n\nThe Global Peace Prize.com\n\nMore on Dr. Paul:\n\nOn a Wing and a Prayer: Globetrotting evangelist Dr. K.A.

Why did the paper of record report on hacked materials it obtained from a quasi-anonymous online race scientist, given its prior refusal to report on other hacked materials of questionable provenance? And most importantly for our purposes — even if we concede that Mamdani’s college application was indeed newsworthy and acknowledge that journalists’ sources will at times include people with retrograde or abhorrent views — why was the Times deferential to the source at the expense of accuracy, obscuring his actual beliefs and agreeing to refer to him by a pseudonym even though his identity had previously been reported elsewhere?\nThis latter note may seem like a minor quibble, but it points to a broader phenomenon: the subtle creep of race science into mainstream political discourse. The Times obtained Mamdani’s Columbia application from “an intermediary who goes by the name Crémieux on Substack and X,” whom reporters described as “an academic who opposes affirmative action and writes often about IQ and race.” A quick Google search is all it takes to reveal that the person behind the Crémieux account is almost certainly Jordan Lasker, a lapsed academic and ardent advocate of eugenics. It’s technically true that Lasker/Crémieux “writes often about IQ and race” in the same way that it’s technically true that Donald Trump “speaks often about immigration.” It would be far more accurate to say that Lasker writes about how Black people are inherently and congenitally less intelligent than white people. \nEgregious as it was, this incident is not isolated, nor did it come out of nowhere. The idea that race and IQ are connected — what’s known as “race realism” or “human biodiversity” — has become conventional wisdom on the right in the years since Trump was first elected. The notion of “human biodiversity” underpins the Trump administration’s efforts to do away with both affirmative action and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. If success is downstream from intelligence and intelligence is determined by race and heredity rather than access and opportunity, then inequality is the product of biology, not policy. And if inequality is the product of biology, any attempts to eradicate it will be ineffective at best and, at worst, will elevate the inferior at the expense of their superiors. This is not a new argument; it is the thesis of Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray’s controversial 1994 bestseller The Bell Curve and, more broadly, the intellectual heir of the centuries-old tradition of scientific racism.\nProminent liberal institutions have — for the most part, anyway — not yet endorsed the 21st-century iteration of race science, but they have helped launder it into the mainstream nonetheless by legitimizing its proponents while simultaneously obscuring their actual beliefs. In the wake of the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have scrambled to come up with an explanation for both Kamala Harris’ loss and the Republican Party’s gains with voters of color. The prevailing opinion among a certain cohort of liberal commentators is that voters are tired of identity politics and want politicians to focus on kitchen-table issues. This was already the prevailing opinion before the election, but now it has a flashy new title: Abundance. The idea, as presented by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their new book of the same name, is that Democrats should be the party of more: more housing, more jobs, more opportunity, more clean energy, more prosperity. But to get there, they argue, we must do away with onerous regulations that impede progress. \nThe Abundance tent is an intentionally big one. It’s partly a bid to win over disaffected voters who defected from the Democratic Party, as well as conservatives who feel abandoned or betrayed by MAGA’s economic policies. In this sense, Abundance isn’t too different from Democrats’ post-January 6th efforts to woo Never-Trump Republicans by pivoting to the center. But Abundance liberals are also seemingly entering into political alliances with race scientists.\nTake, for example, Thompson’s appearance on Richard Hanania’s podcast. Hanania, for those who are unfamiliar (I’m so jealous of you by the way), is an erstwhile member of the tech-right and author of The Origins of Woke, a 2023 book about how “wokeness” originated with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Years before he was a published author, Hanania blogged under the name Richard Hoste. Shielded by his nom de plume, he described himself as a race realist, called for the compulsory sterilization of “low IQ” people, and described himself as an opponent of “miscegenation” and “race-mixing.” Hanania apologized for these writings after they were unearthed by HuffPost, saying they were from a time when he “truly sucked.” None of this affected Hanania’s career much, in part because of conservatives’ opposition to cancel culture and in part because the tech-right is almost entirely made up of race realists. \nHanania and Thompson may seem like strange bedfellows. But Hanania’s relationship with the tech-right has fractured since Trump returned to office. Last December, Hanania took Elon Musk’s side in a fractious online debate over H-1B visas. Hanania, after all, is a race realist, not a popular racist. The majority of H-1B recipients are from India and China. I won’t get into the intricacies of race scientists’ intellectual hierarchies, but suffice to say they believe some Asian groups are smarter than some white groups, with variations based on ethnicity and caste. (This is in fact a common defense among the human biodiversity crowd; they can’t possibly be racist if they believe East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews are the intellectual elite.) Hanania is a defender of “elite human capital” — also the title of his forthcoming book — no matter their skin color, which means he supports high-skilled immigration even if, as the nativist right claims, it comes at the expense of white American workers. \nThe nativists seem to have won that debate, at least for now. Musk is no longer in Trump’s ear, while Stephen Miller and other America First types continue to dictate Trump’s immigration policies. Hanania told Semafor’s Ben Smith that he left Marc Andreessen’s Signal group chat — which Hanania helped fill with prominent right-wingers — in 2023 after it became a “vehicle for groupthink.” He even claims to regret voting for Trump. He is now on a sort of apology tour. He has disavowed many of his former allies, described MAGA as having an IQ problem, and has accused Trump of “unprecedented” corruption. It makes sense, then, that Hanania would be looking to forge new alliances. \nThompson’s willingness to engage with Hanania, on the other hand, is a bit harder to parse. Abundance is best described as a book by liberals for liberals; it’s a roadmap for a sort of utopian tech-futurism. The book is both about the nitty-gritty of deregulation — Thompson and Klein argue that liberals’ affinity for bureaucracy and red tape has stalled growth, leading to a shortage of housing, jobs, and overall prosperity — and an effort to remake the Democratic Party in the wake of the 2024 election. \nAs part of their promotional tour, Thompson and Klein have put forth a theory on why Kamala Harris lost the popular vote. The Abundance authors are part of a growing chorus of liberal technocrats who claim that Harris’ deference to “The Groups” came at the expense of appealing to actual voters who are primarily concerned with the cost of living and are put off by Democrats’ emphasis on race and identity. To get the “solarpunk future” of Thompson and Klein’s dreams, Democrats must not only do away with overzealous regulation but also eschew culture war issues and the nonprofits that espouse them. Still, an abundant future is not a nationalist one — in fact, it relies on an influx of immigrant laborers with specialized skills, or what Thompson has described as “immigration-as-recruitment.” This future dovetails nicely with Hanania’s desire to eradicate DEI, as well as his support of high-skilled immigration. \nKlein and Thompson, to be clear, are not race scientists, proponents of human biodiversity, or cryptofascists. They are avowed liberals — Klein is a Times columnist and Thompson worked at The Atlantic until recently — who are trying to salvage what’s left of the Democratic Party by giving it a pro-deregulation facelift. Unlike Trump’s mass deportations and total dismantling of the federal bureaucracy in the name of ending DEI, Abundance is not underpinned by scientific racism or eugenic ideology. But its figureheads certainly don’t stand up against it, and may even think that doing so is a waste of time better spent forging alliances with people across the ideological spectrum.\nIn a few months, Klein and Thompson will headline an Abundance conference organized in part by the Foundation for American Innovation, a conservative think tank that helped co-author Project 2025. Abundance means more of everything, including more of the tired Democratic strategy of forging a coalition by making overtures to repentant conservatives — including unrepentant racists who see entire swaths of the population as inherently and biologically inferior.","summary":"The New York Times' recent report on Zohran Mamdani's Columbia University application raised a lot of questions, such as: In what universe does this fall under the umbrella of news that's fit to print?

Now Trump's doomed them all","text":"A tiny county that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump has now been doomed by his flagship policy.\n\nA staggering 85 percent of Knox County in Kentucky backed the president in the election in November, with just 14 percent wanting Kamala Harris sworn in.\n\nBut just eight months later they may be regretting it, as his Big Beautiful Bill looks set to tear apart their everyday lives.\n\nThe policy looks set to strip $1trillion from Medicaid leaving millions without insurance that could decimate healthcare systems in rural areas.\n\nKnox County, which has 30,000 people in it, has 38 percent of its total population on the system, including over 7,000 children.\n\nNow locals have spoken out, and feel betrayed by Trump, who promoted the bill as a 'win for workers, farmers, and America's future.'\n\nExperts have also weighed in and pointed out it leaves up to 17million Americans without any health cover.\n\nDr Osama Hashmi, a dermatologist in Atlanta, told the Daily Mail: 'People think of healthcare as a free-market system and it's really not. It affects everybody.' \n\nFor Knox County resident Teresa McNab, whose husband fell ill and fatally started seizing on the floor of their home in 2021, Medicaid helped save their family.\n\nNow, she and her daughter's coverage is being threatened by Trump's prized bill, which requires workers to work at least 80 hours per month to qualify for it.\n\nFor the line cook, who also cares for her mother, it's nearly impossible, she told The Telegraph.\n\n'I take care of my daughter, I take care of my 78-year-old mom, I take care of our home, and half the time I don't even have time for myself,' she said. \n\nFor Lisa Garrison, she would not have been able to afford her daughter's eye condition that would have cost her $180,000 without Medicaid. \n\n'You will be left without hospitals that can serve you near the hollers, without affordable or state-provided healthcare and SNAP benefits will also be affected.'\n\nShe added on her Facebook page earlier this month: 'This bill is atrocious and dangerous. This bill will cause people to die.'\n\nDr Hashmi agrees, adding to the Daily Mail that it will '100 percent lead to death'.\n\nKentucky faces the highest number of rural hospital closures in the country due to the bill, which will cut $28million from the Bluegrass State's program in 10 years. \n\nThirty-five hospitals in Kentucky are at risk, Democrat Governor Andy Beshear said, and 200,000 in the state could lose coverage.\n\nThe Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that the Bluegrass State has 19 hospitals that already have 'losses on services', which will only get worse when hospitals have to eat the cost of Medicaid cuts for patients unable to pay. \n\nIt also found that 16 are definitely at risk of closing, with four at the immediate risk level, a June 2025 report found. \n\n'This bill risks 200,000 Kentuckians' lives, the jobs of 20,000 healthcare workers, 35 rural hospitals, and our economy,' the governor said in a statement. 'The passage of the 'big, ugly bill' marks a sad day for our country and commonwealth.\n\n'Kentucky deserves better.' \n\nThe Medicaid cuts don't go into effect until January 1, 2027, but Hashmi said recipients will feel the effects much sooner and possibly within the next 12 months. \n\nHospitals and other healthcare providers in Atlanta, where he works, have already begun discussing whether or not they will continue to accept Medicaid as they 'decrease [their] reliance' on it ahead of the upcoming federal funding losses. \n\n'That planning starts now,' Hashmi, who volunteers and works at a private practice, said. 'Patients will see the effects in 12 months.'\n\nAlthough those who lose their coverage will feel the effects the fastest, the federal cuts also hurt those using private insurance. \n\nAs hospitals and doctors' offices close in rural areas, patients will be forced to go to urban areas and even metropolises to receive care, which ups wait times, decreases the quality of care as doctors have to see more patients, and threatens the infrastructure of healthcare. \n\n'We already have an access problem in the US,' Hashmi said.\n\nMore so: 'We all pay into this,' the dermatologist said. Without federal funding, the states will have to subsidize hospitals to keep them afloat or the facilities risk bankruptcy. \n\nThis means the 50 states, especially those that heavily rely on Medicaid funding, will have to raise taxes for residents. \n\n'State systems are going to be severely disrupted,' Hashmi said. \n\nThe debt hospitals take on for low-income patients will also rise, not just because ill person cannot pay them, but they will now take longer to seek care. \n\nThis means, when they do seek medical attention, they'll be in later stages of diseases and illnesses that will require more advanced care, especially for cancer patients, who might seek help after it's too late. \n\nHashmi said he has many patients where he can cure their skin cancer by simply removing it if it's detected early, but for those who wait longer, it might not be so simple. \n\nHe fears more Medicaid patients will wait until it's an emergency to seek help. \n\n'I think they should be really worried,' he said of the cuts. \n\nMiller Morris, a women's health researcher, said: 'Medicaid isn't just a line item, it's a lifeline.' \n\nAnd the cuts affect organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provides STD testing, prenatal and postpartum services, and birth control to patients. \n\n'Cutting these services means millions of low-income women, especially in rural areas, will lose access to basic, often life-saving care.' \n\nLeadership Consultant, Harold Reynolds, of Chicago, who works with clients in rural areas, called the bill a '$1trillion mistake.' \n\n'Whether the motive is fiscal conservatism or opposition to the [Affordable Care Act], the result of these cuts is not a more efficient system. It's a more fragile one,' he told Daily Mail.\n\n'We're not just talking about trimming excess, we're pulling funding from hospitals and providers that serve everyone.' \n\nMany experts also told Daily Mail that the miseducation surrounding Medicaid - which is also called Obamacare - very much could have played a role in the support and confusion surrounding this bill. \n\nMany people whose healthcare was threatened under the bill had no idea, as they didn't realize their services were Medicaid, which now risks the health and safety of children, adults, and the elderly. \n\n'Supporters justify this by pointing to $56billion in 'improper payments' in 2023. But what they don't explain is that the vast majority of those payments are not fraud,' Reynolds said. \n\n'According to federal data, only about 1-4 percent of those improper payments are suspected fraud. The rest are paperwork errors, billing mismatches, or technical violations.\n\n'What's really being cut is the funding that pays for maternity wards, ambulance services, emergency rooms, and nursing home care. Medicaid isn't just a benefit for the poor. It's a revenue stream for hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. \n\n'Gutting it weakens the whole system,' Reynolds concluded.\n\nAnd if rural communities are impacted significantly more than urban areas and cities, it could become a legal problem for the Trump Administration, Attorney Ben Michael, of Michael & Associates, told Daily Mail. \n\n'With eligibility requirements becoming stricter, and if rural areas are more negatively impacted as others, that may be grounds for legal action in regard to discrimination,' he said. \n\nBut for now, Americans brace for the inevitable and pray for a more equitable solution.","summary":"A small town that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump has now been doomed by the president.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14894547/small-maga-town-trump-voters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/15/100226625-0-image-a-10_1752245433118.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 17:04:44","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.635},{"id":340690850,"title":"'I voted for none of this': Podcaster who championed Trump in 2024 unloads on his 'boy'","text":"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his advisers not only rallied his hardcore MAGA base — they also made a point of reaching out to independents, swing voters, Latinos, the Manosphere and Gen-Z men.

The Truth Is Complicated.' \n\nDespite previously describing the issue as a conspiracy theory only found in the right-wing, the Times' latest article now condemns 'Democrat politicians' for suggesting Aurora residents and conservatives were merely 'crying wolf.' \n\nIn the latest article shared this month, Aurora resident Cindy Romero told her story of filming Tren de Aragua gang members loitering outside her apartment, straddling guns and threatening residents. \n\nThe footage went viral, and Romero - a self-described 'lifelong Democrat' - joined Trump on stage as she said her city had become overwhelmed. \n\nThe issue was fueled by an influx of 40,000 Venezuelans who had been bussed to Denver, Colorado in just two years, taking advantage of its sanctuary city status to live free in hotels. \n\nWhen their time in the makeshift shelters was up, large numbers moved to Aurora, as it was a cheaper place to live. \n\nThe mass migration allowed Tren de Aragua to gain traction in Aurora, where it set up drug trafficking rings and was quickly involved in a number of violent crimes. \n\nDanielle Jurinsky, a Republican city councilwoman who often shared Romero's footage, was cited in the Times' story in September for having 'pointed to Romero's video as evidence that large numbers of Tren de Aragua members had come with the influx of migrants.' \n\nWhile saying this month that this moment was used by Democrats to 'cry wolf' over the issue, just 10 months earlier the Times was downplaying the very same issue. \n\nThe outlet spoke with Yorman Fernandez, a 29-year-old Venezuelan who lived at one of the properties it now admits were overran with gang members. \n\nFernandez minimized the issue and said he was the victim of stereotyping, 'because of one or two Venezuelans who wanted to do something wrong, we are now all accused of something.' \n\nBut now, that level of 'one or two' migrants ruining the reputation of all others is not so easily dismissed. \n\nThe Times in-depth new piece gives bloodcurdling details of life in Aurora - including at the apartment complexes named as Tren de Aragua nests by Trump.\n\nThe night Venezuela's dictator president Nicolas Maduro won re-election last July, a 10 minute gun battle erupted inside Romero's apartment building.\n\nGangsters brought motorbikes into apartments and revved them at all hours, had noisy parties that went all night and knocked holes in walls so apartments whose electricity had been cut off could be powered by others still on the grid.\n\nDowntown Aurora was described by a local who spoke to the paper as now having the same uneasy, threatening vibe as Venezuela itself. \n\nThe outlet noted this month that 'immigration arrests in Colorado are up more than 250 percent since Trump took office, but that has not ended the presence of young men with guns in Aurora’s downtown.' \n\n'The more central Aurora became to Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, the greater the temptation among Democratic politicians and activists to wave away talk of gang activity in the city as a right-wing hallucination,' the Times wrote this month. \n\n'But their refusal to acknowledge the violence that some residents were seeing with their own eyes came off not as reassurance but as erasure.","summary":"The esteemed paper has contradicted its own recent reporting about the hell of living in Aurora, Colorado.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14896915/New-York-Times-admits-migrant-conspiracy-theory-scolded-Donald-Trump-TRUE.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/14/100221693-0-image-m-16_1752239600549.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/29/8352342017037845877/1024x576_MP4_8352342017037845877.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-11 15:42:12","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":340661156,"title":"Charles Barkley offers shock take on pro-Trump Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl's potential senate run","text":"Auburn alum and former Republican Charles Barkley would support Tigers basketball coach Bruce Pearl's U.S. Senatorial campaign if the outspoken supporter of Donald Trump and Israel ever ran for the office in Alabama.\n\n'I respect and trust him,' the basketball legend and Inside the NBA co-host told AL.com.

They couldn't have me because I always talked about reality on my show, and they always had a problem with that—ABC.\"\"Even back in the early days of your show?\" host Sage Steele asked. \"Even back in the '90s?\"\"Oh yeah. Every day was a fight,\" Barr replied.Vaccine skepticism has been on the rise following the COVID-19 pandemic. One in five Americans believe vaccines are more dangerous than the illnesses, according to a 2024 Gallup poll, which is an increase from 11 percent in 2019.\"During the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines underwent the most intensive safety analysis in U.S. history,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state on their website. \"COVID-19 vaccines continue to be monitored for safety, even after FDA approval, to make sure they continue to meet FDA's standards for safety and effectiveness.\"The recent rise in measles cases—a highly contagious infection that was once considered eradicated in the U.S.—has been linked to anti-vaccine sentiment.Meanwhile, concerns over election fraud have also run rampant. Trump said he \"won\" 2020 election over his opponent Joe Biden, saying there was widespread voter fraud, and in 2024, there were concerns that the election was \"rigged\" in favor of Trump against then-Vice President Kamala Harris.What People Are SayingIn the comments underneath Barr's interview with Steele, fans praised their conversation.YouTube user @ElaineGates-f9i wrote: \"Absolutely loved this.

Voters will select a candidate to occupy a vacant city council seat, which opened up after Councilmember Trayon White was removed in February due to his 2024 arrest related to a federal corruption investigation. Notably, White is among those vying to return to his previous position on the council.\n\nThis election offers the district’s 8th Ward residents the chance to regain council representation as the city contends with a $1 billion budget gap, a result of the Trump administration’s considerable cuts to the federal workforce. Additionally, the city faces a separate billion-dollar budget dispute with congressional Republicans and a potential conflict between the city’s Democratic mayor and the council over a proposed $4 billion stadium deal with the Washington Commanders football team.\n\nApart from White, the candidates in the race include Salim Adofo, Mike Austin, and Sheila Bunn. Adofo currently chairs a local Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), while Austin, an attorney, is a former ANC chair. Bunn has previously served as a top aide to former mayor and longstanding Councilmember Vincent Gray, and to the district’s congressional non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton. All four candidates are Democrats, with no Republicans featured on the ballot.\n\nDespite his ongoing legal troubles, White was reelected in 2024 with 76% of the vote over his Republican opponent. Adofo challenged White in the primary that year but placed second with 28% of the vote, behind White’s 51%. Austin challenged White in the 2020 primary, but White prevailed with 58% to Austin’s 28%.\n\nWard 8, like the city itself, is heavily Democratic. Former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris carried the ward with 91% of the vote in the 2024 presidential race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nIn District of Columbia elections, recounts are automatic in city council races if the margin is less than 1% of the total vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nSpecial election day\n\nWashington’s city council special election will be held Tuesday.

Of those, 76% were Democrats, 4% were Republicans and about 18% were not registered with any party. The remainder were registered with minor parties.\n\nTurnout for special elections in the district tends to be significantly lower than that of regularly scheduled general elections. An April 2015 special election for a Ward 8 city council seat had turnout at 14% of registered voters. By comparison, turnout for the same Ward 8 seat was 24% of registered voters for the 2022 general election and 52% in 2024.\n\nA June 2020 special election for a Ward 2 city council seat also saw a steep drop-off in voter turnout compared with regularly scheduled elections. Turnout in that contest was 23% of registered voters, compared with 42% in the 2022 general election and 75% in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBallots are mailed to all registered voters in Ward 8, so a relatively large share of voters typically do not vote at the polls on Election Day. In higher-profile elections, like the 2022 mayoral race and the 2024 presidential race, more than 70% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day. As of Wednesday, a total of 2,681 Ward 8 ballots had already been cast.

(And also speak plainly about those policies.)\n\nTo briefly recap, I’ll just quote myself: \n\nThe data confirms what our ears are already telling us: We’ve become the party of the elite, and the 2024 exit polls make that clear. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won wealthier voters who make $100,000 and above by 51-47%, but lost those earning less than that by the exact same margin [...]\n\n[President Donald] Trump won those who said that inflation had caused them “severe hardship” by a whopping 76-23% margin. He also won those suffering “moderate hardship” 52-46%. Being the party of the elite, Harris won those suffering “no hardship” 78-21%. As former Daily Kos writer Kerry Eleveld once said during a podcast, “Democrats are the party of people who don’t have to look at grocery prices while shopping.”\n\nTrump tapped into that anxiety by promising to lower prices “on Day One”—a ridiculous pledge that he still hasn’t met despite being however many hellish days into this presidency. But by simply acknowledging the economic pain people felt, he didn’t just win lower-income voters; he also made major inroads with Latinos and Asians. \n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, is taking the same approach, promising free child care, free buses, a rent freeze, and low-cost city-run grocery stores, plus a lot else. It’s easy to promise big things when you’re not yet in charge, but the first job of a politician is to get elected. And step one is understanding what people actually care about.\n\nI’m skeptical of Mamdani’s ability to deliver on his entire platform, but he’s doing the most important thing: explicitly telling voters, I hear you. I’m going to try like hell to make your life easier. Even if he pulls off only part of that, voters will reward the effort. And his relentless focus on pocketbook issues gives confidence that he gets it.\n\nTake this viral clip from January, back when he was stuck in the single digits in the polls. He interviewed halal food vendors and revealed that, thanks to city hall’s broken permitting system, entrepreneurs have to pay tens of thousands to so-called fixers for a permit that technically costs around $400, according to one of the vendors. That’s legalized corruption, driving up food prices. \n\n“New York is suffering from a crisis, and it’s called halalflation,” Mamdani said in the video. In a post accompanying the video, he hit the message perfectly: “Chicken over rice now costs $10 or more. It’s time to make halal eight bucks again.”\n\nThat line is genius, painting a picture of a Democratic city drowning in dysfunction. It’s not just about the $2 or $3 extra it’s costing New Yorkers for what should be cheaper eats. If we can’t make government work in a city where we run everything, why should voters trust us anywhere else?\n\nA newer ad from Mamdani on this theme is just as strong:\n\nIn this one, he promises to make it “faster, easier, and cheaper” to start and operate a small business. Why should an aspiring barber have to, in Mamdani’s words, “fill out 24 forms and go through seven agencies to start a barbershop”?\n\nI tested NYC’s business portal myself. To start a barbershop, I got a list of 31 requirements spread across more than a dozen agencies. I didn’t dig into all the forms (I’m not moving to Queens to cut hair), but his numbers check out—and might even be conservative.\n\nTo be clear, not all red tape is bad. Some regulations exist for good reason—like making sure that chemicals used in barbershops don’t poison the air or water, or that buildings meet fire codes. \n\nBut when the process becomes so bloated that entrepreneurs have to pay $22,000 to fixers for a $400 permit, that’s not public safety—it’s legalized extortion. When it takes a year to get a sign approved, you’re not ensuring quality; you’re suffocating small business. \n\nThat’s the larger truth: Even well-intentioned regulations can pile up into an expensive, time-consuming, job-killing mess. Local governments should be doing everything they can to make starting a small business easier, not treating it like a hazing ritual.\n\nDemocrats can’t cede the language of struggle and survival to Republicans. We need more candidates who don’t just talk policy but can also translate it into plain language and real relief, communicating clearly to voters that they’ll fight to lower the damn price of lunch. And rent. And child care. And education … you get the picture.","summary":"Regular readers know I’ve been harping on this theme: To win, Democrats need to promise—and deliver!—clear, immediate, and simple solutions to the cost-of-living challenges facing voters.

Pre-Trump, the FCC didn’t give much thought to what constituted public interest, but Carr has, I am told.\n\nIn his world view, the First Amendment gives CBS or any local affiliate freedom to publish what it wants. What the First Amendment doesn’t confer is FCC approval for local broadcast licenses, and one interpretation of public interest is that news content must not contain political bias. \n\nPundits can bounce around opinions all they want, but when news shows tilt the scales during debates when a national election is on the line, as alleged in the “60 Minutes” interview with a presidential candidate, the FCC can deny local broadcast licensing and upend mergers like Paramount’s sale to Skydance.\n\nConservatives have been harping for years about TV bias, the open flouting of the FCC rules, but Carr is the first to take it seriously. He intends to make CBS his test case as the Skydance-Paramount deal seeks his agency’s blessing.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Trump’s lawsuit against CBS for allegedly editing the Harris interview to make her sound smarter and more presidential, is nearly identical to a complaint filed by a conservative legal group, Center For American Rights with the FCC that sparked the FCC investigation of CBS and placed another roadblock to the deal.\n\nHere’s what people close to the FCC tell me. Trump won some concessions out of CBS, the money, the PSAs and now going forward, CBS must release full transcripts of interviews so the public can see if it’s deceptively editing news interviews. \n\nCarr will demand a bit more, I am told. Maybe an ombudsman to monitor news content. The Center For American Rights has spoken with the FCC and given some remedies including moving some of CBS’s operations out from the progressive ecosystem of New York, DC and Los Angeles.\n\nCarr also has said he wants to preserve local news, where affiliate stations have been complaining that they are getting squeezed by CBS with ever higher fees to run content. CBS might be forced to cut the affiliates a break. \n\nThe decision on just what to agree to will largely be up to Ellison, the independent movie producer of such hits as “Top Gun: Maverick,” since he will be the new owner once the deal is approved. And make no mistake, this is getting approved one way or another. \n\nDavid is the son of mega billionaire Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, and a Trump MAGA supporter.\n\nTrump, Carr’s boss, wants the deal to proceed, but he also wants to twist the knife into CBS just a bit more for years of alleged biased coverage of him and his agenda. So, expect the deal to get approved with a few conditions that Ellison is likely to agree with whether or not it angers the progressive purists that haven’t already left in the CBS news division.\n\nThe timing of all this is a little uncertain.

Can you believe that was only a year ago? What a wild period in American history that was: the CNN debate, Trump gets shot, Biden drops out, Kamala swaps in... all in the span of, like, a month.It's worth taking a beat to remember what happened on that fairground in western Pennsylvania, because there are still so many unanswered—maybe unanswerable—questions about a moment that came within a quarter-inch of changing the course of history. In fact, it probably did change the course of history in terms of being the moment that solidified Donald Trump's political comeback. Would he have won had he not been shot? Perhaps, but his victory was a foregone conclusion in my mind as soon as he put his fist in the air, as captured in that iconic photo by the AP's Evan Vucci (one of the greatest pieces of photojournalism of my lifetime. Still in awe when I look at it).Because even if you loathe Trump, as so many do, you must admit that his handling of that moment in Butler... jumping up from a pile of Secret Service agents, blood smeared on his face, fist raised, \"Fight!\".... was both politically brilliant and incredibly, badass cool.And yet, despite the fact that we came so close to watching the former and future American president murdered on live television, it doesn't feel like Butler was this momentous event, does it? Part of that, I think, is just how the news cycle plays these days. Part of it is an anti-Trump bias in the media, probably. Part of it is how little we still know about the motives of the kid who almost became the Gavrilo Princip of the 21st century. But it's notable how the near assassination of the Republican candidate for president did not really lead to a moment of national unity or reflection that, I think, so many of us were hoping for.I remember watching the RNC the following week, when Trump came out on the last night to deliver his convention speech. I remember thinking about how he looked different: older, more vulnerable than we were used to seeing him with that big bandage on his injured ear. He started his speech in this really reflective tone—very unusual for him—talking about how painful it was to discuss what had happened the prior Saturday and how \"you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell.\" It was an absolutely gripping moment. I thought, fleetingly, that not only was he going to win regardless of who the Dems were about to swap in for Joe, but that maybe he really was saved by some kind of divine intervention, and that we were about to see a new side of Donald Trump.It didn't really work out that way. By the halfway point of the RNC speech he was back to his laundry list of grievances interspersed with random asides about Kid Rock and his poll numbers. Trump did go on to win decisively, helped along by Kamala Harris being an awful opponent, but he hasn't really even tried to capitalize on that moment of national relief after Butler by trying to unify the country during his second term. It's a shame, really. It feels like a lost opportunity.As for the shooter, quick... can you remember his name off the top of your head? I didn't think so. Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old weirdo who somehow managed to crawl onto that roof and get a clean line of sight to the biggest target in the world, left virtually no trace. No social media footprint, no friends, no apparent motive. A registered Republican who donated to the Democrats and had no obvious beef with Trump? What? It's no wonder there have been so many conspiracy theories about what him. I think as humans, we have a very hard time comprehending when trivial people are able to have such an outsized impact on history. Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, Chapman, Ray, the dude who almost killed Reagan to make Jodie Foster fall in love with him (didn't work). These guys were all stone cold losers who just got lucky, or almost lucky.Thankfully for the country, Crooks' joins their company in the \"almost lucky\" column.Trump Finds Retreating From World Stage Is Easier Said Than DoneWhen Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency in 2016, 2020 and 2024, he made one overarching promise to voters: no more costly overseas entanglements.In a video rolling out his foreign policy agenda during the 2024 campaign, Trump called himself \"the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict, but they don't know how to get us out.\"Now, approaching six months into his second term, Trump has publicly toyed with the idea of annexing Canada and invading Greenland; ordered a series of missile strikes on Iran; and mused about the possibility of regime change in Tehran (he later backed off that threat), while also engaging in an on-again, off-again trade war with much of the world.

Raúl Grijalva, who died in March from complications from cancer treatment.\n\nThe winners will represent their parties in a Sept. 23 special election to serve out the remaining 15 months of Grijalva’s term in the 7th Congressional District, which stretches from Yuma to Tuscon and hugs almost the entire length of Arizona’s border with Mexico.\n\nThe seat will not decide control of the U.S. House, but it is one of three vacancies in heavily Democratic districts that, when filled in special elections this fall, will likely chip away at Republicans’ slender 220-212 majority in the chamber.\n\nFive candidates are running for the Democratic nomination. Former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva is the daughter of the late congressman and has the support of many of the state’s most prominent Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, state Attorney General Kris Mayes and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. She also has endorsements from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, key figures in the party’s progressive wing. Sanders is an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nFormer state Rep. Daniel Hernandez previously ran in the neighboring 6th Congressional District in 2022 but fell short of the nomination. As a congressional intern in January 2011, he provided care to Giffords after a near-fatal assassination attempt outside a Tucson grocery store.\n\nSocial media influencer and progressive activist Deja Foxx is the youngest in the field at age 25. As a 16-year-old, Foxx gained prominence when an interaction she had with Republican then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake on reproductive rights at a 2017 town hall went viral. She went on to work as a digital strategist for Kamala Harris’ presidential primary campaign in 2020. She told Rolling Stone in 2021 that she plans to be president.\n\nIndigenous activist and scholar Jose Malvido Jr. and former health care executive Patrick Harris Sr. also seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Republican primary ballot features contractor and small business owner Daniel Butierez, restaurant owner Jorge Rivas and general contractor and vehicle accessory business owner Jimmy Rodriguez. All three have previously sought elected office.\n\nButierez received about 37% of the vote as the Republican nominee against Raúl Grijalva in 2024, while then-presidential candidate Donald Trump retook Arizona at the top of the ballot. Rivas mounted a short-lived campaign for governor in 2022 following a 2020 flap when his and his wife’s attendance at a Trump campaign rally triggered negative reviews of his restaurant. Rodriguez ran for Congress in 2020, initially filing to run in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District as a GOP primary challenger to then-U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko but ultimately withdrawing and running instead in Vermont, where he lost the Republican nomination to face Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nHernandez led the field in fundraising as of late June, with $981,000 in total contributions compared with $834,000 for Grijalva and $600,000 for Foxx. But Hernandez’s high spending rate left Adelita Grijalva with the most money in the bank heading into the campaign’s final stretch. She had about $128,000 as of June 25, compared with $100,000 for Foxx and about $37,000 for Hernandez.\n\nButierez had brought in nearly $180,000 for his campaign, most of it in loans secured by the candidate. His $98,000 in the bank far eclipsed the rest of the GOP field.\n\nThe majority-Hispanic 7th District includes parts of six counties, including the three most populous: Maricopa, Pima and Pinal. While Maricopa often plays a pivotal role in statewide elections, it takes a backseat in the 7th District to Pima County, which comprises more than 60% of the district’s registered voters.\n\nDemocrats enjoy a nearly 2-1 ratio registration advantage over Republicans, both districtwide as well as in five of the six counties. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the small corner of Pinal County that falls within district boundaries.\n\nAfter Pima County, Maricopa and Yuma counties offer the highest potential for possible votes in both Democratic and Republican primaries, followed by Santa Cruz.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nIn Arizona, recounts are automatic if the vote margin is 0.5% of the total vote or less. The AP may declare a winner in a race that’s eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect Tuesday:\n\nSpecial primary day\n\nThe special primaries for Arizona’s 7th Congressional District will be held Tuesday. Polls close districtwide at 7 p.m. local time, which is 10 p.m. ET. No results will be released before 11 p.m. ET. Most of Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare winners in both the Democratic and Republican primaries.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nThe special primaries are limited to voters who are registered in the 7th Congressional District. Registered Democrats and Republicans may vote only in their own parties’ primaries. Independents may vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of June 16, there were nearly 440,000 voters registered in the 7th District. Of those, about 175,000, or 40%, were Democrats, and nearly 92,000, or 21%, were Republicans. Roughly 165,000 voters were not registered with any party.\n\nIn the 2024 primaries for the 7th District, turnout was 12% of registered voters in the Democratic primary and 5% in the Republican primary. About 92% of Democratic primary voters and about 80% of Republican primary voters cast their ballots before election day.\n\nAs of Thursday, nearly 40,000 Democratic and more than 12,000 Republican primary ballots had already been cast.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the AP first reported results in the 7th District at 10 p.m. ET, the earliest time votes were allowed to be released under state law. Tabulation ended for the night at 6:44 a.m. ET with about 55% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 70 days until the special general election on Sept. 23.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Eight candidates will go before southern Arizona voters at the ballot box Tuesday in special congressional primaries to replace longtime Democratic U.S. Rep.

In this post, they have imagined that Vice-President Kamala Harris won the election as the President of the United States, and Donald Trump is jailed.\n\nThey have also imagined that “woke” ideology has become the mainstream institutional standard, and US borders are now open for immigrants.\n\nThis imaginary alternate universe has sparked an intense debate. This post was clearly meant as political commentary and has now successfully garnered attention across political lines.\n\nNow, if a discussion is alive on X.com, how could billionaire CEO Elon Musk stay away from the controversy?

It has reignited interest in Musk that had been dying down closely after his White House exit.\n\nThis has also given Musk a political platform to shape his future discourse on. These sorts of engagements give Musk the conversations he needs to grow his potential future role in reshaping political discourse.\n\nMusk was once considered a Trump ally and was rhetorically called the First Buddy. However, there has been a very public fall out between Trump and Musk on X.com. Their disagreement escalated after Musk’s public criticism of Trump’s leadership style and his indirect jabs at Trump’s political rhetoric.\n\nThe rift between Musk and Trump deepened when Musk indicated Trump’s name being associated with jeffrey epstein files. Though Musk did not come out right and elaborate, the implication was clear, and it was enough to provoke an aggressive response from Trump.\n\nElon Musk confirms exposing Epstein files is a high priority for the America Party. pic.twitter.com/w6TUdJmllo\n— Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) July 8, 2025\n\nThe implication was enough to provoke an aggressive response from Trump. The President labeled Musk “crazy,” accusing him of engaging in smear tactics and betraying prior goodwill.\n\nNow that ties have been broken, Musk is looking to start his own party. However, the only issue is that he has no mandate or agenda, and all he promises is a country that’s different from what Trump is showing right now or what Harris would have eventually led America to.\n\nTherefore, such controversial ideas are beneficial for Musk as they give him legs to stand on. Unsurprisingly, Trump has dismissed the initiative and has called the idea “ridiculous.” He has also suggested that Musk lacks the political credibility to launch a viable movement.\n\nTrump says Elon Musk ‘can have fun with it’, but a new party is ‘ridiculous’. pic.twitter.com/GL98mhBmv1\n— ℂ𝕙𝕖 𝔾𝕦𝕖𝕧𝕒𝕣𝕒 ★ (@cheguwera) July 7, 2025\n\nStill, Musk’s large social following and his ownership of X give him a powerful platform that many political figures can’t afford to ignore.\nElon Musk’s cryptic “Good Points” response to a viral multiverse scenario post has highlighted growing political tensions.

On Wednesday, Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis offered a blunt ultimatum to staff who aren't onboard with the \"new direction\" the paper is taking under its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. \"I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,\" Lewis wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that. The VSP is designed to support you in making this decision, give you the ability to weigh your options thoughtfully and with less concern about financial consequences. And if you think that it’s time to move on to a new chapter, the VSP helps you take that next step with more security.\" WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFFERS WHO DON'T ‘FEEL ALIGNED’ WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT The buyout program, first announced in May by Post executive editor Matt Murray, specifically targeted veteran staffers and other departments. The program is set to conclude by the end of July. The staffer suspects, however, that Lewis' mid-July message means \"people aren't interested\" in taking the buyout despite the turmoil and agony that has erupted in recent months. \"It’s been one set of blows after another. So this memo is par for the course,\" the insider says. \"Another bomb went off but who notices anymore?\" LONGTIME WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST QUITS PAPER, SLAMS GROWING EDITORIAL CONSTRAINTS UNDER BEZOS One staffer who wasn't onboard with the \"new direction\" of the Post was longtime columnist Joe Davidson, who shed light on what led to his resignation from the paper late last month. It is unclear whether he took a voluntary buyout. \"For me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,\" the 20-year Post veteran wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \"While the policy prohibiting opinion and commentary in News section articles can be justified journalistically, it is a departure from longstanding Post practice and mandated a change in my role that I chose not to accept.\" While Davidson didn't believe Bezos was directly involved in his column being killed, he wrote, \"it would be naïve to ignore the context.\" \"Starting before the November presidential election, Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,\" Davidson said. \"The result – fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy.\" \"Nonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong. Yet the policy against opinion in News section columns means less critical scrutiny of Trump -- a result coinciding with Bezos’s unseemly and well-document[ed] coziness with the president,\" Davidson continued. He later wrote, \"As a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column… When Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction. The Post continues to produce first-rate journalism now, despite his morale-busting actions.\" JEFF BEZOS' TENURE AS WASHINGTON POST OWNER IN SPOTLIGHT AS PAPER GRAPPLES WITH LOW MORALE, STAFFER EXODUS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Post has suffered a dramatic decline in subscriptions, which was further fueled by multiple boycott campaigns against the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper over decisions made by Bezos. In October, Bezos set off an uproar when he halted the paper's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. Then in February 2025, Bezos announced his directive for the Post's editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. Both instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos' new policy. Last month, the Post tapped Adam O'Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages. The paper has lost a flood of reporters to rival publications in recent months, such as Josh Dawsey, Ashey Parker, Michael Schere and Tyler Pager, in addition to columnists who have quit, like Jennifer Rubin, Eugene Robinson and Ruth Marcus. A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment to Fox News Digital.","summary":"The latest effort by The Washington Post to reduce headcount is hitting a wall according to one insider at the paper, as low morale continues to plague the newsroom.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-staff-shellshocked-constant-blows-morale-bosses-seek-buyouts-insider-says","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/WaPojpg.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 12:00:22","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":340582030,"title":"Why Zohran Mamdani matters outside New York City","text":"There are several reasons that the election will reverberate beyond the five boroughs.\n\nNew York City isn’t Las Vegas\n\nThe old saying is that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Not true in New York City, which is the country’s largest. Of NYC, it is said that if you make it there, you make it anywhere. \n\nNew York is second only to Washington, D.C., as the home of the national political press. It is arguably the most important city for the Democratic Party in 2025.\n\nPolitical trends in the city that doesn’t sleep will necessarily receive outsize attention. If Mamdani wins, he will become a model for socialists throughout the country on how to obtain and wield political power. He will also quickly become the top Republican bogeyman.\n\nDemocrats are looking for direction\n\nThe Democratic Party has been trying to find itself since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Democrats have been having a national conversation about Mamdani’s candidacy, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) and former Rep. Dean Phillips speaking out against it and several other, more liberal Democrats being slow to endorse him.\n\nWhen CNN asked Phillips whether the Democratic Party was big enough for both him and Mamdani, the former Minnesota congressman replied, “The answer, ultimately, I think is no.” Asked a similar question by PBS about Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, by contrast, said the party was a big tent.\n\nA Mamdani loss, or a disastrous four years in Gracie Mansion, could empower centrists and other Democrats who want the party to attempt to recapture the voters it lost to Trump. But a Mamdani victory will embolden everyone who would like to see the Democrats move to the left at a time of palpable progressive anger that occasionally (but increasingly frequently) bleeds into violence. \n\nMost Democrats, and virtually all of the party establishment, feared nominating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president in 2016 and 2020. They might be willing to nominate a younger version in 2028. It will at least influence how far Democrats may be willing to go on socialism, Resistance, Israel, and overthrowing their aging establishment, especially if a socialist can position himself as the candidate of affordability, as former Vice President Kamala Harris conspicuously failed to do last year. \n\nA Mamdani win could also directly influence the fortunes of top national Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and rising Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). \n\nFor a while, it looked like Democrats were going to handle urban progressive misgovernment themselves through the primary process. That hasn’t happened lately, with bad mayors chasing worse in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and now possibly New York City.\n\nAt least Mamdani is constitutionally ineligible to run for president. While the recent track record for New York City mayors seeking the White House hasn’t been good, Michael Bloomberg was hampered by his late entry and Rudy Giuliani by bad strategy. Both could have made it further if they had campaigned differently. \n\nSocialism on Wall Street\n\nA New York City mayor can muse about seizing the means of production, but most of what he would want to do would be outside the jurisdiction of local elected officials. But the city houses much of the U.S. financial sector. There could easily be an exodus of investors from the city. While that would mostly be felt locally, subjecting Wall Street to socialist leadership would have at least some national effect, even if only to demonstrate the powerlessness of wealthy New Yorkers to forestall this outcome.

Johnson in 1954 when he was serving as the U.S. Senate majority leader. It banned all tax-exempt organizations like churches and charities from “directly or indirectly” participating in politics, specifically in endorsement or opposition of candidates. \n\nWho was behind the lawsuit? \n\nThe July 7 filing stems from a lawsuit filed in Texas in September 2024 on behalf of the National Religious Broadcasters, an international association of evangelical Christian communicators, as well as Intercessors for America, a conservative Christian prayer advocacy group. Two Texas churches also joined as plaintiffs: First Baptist Church Waskom in Waskom, Texas, and Sand Springs Church in Athens, Texas. \n\nWhy are some people concerned? \n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, whose membership is comprised of nearly 40,000 \"atheists, agnostics and skeptics of any pedigree,\" was “stunned” by the reversal of the decades-long policy, foundation legal counsel Chris Line told USA TODAY. \n\nThe foundation has reported dozens of pastors and churches to the IRS over the years for engaging in what it viewed as prohibited political speech, Line said. \n\nIt reported the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in September 2024, for example, over its election guide that it said had a “clear bias and preference for Donald Trump and Republicans.” \n\nIt also reported New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia after former Vice President Kamala Harris was invited to speak at a worship service in October 2024. Pastor Jamal Bryant made comments that suggested the church was “urging its congregants to vote for Kamala Harris in the upcoming election in violation of the law,” the foundation’s letter to the IRS said. \n\nHe referenced the narrow nature of the IRS’ July statement and said it appears that “a lot of the worst actions would still be impermissible” under the tax code. There is, however, room for questions about where the line between prohibited and acceptable political involvement will fall in practice. \n\n“Churches shouldn’t necessarily feel 100% safe based on this to go out and start violating the Johnson Amendment,” he said. \n\nDan Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, also told USA TODAY the exemption “raises serious constitutional concerns” by “favoring religious viewpoints over nonreligious ones when handing out tax subsidies and benefits.” \n\nLine also expressed concern over the \"disparity\" between tax rules for religious organizations and other charitable entitites.\n\n\"We're in a situation now where churches are allowed to violate this law, but all other groups, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, were not given that same carve out,\" he said.\n\nThe American Humanist Association said it was “discouraged, but ultimately not surprised” by the decision in a July 8 statement. \n\n“The Johnson Amendment, though weakened over the years by lax enforcement, is the small but mighty dam standing in the way of a torrent of dark money influencing our elections,” executive director Fish Stark said. \n\nNow, “all bets are off.” \n\n“There will be little to stop billionaires from funneling money through churches to buy our elections – and they will get a tax write-off for doing it, all subsidized by American taxpayers,” Stark said. \n\nIt said the ruling is ultimately a boost for the religious right and Christian nationalists, whom they said now “have the megaphone they’ve been waiting for for decades.” \n\nWho's celebrating the decision?\n\nTrump called it a \"terrific\" move by the IRS.\n\n\"I love the fact that churches could endorse a political candidate,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, according to Reuters. \"If somebody of faith wants to endorse, I think it's something that I'd like to hear.\"\n\nRobert Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, said the change \"would never have happened without the strong leadership of our great President Donald Trump\" in a July 9 X post.\n\n\"Government has NO BUSINESS regulating what is said in pulpits!\" he wrote.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation also reported Jeffress to the IRS for his overt support of Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020.\n\nWhat previous actions have been taken to remove the Johnson Amendment? \n\nTrump pledged in his first term to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment and later claimed to have “gotten rid of” the provision, but the law has remained part of the tax code. Trump did, however, direct the Treasury Department to avoid penalizing religious organizations for speech about “moral or political issues from a religious perspective” in a May 2017 executive order. \n\nRep. Mark Harris, R-NC, and Sen. James Lankford, R-OK, introduced the Free Speech Fairness Act in March that sought to allow charitable organizations – which would include churches and other houses of worship − to make political statements “if such statements are made in the ordinary course of carrying out its tax-exempt purpose.” \n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, co-sponsored Lankford’s bill, while more than a dozen Republican representatives including Rep. Barry Moore, R-Alabama, and Abe Hamadeh, R-Arizona, co-sponsored the House bill. \n\n“For too long, the Johnson Amendment has silenced pastors, churches and non-profits from engaging on moral and political issues of our day for fear of losing their tax-exempt status,” Harris said in a March news release. “This attempt to muzzle people of faith must end – the Constitution is clear: Americans’ right to free speech shall not be infringed.” \n\nIs this a popular idea? \n\nAccording to a 2024 survey conducted by Lifeway research, a Southern Baptist Convention research organization, only three in 10 U.S. adults (29%) believe pastors publicly endorsing candidates for public office during a church service is appropriate. Three in five (60%) disagree, including 42% who strongly disagree and 11% who aren’t sure. \n\nWhen asked directly in the survey if churches that endorse political candidates should lose their tax-exempt status, around 48% of respondents agreed, 31% disagreed and 21% weren’t sure. \n\nBut the percentage of Americans who see pastors endorsing a candidate in church as appropriate has risen steadily over the past 16 years, according to the organization. In the first survey of the topic in 2008, only 13% saw political endorsements during a church service as acceptable. The number rose steadily in the second survey conducted in 2015, before rising to its current 29% in 2024. \n\nHas the Johnson Amendment been challenged before? \n\nPrevious court rulings have upheld the Johnson Amendment over the years. \n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the 1970s that a nonprofit religious organization was not entitled to a tax exemption because its actions, according to the court, sought to influence legislation and “attack(ed) candidates and incumbents who were considered too liberal.” \n\nThe ruling said the government has an “overwhelming and compelling” interest in keeping the “wall separating church and state ... high and firm.” \n\nDecades later, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that a religious organization that had its tax-exempt status revoked had “failed to establish a First Amendment violation” in the case. \n\nNotably, speakers at the inaugural meeting of Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission in June also supported challenges to the Johnson Amendment and expressed a belief that the First Amendment doesn’t prevent the government from promoting religion as a social good. \n\nBrieAnna Frank is a First Amendment Reporting Fellow at USA TODAY.
