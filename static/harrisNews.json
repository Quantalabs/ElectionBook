So how did we get here?\n\nElon Musk’s propaganda machine\n\nThe 2024 election made it clear why Elon Musk leveraged billions of dollars to purchase Twitter, which he has since rebranded as X. The wealthiest man in the world turned the site into a propaganda machine, amplifying conspiracy theories and bigotry.\n\nWhen he threw his support behind Trump, the site went all in on amplifying his campaign while escalating lies and falsehoods about Democrats, particularly President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, liberals and progressives mounted a mass exodus to Bluesky. Conservatives responded with anger—because they vitally need to troll liberals, which they prefer over speaking with each other.\n\nAttack on diversity\n\nTrump is a racist and the biggest promoter of the “birther” conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. In his first term, he praised Nazis as “very fine people.” And now in his second term, there’s just more of the same.\n\nBut instead of merely throwing around rhetoric where “woke” is a substitute for the N-word, Trump is using his power to roll back the very notion of diversity. He’s used executive action and internal government policy to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and has even taken to simply erasing the achievement of Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAt the same time, he’s fulfilled—in part, at least—his campaign pledges to the most virulent racists by affirming his support for the pro-slavery Confederacy. Trump and his lieutenants like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are relitigating the Civil War and coming down firmly on the side that viewed Black people as property.\n\nMusk’s government sledgehammer\n\nBy empowering Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency to infiltrate multiple government agencies, Trump advanced the longstanding right-wing mission to undermine effective government. Musk and his team of destructive operatives—like “Big Balls”—have tried to take down government agencies that millions of people rely on.\n\nThere has been significant resistance and a string of courtroom losses for Trump. But thanks to DOGE, the government’s ability to do things like send out Social Security payments and monitor hurricanes has been compromised.\n\nTrust in the government was already in trouble, but Trump and Musk made it worse—all in the name of “small” government, even if that means that people have to die.\n\nScared men and predators\n\nAt the Pentagon, former Fox News host Hegseth continues to be the living embodiment of the toxic masculinity that he represented on the right-wing network. The only problem is that it’s manifested in the mismanagement of the most powerful military in recorded history.\n\nWith Trump’s blessing, Hegseth pounds the table on so-called “warrior” ethos while gossiping on group chats about missile strikes and making a mess of international diplomacy.\n\nSimultaneously, the Trump administration has continued its outreach to the toxic right-wing manosphere by reportedly advocating for the release of influencer Andrew Tate, a misogynist who has been accused of rape in multiple countries. In other words, he’s the perfect hero for the Trump administration.\n\nNever stop pushing conspiracies\n\nTrump is a conspiracy theorist. For decades, he’s offered up half-baked, debunked theories on a litany of topics—like when he said that climate change was a Chinese “hoax”. Even though he and the GOP are in charge, the Trump team still insists that the “deep state” is out to get them.\n\nThe conspiracies are even worse this time around because they’re being fueled by Musk. He and Trump bandied about the notion that gold at Fort Knox had been stolen, even though Trump’s last Treasury secretary did a weird photo shoot there just a few years ago.\n\nThere is no such thing as “white genocide,” but Trump spent days harping on it, throwing a rhetorical bone to white supremacists who have pushed the conspiracy.\n\nThey love abusing and bombing people\n\nConservatism has a long-standing love affair with abusive behavior. The line goes back to figures like President George W. Bush, who promoted torture as U.S. policy with the euphemism “enhanced interrogation” at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\nNow Trump has brought it back to the forefront by abducting and detaining immigrants, crowing about detention camps, and having his subordinates like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stage photo shoots in front of packed jail cells.\n\nThe Republican tradition of gleefully bombing people has resurfaced with Trump’s decision to inject the nation into the conflict between Iran and Israel. Like Bush, Trump is now complaining about the media accurately covering his questionable declarations of success in his bombings.\n\nKilling the economy\n\nTrump inherited an economy from Biden that was on the mend, following years of Trump’s mismanagement during COVID-19. Instead of just taking credit for it, like he did with Obama’s economic recovery in 2017, Trump has gone on the attack.\n\nHe unilaterally imposed tariffs that have already contributed to a fiscal slowdown and sticker shock. Businesses have had their hiring impacted while countries around the world are anticipating the shockwaves of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe last few Republican presidents—Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bush, and Trump—have all presided over economic pullbacks that were cleaned up by Democratic presidents. \n\nTrump and his team, who spent years complaining about prices under Biden, have now said that cost increases are good for the economy, lest they offend Trump.\n\nWar on immigrants\n\nTrump hates immigrants. He launched his initial bid for the presidency based on bald-faced lies about Mexican immigrants being rapists and has pursued a policy of cruelty ever since. In his first term, he separated immigrant families. Now, he’s abducting immigrants and even forcing military occupation on American cities.\n\nThe desire to demonize immigrants or people sympathetic to immigration—a tradition that has been forever intertwined with U.S. history—is evident in all of Trump’s actions. \n\nBut now that the public has seen that Trump and the GOP overstated the threat of “immigrant criminals,” he’s losing ground on what past polls found were his strongest issues.\n\nThe United States is in a bad place, but that didn’t happen overnight. The right plotted and planned for the Trump-powered onslaught, even though he pretended that he was not connected to initiatives like Project 2025.\n\nIf the country recovers, it will take a very long time. Trump has an entire system behind him, from the Republican Party to propaganda machines like X and Fox News.\n\nThey can be defeated, but the fight will have to be sustained.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a tumultuous 6 months with Donald Trump inhabiting the presidency, with a weakened federal government now incapable of addressing monumental problems like climate change, pandemics, education, basic security and safety, and even forecasting the weather.\n\n\n\nAs the United States reaches its 249th year of existence, it’s in a very precarious position.

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.\n\nAfter the sentence about abolishing and replacing the government, O’Donnell delivers a brief commentary.\n\n“Come on, America,” she pleads. “Keep going.”\n\n“Happy Fourth of July. This is a sad day in American history,” she concludes, clearly referring to President Trump’s signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on the White House lawn.

But a new poll reveals what voters believe ultimately cost her the election.\n\nAn exclusive survey conducted by J.L. Partners for DailyMail.com asked over 1,000 voters to describe, in a few words, why they think Harris lost to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe poll, carried out between November 29 and December 1, found the economy dominated responses across the board - citing inflation, rising prices, and financial anxiety as top reasons for Trump's win.\n\nBut among Harris's own supporters, one word came up more than any other: woman.\n\nMany blamed her defeat on sexism, claiming the country still isn't ready to elect a female president, a sentiment that mirrors Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss. \n\nSome Harris voters also pointed to racism, Trump's 'lies,' and even blamed the American electorate itself, calling voters 'stupid'.\n\nOthers noted the challenge Harris faced with limited time. After Biden bowed out of the race in July, Harris had just 107 days to mount a national campaign.\n\nBiden's name also appeared frequently in the responses, suggesting lingering frustrations with the outgoing president weighed on Harris's chances.\n\nWhen it came to Trump voters, their answers were more varied. Some pointed to his experience, policies, and strength on the economy. \n\nWords like 'tired,' 'inflation,' and 'woman' appeared - but far less frequently than among Harris supporters.\n\nMore cutting responses included 'incompetent' and 'idiot,' as some Trump backers took direct aim at Harris's leadership ability and qualifications.","summary":"Kamala Harris was criticized over the somber tone of her post, as well as its thinly veiled dig at former running mate Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14878339/kamala-harris-slammed-fourth-july-post-brutal-swipe-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/19/100039113-0-image-a-29_1751739952537.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 19:04:47","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":338630928,"title":"RFK Jr. Cleans House: New Team to Reevaluate COVID-19 Vaccines, Conflict-of-Interest Rules","text":"Following the dismissal of 17 members from a federal vaccine advisory committee in early June, big changes are on the horizon at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with a federal health policy expert about the impact of those changes. Robert Moffit, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Health and Welfare Policy, discussed the removal of members from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and President Donald Trump’s health policy agenda.\n\nMoffit, editor of the book “Modernizing Medicare,” expects a reevaluation of COVID-19 vaccines, an increase in vaccine testing, and a thorough examination of the conflict-of-interest rules regarding vaccine and medical device approval.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nPhilip Roberts: What is the purpose of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices?\n\nRobert Moffit: To make recommendations for the vaccine schedule for CDC, and for them in turn to make recommendations to states and local public health officials about what vaccines are appropriate and what vaccines are not. That’s what CDC is supposed to do.\n\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did exactly the right thing by firing all the Biden appointees. After all, they represented the policy agenda of the previous administration and, in several instances, they were politically engaged as financial supporters of the Democratic Party. It is profoundly naïve to believe that Biden’s appointees were merely disinterested scientists with no financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the candidate of the Biden-Harris administration, was defeated at the polls. Elections have consequences, and Americans voted for change. It is critically important for the new president and his team to have their own people in place. In the case of the Biden administration, his appointees presided over vaccine policies that were profoundly flawed, especially the illegal and unprecedented COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nKennedy has taken the right course of action by getting rid of the previous administration appointees and putting in his own.\n\nRoberts: Can you explain what happened with the removal of ACIP members?\n\nMoffit: Again, the Biden administration’s policies were repudiated at the polls. In a democratic society, the government is expected to represent the will of the people. It is democratic imperative that the newly elected president, and his appointees, such as Secretary Kennedy, can carry the policy changes that they promised the American people.\n\nSo, Kennedy has put in a new team to pursue a new set of policies, specifically with regard to the COVID-19 vaccine schedule.\n\nFollowing the unhappy experience of the pandemic, the COVID-19 vaccine policies became the central issue. We have had accumulating data on adverse events from these COVID vaccines, especially serious heart inflammation among young men. There must be a more comprehensive evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the COVID vaccines, and that is what Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Marty Makary, the new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promised.\n\nRoberts: Was this removal expected?\n\nMoffit: It should have been. When you change administrations, you’re changing personnel.\n\nAnd as the great Ed Feulner, the former president of The Heritage Foundation, has said, “Personnel is policy.”\n\nIn recommending a vaccine, there must, of course, be rigorous scientific analysis before any recommendation, focused not only on its safety and effectiveness, but also its medical necessity or appropriateness for different cohorts of the population. Moreover, when it comes to the best course of action on behalf of a large and diverse public, there are policy questions. So, yes, a change in policy requires a change in personnel.\n\nAnd speaking of political implications, it is curious that the Biden administration appointed a disproportionate number of the ACIP in 2024, the last year of the Biden administration. As Kennedy pointed out, if he did not act, he would have been prevented from appointing a majority of the members of this advisory committee until 2028.\n\nNo doubt, the Biden team had every intention of locking in their previous agenda, regardless of the outcome of the 2024 election. The appointment of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was never somehow “above” politics.\n\nThe Biden administration’s appointment agenda in 2024, an attempted stacking of the committee, was obviously and narrowly political.\n\nRoberts: How will the removal of these members affect public health recommendations and policies?\n\nMoffit: I think we’re going to see a fresh approach to the COVID vaccine. Beyond that, I’m not so sure.\n\nI don’t think we’re going to see some kind of revolutionary change that would shred the current vaccine schedule. I do think, however, we’re going to see more and more in-depth, random, controlled trials of vaccines and reevaluations of vaccines.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making sure that your previous determinations are correct or checking your assumptions. That is always a good thing.\n\nThere is nothing wrong, in other words, with collecting more and more detailed data based on the most rigorous scientific evaluations.\n\nSecretary Kennedy, when he testified before the Senate at his confirmation, had promised that he was going to rely upon the highest quality of scientific investigation. There’s nothing that I’ve seen so far that indicates he’s deviating from that.\n\nThe big question is, “What should we do with COVID vaccines?” What we’ve seen so far, I think, is a perfectly rational approach based on what we know today.\n\nThere are radical disparities between healthy young people and older Americans, especially those with underlying health conditions, in terms of their vulnerability to the coronavirus virus and their reaction to the vaccines. The radical disparities in the risks of the coronavirus and the benefits of the COVID vaccines must be taken into account. That’s simply common sense.\n\nTo illustrate: Between 2020 and roughly April 2025, there were over 2.2 million Americans whose deaths were attributable by the CDC to the COVID pandemic. Out of that large number, for example, persons aged 18 to 29 suffered 639 deaths, or 0.05% of the total.\n\nAmong those aged 12 to 17, there were just 394 deaths, or 0.03% of all COVID-19 deaths registered by the CDC. The data also showed that mortality among children was heavily concentrated among those who were immunocompromised or otherwise unhealthy.\n\nIn short, among young healthy children, the threat of the coronavirus was very, very low.\n\nA lot of young people would get the virus and didn’t even know they had it, because the virus was often asymptomatic. Maybe they have some sniffles for a short while, perhaps a sore throat, but their recovery was quick and the infection was otherwise uneventful.\n\nAt the age of 65, the data shows that there is a dramatic difference in risk. When you’re looking at people at the age of 65 and older—especially if they have an underlying condition and most people at that age do—the COVID vaccines are not only appropriate, but they are an extremely good idea.\n\nThe risk-benefit calculation is very different for older Americans, and the danger of severe illness, hospitalization and death among the older population is much greater. That’s what the raw data tells us.\n\nRoberts: Why are the new ACIP members significant?\n\nMoffit: My understanding is that they are all people with reputable scientific backgrounds. Not surprisingly, a couple of them are very, very highly critical of the COVID vaccine or its administration in the general population.\n\nThe one that comes to mind is Dr. Robert Malone, who was partially, at least, responsible for the development of the mRNA technology, which is the novel feature of the COVID vaccines.\n\nI don’t expect that we’re going to have any kind of dramatic surprises. I don’t think, in other words, the committee is going to turn into some sort of irresponsible anti-vaccine caucus.\n\nThey’re going to base their recommendations on “evidence-based” medicine and perhaps impose tougher standards for recommendations than previous Committee members did in the past. And that would also be a very good thing also.\n\nWhat will be interesting to see is how the FDA—which gives approval as a regulatory body to these vaccines—works with the new ACIP. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine recently, Dr. Makary of the FDA has already indicated that his team wants to see more random, controlled trials for safety and effectiveness for COVID vaccine boosters for people under the age of 64.\n\nWe shouldn’t stick with the status quo view virtually everybody should be provided the COVID vaccine, and it would be wise to focus its administration on the over-65 population.\n\nThis would also bring our public health vaccine recommendations more in line with our friends and allies in Europe.\n\nThere’s another issue, though, that the new ACIP will likely address. We have so many vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule. It’s a huge number: about 25 injections for children before they reach 2 years of age. Are they all medically necessary and appropriate? I hope the new committee members address that number, as well as reexamine the appropriate spacing of vaccine administration to safeguard children’s health.\n\nKennedy raised another issue that must also be more extensively explored—this whole problem of financial conflicts-of-interest between people who are participating in the approval of medical devices, vaccines and medications, and their financial interest in those approvals.\n\nThis is an old problem, and it relates both to the FDA as well as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nBack in June 2000, the Committee on Government Reform issued a staff report on the CDC advisory committees.\n\nAccording to one key committee finding: “The CDC routinely grants waivers from conflict-of-interest rules to every member of its advisory committee. … Members of the CDC’s advisory committee often fill out incomplete financial disclosure statements and are not required to provide the missing information by CDC ethics officials.”\n\nSecretary Kennedy is absolutely correct to launch a very intense review of the current conflict-of-interest rules governing the approval of vaccines and other medical devices. \n\nIn protecting the public from conflicts-of-interest in a profoundly sensitive area of their personal health and well-being, he’s pursuing the right policy.","summary":"Following the dismissal of 17 members from a federal vaccine advisory committee in early June, big changes are on the horizon at the Centers for...

Partners poll. \n\nIt is the same figure recorded on June 6 - before Israel launched its initial strikes - and again on June 18, just days before the U.S. entered the conflict. His disapproval rating also held steady at 53 percent.\n\nHowever, roughly a third of voters said their opinion of Trump had soured in recent weeks, with many citing fears of a broader conflict with Iran, concerns over his 'dictatorial behavior' for bypassing Congress, or frustration over what they saw as ego-driven decisions.\n\nAnother 30 percent said their view of the president had improved - crediting him for showing strength, keeping his promises, and taking swift action to defend U.S. interests abroad.\n\nThe poll, conducted June 24–25 among 1,025 registered voters, came just after Trump helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following a barrage of intercepted Iranian missiles. It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate shock poll shows most voters are turning against Trump’s so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill' - his massive tax-and-spending package that now heads to his desk after clearing both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe sprawling Republican-led bill promises $1,000 ‘Trump Accounts’ for newborns, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, injects billions into the border wall, and bans states from regulating AI for the next decade. It also imposes new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nWhile Trump and GOP leaders have hailed it as 'the largest tax cut in history,' most voters remain unconvinced.\n\nJust 28 percent support the bill, while 36 percent oppose it, according to a new Daily Mail/J.L. Partners poll - giving it a negative net rating of -8. Support plummets outside of Trump’s base: Republicans back it by +36, but independents oppose it by -14 and Democrats by a staggering -41.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt by 2034 while slashing taxes by $3.75 trillion.\n\nEven some Republicans are uneasy. Sen. Ron Johnson threatened to block it over deficit fears, while Sen. Josh Hawley objected to Medicaid cuts.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll also found that 47 percent of Americans believe the bill will hurt the middle class - further signaling trouble for Trump’s economic agenda ahead of November.","summary":"President Trump is facing growing backlash from a surprising demographic, with a new poll showing his approval has plunged to one of its lowest points yet.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14878095/trump-approval-rating-savaged-key-group-poll.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/17/99204931-0-Trump_has_told_lawmakers_that_he_wants_the_Senate_to_pass_the_bi-a-11_1751731303827.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 16:56:29","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":338593506,"title":"Kamala Harris Skewered On Social Media Over Somber July 4 Post With Photo That Crops Out Joe Biden","text":"Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers.

His 2024 gains with young voters are slipping fast, signaling a sharp shift in youth political sentiment.\n\nDonald Trump's Approval Rating Crashes With Gen Z Amid Growing Discontent- President Donald Trump is facing a major drop in support from one of the most influential and fastest-growing voter blocs—Generation Z. According to multiple new polls, Trump’s approval rating among young Americans has taken a serious hit in June, marking a steep decline from the inroads he made with them during the 2024 election. In the latest YouGov/Yahoo News poll conducted from June 26 to June 30 with 1,597 adults, Trump’s net approval rating among Gen Z voters fell sharply—from -23 points in May to -41 points in June. His overall approval rating in this group now stands at just 27%, with a margin of error of ±3.2%. Why is Donald Trump losing support among Gen Z voters? Experts believe the drop reflects more than party politics. Lucas Walsh, a political behavior professor at Monash University, explained to Newsweek that Gen Z voters are more focused on specific issues than party loyalty. He said, “These younger voters often care less about red and blue party lines and more about issues, particularly progressive ones, and issues affecting the bottom line of their day-to-day lives.” In the 2024 presidential election, Trump surprised many by narrowing the usual Democratic lead among 18–29-year-olds. According to AP VoteCast, this group supported Kamala Harris over Trump by a slim 51% to 47%, a far smaller gap than in 2020, when Joe Biden beat Trump among Gen Z voters 61% to 36%. What do the latest Trump approval polls show? Recent surveys confirm a broader decline in Trump’s approval among Gen Z. In a Quantus Insights poll conducted between June 30 and July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, only 35% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58% disapproved. Just a month earlier, Trump held a 46% approval and 51% disapproval rating with this group.Live Events Another study by ActiVote, conducted between June 1 and June 30 with 523 adults, found similar results. In June, just 32% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s performance, while 62% disapproved—a major shift from May, when support and disapproval were nearly even at 47% vs 48%. Is Gen Z losing faith in Trump's economic and inflation policies? The decline isn’t limited to general approval—it runs deep into key issues like the economy and inflation. At the start of June, 33% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, compared to 54% disapproval. By the end of the month, approval had dropped to 32%, and disapproval rose to 60%. On inflation, a top concern for young people, the numbers were even more alarming. Trump’s approval in this area fell from 32% approve / 57% disapprove in early June to just 23% approve / 69% disapprove by month’s end. How has Trump’s immigration stance impacted Gen Z approval? Immigration, another key issue where Trump has maintained a strong public stance, also appears to be costing him Gen Z support. In early June, he had 40% approval and 52% disapproval among younger voters on immigration. By the end of the month, that dropped to 30% approval and 65% disapproval—a 15-point swing. This downward shift reflects increasing discomfort among young voters with Trump’s approach on divisive topics, as many in Gen Z lean more toward inclusive and humanitarian perspectives on immigration policy. Is dissatisfaction with Trump translating into democratic gains? Interestingly, the growing frustration with President Trump does not seem to be benefiting Democrats significantly. The Quantus poll found that 43% of Gen Z voters feel neither party represents American values—a sign that many young Americans feel politically alienated, not just from Trump, but from the entire political system. Meanwhile, the broader mood among Gen Z is shifting toward pessimism. According to YouGov/Yahoo, only 21% of Gen Z voters now believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction, down from 27% in May. Those who feel the country is on the wrong track jumped from 53% to 66% within a month. What does this mean for Trump heading into 2025? President Trump’s sharp drop in support among Gen Z voters could pose a serious challenge for his administration and reelection strategy. Although he gained ground in the 2024 election with younger voters, recent data suggests that those gains are quickly fading. Whether it’s the economy, inflation, immigration, or his post-election policy shifts, young voters appear increasingly disillusioned with Trump’s leadership. As Lucas Walsh pointed out, “Economic hardship and uncertainty typically affect younger people disproportionately during downturns,” making Gen Z especially sensitive to issues like job security, rent, student loans, and affordability—issues where many feel Trump is falling short. For now, Trump’s approval rating among Gen Z is in free fall. Unless major changes occur, this could have long-term implications for both his presidency and the Republican Party’s ability to engage with future generations.FAQs: Q1: Why is Donald Trump’s Gen Z approval rating falling? Because Gen Z is frustrated with his handling of issues like inflation, the economy, and immigration. Q2: Did Donald Trump gain Gen Z support in the 2024 election?

And the reason cuts deep: immigration raids.\n\nRogan, who endorsed Trump just hours before the 2024 presidential election, now says he was misled by the man he helped boost into office. The podcaster and UFC commentator, known for giving a platform to anti-cancel culture figures and free speech advocates, is now accusing Trump of betraying the very values he campaigned on.\n\n“We were told there would be…,” Rogan began during a July 2 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, before trailing off and recalibrating. “There’s two things that are insane. One is the targeting of migrant workers, not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers, just construction workers showing up at construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?”\n\nHis guest, Amjad Masad, the Palestinian founder and CEO of the coding platform Replit, agreed. The two were discussing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants, especially in the context of escalating tensions over Gaza and political speech on U.S. campuses.\n\nMasad brought up recent reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeting Palestinian students and immigrants on flimsy pretenses. “Did you see the video of the Turkish student at Tufts University who wrote an essay?” he asked.\n\nRogan responded, incredulous: “It was just critical of Israel, right? And that’s enough to get you kicked out of the country?”\n\nThe two were referencing growing concern that lawful political speech, especially criticism of Israel, is increasingly being used as grounds for visa cancellations and deportations under Trump’s revived immigration policy.\n\nRogan’s Endorsement and Regret\n\nBack on November 4, 2024, Rogan endorsed Trump on social media, just before the election. It was a powerful signal to his massive base of male followers.\n\n“The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn’t for him we’d be fucked,” Rogan wrote at the time. “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way. For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.”\n\nThe post racked up more than 50 million views. But less than a year later, Rogan seems to be reconsidering.\n\n The great and powerful @elonmusk.If it wasn't for him we'd be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.Enjoy the podcast pic.twitter.com/LdBxZFVsLN — Joe Rogan (@joerogan) November 5, 2024\n\nWhile he made clear he would never vote for Kamala Harris, Rogan now feels duped. The immigration policy he thought would focus on violent criminals has instead become a broader crackdown on immigrant communities, including legal residents, students, and workers.\n\nFrom America First to Raids and Fear\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, but insisted the focus would be on criminals and gang members. His rallies featured mugshots of alleged MS-13 members and claims that his plan would “clean up the streets.”\n\nBut now that he’s back in the White House, reality looks different. According to recent court filings and ICE data, many of the people being arrested or deported have no criminal records at all.\n\nThat discrepancy is what’s pushing Rogan to speak out. He’s built his brand around authenticity and free speech. Trump’s current approach, he suggests, smells more like authoritarianism than policy.\n\n“Fascism is the response almost always to communism,” Rogan said on the same podcast, quoting ANthony Rispo, a student of psychology and neuroscience at Columbia University. “What we experience in this country is this continual overcorrection. Overcorrection to the left, then overcorrection to the right, to counter that.”\n\nIn other words, Rogan is wondering if Trump’s policies are an overcorrection too far, and if they resemble fascism more than freedom.\n\n Thanks @joerogan for shouting me out on @joeroganhq !! pic.twitter.com/gTV7MRgRWq — Anthony Rispo (@anthony_rispo) July 3, 2025\n\nMusk, DOGE, and the Fracture of the Bro Alliance\n\nRogan’s disillusionment mirrors that of Elon Musk, another former Trump ally. Musk, who headed the now-infamous Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has become one of Trump’s fiercest critics since Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a legislation that slashed EV subsidies, immigration protections, and environmental incentives.\n\nMusk is now threatening to start a third political party. And while Trump can afford to ignore the Tesla CEO’s rebellion, he can’t easily brush off Joe Rogan. Why? Because they share the same audience: disaffected men, anti-establishment voters, young libertarians, and people tired of traditional politics.\n\nIf that group is forced to choose between Trump and Rogan, the outcome could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections and future political landscapes.","summary":"The podcast king, once a prominent supporter of Donald Trump, denounced the president’s aggressive deportation tactics on his wildly popular podcast.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogan-feels-trump-betrayed-him-on-immigration-2000624426","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Joe-Rogan-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 13:45:09","author":"Luc Olinga","authors":["Luc Olinga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.177},{"id":338561844,"title":"Trump rides major wave of momentum going into July Fourth after Iran, BBB, Supreme Court and lawsuit victories","text":"President Donald Trump is riding a major wave of momentum after he signed his $3.3 trillion \"big, beautiful bill\" Friday – a final notch in a series of wins for his administration in recent weeks. The bill’s passage comes on the heels of other significant victories for his administration, including a Supreme Court ruling in his favor and successful strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. \"President Trump has delivered more wins for the American people in two weeks than most Presidents do in four years,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Thursday statement to Fox News Digital. \"This has been the most historic two weeks of any Administration in history. Thanks to President Trump, America is back and is the hottest country in the world!\" The tax and domestic policy bill arrived on his desk after the House passed the final version of the measure Thursday – meeting Trump’s self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to get the measure over the finish line. The bill includes key provisions that would permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay. The measure also raises the debt limit by $5 trillion – a provision that has faced scrutiny from figures such as SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Furthermore, the bill rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, and allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump’s mass deportation initiative to weed out illegal immigrants from the U.S. The measure also institutes Medicaid reforms, including new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for Medicaid recipients, and expands work requirements for those on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Here are some other recent events that have gone in the Trump administration’s favor: US strikes on Iran The U.S. launched strikes June 21 targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities, which involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Following the strikes, Trump said in an address to the nation that the mission left the nuclear sites \"completely and totally obliterated,\" and Caine said that initial battle damage assessments suggested \"all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\" Still, Caine acknowledged that a final assessment would \"take some time.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKES ON NEW BATTLE SHUTTING DOWN INITIAL IRAN STRIKE ASSESSMENTS But days later, a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency, published by CNN and the New York Times, cast doubt on those claims, saying that the strikes had only set back Iran’s nuclear program by several months. However, the Pentagon said Wednesday that internal intelligence assessments indicate the strikes set back Iran’s nuclear program by one or two years. \"We have degraded their program by one to two years, at least intel assessments inside the Department (of Defense) assess that,\" Defense Department spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters Wednesday. Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions The Supreme Court ruled, 6–3, to block the lower courts from issuing universal injunctions on June 27. Multiple executive orders Trump has signed during his second administration have been tied up in the courts as a result of nationwide injunctions, including his ban on birthright citizenship. TRUMP CELEBRATES SUPREME COURT LIMITS ON ‘COLOSSAL ABUSE OF POWER’ BY FEDERAL JUDGES The Supreme Court’s ruling means that lower courts are only permitted to issue broad injunctions in limited cases, which Trump said would prevent a \"colossal abuse of power.\" \"I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we've seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers,\" Trump said on June 27. Paramount Global agrees to settlement CBS News’ parent company, Paramount Global, Tuesday agreed to a $16 million settlement with Trump, stemming from a lawsuit Trump filed against CBS in October 2024 related to a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his opponent in the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS BLASTS TRUMP’S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER In the lawsuit, Trump alleged that CBS deceptively edited the interview with Harris when asked about why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. While the segment aired one answer from Harris during a primetime special on the network, a less polished answer had previously appeared in a preview clip of the interview. The money from the settlement will not go to Trump himself, but rather, toward his future presidential library and to cover the plaintiffs' fees and costs. CBS said it worked with a mediator to reach the settlement agreement and that Paramount will not issue an apology.","summary":"The &quot;big, beautiful&quot; bill’s passage comes on the heels of other significant victories for his administration, including a Supreme Court ruling in his favor and successful strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rides-major-wave-momentum-going-july-fourth-after-iran-bbb-supreme-court-lawsuit-victories","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/capitol-trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 13:00:08","author":"Diana Stancy","authors":["Diana Stancy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.008},{"id":338544184,"title":"BROADCAST BIAS: Media elites put their profession over patriotism","text":"When I was a member of the White House press corps, it was easily observable that reporters felt they could not say the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" with other Americans at the White House. That, somehow, compromised their neutrality. This inaction suggested that American reporters shouldn’t show appreciation for their country enshrining freedom of the press. That’s a lack of gratitude, not just a lack of patriotism. For the broadcast media, the feeling that they weren’t rooting for America was first underlined in their opposition to the Vietnam War. This was crystallized with CBS anchor Walter Cronkite declaring from Saigon in 1968 that America was going to lose, \"that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors.\" Cronkite had been over-praised as the essence of objectivity, but politicians feared his persuasive power. Media power to sway the country was more satisfying than patriotism. Journalism is poised against patriotism. Journalists disdain patriotism as \"my country right or wrong,\" and they always want to be right. They associate patriotism with warmongers pushing for endless wars. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES In March 1989, the media’s controversial ingratitude toward America was spotlighted by a PBS show called \"Ethics In America.\" Professor Charles Ogletree created a scenario where America was fighting a fictional country called North Kosan. The enemy was going to assault American troops. He asked: does a reporter have a \"higher duty as an American citizen\" to warn the troops? Without hesitation, CBS journalist Mike Wallace said no. \"No, you don't have higher duty ... you're a reporter.\" ABC anchor Peter Jennings first said he would notify them, then changed his mind: \"I think he's right too. I chickened out.\" In an April 1990 primetime special, Jennings clearly signaled America was not a benign force in the world. \"The United States is deeply involved in Cambodia again. Cambodia is on the edge of hell again.\" September 11, 2001, may have united the country for a few weeks, but not on ABC. Six days after thousands of Americans died, ABC \"Politically Incorrect\" host Bill Maher argued that the terrorists who drove planes into buildings were more courageous than American pilots: \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away, that’s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, not cowardly.\" EX-ABC JOURNALIST FIRED FOR CALLING TRUMP A 'WORLD-CLASS HATER' SAYS IT'S NOT A REPORTER'S JOB TO BE OBJECTIVE Two weeks later, \"CBS Evening News\" producer Dick Meyer wrote a commentary on CBSNews.com on the discomfort with the American flag. \"Our 10-year-old daughter asked her mother if we could put a flag on our car. My wife reluctantly agreed, but hasn’t procured the flag yet. ... My wife essentially shares our daughter’s feelings. But for her, the symbol of the flag was appropriated in her youth by counter-protesters who used it to deny the patriotism of the war’s opponents. Flag-waving feels aggressive to her.\" Burning the flag isn’t aggressive. Waving it is. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Flag pins were still offending PBS host Bill Moyers, who uncorked a pompous commentary on his program \"Now\" on the taxpayer-funded network. The flag’s been hijacked and turned into a logo – the trademark of a monopoly on patriotism. ... When I see flags sprouting on official lapels, I think of the time in China when I saw Mao’s Little Red Book on every official’s desk, omnipresent and unread.\" Four years later, Moyers was still at it on his PBS show, now called \"Moyers & Company.\" This time, he ripped the pledge: \"The next time you say the ‘Pledge of Allegiance.’ ... Remember, it's a lie, a whopper of a lie. We coax it from the mouths of babes for the same reason our politicians wear their flag pins on their lapels. It makes the hypocrisy go down easier.\" BROADCAST BIAS: MEDIA COVERAGE OF NPR LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP HIDES WHAT PUBLIC MEDIA REALLY IS Also in 2007, the ABC News program \"The View\" featured Rosie O’Donnell suggesting we were the terrorists: \"I just want to say something: 655,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. Who are the terrorists?...If you were in Iraq, and the other country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The View\" was still at this in 2021, when Olympian athlete Gwen Berry turned away and covered her head while they played the national anthem at the delayed Olympic trials. Whoopi Goldberg came to her defense: \"In the upcoming days, we’ll play you the American anthem and let you see what you think of it. Because there’s some stuff in there that makes it a little bit tough to take.\" America is a free country, and journalists are free to denigrate it. Journalists are free to assert that their precious profession places them above putrid pledges of allegiance.

Any day Joe Biden is appearing on the public stage, reminding Americans of his failures, is a good day for the White House.”\n\nA spokesperson for Biden’s office did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nThis isn’t the first time Biden has spoken about Trump since leaving the White House. The Washington Examiner lists seven times the former president rebuked Trump or made rare remarks about his administration.\n\n1. Biden’s first post-White House interview with the BBC\n\nIn early May, the BBC released its exclusive interview with Biden after his presidency, in which he criticized Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine to give up part of its territory to Russia.\n\n“It is modern-day appeasement,” Biden said as he criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I just don’t understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he’s going to take significant portions of land that aren’t his, and that’s going to satisfy him. I don’t quite understand.”\n\nBiden did not appear impressed with Trump’s efforts to redefine the White House in his first 100 days. “I don’t see anything that’s triumphant,” Biden said. \n\n2. Biden goes on The View \n\nThe same week as the BBC interview, Biden conducted his first live interview with an American outlet since leaving the White House with the hosts of The View.\n\nBiden largely defended his presidency from unrelenting criticisms that he and his allies had covered up his mental decline while serving as president. \n\nBiden, again, took another shot at Trump’s first 100 days in office. “He’s had the worst 100 days any president ever had,” Biden said about his successor.\n\nAlthough Biden claimed he could have defeated Trump if he had not suspended his 2024 campaign, the former president conceded that he bears responsibility for Trump’s win. “I was in charge, and he won. So, you know, I take responsibility,” he said.\n\nWhen Joy Behar, an anti-Trump critic and co-host on The View, asked Biden why Trump has repeatedly blamed him for problems the U.S. faces, Biden responded, “I beat him.”\n\n3. After cancer diagnosis, Biden stays hopeful \n\nAfter Biden’s shocking announcement that he had an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones, he attended his grandson, Robert Hunter Biden II’s, high school graduation in Salisbury, Connecticut.\n\nThe former president told travelers at the Bradley International Airport in Connecticut that he was “feeling great” and “doing fine” ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. \n\nThe cancer revelation prompted Trump and Congress to launch multiple investigations into Biden aides over his use of the autopen to conduct presidential actions. \n\n4. Biden defends record while in Delaware \n\nIn late May, Biden defended his decision to seek reelection and his mental acuity amid the rising swell of concern after the cancer diagnosis. \n\n“You can see that I’m mentally incompetent and I can’t walk, and I can beat the hell out of both of them!” Biden cheekily told reporters following the publication of a new book from journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleging a White House cover-up of his health.\n\nBiden claimed he would “beat” prostate cancer.\n\n“The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this. It’s not in any organ. My bones are strong. So feeling good,” Biden said while speaking at a Memorial Day service in New Castle, Delaware. \n\n5. Biden takes aim at Trump during Juneteenth \n\nDuring an event commemorating Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery that Biden signed into law in 2021, in Galveston, Texas, Biden attacked Trump’s efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\n“I played a role in changing the names of all the military camps that have slave names,” Biden said. “What are we doing now? Restating those names. Folks, the darkness can hide much but erase nothing.” \n\nTrump didn’t hold a Juneteenth celebration or sign a proclamation to mark the holiday. \n\n6. Biden attends the funeral of a slain Minnesota lawmaker \n\nIn late June, Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined mourners at the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed by a man posing as a police officer. Law enforcement called their June 14 deaths an assassination. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also wounded by the attacker.\n\n“Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history. I get to remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I have ever known,” said Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s former running mate, during his eulogy. \n\nNeither Biden nor Harris spoke, but both were seated with Walz.\n\nDays before the funeral, the former president also joined mourners as Hortman, her husband, and her dog lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda.\n\nNeither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance attended the funerals. \n\n7. Biden takes shot at ‘big, beautiful bill’\n\nAt Wednesday’s Society for Human Resource Management convention, Biden lamented Trump’s efforts to reverse the gains from Biden’s tenure.\n\n“Many of the things I worked so damn hard, that I thought I changed in the country, are changing so rapidly,” Biden said in a keynote speech. \n\nThe former president did not mention Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which passed through the House after gaining approval in the Senate. The legislation would reverse the Medicaid expansions enacted during Biden’s term.\n\nBut as soon as it passed the House on Thursday, Biden’s X account posted a statement calling the bill “reckless” and “cruel.”\n\nTrump signed the legislation into law on Friday, coinciding with the Fourth of July deadline lawmakers had set.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden is slowly stepping back into the spotlight since his White House exit in January to defend his legacy in the face of GOP investigations.

Still, the president's approval rating in June is low, at 27 percent. The margin of error is at plus or minus 3.2 percent.Lucas Walsh, a youth political behavior expert and professor at Monash University, told Newsweek that Trump's falling support among Gen Z voters may reflect how young people \"respond to issues rather than party allegiances.\"Why It MattersIn the 2024 election, Trump made surprising inroads with young voters, narrowing the Democrats' traditional lead among Gen Z—a group that has typically leaned left in recent cycles. According to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent. By comparison, in 2020, Joe Biden carried the same age group by a much wider margin, winning 61 percent to Trump's 36 percent.What To KnowOther polls also show a clear deterioration in support for Trump among the youngest voters, reinforcing signs that his modest gains with Gen Z in 2024 may be slipping away just months later. The latest Quantus Insights poll, conducted between June 30 and July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, found that just 35 percent of Gen Z voters now approve of Trump's job performance, while 58 percent disapprove—a sharp drop compared to the previous month. In June, the same poll showed him with 46 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval among young voters.The latest ActiVote poll, conducted between June 1 and June 30 among 523 adults, shows a similar trend. In June, 32 percent of Gen Z respondents approved of Trump's performance, compared to 62 percent who disapproved—a dramatic slide from May, when approval and disapproval were nearly evenly split at 47 percent and 48 percent, respectively. These numbers suggest that whatever modest inroads Trump made with younger voters in 2024 may be eroding as Gen Z voters grow frustrated with his agenda and messaging.The broader mood among young voters appears to be souring, too. The YouGov/Yahoo data reveals that Gen Z is becoming more pessimistic about the country's direction overall. In May, 27 percent of Gen Z voters said the U.S. was headed in the right direction, while 53 percent said it was on the wrong track. By June, that optimism had dropped sharply: only 21 percent said the country was headed in the right direction, compared to 66 percent who believed it was off course.This discontent does not appear to be translating into strong support for Democrats. The Quantus poll suggests that young voters are feeling politically homeless, with 43 percent of Gen Z voters saying that neither party represents American values.A YouGov/Economist poll from last week suggests discontent with Trump among young people may be tied to his performance on key issues such as the economy and immigration.Among Gen Z voters overall, Trump's approval fell from 34 percent approve / 58 percent disapprove at the start of June to 28 percent approve / 66 percent disapprove by the end of the month.On the economy, the decline was more modest but still negative: approval slipped from 33 percent approve / 54 percent disapprove in early June to 32 percent approve / 60 percent disapprove by month's end. The numbers were even starker on inflation—a top issue for young voters—with Trump's approval dropping from 32 percent approve / 57 percent disapprove at the start of June to just 23 percent approve / 69 percent disapprove by the end of the month.On immigration, another issue where Trump's messaging has been central, Gen Z voters' support also eroded. His net rating went from 40 percent approve / 52 percent disapprove at the beginning of June to 30 percent approve / 65 percent disapprove by the end of the month.Walsh said that while many young voters backed Trump in 2024, his \"dizzying array of announcements across contentious issues\" since then could be pushing them away.

Gavin Newsom (12%).\n\nNow, these numbers should be viewed through the context of how difficult it can be for voters to decide who they will support when primaries begin in two and a half years.\n\nHowever, polls are an effective way to take a snapshot of the electorate’s mood at a given time, and the data from Emerson has three overarching takeaways.\n\nFirst, the race for the 2028 Democratic nomination is wide open. \n\nDespite their deep bench of household names, no Democrat has managed to separate themselves from the pack. \n\nButtigieg’s 3-point lead is well within the survey’s 5-point margin of error, and a plurality (23%) of respondents said they were undecided. \n\nIt is also worth noting that Buttigieg received zero votes from Black voters – the backbone of the Democratic Party – in the Emerson poll.\n\nThe second takeaway is that, with Rep. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7%) tied for 4th place, the poll indicates a desire for fresh faces – which Harris is not. \n\nIt also reflects the rising influence of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, joining the surprise victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s Democratic primary and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ relatively successful presidential campaigns. \n\nThe growing power of this wing opens up avenues for a number of younger Democrats which further muddy the waters and make it hard for any one candidate to cement themselves as the party’s standard bearer before 2028.\n\nFinally, the third main takeaway is what this poll says about Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and their diverging political fortunes. \n\nGiven Harris’ name recognition, experience, and how close she came to winning in 2024, one may have expected her to be leading early polling, which usually reflect name recognition more than anything else.\n\nSimilarly, Newsom’s recent moves to the center on key issues and his hosting of right-wing influencers on his podcast had been considered harmful to his position in a primary. \n\nAnd yet, Newsom is virtually tied with Harris in the Emerson poll, while at the same time, seeing an improvement in his overall numbers in California. \n\nIn early June, UC Irvine polling showed that less than 4-in-10 (36%) of California voters approved of the job Newsom is doing as governor. \n\nWhen UC Irvine released a follow up poll on July 2, it showed Newsom with a 56% favorability rating. While not an exact comparison, it does show that whatever doubts about his job performance, he remains personally favorable.\n\nConversely, for Harris, recent weeks have seen the release of multiple reports detailing her “enthusiasm problem.”\n\nAs one Politico report noted, “many Democratic donors aren’t enthusiastic” about Harris’ potential return to the political arena. \n\nOne major donor told the outlet that, “they fear her reemergence as a candidate would re-open still-fresh wounds from her defeat in 2024.” \n\nAnother pointed out that “Kamala just reminds you we are in this complete (expletive) storm” referring to Harris’ coverup of former President Biden’s cognitive decline while in office. \n\nIn that same vein, Harris’ 2024 campaign was largely run on opposition to Trump, rather than her own platform. She articulated few of her own ideas for the economy, immigration, or foreign policy, so its understandable if voters are still wondering what she stands for or what policies she would pursue.\n\nTaken together, Harris’ worse than expected polling and waning enthusiasm for her to run again for president may actually propel her to seek another office – California governor. \n\nTo be sure, that possibility has been well-discussed, but Harris’ refusal to either declare or refute her potential candidacy has been speculated to be about keeping her options open for another shot at the White House. \n\nWere Harris to run for governor, its widely assumed that she would have a sizable advantage, with virtually all polls suggesting that she would likely win.\n\nThat being said, the same issues that she has in national polling are showing up in state polling, albeit less clearly.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned UC Irvine poll, in a binary choice for governor between Harris and an unnamed Republican, just 41% of California voters chose Harris, compared to 29% backing the Republican. \n\nThree-in-10 California voters said they were unsure (16%) or would not vote (14%).\n\nIf Harris decides that Sacramento is the better option than seeking the Oval Office, Newsom likely stands to benefit the most of all candidates Emerson tested. \n\nButtigieg is popular, although his national profile is considerably smaller than Newsom’s, as is his fundraising ability, something Newsom has proven himself quite adept at. \n\nFurther down the field of candidates, Ocasio-Cortez is widely regarded to be too far to the political left to be a viable presidential candidate. \n\nAnd while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro – tied with AOC at 7% – is a popular governor of a swing state, his appeal to an increasingly far-left primary base may hurt him, as it did when Harris skipped over nominating him as her running mate last year.\n\nUltimately, between now and 2028, these polls are all but guaranteed to see considerable movement, especially if Harris effectively takes herself out of the race by running for governor. \n\nMoreover, it is entirely possible that someone not included in this poll emerges, much in the same way former President Obama did in 2007-2008.\n\nNonetheless, at this point, the data is telling. Harris is significantly more vulnerable than a former VP should be, while Newsom may be stronger than appeared.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Kamala Harris is significantly more vulnerable than a former VP should be, while Gavin Newsom may be stronger than appeared.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/05/harris-and-newsom-diverge-as-polling-shows-democrats-race-is-wide-open/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sut-z-oe-benefits-3.jpg?w=1024&h=805","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 07:20:09","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":338465326,"title":"Another remarkable week for Keir Starmer and the BBC - Vladimir McTavish","text":"He may have managed to get enough of his rebel MPs under control to stave off a full-scale revolt to the Welfare Reform Bill, but it did look like an embarrassing climb down. It was a bit like a Premier League side getting a stoppage time winner against non-league opponents in the FA Cup. OK, he may have won, but he wore the red face of a loser. His second remarkable achievement was to accidentally elicit an emotional response from Rachel Reeves. The Chancellor’s demeanour usually borders between cold and robotic, but on Wednesday she was seen to shed tears on television. When Kemi Badenoch asked Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions whether Reeves would still be in her job by the next election, the PM fudged his answer and Iron Rachel could be seen weeping behind him. Starmer’s response was that Kemi herself would not be in her job by the next election, which could explain the Chancellor’s tears. The prospect of Badenoch not be around is truly horrifying to the Cabinet. Imagine if the Tories replaced her with someone who knows what they were talking about? A colleague later explained that Reeves was crying due to “a personal matter”. Doubtless true. Matters don’t come much more personal than your boss refusing to commit to not sacking you. All this farce could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had spent last week talking to his own MPs rather than sticking his nose in where it didn’t belong, with his comments on the Glastonbury line-up and the BBC’s scheduling of live broadcasts. The media has been awash with faux outrage all week since some rather inappropriate remarks were made by rap duo Bob Vylan, which were recorded live on TV. They encouraged the crowd to join in their chant of “Death, death to the IDF”. Yeah, like a bunch of pilled-up clubbers dancing in a field pose any threat to the Israeli military. Let’s get a level of perspective here. At the same time as a few thousand hipsters were jumping around in a mosh pit in Somerset, the actual IVF were launching a missile attack on a seafront cafe in Gaza, killing 20 Palestinians. Now, that’s genuinely outrageous. The public really couldn’t care less about rock stars’ opinions. You only have to look at last year’s US election, where Kamala Harris won the showbiz vote hands-down. Bruce Springsteen campaigned hard in support of the Democrats but millions of his fans voted for Trump. And when Rod Stewart says “I think we should give Nigel Farage a chance”, the most common reaction is “Oh no, the silly old git is p***ed again”. Starmer was quick to condemn Bob Vylan’s behaviour, but perhaps the best way to stop musicians from making these inflammatory comments would be to stop selling arms to Israel. Back to Glastonbury. Next up on stage after Bob Vylan were Kneecap, who led the crowd in a chant of “F**k Keir Starmer”. Which, judging by Tuesday’s vote, went down very well with a lot of backbench Labour MPs.","summary":"For a distinctly unremarkable man Keir Starmer has had quite a remarkable week.

She’s trying to sound like she’s 26 years old, and it’s inappropriate. It feels weird. She’s one of our biggest stars, that’s true. Act like it … Have some class.”\n\nTheron, who is currently promoting the upcoming Netflix film The Old Guard 2, told Cooper during their conversation: “I did just recently f**k a 26-year-old, and it was really amazing … I’ve never done that. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is great.’ Women should be the ones that are like, ‘F**k you, I’m going to have an orgasm.’”\n\nShe also encouraged women to be more vocal about their desires.\n\n“Women who come across as confident, women who come across as outspoken, ones that wouldn’t speak up for themselves tend to also be, in bed, people who want to please males,” she said.\n\nKelly also criticised the actress’ use of profanity on Call Her Daddy, saying: “I love a good F-bomb … But every sentence? An F-bomb? ‘F in this, F in that, F in God,’ what is that? This is like an affectation where she’s trying to act like, again, young, cool girl, ‘I get it, and I don’t need a man.’”\n\nTheron, a single mother, also spoke on the podcast about the freedom she feels raising her two adopted daughters — Jackson and August — without a male partner.\n\nKelly also decided to take issue with this, seemingly looking to attack everything about the actress.\n\n“She’s got two children. They don’t need a father? She’s super proud of the fact that there’s no father in the picture? Great.

On Thursday, she announced that she would no longer run the day-to-day editing of the fashion bible.\n\nBut this does not mean retirement for the 75-year-old British style mogul.\n\nConde Nast, the magazine group owner, confirmed she would continue to hold senior roles at the group and remain Vogue's global editorial director.\n\nWintour has not only influenced how people dress in the US, she has also had a hand in shaping fashion globally, including in Africa and India.\n\nOf course, her ongoing legacy is not without criticism.\n\nIs Wintour really 'the devil' wearing Prada?\n\nSpeculation abounds as to whether the heartless antagonist in the 2006 film, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" — and the book of the same name written by Wintour assistant, Lauren Weisberger — was directly inspired by the Vogue editor-in-chief.\n\nIn the movie, a ruthless fashion boss, played by Meryl Streep, terrorizes her employees.\n\nWhile Wintour herself has labeled the book and the movie \"fiction,\" a 2022 biography by Amy Odell confirms that the fashionista had an assistant responsible for making sure her daily breakfast of extra-hot grande Starbucks latte and blueberry muffin was waiting on her desk.\n\nWhatever the veracity of the claim that Wintour was more than just a loose inspiration for the hit film, the character did reflect the Vogue chief's ability to reign over the fashion world.\n\nNearly 40 years as Vogue boss\n\nWintour was born into a well-off family in London in 1949. Her father, an editor of the London Evening Standard daily newspaper, helped her land her first job at Harpers & Queen magazine as a fashion assistant at the age of 20.\n\nShe eventually moved to New York and continued to climb the editorial ladder at a number of publications.\n\nIn 1988, she was offered the position at US Vogue. When Wintour took the helm of the famous fashion magazine, its advertising revenue was threatened by a new women's lifestyle magazine, Elle.\n\nYet thanks to Wintour, Vogue carved its own niche and came out on top.\n\nThe publication moved away from only featuring models on the cover. Prominent women in politics and Hollywood such as Angelina Jolie and Hillary Clinton soon had star billing.\n\nVogue covers have since featured men like Timothee Chalamet and even prominent activists such as transgender LGTBQ+ rights activist Ariel Nicholson. \n\nAnd who can forget about Kamala Harris' Vogue cover controversy? In January 2021, the portrait of the then-US vice president elect was criticized for featuring her casually dressed, claiming it diminished her achievements. Wintour was forced to defend the image, and a second, more formal, cover shot was also produced for the digital version of the magazine.\n\nWintour helped the magazine's parent company, Conde Nast, launch a number of spinoff magazines, including Teen Vogue which hit shelves in 1993.\n\nShe also made a name for the magazine by associating it with a number of high-end philanthropic events in Manhattan, most notably the Met Gala, which she helped transform into a star-studded celebrity event known as the East Coast's answer to the Oscars.\n\nWintour is lauded for her ability to mix the fashion world with Hollywood, helping fashion designers and brands reach the public.\n\nWintour makes Vogue a global brand\n\nThe original US edition of Vogue was first published in 1892, with the British edition coming next in 1916.\n\nCurrently, there are over 28 international editions of Vogue magazine. The expansion of the brand has shaped the global fashion scene. \n\nWintour's editorial decisions have played a role in how the magazines operate in their respective countries.\n\nThe launch of Vogue Africa in 2021 helped bring African designers into the international spotlight. Meanwhile, Vogue India launched in 2007 under Wintour's personal guidance.\n\nThe Indian edition has since helped position the country as a major player in the fashion industry, promoting the merging of traditional Indian attire with contemporary styles.\n\nNot doing enough for diversity\n\nYet Wintour's reign has not been without controversy.\n\nUS Vogue has been accused of underrepresenting people of color and of not doing enough to celebrate diversity in the notoriously privileged and snobby world of fashion.\n\nThe industry, like others, has been called upon to be more inclusive, particularly since the murder of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nVogue has made more of an effort to put Black women like the pop singer Rihanna and former US first lady Michelle Obama on the cover in recent years, and Wintour herself put out a statement supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nBut critics also said Wintour had the power to do a lot more.\n\nA study by digital media outlet \"The Pudding\" found that between 2000 and 2005, only three out of 81 models on the covers of Vogue were Black.\n\nA 2020 New York Times article about Conde Nast detailed the experiences of Black former employees.\n\nAmong other grievances, they said they \"faced ignorance and lazy stereotyping from white bosses when the subject of covering Black culture came up.\"\n\nCriticism of Wintour extended to the various international editions she was also responsible for.\n\nA 2022 cover of British Vogue featuring nine models from Africa came under fire for upholding Western beauty ideals and fetishizing Blackness — all models were wearing Western-style hairdos, and their skin was said to be edited to be darker.\n\nA Trump ban from Met Gala?\n\nAnother recent headline-grabbing incident concerns the fashion mogul's role as longtime co-chair of the prestigious Met Gala, the annual haute couture fundraising festival held for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in Manhattan.\n\nAhead of the 2025 event, a video started circulating on social media, seemingly showing Wintour explaining why she had \"permanently removed\" Donald Trump from the Met Gala invitation list. It stated that he \"never truly belonged,\" and she didn't \"want this most sacred night in the fashion world to be reduced to someone's political show.\"\n\nBut the video was found to be a deepfake, combining altered footage from an authentic Vogue interview with an AI-generated voice.\n\nAs a guest at \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" in 2017, Wintour did however name the US president as a person she would \"never invite back\" to the prestigious event.\n\nUpdate, June 27, 2025: A previous version of this article was published on November 4, 2024 to mark Anna Wintour's 75th birthday. It has been updated following the news of Wintour's decision to step down as editor of Vogue.","summary":"&#39;Vogue&#39; editor Anna Wintour- Iconic and controversial  DW  06-27-2025","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/vogue-editor-anna-wintour-her-iconic-and-controversial-moments/a-70632960?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","image":"https://static.dw.com/image/70633433_804.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 05:31:51","author":"Sarah Hucal","authors":["Sarah Hucal"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.198},{"id":338509368,"title":"Donald Trump Admits 2020 US Election Defeat In His 'Life Evolution Video', Says 'They Tried To End My...'","text":"A subtitle in the clip states,“Lost 2020 elections but remain committed to Make America Great Again (MAGA)\", representing a significant shift from his earlier remarks where he consistently asserted the election was“rigged” or stolen.\n\nIt traces Trump's life from his childhood, through his business career, and into his years as a political figure, highlighting the challenges and controversies Trump faced during his presidency, referencing times when he felt“pressured and attacked\", It further alludes to a near assassination attempt in July 2024, underscoring the personal risks and dangers Trump says he has endured.\n\nIt begins with his journey at New York Military Academy from 1959-1964, followed by various tasks after graduation from taking over Trump organisation to building grand Hyatt hotel to opening Trump Tower and others.

Trump claimed – without any serious evidence – that the edit of the interview betrayed bias against him.\n\n60 Minutes journalists countered – and nearly all other observers agreed – that it was just standard editing, common to all major interview segments.\n\nSo then why settle? The key may lie with the fact that the super-wealthy Redstone family, which owns Paramount, is seeking to gain approval from Trump administration regulators for an $8bn deal to sell Paramount to the movie studio Skydance – a deal in which they stand to profit with a $2.4bn payday.\n\n“Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chief,” said lawyer Bob Corn-Revere of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.\n\nNo wonder Sanders was mad. He has warned that the Paramount deal “will only embolden” Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which the US president has repeatedly labeled “the enemy of the people”. It was, Sanders said, a “dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press”.\n\nMany would agree. For as Trump’s second presidency has unfolded amid chaos, vast cuts to government spending and a rollback of civil liberties, his repeated and blistering attacks on the press have been one of the things most worrying those who fear for America’s democratic health.\n\nThe US media is now in a deep crisis of the sort that observers of creeping autocracy in places such as Hungary might find familiar. For the Paramount deal is not alone. The settlement follows another, six months ago, when Disney – which owns ABC News – put to bed a legal claim over how George Stephanopoulos, one of its top news anchors, described the president’s sexual assault of the magazine writer E Jean Carroll. Again, the payment was $16m.\n\nHe is even pursuing a legal claim against a relatively tiny newspaper for printing a poll he didn’t like: Trump’s lawsuit against the Iowa pollster Ann Selzer accuses her and the Des Moines Register of fraud, after she conducted a poll right before the 2024 election that showed Kamala Harris leading in Iowa, a state which she did not ultimately win.\n\nLast week the Trump administration also threatened legal action against no less a news giant than CNN, over its reporting on an app that warns users of nearby immigration enforcement agents. As the administration continues its mass deportation efforts, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said her department and the Department of Justice are now examining the idea of prosecuting the network.\n\n“We’re working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them,” Noem said of CNN, “because what they’re doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities and operations. We’re going to actually go after them and prosecute them. What they’re doing is illegal.”\n\nTrump then added, seemingly for good measure, that he believed the network’s reporting on the success – or lack thereof – of the US bombing on Iran could also be examined. “Our people have to be celebrated, [and] not come home to ‘What do you mean we didn’t hit the targets?’” Then he crystallised his entire approach: “You have scum. CNN is scum. MSDNC [his insult for MSNBC] is scum. The New York Times is scum. They’re bad people. They’re sick.”\n\nBut if Trump is determined to wage a fierce crackdown on the press in the US, in some high-profile quarters it has been met with a distinct lack of resistance – especially from news organizations whose owners are billionaires or large corporations, keenly aware of Trump’s control of the nation’s regulators and their power to make or break a company’s fortunes.\n\nIndeed, while the legal settlements with Trump represent a compromise of press freedoms, they may also represent an economic reality: that news outlets are more of a curse than a blessing to the multibillion-dollar media corporations that own them.\n\nThe billionaire owners of both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post – the biotech mogul Patrick Soon-Shiong and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, respectively – have conspicuously moved their once-powerful newspapers closer to Trump and his Maga movement. Their opinion sections, both once fierce havens for Trump critics, have been the subject of particular attention by their owners – and the outraged resignation letters of staff have appeared to make little impact.\n\n“A generation ago this would have seemed an outrageous story in the history of journalism,” said Bob Thompson, a media professor at Syracuse University.\n\nNot now in Trump’s America. It is a two-pronged spear: even as Trump and his administration have launched an unprecedented attack, at the same time significant parts of the US media have seen its owners and power brokers often fold their hands.\n\nThe head of Reporters Without Borders, Clayton Weimers, said: “A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom, and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.”\n\nJameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said: “Calling these ‘settlements’ doesn’t quite capture what’s happening. It’s more like surrender – or even payoff.”\n\nThe Trump administration has even signaled precisely that. Brendan Carr, Trump’s handpicked chair for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – which holds the reins over whether the Redstone family gets its $2.4bn payday – said in an interview last year that “the news distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction”, referring to the Paramount-Skydance deal.\n\nThe Democratic party, without power and shouting from the sidelines, is furious. The leftwing Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday called for an investigation into the Paramount settlement.\n\n“With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration’s approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight,” Warren said in a statement.\n\nThe settlement, she said, exposed “a glaring need for rules to restrict donations to sitting presidents’ libraries” – referring to the Trump entities that both ABC and CBS said their settlement payments would be directed – and added that “the Trump administration’s level of sheer corruption is appalling, and Paramount should be ashamed of putting its profits over independent journalism”.\n\nIn May, Warren, Sanders and their fellow senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to the Paramount CEO, Shari Redstone, cautioning her that “under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act”.\n\nBut prosecutors in the state of Delaware, where Paramount is incorporated, appear unlikely to open an investigation.\n\nPerhaps most chilling has been Trump’s ongoing attack on the Associated Press, the news agency that is generally relied on to announce the winners and losers of individual elections, up to and including the presidency. When Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico renamed to “Gulf of America”, and the AP continued to use both names – noting that the rest of the world still uses the original – Trump jumped on it as a pretext to ban AP reporters from the White House.\n\nThe AP has sued, but whatever the result, Trump’s attempt to undermine the impartiality credentials of an organisation that is crucial to letting the American people know who their next president is may prove even more dangerous in the long run. And while AP remains banned, official coverage of White House activities has been opened to various new media individuals and groups with no history of impartial journalism at all, and who appear to be selected entirely for their willingness to ask Trump sycophantic questions.\n\nThe political and legal assault could hardly have come at a worse time for American journalism, either, which is assailed by economic headwinds that would be challenging even under a more friendly administration. Scores of once healthy and powerful regional newspapers and television stations have declined or closed. News deserts have appeared all over the country.\n\nBig TV names – such as CNN and its rival MSNBC – are being jettisoned by the owners that once provided a safe haven for them, and few expect the good economic times to return as the rise of social media giants and artificial intelligence chokes off advertising and revenue streams for a public increasingly sceptical of mainstream media.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the fresh new digital startups that were meant to take their place have either shrunk themselves or been axed. Names such as BuzzFeed, HuffPost and Vice News that were once darlings of the digital media world are pale shadows of their former selves, unlikely to provide any sort of bulwark against Trump while mired in economic difficulties. One of the few booming parts of the US media landscape? Fox News, the Trump-boosting conservative channel owned by Rupert Murdoch and his family.\n\n“Part of the various crises in journalism, from the business model to the interference of an aggressive presidential administration, is that so much of journalism are in fact little compartments in huge corporate entities for whom the standards of American journalism, the first amendment, the obligation to inform the citizenry in a republic, are not at the top of their priorities,” Thompson said.\n\n“It’s no surprise that we would have constant conflicts of interest when news organisations are owned by enormous, multivalent corporations that have got a lot of other interests besides telling the truth in journalism.”\n\nIn this world, the Trump administration’s role in the crisis of US journalism is not as singular villain, but as just one more factor in an area of American civic life that was already deeply ailing and standing near the edge of a cliff. Trump and his allies have just started pushing it closer.\n\n“As it collapses before our very eyes, we might be surprised that it didn’t happen a long time ago,” Thompson said.","summary":"As the president’s attacks are met with a distinct lack of resistance, critics warn that freedom of the press is eroding in plain sight\n\nBernie Sanders, the venerable democratic socialist senator from Vermont, was not in a mood to pull punches.\n\n“Trump is undermining our democracy and rapidly moving us towards authoritarianism, and the billionaires who care more about their stock portfolios than our democracy are helping him do it,” he fumed in a statement last week.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/05/trump-attack-us-media","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61cfb5291708ce6ccb65f5468d9c4dddbe073849/0_0_5000_3999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 05:00:04","author":"Edward Helmore","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":338417944,"title":"Donald and Melania Put Their Love on Display During July 4th Celebrations","text":"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were seen exchanging a kiss from the Truman Balcony on Friday in anticipation of Washington, D.C.’s major Fourth of July fireworks show.\n\nThe first couple kissed and hugged as supporters down below ‘awww’-ed the scene.\n\nTrump hosted military families in the South Lawn for the occasion, marking the holiday with a picnic. \n\nEarlier in the evening, Trump delivered a speech from the same balcony, followed by signing his ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ into law, aligning with Congress’s commitment to pass the substantial legislation by the Trump-set Fourth of July deadline.\n\nThere were also a trio of military flyovers, including with B-2 bombers, the stealth jets used in the recent military action over Iran.\n\nThe Trumps had slipped into the West Wing but returned to watch the annual fireworks display over the National Mall.\n\nThe DJ entertained with patriotic music, but also included some unexpectedly catchy pop songs from artists like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga.

He stopped to visit with Biden’s senior staff, many of whom used to work for him, and shared his account of what he and Biden had discussed. Obama was more blunt with the staff. ‘Your campaign is a mess,’ he told them.”\n\nObama recognized that the Biden campaign’s decision to divide leadership between Washington, D.C., and Wilmington, Delaware, could prove costly for his reelection chances, which Biden himself admitted to an aide.\n\nBiden’s campaign operations were based in Wilmington, his longtime home. This was meant to appeal to everyday voters and illustrate his Delaware roots.\n\nAt the time, White House Deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon was sent to Wilmington as campaign manager to address the leadership problems that Obama raised. Biden adviser Mike Donilon stayed in Washington as the president’s chief strategist. Despite the shift, it wasn’t enough to fix his failing campaign.\n\nUltimately, Biden decided to drop out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance with now-President Donald Trump caused worry among Democrats.

Things are hard right now. They are probably going to get worse before they get better,” Harris posted Friday on X.\n\n“But I love our country — and when you love something, you fight for it. Together, we will continue to fight for the ideals of our nation.”\n\nX users were quick to point out that the image Harris promoted — which showed her and first gentleman Doug Emhoff enjoying an Independence Day fireworks display in July 2024 — was conveniently framed to exclude Biden and first lady Jill.\n\n“Kamala cropping Joe out is very symbolic,” noted Link Lauren, a former senior adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign, publishing another shot from the White House balcony that shows the first couple just feet away.\n\n“[W]hose elbow is that at the right[?]” jeered another X user.\n\nOthers took issue with the ominous tone of her holiday statement.\n\n“Feeling grateful we didn’t end up with a President who posts ‘things are gonna get worse’ on the 4th of July,” added Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kiersten Pels.\n\n“Among other reasons, this is why you’re not President,” a second netizen chimed in, while a third encouraged her to “just enjoy the day.”\n\n“America is unburdened by what has been,” a fourth needled, paraphrasing a favorite catchphrase of the VP.\n\n“Kamala sets a new record for the worst 4th of July message ever,” claimed 710

loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 election, with all seven swing states going to the Republican after Biden bowed out of the race months prior.\n\nIn April, Harris delivered an odd keynote address that attacked the Trump administration’s economic and immigration policies — without directly invoking the 47th president’s name — during a 20th anniversary gala in San Francisco for Emerge, a Democratic group helping women run for office.\n\nRecent public polling also shows that her favorability and chances at clinching the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination are declining.\n\nAn Emerson College poll last month found just 13% would back Harris in the primary, whereas 16% would favor former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out of the Democratic contest with just 15 delegates before Super Tuesday in 2020.\n\nWhen the same pollster surveyed Dems in November, at least 37% still stood by Harris.\n\nOther surveys have ranked her much higher, with a Morning Consult poll in March showing 36% support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters in the 2028 primary.\n\nThe following month, the same percentage of respondents seen as “policy influencers” said they weren’t that excited about her pursuing a gubernatorial bid in California next year either, according to a survey by Politico and UC Berkeley’s Citrin Center.\n\nHarris insiders told Politico the former vice president and California Democratic senator will make a decision about her political future by the end of this summer.","summary":"\"[W]hose elbow is that at the right[?]\"

bode well for party’s future","text":"Some Democrats’ latest attempt to develop a winning political agenda to help the party retake the White House in 2028 could be destined for failure.\n\nFormer Arizona Democratic Party chair Andrei Cherny is assembling a group of well-connected party members to craft a ready-made agenda, dubbed “Project 2029,” to help serve the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee, the New York Times first reported on Monday. Though, several analysts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the effort is unlikely to succeed in helping the party win back voters they lost in 2024.\n\nCherny told the NYT that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost her 2024 White House bid because she leaned into attacking President Donald Trump’s agenda instead of touting her own policies, telling the outlet that “the oldest truism in politics is you can’t beat something with nothing.” Cherny’s project — which some people have already panned on social media — draws similarities to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a policy outline and personnel list created to help serve the next GOP president, which Democrats had repeatedly used to attack Trump during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nCherny could not be reached for comment.\n\nAdolph Mongo, a Democratic political commentator and former journalist, told the DCNF he thinks that Project 2025 is a “fantastic” idea, but likely not attainable.\n\n“Project 2029 is a fantastic idea but unrealistic,” Mongo told the DCNF. “The Democratic Party is fractured. The far left has destroyed the party. Look at New York [City], a socialist Democrat might become mayor. In Detroit, a long time Democratic mayor left the party. Democrats across the country are quitting the party and turning Republican. Their once loyal base is black and brown voters, [who] have abandoned the party.”\n\nMoreover, when asked if he thinks the Democratic Party will be able to successfully persuade voters to embrace their ideas through efforts such as Project 2029, Mongo replied “no.”\n\n“For the last 50 years Democrats have made promises and not were able to deliver them,” Mongo told the DCNF. “Democratic run cities have been left out in the cold. Look at the crime and unemployment in our urban area.”\n\n“The Democrats’ problem is several-fold,” Tom Basile, a Daily Caller contributor and host of Newsmax’s “America Right Now,” told the DCNF. “They don’t have credible messengers to even attempt to convince Americans that the party is capable of governing for the vast majority of Americans. The highest profile members of the Democratic Party are [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] AOC, [Independent Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders, and now [Democratic New York Assemblyman] Zohran Mamdani – all socialists. Socialism is not compatible with American life and most Americans know that.”\n\nSanders, the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, is not a registered Democrat, but still caucuses with the party in the Senate.\n\nMamdani on June 2024 notched a surprise win in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary election. Some analysts previously told the DCNF that the socialist’s mayoral primary victory may push the Democratic Party to lean into more far-left policies in future elections.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 election cycle, the Democratic Party has been attempting to strengthen their messaging, amid some party leaders claiming the party brand has become too “woke.” Democrats are also facing various polls showing Americans are largely unimpressed with their leadership.\n\nAdditionally, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly grappling with rampant intraparty tensions and a drop in major donations this year.\n\n“Delivering a message doesn’t only require a credible messenger, but also money and the DNC is flat broke at this point,” Basile told the DCNF. “Additionally, because this flirtation with socialist policies is now a pattern over several election cycles, any claims on the part of Democrats that they are ready to moderate will be met with tremendous skepticism on the part of the public. This week, every Democrat in the U.S. Senate voted for the largest tax hike in American history.”\n\nSome prominent Democratic leaders have recently been growing their national profiles amid speculation that they are sizing up runs for the White House in 2028. Though, some political strategists previously told the DCNF they are skeptical that several of the prospective 2028 Democratic presidential candidates will be able to reunify the party.”For nearly a decade, Democrats have said loud and clear to the American people that they care far more about transgenderism, militant censorship, boys playing in girls sports and open borders than making Americans more financially secure,” Basile told the DCNF. “The party has become anti-Democratic and intolerant while doubling down on an extreme fidelity to government programing that has proven to be a failure. The Biden-Sanders Unity platform, from the 2020 campaign and the gaslighting over the border from last year are both prime examples of what looks like an entrenched, radical agenda. That’s clearly not where the nation is ideologically.”\n\n“Donald Trump is the blue-collar billionaire who is speaking directly to the needs of the working men and women of this country and the middle class,” Basile added. “His program of reform and realignment of power away from government systems to the empowerment of people has stolen core issues from the Democrat [Democratic] Party who have fallen back on radical social agendas to motivate voters. In that fight, the Republicans win regardless of what some document concocted by the DNC says.”\n\nDaisy Roser contributed to this report.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

By the time he became the Republican nominee in 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in over 4,000 lawsuits. His litigious streak has continued, leading to a second term where Trump is actively litigating multiple cases. Here’s a rundown of some of the big lawsuits that Trump, the private citizen, is pursuing while also still being president.\n\nSo mad about the media\n\nTrump has not yet sued CNN or The New York Times over their coverage of Iran. He did, however, have his personal lawyer send them letters threatening to sue, which is an absolutely unhinged thing to do, and a deliberate blurring of the lines between his role as president and his role as a private citizen. \n\nLate Tuesday night, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, announced it would pay Trump $16 million to settle his whiny lawsuit where he alleged the network had deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThat’s almost the same amount Disney paid in December 2024 to settle Trump’s baseless defamation lawsuit against ABC. To make things look slightly less like a straight-up bribe, these millions belong to Trump’s eventual presidential library rather than Trump personally. Nope, still looks like a bribe. \n\nTrump also still has a lawsuit against Iowa pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register over her poll that predicted Harris would win Iowa. Well, he has two of them now, actually. Trump initially filed his suit in Iowa state court, but Gannett, the parent company of the Register, removed the case to federal court. \n\nIn June, Trump tried to get the case back in state court, but the federal judge denied the request. So Trump decided to voluntarily dismiss his federal case and refile in state court. That didn’t really work out either.\n\nThe judge in the federal case, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger, struck Trump’s voluntary dismissal from the record, saying that because Trump had earlier filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit, that court now has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the case. Were Ebinger to grant the voluntary dismissal of the district court case, she would functionally be dismissing Trump’s appeal as well, which the district court doesn’t have the power to do. So, Trump needs to voluntarily dismiss his federal appeal first. \n\nYes, this is wonky procedural stuff, but that’s what lawyers are for. Unfortunately, in this instance, it appears that Trump’s personal attorneys aren’t super-sharp about basic court rules. But rest assured—their client seems to have all the time and money in the world to keep pursuing this in whatever court will take it. \n\nSo mad about the money he owes\n\nDuring his time away from the presidency, Trump lost not one, but two cases to E. Jean Carroll. In May 2023, a jury found him liable for sexually abusing Carroll when he assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and awarded Carroll $5 million. Then, in January 2024, a jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in a separate case over Trump's defamation of her, following the May 2023 verdict. He’s still battling to make both of those go away. \n\nThe full Second Circuit Court of Appeals just declined to reconsider the $5 million verdict, which likely means the next stop is the friendly confines of the United States Supreme Court. And if you’re wondering if Trump will try to argue that he is somehow immune from this civil lawsuit about a sexual assault he committed 20 years before becoming president? Absolutely. How can we be sure? Because that’s basically the argument he just made to the Second Circuit in his attempt to overturn the $83 million verdict. \n\nDuring oral arguments last month, Trump’s personal attorney said that the verdict against Trump “severely damages the presidency” and that “President Trump was denied the protection of presidential immunity” when the trial judge let Carroll’s case proceed. It seems incredibly self-evident that Trump’s presidential immunity does not reach back in time to protect him from the consequences of his actions decades ago. Then again, no one could have expected the Supreme Court to make up that immunity doctrine out of whole cloth. Expect this one to go all the way up as well, and brace yourself for the possibility of a really, really stupid outcome. \n\nSo mad about his criminal conviction\n\nWinning the 2024 election freed Trump from the dozens of federal criminal charges he faced, but it couldn’t undo his conviction in New York state on 34 felony counts over his falsification of business records to hide his payoff to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. He’s continuing to appeal that in the state courts, but he’s also begging the Second Circuit to let him move the criminal case to federal court. \n\nIt should be in federal court, per Trump, because, you guessed it, he believes his presidential immunity covers his criminal acts before becoming president. It should also be in federal court, Trump’s lawyers told the Second Circuit, because the scope of his immunity should be decided “by this court and the Supreme Court, not by New York State courts.” \n\nIn other words, the goal, as ever, is to get in front of a Supreme Court that has proven remarkably receptive to letting Trump off the hook. \n\nSo mad about Russia, still?\n\nThis case, where Trump sued the Pulitzer Prize Board for defaming him, has flown under the radar for a while, but it’s heating up now in ways that highlight exactly how bad it is that the sitting president is also a private litigant. \n\nBut first: How did the board defame him, exactly? By refusing to retract awards to the Washington Post and The New York Times for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump demanded the awards be retracted, and the Pulitzer Board indulged him far more than they should have, conducting an independent review of all the stories. The board concluded that nothing in the award-winning stories had been discredited and declined to retract the awards, and Trump says that defames him. \n\nThis is a ridiculous case, and it should have been dismissed out of hand. But Trump drew an exceedingly friendly three-judge panel in Florida state court that ruled, in February 2025, that he could proceed. How friendly, exactly? Peep the concurrence by Judge Ed Artau, which kicks off by quoting some of Trump’s favorite phrases and glowingly recaps Trump’s complaint. \n\nThat concurrence served as a nice little sizzle reel for Artau, who Trump rewarded two months later with a nomination to the federal bench. And, as Jay Willis points out over at Balls and Strikes, Artau may have known he was under consideration when he wrote that suck-up concurrence. \n\nThis is a not-great collision between Trump’s role as president and his role as private litigant. He’s able to reward judges who rule in his favor in private matters with a reward that he can only extend because of his role as president. \n\nIt gets worse, actually. The Pulitzer Board has been attempting to put this case on hold until Trump is no longer president, given the complexities of litigating against the sitting president and the potential conflict between a state court’s exercise of judicial power and the president’s federal Article II powers. The board pointed out that Trump has argued in other civil cases that litigation would interfere with his duties as president, warranting a stay until the end of his term.\n\nNope, said that friendly appeals panel in May. Only Trump can invoke the privilege of saying he’s too busy being president to participate in litigation. That appellate panel went even farther, saying that if Trump sues someone, that’s cool because he is “uniquely equipped to determine how to use his time, to assess the attention a lawsuit will require, and to decide whether the lawsuit will divert him from his official business.” \n\nBut if someone sues Trump, he gets to decide if that’s too onerous. Needless to say, the Pulitzer Board is appealing this nonsense up to the state Supreme Court. \n\nSo mad at his former business partners\n\nBecause the president now runs private for-profit companies while also being president, said president now gets hauled into court over private business disputes. Also, because said president is a grifter with no loyalty, he gets hauled into court because his business associates allege that he screwed them over. \n\nTwo cofounders of Truth Social, Trump’s low-energy social media platform, sued Trump in 2024, alleging he tried to dilute their stake in the company and ice them out of the initial public offering. When the case was before the Delaware Chancery Court in May 2025, Trump argued the suit should be dismissed or stayed until the end of his term, as he is immune from civil suits while in office. \n\nYes, it’s exactly what the Pulitzer Board was referring to. When Trump is sued, he is the president, and you cannot take the president away from his important duties with lawsuits. When Trump sues people, he is a private individual who also happens to be president, and has assessed whether he has the time to drag parties into endless litigation. \n\nIt’s a double standard that exists only for Trump, another way that he is above the law. Heads, Trump wins. Tails, we all lose.","summary":"Well before his oh-so-illustrious political career resulted in a truly breathtaking number of criminal charges, Donald Trump was no stranger to a courtroom.

Musk has even threatened to bankroll primary challenges against GOP members of Congress who backed the bill.\n\nBut political experts say his billions would be better spent buying him influence within the GOP’s existing party structure rather than birthing a viable new political force capable of challenging America’s entrenched two-party duopoly.\n\n“Third parties are like honeybees — they sting and then they die,” Georgetown political historian Michael Kazin told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nIt is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!\nTime for a new political party that actually cares about the people.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025\n\nAmerican history is littered with third-party bids that flared brightly only to fizzle out, he explained. George Wallace carried five Southern states in 1968 and Ross Perot grabbed nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992 — yet neither cracked the two-party hold on the presidency.\n\nSuch efforts tend to hit a structural wall, Kazin said. The Electoral College’s winner-take-all math means a new party would need to win outright in multiple states to have any shot — a virtually impossible task without displacing one of the existing major parties. Congressional races are similarly unforgiving: first-past-the-post voting leaves little room for third party contenders except as spoilers.\n\nOnly Maine and Alaska run every statewide race under ranked-choice voting — with the District of Columbia recently mandating it too — even as sixteen mostly red states rushed to ban the system outright. Nearly one in twenty ballots cast in ranked-choice elections were improperly filled out, according to a March Political Behavior study that analyzed more than three million ballots cast in Alaska, Maine, New York City and San Francisco.\n\nKazin added that when outsider movements do break through, they usually start small.\n\n“Structurally, third parties would have to begin by showing strength in a state or region,” he said, calling it “a mistake … to try to run nationally the first time.” He pointed to the Populists of the 1890s — who won governorships and state legislatures across the Plains before petering out — as well as Wallace’s Dixie stronghold and Perot’s early focus on Texas as evidence that durable change, if it comes at all, builds locally before emerging on the national stage.\n\nIf this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day.\nOur country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025\n\nYet the public appetite for an alternative is ravenous. Nearly two-thirds of Americans in a 2023 Gallup poll agreed that a “third major party” is needed — a level of frustration with the Republican-Democratic duopoly that has persisted for over a decade. But so far that discontent has never translated into a new party capable of upending the system.\n\nFor Musk, the challenge runs deeper than structural impediments. His brand of libertarianism — the philosophy centered on minimal government and maximum individual freedom — lacks the mass constituency needed to sustain a political movement.\n\nThe numbers are damning. Libertarian Party candidates have averaged just 1% of the presidential vote since 2000, with Gary Johnson’s 3.3% showing in 2016 being an outlier. Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, arguably the Senate’s most libertarian member, finished fifth in the 2016 Iowa caucuses before dropping out — a humbling reminder that even the state that elected him also sent Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell to Washington.\n\n“Libertarianism was arguably the core ideology about the party under Ronald Reagan … Trump has changed the Republican Party,” Kazin said.\n\nIs it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025\n\nYet Musk’s money could still matter enormously within the existing party structure. The Senate Leadership Fund has shown how targeted cash can redraw a primary map; the super PAC poured almost $8 million into Alabama’s 2017 special election to prop up former Sen. Luther Strange over hard-right challengers and later spent roughly $5 million in 2022 to shield centrist Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski from a Trump-backed insurgent, according to The Washington Post — evidence that with enough money, a donor can bend the GOP to his will without resorting to a breakaway party.\n\nMoney isn’t a surefire way to win elections, however. Musk poured a record-breaking $22 million into Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race in April — money that supported conservative Brad Schimel but still couldn’t stop liberal Judge Susan Crawford from winning by almost nine points. University of Wisconsin political scientist Barry Burden told the Post that Musk’s presence galvanized liberal turnout, arguing a hypothetical third party should “draw on [Musk’s] resources but keep him in the background.”\n\nDemocrats learned the same bitter lesson in 2024. OpenSecrets data shows former Vice President Kamala Harris over $1 billion — yet Trump still landed a decisive Electoral College victory and swept every swing state with less than half the campaign funds.\n\nBut campaign finance law could further complicate the future of the “America Party.”\n\nBradley Smith, a former chair of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), told CNN that “there is some case law suggesting that some of the organizational activities of a party and starting a party can be funded with larger contributions, until it actually qualifies for party status under the election commission regulations.”\n\n“You can fund super PACs all you want,” he said. “But you can’t fund a political party, as a strange part of American law.”\n\nUltimately, Kazin suggested Musk’s flirtation with a third-party run would likely remain more rhetorical than practical.\n\n“The idea that he, by himself, is going to be able to found a party which could make a difference — yeah, it seems fanciful to me,” Kazin said, adding that “a lot of people think he’s somewhat foreign. I think that probably counts against him as well, especially among conservatives who style themselves to be great American patriots.”\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gas prices down. Economic indicators are decent. Brand new jobs report shows that it's much better than expected, and border crossings are down,' Sidner first told Florida Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz during the exchange on CNN News Central. \n\n'And now, Trump's mega-spending bill looks like it's going to be passed by Republicans.' \n\nThe bill - dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill - has since been passed.\n\nSidner went on to pose a pointed question. 'How do you Democrats fight back against the wins that Trump can tout?'\n\nWasserman-Schultz immediately bristled, firing back: 'Well, it depends how you define wins, Sara,' before launching into a heated tirade against Trump - even pointing out that his bill goes against past promises not to touch Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nA meltdown ensued, months after CNN CEO Mark Thompson reportedly demanded a drastic tone-down in anti-Trump rhetoric from staff amid tanking ratings.\n\nSidner appeared to abide, as Wasserman-Schultz refused to acknowledge Trump's recent wins. \n\n'I mean, the way I can summarize this - this big, ugly bill best is, Republicans caved, Trump lied, and people will die,' Wasserman-Schultz said. 'This bill does kick 17 million people off of their health care. \n\n'That's people who are on Medicaid, who are extremely vulnerable, like veterans and the elderly, the disabled and children.'\n\nForecasting people going hungry due to incoming cuts to nutrition assistance, the congresswoman declared: 'This is a bill that is going to cause tremendous pain.'\n\nShe maintained the bill 'is incredibly unpopular with the public' due to it stripping away things she said 'ensure that [Americans] can remain healthy and safe.\n\n'And that their families can be cared for, and that they can have a middle class lifestyle.'\n\nThe final version of the bill is set to strip funding from the federal health insurance programs over the next 10 years - a prospect progressives have painted as a means to give tax cuts to billionaires. \n\nWasserman-Schultz, 58, made that claim as well, telling Sidner: 'This bill is all in service to taking care of the wealthiest, most fortunate Americans.\n\n'It explodes the deficit, and it raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to give tax breaks to the wealthy.'\n\nThe congresswoman then turned to the jobs report, which she refused to accept at face value. \n\nA stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs was added to the US economy in June, Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday revealed - statistics Wasserman-Schultz argued were misleading.\n\n'That jobs report you just mentioned, the overwhelming majority of those jobs are actually government jobs and education jobs that look to be more like substitute teachers,' Wasserman-Schultz said, despite an almost identical amount being added to industries like health care, leisure, and hospitality.\n\n'There are really not many jobs in that jobs report that they can point to that are in the private market. \n\nShe concluded by branding the report 'hollow', not addressing Trump's successes along the Southern Border.\n\nCrossings there have dropped to levels not seen in decades, numbers released Thursday showed. \n\nOn Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives passed the Big Beautiful Bill late Thursday as well by a vote of 218 to 214.\n\nIn return, Wasserman-Schultz said the vote was purposely being done 'in the dead of night [so] people don't know what's going on', leading Sidner to change the subject and ask whether Democrats had a strategic response ahead of midterms next year. \n\nShe said the party will continue to call attention to rural hospitals and nursing homes closing and approved tax cuts for a group she framed as 'the wealthiest, most fortunate Americans.' \n\n'It's an abomination, and they will pay for it at the ballot box next year when Democrats take the majority back because people are going to rebel.' \n\nSidner, 53, then changed the subject, pivoting to Trump's promised Alligator Alcatraz in Wasserman-Schultz's home state.\n\n'It's an outrage, an abomination. It is going to upend and waste hundreds of billions of dollars that we've already spent on Everglades restoration. \n\n'It should be abandoned immediately,' she said. Sidner ended the segment there, not offering any opinion on the matter.\n\nUnlike Sidner, who simply reported the news, Collins played a supercut on The Source Monday that honed in on the president's repeated promises to avoid such cuts. \n\nLast week, Collins and Trump had a testy back-and-forth during a press conference at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, where Trump ripped CNN as 'fake news CNN'.\n\nThey also had a heated exchange aboard Air Force One last month, after Collins floated a series of questions about the conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nSidner, in May, stood up against Trump as well, during a fiery exchange with Congressman Pat Harrigan (R-NC) over the president's comments defending his tariffs.\n\n'Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30,' Trump has said - leading Sidner to take issue.\n\n “Congressman, would your constituents think it's funny to tell them to stop buying things and to stop buying dolls for their children while the economy is in a decline?” Sidner said after Harrigan laughed off one of her questions.\n\nShe also pressed the congressman on April's more lackluster job report, which June's appeared to address. \n\n'You think the economy is good even though the GDP has actually receded for the first time in many years?' she asked, months after calling out the conservative for his complaints about Democratic rhetoric amid the ongoing threats across Springfield, Ohio, following his 'eating the pets' claims.\n\nA few weeks before, last July, Sinder chided Trump for calling Kamala Harris 'real garbage.' \n\nTrump has been at odds with CNN since his first term, repeatedly slamming its coverage since.\n\nHe revived his claim that the network is a purveyor of 'fake news' after in-depth reporting into his strikes on Iran that questioned their effectiveness.","summary":"'Gas prices down.

As Republicans hail the legislation as a triumph of conservative governance, Democrats are mobilizing against what they describe as a broad assault on social safety nets. The measure, dubbed Trump’s Megabill, is poised to become a defining issue in the upcoming electoral contest.The $4.5 trillion legislative package, which includes permanent tax code changes, border security expansion, and controversial cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, has not only reshaped policy but also reignited fierce partisan debate — one that both parties believe could shape control of Congress next year.Also Read | From coverage to crisis? How Trump’s tax package could strip millions of Medicaid benefitsGOP Celebrates Legislative Victory as Fulfilling MandatePresident Trump showcased the bill’s passage at a rally in Iowa, declaring it the fulfillment of his 2024 campaign promises. “Every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept,” Trump told a cheering crowd.The Republican leadership, still navigating internal divisions, has largely coalesced around the megabill, viewing it as a major legislative win. It codifies Trump's earlier tax reforms and adds new measures such as tax exemptions on tips and a senior citizen tax deduction of $6,000 for those earning up to $75,000 annually.Live Events“This bill is not only about taxes — it's about showing voters we can deliver on our agenda,” said Mark Bednar, a Republican strategist and former aide to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “The GOP should lean into this, especially as we approach the August recess and 2026 campaign cycle.”Also Read | 10 key takeaways from Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill summarised simplyDemocrats Highlight Social Cuts, Seek Messaging ResetDemocrats, reeling from setbacks in previous elections, see the bill as an opportunity to reframe the political conversation. Trump’s Megabill, they argue, prioritises wealthy Americans and corporations while slashing lifelines for vulnerable communities.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., delivered an impassioned nine-hour speech on the House floor, highlighting individuals affected by proposed Medicaid and SNAP reductions. “Shame on the people who've decided to launch that kind of all-out assault on the health and the well-being of everyday Americans,” he sai, as quoted in a report by ABC News.According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the bill will eliminate health coverage for 12 million Americans and strip 3 million of food stamp benefits over the next decade. The CBO also projected a $3.4 trillion increase in the national deficit as a result of the policy changes.Divided Public Opinion Clouds Political ImpactPolling data reflects the public’s ambivalence. A June Quinnipiac poll found that just 29% of voters supported the bill, while 55% opposed it. Another Fox News survey showed similar trends, with 59% against and only 38% in favour. Notably, nearly half of those polled felt the bill would negatively affect their own families.Opinions on work requirements for Medicaid recipients remain more evenly split: 47% support the provision, while 46% oppose it, as per a report by ABC News. Still, strategists on both sides believe the real electoral implications will depend on how effectively the parties communicate the bill’s provisions and consequences to voters. “It’s going to be crucial for Democrats to explain the long-term impact of Medicaid cuts and rising debt,” said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who ran the party’s 2018 congressional campaign.Echoes of 2018 or a New Political Terrain?Democrats have drawn parallels to 2018, when public backlash over GOP tax reforms and failed attempts to repeal Obamacare helped them reclaim the House. However, analysts caution that the 2026 midterms present a different landscape.At the time, Republicans were defending 25 districts won by Hillary Clinton. Today, just 13 Democrats hold seats in districts carried by Trump, while only three Republicans represent districts won by Vice President Kamala Harris.Moreover, some moderate Democrats have cautiously endorsed elements of Trump’s Megabill, including the no-tax-on-tips provision, complicating efforts to present a unified opposition.Republicans, meanwhile, are showing a more consolidated front under Trump’s leadership. While dissent did emerge — notably from Senator Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who opposed the Medicaid changes — such resistance remains isolated. After voting against the bill, Tillis announced he would not seek re-election, following reported pressure from Trump loyalists.Trump Signals Campaign Strategy for MidtermsPresident Trump made it clear during his Iowa rally that he intends to use the megabill as a campaign centrepiece. “With all of the things we did with the tax cuts and rebuilding our military, not one Democrat voted for us,\" he said. \"And I think we use it in the campaign that's coming up — the midterms, because we've got to beat them.\"FAQsWhat is Trump’s Megabill?Trump’s Megabill is a $4.5 trillion legislative package recently passed by the U.S. Congress. It includes permanent tax reforms, expanded border security, and significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs like SNAP.When do the Medicaid work requirements take effect?Starting in 2027, states must verify that “able-bodied” Medicaid recipients work at least 80 hours per month, unless exempted (e.g., students, caregivers, disabled individuals). Parents of children over 13 will also be subject to these checks.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump's Big Beautiful BillTrump's Megabill2026 midterm electionsMedicaid cuts effectsTrump's midterm\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

She’s trying to sound like she’s 26 years old, and it’s inappropriate. It feels weird. She’s one of our biggest stars, that’s true. Act like it… Have some class.”\n\nLater in the episode, Kelly implied that Theron may be misrepresenting her sexuality and exaggerating sexual encounters for attention.\n\n“I kind of call bulls–t, because I believe that Charlize Theron probably prefers women. That’s my belief. Okay, I’m entitled to my opinion, and there’s no reason to get into the details as to why I believe it, but I believe it,” Kelly said.\n\n“And I don’t think that she’s telling the truth about the 26-year-old.”\n\nTheron, who is currently promoting the upcoming Netflix film “The Old Guard 2,” told Cooper during their conversation: “I did just recently f–k a 26-year-old, and it was really amazing… I’ve never done that. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is great.’ Women should be the ones that are like, ‘F–k you, I’m going to have an orgasm.’”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress has previously addressed questions about her sexuality.\n\nIn a 2017 appearance on the Bravo television show “Watch What Happens Live” with Andy Cohen, Theron was asked if she had “dipped in the lady pond.”\n\n“When I was young, yes,” Theron told Cohen. \n\nAt the time, she was promoting her film “Atomic Blonde,” a spy thriller in which she portrayed a bisexual MI6 agent who was operating in Berlin during the Cold War.\n\n“I mean, it’s just so not big deal. I’m so old school — I really like dudes,” Theron said at the time.\n\nTheron went on to clarify that while she explored her sexuality in the past, she identifies as heterosexual and has spoken out in support of bisexual visibility in film.\n\nKelly also criticized the actress’s use of profanity on “Call Her Daddy,” saying: “I love a good F bomb… But every sentence? An F bomb? ‘F in this, F in that, F in God,’ what is that? This is like an affectation where she’s trying to act like, again, young, cool girl, ‘I get it, and I don’t need a man.’”\n\nTheron, a single mother, also spoke on the podcast about the freedom she feels raising her two adopted daughters — Jackson and August — without a male partner.\n\n“She’s got two children. They don’t need a father? She’s super proud of the fact that there’s no father in the picture? Great. Good for you,” Kelly remarked.\n\n“It’s a very strange thing to see one of our best known actresses sit down like that, with the crossed legs, with this sex podcaster, talking about their orgasms and who they f’ed. It’s just really off-putting.”\n\nTheron adopted her eldest child, Jackson, in 2012, and her second daughter, August, in 2015. In 2019, Theron revealed that Jackson is transgender, telling media outlets that Jackson asserted her identity at age three.\n\nTheron, who has never married, has been candid about her dating life.\n\nShe was in a long-term relationship with actor Stuart Townsend from 2001 to 2010, and later dated Sean Penn between 2013 and 2015.

Wall Street ruajti fitimet e gjeneruara në javët e mëparshme dhe obligacionet nuk regjistruan lëvizje dramatike. Dollari vazhdon të dobësohet kundrejt monedhave të tjera, gjë që analistët e shoqërojnë me rritjen e deficitit dhe rreziqet fiskale të vetë paketës. Sipas vlerësimeve fillestare, paketa e Trump do t’i shtojë borxhit kombëtar një shumë marramendëse prej 3.3 trilionë dollarësh (po, trilionë!) gjatë dekadës së ardhshme. Ky është një informacion që në vetvete është një dhimbje koke për republikanët fiskalisht konservatorë, ata të llojit të vjetër, prandaj ndihmësit e administratës aktuale duhej të bënin një përpjekje të jashtëzakonshme, më të madhen deri më tani në mandatin e ri, për t’i vënë në vijë.

The story detailed Lyonne's efforts to lobby Hollywood heavyweights to sign onto her letter to the Trump administration in March, urging against the loosening of regulations around AI, which they deem a potential threat to their intellectual property without proper protections in place. The WSJ noted the White House's pending AI action plan \"could influence how U.S. copyright rules are applied to training large language models,\" with tech companies like Google and OpenAI saying they need such models to keep theirs up to date and compete globally with rivals like China. REPUBLICANS SCRAP DEAL IN 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO LOWER RESTRICTIONS ON STATES' AI REGULATIONS The Hollywood letter said the companies \"are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit America’s creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections that have helped America flourish.\" Lyonne and more than 400 others, including such figures as Paul McCartney, Ron Howard and Ben Stiller, signed the letter. Lyonne, known for her roles in the series \"Poker Face\" and \"Russian Doll,\" is a partner in a new studio called Asteria, which describes itself as \"an artist-led generative AI film and animation studio powered by the first clean and ethical AI model.\" Like many figures in Hollywood, Lyonne is not a fan of the president, endorsing Kamala Harris in 2024 and posting in a now-deleted X post in 2020 about turning Texas blue to defeat Trump. Earlier this year, she told The Hollywood Reporter she was concerned for marginalized communities, saying of Trump, \"It’s very weird to have like a showbiz guy in charge, is surreal. I’m actually pretty horrified by how strategic and effective this whole thing has been.\" FEDERAL AI POWER GRAB COULD END STATE PROTECTIONS FOR KIDS AND WORKERS She added she was concerned that 12-year-olds wouldn't be able to get abortions, later clarifying that she was referring to young victims of rape or incest who may be forced to give birth. The WSJ reported that Trump officials were unsure whether they'd take any action on the AI front, due to the complexities involved and having to take one side over another. There have been mixed rulings on the subject as well, with fair use arguments favoring companies like Meta and Anthropic in two cases last month because the copyrighted material used to train their AI models was sufficiently transformed, the Wall Street Journal reported. But others have favored copyright holders, depending on the context. OpenAI and Google put forth their own submissions earlier this year to the White House Office of Science and Technology asking their respective companies to be able to train their models on copyrighted material. \"The federal government can both secure Americans’ freedom to learn from AI and avoid forfeiting our AI lead to the PRC [People's Republic of China] by preserving American AI models’ ability to learn from copyrighted material,\" OpenAI’s letter states. SCARLETT JOHANSSON TAKES AIM AT COMPANIES USING HER LIKENESS, VOICE IN AI Google’s letter states, \"Balanced copyright rules, such as fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions, have been critical to enabling AI systems to learn from prior knowledge and publicly available data, unlocking scientific and social advances. These exceptions allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.\" This week, a deal that had been reached between Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, over how states can regulate artificial intelligence was pulled from President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" bill. The collapsed agreement would have required states seeking to access hundreds of millions of dollars in AI infrastructure funding in the \"big, beautiful\" bill to refrain from adopting new regulations on the technology for five years, a compromise down from the original 10 years.

Proponents of a Beshear run point to his electoral success in Kentucky, a reliably Republican state, as proof he can win over Republican and independent voters. However, polls suggest he is less known than other Democrats who could run in 2028.What to KnowBeshear, who was speculated to be a potential vice presidential candidate for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, addressed speculation about a potential run in an interview with Vanity Fair published Friday.\"Two years ago, I wouldn't have considered [running for president],\" he told the magazine. \"But if I'm somebody who could maybe heal and bring the country back together, I'll think about it after next year.\"Early polls suggest most Democrats favor candidates like former Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom or former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. But the primary still years away, meaning a dark horse candidate like Beshear could still break through.The latest Emerson College poll showed Beshear with support from 2 percent of respondents.In that poll, 16 percent of respondents backed Buttigieg, 13 percent supported Harris and 12 percent leaned toward Newsom. Seven percent supported both Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, while 5 percent said they would prefer to vote for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Three percent backed New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Maryland Governor Wes Moore also received the backing of 2 percent of respondents.The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from June 24 to June 25 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.A Morning Consult poll from June found him similarly trailing other candidates with 1 percent support.That poll showed Harris leading with 36 percent of the vote. Buttigieg followed at 10 percent, and 5 percent backed Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez. It polled 1,000 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents from June 13 to June 15, 2025.Beshear remains one of the most popular governors in the country. A Morning Consult survey found that he has a net approval rating of +43. Sixty-eight percent view him favorably, while only 25 percent give him negative marks.Supporters say that approval is especially impressive given President Donald Trump's 30-point victory in Kentucky. He won nearly 65 percent of the vote, compared to former Vice President Kamla Harris' 34 percent, in the 2024 election.What People Are SayingBeshear told Kentucky's WDRB in May: \"But I don't want to leave a broken country to my kids. So, if I'm somebody who can bring this nation together, hopefully find some common ground, it's something I would consider.\"Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in June in remarks to WHAS: \"If he wants to run, he should. He's a great guy. He's a wonderful governor. I've known him a long time.\"What Happens NextCandidates typically don't start making formal presidential runs until after the midterms, but other potential candidates are already laying the groundwork for 2028.

According to multiple news outlets, Donald Trump told a Des Moines crowd, “We’re going to have a UFC fight—think of this—on the grounds of the White House.” That initialism is a reference to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a MMA promotions company now owned by talent-agency-turned-combat-sports conglomerate Endeavor, a public company led by big-ticket Democrat donor and vocal Kamala Harris supporter Ari Emanuel.\nOf course, Emanuel isn’t who most folks think of, if or when they mull the UFC. That honor goes to Dana White, a longtime Trump hype man employed by the fight company as president and CEO (he also reportedly holds a small ownership stake). White, who was caught on tape in an alleged domestic violence incident with wife Anne White in 2022, has praised Trump as “the toughest, most resilient guy I’ve ever met in my life” and “the legitimate, ultimate American badass of all time,” words that cynics might assume have swayed Trump’s interest in his company.\nIf the White House match happens, it will be an incredible turnaround for a sport that was banned in most states until just a couple of decades ago. The UFC—which once marketed itself as “no holds barred,” although rules do indeed exist today—faced bipartisan ire when Republican Senator John McCain sent letters to governors of all 50 states in 1996 encouraging its ban. It was “barbaric,” “not a sport,” and “human cockfighting,” McCain wrote. In consequence, the UFC went dark in the US until the turn of the millennium, when those laws were lifted state by state.\nThe now-shuttered Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was the site of a UFC bout soon after, in 2001, so if this White House match goes off, it won’t be the president’s first time hosting one of the company’s events. “We’re going to have some incredible events, some professional events, some amateur events. But the UFC fight is going to be a big deal, too,” Trump told assembled Iowans Thursday. “It’s going to be a championship fight, full fight, like 20,000 to 25,000 people and we’re going to do that as part of ‘250’ also.”\nAccording to a pool report quoting White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the president is “dead serious” about the plan to host this globally inspired sporting event at the White House, even as more expressly and traditionally American pursuits like baseball (the modern version of which was invented in New York in the 1840s), basketball (Massachusetts, 1890s), and American football (East Coast, 1960s) go unmentioned.\nIt’s news sure to rile former Trump supporters like Tucker Carlson, who has recently complained that Trump’s promise to focus on American excellence and boosterism appears to be slipping. \"Let’s focus on my country, where I was born,” Carlson said last month, as he chewed over America’s bombing of Iran. Is Trump’s desire to mark America’s founding with a new, non-traditional, and foreign-born sport a yet another sign—like his softened stance on undocumented farmworkers—that the president is sneakily, incrementally going multicultural and woke? If so, this is certainly a July 4 for the history books.","summary":"The president passes over American pastimes like baseball, basketball, and football for the foreign-born discipline of mixed martial arts.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/donald-trump-white-house-ufc-match","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6867f16ef69d8cc9437f833a/16:9/w_6848,h_3852,c_limit/2209982489","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 17:46:16","author":"Eve Batey","authors":["Eve Batey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.128},{"id":338365092,"title":"How Paramount's $16-million Trump settlement came together  — and could've fallen apart","text":"By early spring, Paramount Global was in crisis. President Trump wouldn’t budge from his demand for an eye-popping sum of money and an apology from the company to settle his lawsuit over a CBS News “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Journalists at the storied broadcaster were in revolt against the parent company. Meanwhile, Paramount’s board faced withering pressure, with a settlement widely seen as a prerequisite for getting government approval for the company’s $8-billion sale to David Ellison’s Skydance Media, or the deal would collapse. Then a new emergency erupted. On May 4, CBS aired a hard-hitting “60 Minutes” segment that took aim at Trump’s targeting of law firms. Correspondent Scott Pelley anchored the report, which relied heavily on an interview with a leading Trump irritant — former top Hillary Clinton advisor Marc Elias. Trump was furious. He threatened Paramount with an additional lawsuit alleging defamation, according to people close to the situation who were not authorized to comment. The behind-the-scenes drama eventually would culminate with Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to end the president’s battle over edits to October’s Harris interview, which Trump alleged was manipulated to boost the then-vice president’s election chances. Trump’s suit had demanded $20 billion in damages. The deal resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests: the president, mogul Shari Redstone, tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel, CBS News' ousted leader Wendy McMahon and Jeff Shell, a former NBCUniversal chief now with RedBird Capital Partners, which backs Ellison's Skydance. The settlement, which the president approved late Tuesday, included a commitment by Trump to drop his claims and not sue over the May \"60 Minutes\" broadcast, according to sources and a Paramount statement. Paramount said it agreed to pay Trump's legal fees. The remainder of the $16-million settlement will go toward his future presidential library. \"Larry Ellison is a friend of mine. He's a great guy,\" Trump told reporters following a Thursday night rally in Iowa. \"I think he's going to run CBS really well, and I think he's making a good deal to buy it.\" The beleaguered company behind \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Yellowstone\" mustered victories during the negotiations, withstanding the Trump team's earlier demand for a $100-million payout, the knowledgeable sources said. The company also refused to apologize for CBS' reporting or edits, a stance to protect its journalistic ethics and 1st Amendment rights. \"This settlement allows Paramount to focus on its prospective sale, and CBS can maintain its principles,\" said C. Kerry Fields, a business law professor at the USC Marshall School. \"But principle has its price, and there certainly was one set here.\" The eight-month skirmish with Trump shined a harsh light on Paramount's vulnerabilities — and deep divisions within the company and its prospective new owners. Paramount had a narrow window to reach a truce. The company wanted to finalize the settlement before Wednesday, when Paramount held its annual shareholder meeting and three new members joined the board. \"This [settlement] was all about survival — it was that dark,\" Fields said. \"Paramount has to execute the sale to Skydance in order to survive.\" At first, Paramount's sale to the Ellison family seemed like a sure bet. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corp., is close to Trump and his company is a possible buyer for TikTok, another deal of interest to the president. The landmark Paramount-Skydance deal, struck a year ago, could reshape one of Hollywood's original studios and the entertainment landscape. Redstone and her family agreed to part with their entertainment holdings, National Amusements Inc., and controlling Paramount shares. The family's shaky finances were a catalyst for the sale. Redstone has borrowed heavily to meet debt obligations, including a $186-million term loan from Larry Ellison last year. The family is waiting for the cash from the sale of Paramount and National Amusements to the Ellisons and RedBird, a private equity firm. But an unexpected misstep altered the deal's course. Last fall, \"60 Minutes\" invited Trump and Harris to participate in preelection interviews. Trump agreed, then backed out. CBS News went forward with a Harris sit-down. Correspondent Bill Whitaker asked Harris about the Biden administration's rocky relations with Israel's prime minister. Producers used different portions of her answer on two programs: a convoluted response on CBS' Sunday morning show \"Face the Nation,\" and a more succinct part on \"60 Minutes.\" Trump and his supporters zeroed in on the discrepancy. They accused CBS of doctoring the interview. CBS News denied the allegation, saying the edits were routine. Days before the election, Trump sued in Amarillo, Texas, ensuring the case would be overseen by a Trump-appointed judge. His lawsuit alleged the \"60 Minutes\" edits amounted to election interference — \"malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public,\" in the suit's words. 1st Amendment experts said the case had no merit; some figured it was a campaign stunt. Days later, Shell, the RedBird executive who will become Paramount's president should Skydance take over, held a conference call with top CBS executives. Shell suggested \"60 Minutes\" release the full Harris interview transcript in a bid for transparency, according to people familiar with the matter. News executives refused, drawing a clear division between some high-level Paramount executives and Ellison's team. Those Paramount executives have bristled over Shell's involvement, including a comment he reportedly made to McMahon late last year, stating the company eventually would have to settle. Skydance has said it has an agreement with Paramount that gives Ellison and Shell the ability to give input on key business issues — even before acquiring Paramount. A spokesperson for Shell declined to comment. The role of Shell, ousted from his previous role running NBCUniversal after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with an underling, has been controversial. Representatives for the creators of \"South Park\" have accused him of overstepping his authority and meddling with a protracted negotiation over their overall deal and streaming rights to the long-running cartoon. A representative for Shell denied that accusation. Trump had scored previous victories over media organizations. In December, the Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay him $16 million, including $1 million for his attorney fees, to end a dispute stemming from ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate description of Trump's liability in a civil court case. Press advocates howled. Paramount held firm. But it failed to get Trump's case dismissed or moved to a court in New York, where CBS and \"60 Minutes\" are based. So the company was in a box. Its sale to Skydance requires the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to transfer CBS TV station licenses to the Ellisons, and that consent has been elusive. In one of his first moves as FCC chairman, Trump appointee Brendan Carr launched an inquiry into whether CBS' edits of the Harris interview rose to the level of news distortion — the crux of Trump's lawsuit. In February, Carr demanded CBS release a raw transcript of the Harris interview and the unedited footage. CBS complied; the material showed Harris had been accurately quoted. The Texas judge ordered Paramount and Trump's lawyers into mediation. Talks began April 30. That weekend, \"60 Minutes\" ran its report on Trump and the law firms, riling Redstone and others. The Trump team and Paramount were already far apart, the sources said. Soon, CBS News and Stations President Wendy McMahon was forced out. Knowledgeable sources attributed her departure to months of strife and persistent criticism from Redstone, who serves as Paramount's chair. McMahon also made missteps, including overseeing an unsuccessful reboot of \"CBS Evening News.\" Her exit followed that of Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of \"60 Minutes,\" who fought efforts to settle. The day McMahon was ousted, left-leaning U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) lobbed a salvo at Redstone. In a May 19 letter, they warned that Paramount board members risked possible bribery charges if they paid Trump to settle the lawsuit as a way to win FCC approval for the Skydance deal. By early June, Redstone and the Ellison team were getting restless. Emanuel, the agent, stepped in to help get the dealmaking back on track, people familiar with the matter said. Emanuel is Trump's former talent agent and one of Ellison's closest allies. On June 7, Ellison met briefly with Trump at a UFC event in New Jersey. Emanuel is executive chairman of the WME Group and chief executive of UFC’s parent company, TKO. According to a source, Emanuel associate Dana White, the Trump-supporting UFC chief executive, helped facilitate the Ellison meeting with the president, which occurred steps away from the fighters' octagon. People close to Ellison and Emanuel declined to discuss Ellison's interactions with the president. Representatives of Skydance, Redstone and Emanuel declined to comment for this story. Finally, a breakthrough came when Trump offered support for Ellison and the Skydance deal, though he continued to blast Harris and CBS News. “Ellison is great,” Trump said from the White House lawn on June 18. \"He'll do a great job with it.\" Late Thursday, Trump called David Ellison \"a fantastic young man.\" Meanwhile, the clock was ticking. Redstone and others wanted the board to handle the settlement before the shareholder meeting, when one director stepped down, and three new members joined the board. Redstone recused herself from voting but made her wishes known. The settlement was finally reached about 10 hours before the Paramount board switched. One person close to the legal effort said the agreement \"got over the finish line\" due to a sweetener for Trump. His team anticipates that Paramount networks eventually will run millions of dollars worth of free commercials, or public service announcements, in support of Trump causes, including combating antisemitism and increasing border security. Trump also referenced the alleged side deal. \"We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million — or maybe more than that in advertising,\" Trump said. \"So [the settlement] is like $32- to maybe $35 million.\" Paramount said it agreed to a $16-million settlement. . “Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs,\" the company said in a statement. \"Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.\" Skydance declined to comment. Emanuel did not respond to messages.

Each attempt has only exposed their bias, damaged their credibility and handed Trump yet another win.\n\n1. MSNBC Shakes Up Primetime Lineup After Host Repeatedly Targets Trump\n\nMSNBC has shaken up its primetime lineup in February after a series of controversial moments involving its host targeting President Donald Trump. Joy Reid’s show, “The ReidOut,” which aired at 7 p.m., has been canceled and replaced with a new panel show featuring Symone Sanders-Townsend, Michael Steele, and Alicia Menendez.\n\nThe move comes as the network retools its programming, with Alex Wagner’s show also being replaced by Jen Psaki. Reid faced backlash for her frequent attacks on conservatives and white Americans. Her emotional farewell on-air highlighted her belief that her program had “value” on MSNBC. Even after her firing, Reid continued to criticize Trump, insisting that “fascism is already here” in her final broadcast. (RELATED: Rachel Maddow Couldn’t Wait For Trump To Be Declared Winner Before Already Invoking Russia)\n\n“I’m sorry,” Reid said. “That what I was doing had value. And, in the end, I’m sorry, I try not to cry on TV and this is kinda like me on TV, so I apologize … what I will just say is, where I land is that the moment of guilt that I felt that I went hard on so many issues whether it was the Black Lives Matter issues of a young baby or a mom or dad that was killed or when we opened up people’s eyes to the fact that Asian Americans were being targeted, not just black folks, [or when we] went hard for immigrants who did nothing but come to this country like my parents did and try to make a life and defended them. Or whether we talked about what [President Donald Trump] is doing that is subversive to the Constitution, that is injurious to our liberty.”\n\n2. Media Mocks Trump’s ‘Daddy’ Meme, But Ends Up Making It Go Viral Instead\n\nThe media’s mockery of Trump’s “Daddy” meme ignited following NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s remark at the NATO summit. Rutte referred to Trump as “Daddy” during a press briefing, saying, “then daddy has to sometimes use strong language,” while discussing Trump’s strategy regarding the Israel-Iran conflict. The comment quickly went viral, sparking widespread media attention.\n\nLate-night hosts Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert quickly seized the moment to satirize the incident. Meyers asked, “Why is anyone calling him daddy?” and mocked the NATO summit as a “softcore Cinemax movie from the ’80s.” Colbert also joined the mockery and used the opportunity to criticize Trump’s political actions.\n\nRather than distancing itself from the nickname, the White House embraced it and even released a video titled “Daddy’s Home.” The clip, which featured footage of Trump at the summit set to Usher’s song “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home),” further fueled the meme’s popularity.\n\n3. Corporate Media Blamed Trump For Soaring Egg Prices Then Prices Crashed And Made Them Look Foolish \n\nThe corporate media thought they had Trump cornered over the rising cost of eggs, but the prices soon plummeted. Despite the media’s complaints, egg prices dropped by over 61% since Trump took office on Jan. 20, falling from a peak of $8 per dozen in early March.\n\nOn Trump’s first full day in office, Jan. 21, the average price of eggs was $6.41, by the end of the week, it had fallen to $2.57, according to Trade Economics. As they tried to shift blame for the price surge onto Trump, media outlets focused on the high cost of eggs, fact-checked his statements on the issue, and doubted his ability to reduce prices.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on March 7 that Democrats viewed the rising egg prices as a potential route to political recovery. The article also mentioned that the Department of Agriculture expected egg prices to rise by 41% in 2025, with Democrats blaming Trump for the increase.\n\nIn April, both CBS News and CNN accused Trump of lying about the decline in egg prices. CNN specifically criticized Trump for claiming that the wholesale cost of eggs had fallen by 94% since he took office. (RELATED: ‘Last Remnant Of Democratic Resistance’: Charlie Kirk Warns ‘Biggest Fight’ Of Trump’s Presidency Awaits)\n\nAs of June 2025, U.S. egg prices had significantly dropped from earlier peaks. The USDA’s Economic Research Service reported that the average retail price for eggs in April 2025 was $5.12 per dozen, down more than $1 from the March peak of $6.23 per dozen.\n\n4. MSNBC’s Ratings Significantly Dropped Following Trump’s Presidential Win\n\nMSNBC endured a tough period with a 53% drop in ratings since Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris. The network’s struggles worsened by an announcement from top hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who revealed a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which angered many loyal viewers.\n\nIn addition, Comcast announced plans to spin off MSNBC and CNBC, which further signal the declining value of both channels. At the moment, MSNBC is still experiencing ratings struggles, with viewership continuing to lag despite efforts to retool its programming after the departure of Reid in Feb. 2025. (RELATED: MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace Rants About How ‘Gutted’ She Felt After Trump Deported Alleged Gang Members)\n\nThe network’s ratings have dropped by 46% compared to the first 10 months of 2024. The network’s programming changes have yet to generate a significant boost in ratings.\n\n5. Media Reports On Iran Strikes Prove Premature As Officials Clarify Damage Was Too Early To Assess\n\nAfter the U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow, mainstream media outlets claimed that the attacks failed to eliminate the key components of the program and likely only delayed its progress by months. CNN downplayed the success of the bombings in Iran and quoted Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, who claimed the B-2 bombers caused “restricted” damage, as they did not drop “bunker-buster” bombs, calling the attack “an incomplete strike.”\n\nCNN further questioned whether the U.S. had achieved its goal, pointing to the survival of Iran’s Isfahan facility despite the destruction of Fordow. MSNBC echoed these concerns, with General Dan Caine saying that it was “way too early” to make a meaningful assessment of the damage.\n\nTrump criticized CNN and MSNBC for their coverage of the U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and called them “gutless losers.” The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the CIA and even the Iranian government contradicted a CNN report claiming that Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites caused minimal damage. While CNN cited a “low confidence” DIA assessment, multiple agencies and even Iranian sources confirmed that the strikes significantly impacted Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nU.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said it would be “almost impossible” for Iran to “resurrect” its nuclear program following the U.S. strikes on its facilities. (RELATED: Joy Reid Suggests Iran Having Nuclear Weapon Might Make Middle East ‘Calmer’)\n\n“It’s not even conceivable,” Witkoff said. “The conversion, destroying of the conversion facility, which not a lot of people are aware of, that stops the enrichment process in the beginning, and it’s needed to finish the enrichment process. Once you get to 90%, you now must metallicize the material, shape it into a round ball, a round metallic ball. That round metallic ball goes into the bomb. Without conversion, you can’t begin enrichment, and you can’t end enrichment in a successful weaponization. That was taken out.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And I blow away the reckless government spending on my DOGE subcommittee.”\n\nShe also took aim at former President Joe Biden, accusing Democrats of giving away “trillions to illegal aliens, the green new scam, and their NGO deep-state friends to destroy our country.”\n\n“But America elected Donald Trump,” she continued, “and now I’m working by his side to make America great again, and we are fighting to protect our faith, families, and freedom.”\n\nHer final sales pitch was delivered with another burst of gunfire: “Why enter to win this gun? Because in America, you can.”\n\nThe giveaway website echoes that nationalistic theme, promising “one lucky winner” the FN M249S PARA to celebrate the nation’s 250th birthday, which is … next year. \n\nGreene’s giveaway gun is a semiautomatic replica of the M249 SAW used by military and law enforcement, according to FN America, the manufacturer.

She did it to mark the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and again in August 2024, as a way to attack then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ commonsense gun policies.\n\nAnd the timing of her latest raffle isn’t a coincidence. Greene’s announcement drops just as her party faces backlash for rushing the passage of Trump’s cruel tax legislation.\n\nThat said, a high-dollar gun raffle over the long weekend is one way to shift the focus away from public policy and back to Greene’s preferred domain: tacky stunts.","summary":"Looking for something to do this Fourth of July?

Newsom has cast himself as a leading rival to President Donald Trump amid his second term in office. Several prominent Democrats are expected to jump into the race. While the primary is still more than two years away, potential candidates are already making early moves with the goal of giving themselves an advantage among Democratic primary voters.What to KnowThe South Carolina Democratic Party (SCDP) announced a multi-county tour with Newsom across some of the most \"economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable rural counties in South Carolina\" next week.Several of these counties have experienced \"hardship\" from job loss, wildfires and hurricanes, the SCDP wrote in a statement, adding that the rural areas have been \"left behind\" by Republican leaders in the state.It will also give Newsom the opportunity to engage with voters in what is likely to be an early-voting state.South Carolina voted first in the 2024 primary but has long been among the four first states to vote—along with Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. Whether the schedule may change remains unclear at this point.The statement, however, makes no mention of his potential 2028 ambitions.SCDP Chair Christale Spain wrote in a statement that Newsom \"leads the largest economy in America and the fourth largest in the world\" and is \"coming to meet folks in towns that have been hollowed out by decades of Republican control.\"\"This is about building partnerships, uplifting communities, and showing rural voters they aren't forgotten,\" Spain wrote.Gavin Newsom's Chance of Winning 2028 Primary—PollsNewsom has been among the leading candidates in most polls of the 2028 primary, along with former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.The latest Morning Consult poll of the potential 2028 field showed that Newsom's standing doubled after the Los Angeles protests over Trump's immigration policies and mass deportations. Eleven percent said they planned to support him, up from 5 percent in March. Still, 34 percent said they leaned toward Harris. Seven percent said they planned to vote for Buttigieg and Ocasio-Cortez.The poll surveyed 1,000 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents from June 13 to June 15, 2025.An Emerson College poll last month showed Newsom with 12 percent support, compared to 16 percent for Buttigieg, 13 percent for Harris and 7 percent for Ocasio-Cortez.The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from June 24 to June 25, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.What People Are SayingSpain wrote in the press release: \"Our strategy isn't about chasing cable news coverage, it's about showing up and building trust, town by town, county by county, that is our path back to power. We're proud of the gains we are making but we're even more focused on what's ahead.\"Newsom told The Wall Street Journal in June: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"What Happens NextTypically, most candidates do not begin announcing presidential runs until after the midterm elections.

Trump previously sued the company after an episode of 60 Minutes in which he claimed his then-presidential rival, Kamala Harris, was edited in a way to make her look better during the election.\n\nWhile many legal experts agreed Trump’s claims were baseless, the suit was taken seriously due in part to Paramount Global’s proposed merger with Skydance Media, which requires government approval.\n\nHowever, on Thursday night, July 3, Trump claimed the settlement was more than the stated $16 million. Speaking with reporters in a motorcade back to the White House following a rally in Iowa, the President said, per the The Washington Post, “We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that in advertising. So it’s a combination of 16 plus 16. So it’s like $32 [million]. Maybe $35 million.”\n\nTrump’s claims follow reports that Skydance Media CEO David Ellison has promised the President free advertising time on Paramount’s networks once the merger is finalized. On July 2, the New York Post cited an anonymous source claiming Ellison and Trump had reached a “side deal,” including PSAs and “other broadcast transmissions” valued between $15 million and $20 million.\n\nParamount Global has denied this, saying in a July 2 statement, “Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs. Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties. The material terms of the settlement agreement in principle are those disclosed by us yesterday.”\n\nThe statement from Trump’s legal team on July 1 also didn’t make any mention of potential PSAs and advertising as part of the agreement.\n\n“With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,” the statement read. “CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.”\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nDonald Trump Makes a Bold Claim About Paramount Lawsuit Settlement‘Jeopardy!’ Contestant Apologizes After Claiming to be First Champion Married to a Previous Winner‘Jeopardy!’ & ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Latest Ratings Reveal Big Swing‘Fire Country’ Season 4: Will Vince Die?

Musk has even threatened to bankroll primary challenges against GOP members of Congress who backed the bill. (RELATED: Big Tech Whistles Along While World Rides Trump-Musk Rollercoaster)\n\nBut political experts say his billions would be better spent buying him influence within the GOP’s existing party structure rather than birthing a viable new political force capable of challenging America’s entrenched two-party duopoly.\n\n“Third parties are like honeybees — they sting and then they die,” Georgetown political historian Michael Kazin told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!! Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025 \n\n American history is littered with third-party bids that flared brightly only to fizzle out, he explained. George Wallace carried five Southern states in 1968 and Ross Perot grabbed nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992 — yet neither cracked the two-party hold on the presidency.\n\nSuch efforts tend to hit a structural wall, Kazin said. The Electoral College’s winner-take-all math means a new party would need to win outright in multiple states to have any shot — a virtually impossible task without displacing one of the existing major parties. Congressional races are similarly unforgiving: first-past-the-post voting leaves little room for third party contenders except as spoilers.\n\nOnly Maine and Alaska run every statewide race under ranked-choice voting — with the District of Columbia recently mandating it too — even as sixteen mostly red states rushed to ban the system outright. Nearly one in twenty ballots cast in ranked-choice elections were improperly filled out, according to a March Political Behavior study that analyzed more than three million ballots cast in Alaska, Maine, New York City and San Francisco.\n\nKazin added that when outsider movements do break through, they usually start small.\n\n“Structurally, third parties would have to begin by showing strength in a state or region,” he said, calling it “a mistake … to try to run nationally the first time.” He pointed to the Populists of the 1890s — who won governorships and state legislatures across the Plains before petering out — as well as Wallace’s Dixie stronghold and Perot’s early focus on Texas as evidence that durable change, if it comes at all, builds locally before emerging on the national stage.\n\n If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025 \n\nYet the public appetite for an alternative is ravenous. Nearly two-thirds of Americans in a 2023 Gallup poll agreed that a “third major party” is needed — a level of frustration with the Republican-Democratic duopoly that has persisted for over a decade. But so far that discontent has never translated into a new party capable of upending the system.\n\nFor Musk, the challenge runs deeper than structural impediments. His brand of libertarianism — the philosophy centered on minimal government and maximum individual freedom — lacks the mass constituency needed to sustain a political movement.\n\nThe numbers are damning. Libertarian Party candidates have averaged just 1% of the presidential vote since 2000, with Gary Johnson’s 3.3% showing in 2016 being an outlier. Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, arguably the Senate’s most libertarian member, finished fifth in the 2016 Iowa caucuses before dropping out — a humbling reminder that even the state that elected him also sent Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell to Washington. (RELATED: More Voters Deciding They’d Rather Be Called Anything But A Democrat)\n\n“Libertarianism was arguably the core ideology about the party under Ronald Reagan … Trump has changed the Republican Party,” Kazin said.\n\n Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 \n\nYet Musk’s money could still matter enormously within the existing party structure. The Senate Leadership Fund has shown how targeted cash can redraw a primary map; the super PAC poured almost $8 million into Alabama’s 2017 special election to prop up former Sen. Luther Strange over hard-right challengers and later spent roughly $5 million in 2022 to shield centrist Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski from a Trump-backed insurgent, according to The Washington Post — evidence that with enough money, a donor can bend the GOP to his will without resorting to a breakaway party.\n\nMoney isn’t a surefire way to win elections, however. Musk poured a record-breaking $22 million into Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race in April — money that supported conservative Brad Schimel but still couldn’t stop liberal Judge Susan Crawford from winning by almost nine points. University of Wisconsin political scientist Barry Burden told the Post that Musk’s presence galvanized liberal turnout, arguing a hypothetical third party should “draw on [Musk’s] resources but keep him in the background.”\n\nDemocrats learned the same bitter lesson in 2024. OpenSecrets data shows former Vice President Kamala Harris over $1 billion — yet Trump still landed a decisive Electoral College victory and swept every swing state with less than half the campaign funds.\n\nBut campaign finance law could further complicate the future of the “America Party.”\n\nBradley Smith, a former chair of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), told CNN that “there is some case law suggesting that some of the organizational activities of a party and starting a party can be funded with larger contributions, until it actually qualifies for party status under the election commission regulations.”\n\n“You can fund super PACs all you want,” he said. “But you can’t fund a political party, as a strange part of American law.”\n\nUltimately, Kazin suggested Musk’s flirtation with a third-party run would likely remain more rhetorical than practical.\n\n“The idea that he, by himself, is going to be able to found a party which could make a difference — yeah, it seems fanciful to me,” Kazin said, adding that “a lot of people think he’s somewhat foreign. I think that probably counts against him as well, especially among conservatives who style themselves to be great American patriots.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Since she released Invasion of Privacy seven years ago, they have continued to support every tune she has shared – and there have been quite a lot of them.\n\nThe Grammy winner recently dropped the brand new single \"Outside\" and finally announced that her second full-length effort, Am I the Drama?, is coming in September. All the excitement around not just a just-shared cut, but also a forthcoming album has helped \"Outside\" become a powerful seller and streamer, bringing Cardi back to No. 1 on multiple U.S.-based charts this week.\n\n“Outside” Debuts at No. 1 on Five Charts\n\nIn America, the star rules five Billboard tallies as \"Outside\" opens in first place on rankings dedicated to both pure purchases and streaming activity, as interest in the tune was incredibly high from the moment it arrived. \"Outside\" leads the Digital Song Sales, R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales, and Rap Digital Song Sales charts, as well as both the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs and Rap Streaming Songs tallies.\n\nCardi’ B’s History of Hitting No. 1\n\nCardi has already reached No. 1 on all of these lists in the past – multiple times, in fact – though the number of leaders she has accrued differs widely from one ranking to the next. She has earned half a dozen rulers on the streaming tallies, eight No. 1s on the all-genre Digital Song Sales chart, 13 No. 1s on the Rap Digital Song Sales ranking, and 16 smashes on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales roster.\n\nThe Bestselling Song in America\n\nLuminate reports that in its first tracking frame, \"Outside\" sold a little more than 13,600 copies. It is the only song in America this week to have sold 10,000 or more copies at once, easily becoming the standout bestseller in the nation.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSeveral New Top 10 Starts\n\nIn addition to the five Billboard rankings where \"Outside\" opens at No. 1, the single also launches on nine other lists, and begins its time inside the top 10 on several of them. That roundup includes both the Streaming Songs chart and the Hot 100, where Cardi B earns her lucky thirteenth top 10 as \"Outside\" comes inside at No. 10.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Cardi B’s “Outside” debuts at No. 1 on five U.S. Billboard charts, becoming both a strong seller and a huge hit on streaming platforms simultaneously.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/07/04/cardi-bs-new-single-dominates-multiple-charts-as-it-debuts/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6867056dfe253b2e05a33b60/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 14:15:00","author":"Andrew Harnik,Hugh McIntyre,Senior Contributor","authors":["Andrew Harnik","Hugh McIntyre","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.23},{"id":338264530,"title":"Just half of Democrats consider themselves patriots, compared to 91% of Republicans, poll reveals","text":"Red, white and blue is becoming red vs. blue.\n\nAs Americans celebrate Independence Day, patriotism itself is becoming a source of division, according to a new poll shared exclusively with The Post.\n\nThe survey conducted by New Jersey-based GOP firm National Research Inc., found that 91% of self-identified Republicans call themselves patriots, compared to just 50% of Democrats.\n\nThe poll showed a near-identical schism among 2024 voters, with 90% of those who backed President Trump identifying as patriots compared to 55% of former Vice President Kamala Harris supporters.\n\nAmong self-described conservatives, 87% deemed themselves a patriot, compared to 51% of liberals, per the poll.\n\nNational Research founder Adam Geller, a Republican pollster and strategist whose resume includes work for Trump’s 2016 campaign, told The Post that while the results may stem in part from “a little leftover saltiness” from the election, “we need to have a country where even if you don’t love the president, you’re still proud to be an American — you still hold those values.”\n\nGeller’s findings mirror other polls about national sentiment. \n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, just 36% of Democrats called themselves “extremely” or “very” proud to be an American, plummeting from 62% in 2024 and the lowest level among the demographic this century.\n\nJust over half (53%) of independents said they were extremely or very proud to be American, down seven percentage points from last year.\n\nRepublican pride in the US spiked by seven percentage points to 92%.\n\nOverall, a record low 58% of respondents were extremely (41%) or very (17%) proud to be an American, a nine-point dip from last year.\n\nBack in January of 2001, Gallup gauged that 87% of US adults were very or extremely proud, a figure that jumped to 91% after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nGallup also determined that Gen Z had the least amount of national pride, with only 41% calling themselves very or extremely proud to be an American, compared to 58% of Millennials, 71% of Generation X and 75% of Baby Boomers.\n\n“It is a surprising finding, and sobering,” Geller said. “It’s a little breathtaking.”\n\n“We’ve established the fact that on average the left is about 50% [proud of America]. Why? What is it? That’s the part I don’t know yet,” he said. “To me the next step is understanding what is going on in our country right now.”\n\nGeller’s poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters June 21-23 with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Gallup poll surveyed 1,000 adults June 2-19 with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.0 percentage points.","summary":"Red, white and blue is becoming red vs. blue.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/04/us-news/just-half-of-democrats-consider-themselves-patriots-shock-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107586409.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NNQR2YNT-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-04 14:02:04","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.58}]}
