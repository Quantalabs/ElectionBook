Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan Sunday, telling “This Week” guest host Jonathan Karl she was working for her state.\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised Whitmer, a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2028 presidential election, during a Wednesday meeting in the Oval Office, saying she did an “an excellent job” and describing her as “a great person,” Fox News reported. Smith said Whitmer’s critics were “ridiculous” during a wide-ranging interview on “This Week.”\n\nI can’t get over this image of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer shielding herself from cameras in the Oval Office this past week.\nWhitmer’s spokesperson said she was at the White House to meet with President Trump about Michigan matters and didn’t know she would be walking… pic.twitter.com/n8nIOsja6C\n— Yashar Ali (@yashar) April 12, 2025\n\n“She’s the governor of Michigan. She has no choice but to do that, and anybody that thinks otherwise is just being foolish and immature and childish,” Smith said. “The fact is she’s the governor of a state in the United States of America. You need to do business with the federal government. He’s the president of the United States, you don’t get to circumvent him. So, as a result, you have to be an adult in the room and be prepared to do business and anybody who would encourage her to do otherwise is just being utterly ridiculous.”\n\nSmith also tore into Democrats as well, saying Trump won the 2024 elections due to the “rudderless” party having “no muscle whatsoever.”\n\n“He seems very convincing in letting people know what he feels in getting them to see his way of thinking, but I think it’s a product, a by-product, rather, of the Democratic Party and the fact they don’t seem to have any mission, any vision, any kind of leadership,” Smith told Karl. “They seem rudderless, to say the least, and now it’s at a point where they’re getting mocked religiously.”\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer spotted in the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/BmXx71J1qE\n— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) April 9, 2025\n\n“And so, as a result of that, you’re going to look at him and, regardless of the troubles you think he might bring forth, unless things become disastrous economically, the fact of the matter is the American people have already said during the last election he’s a bit more normal or closer to normal than the Democratic Party and that’s where the real problem lies,” Smith continued. “It might be a two-party system but there’s only one party running this country right now, because the Democrats have no muscle whatsoever.”\n\nThe Trump campaign ran ads in 2024 featuring Vice President Kamala Harris discussing how she pushed “behind the scenes” for transgender prisoners to receive sex changes, while Trump said he supported banning biological men from competing in women’s sports during an Oct. 16 town hall moderated by Fox News host Harris Faulkner. Smith said Democrats were talking about issues that have nothing to do with Americans’ concerns.\n\nGov.

They talk and they talk and they talk, but what can they do?” Smith asked Karl. “They position themselves to do absolutely nothing.”\n\n“I didn’t hear anything about tariffs from the Democrats before the election. Trump had been preaching about this for the longest time,” Smith continued. “The way people decry his strategy, he’s been bloviating about that. They said nothing about it. Instead, they talked about everything from woke culture to cancel culture to abortion rights and all of this other stuff, but that wasn’t going to win the election and that’s what we have to look at. What is it going to take to get the job done? That’s why somebody who is a sports analyst, for cryin’ out loud, is in the daggone polls. It’s not somebody bigger than me, it’s an indictment against the Democratic Party that doesn’t have leadership and doesn’t have a vision, and it’s sad.”\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.\n\nLast weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel.\n\nThe man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration.\n\nTo Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.\n\n“One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.\n\nThe tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology.\n\n“I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry.\n\n“The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.”\n\nThe biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington.\n\nZuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors.\n\nTrump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe.\n\nIt's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk.\n\nSanta Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold.\n\n“We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.”\n\nThe valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems.\n\nThat has persisted even as the tech industry has changed.\n\nThe tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers’ dreams of changing the world for the better. Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth.\n\nEntrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years.\n\n“Now,” she said, “if you’re part of a startup, you’re hoping you’ll be absorbed in a way that’s profitable.”\n\nEven before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries.\n\n“I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said.\n\nSylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden.\n\n“I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.”\n\nIt is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration.\n\nAt first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs.\n\nBut it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives.\n\n“The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.”\n\n“Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.”\n\nKamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift.\n\n“The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles and video journalist Haven Daley contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

In a single stroke, Trump imposed a 90-day freeze on all aid programs. The executive order that imposed the freeze stated that these programs would be reviewed to ensure “programmatic efficiencies” and “consistency with United States foreign policy.” Trump’s initial order was followed four days later (January 24) by a memo from the State Department ordering officials at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to stop all projects and “new obligations of funding.” Since then, 83 percent of all programs have been eliminated, while the remaining 17 percent have been taken under the direct purview of the U.S. State Department. Meanwhile, officials from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have conducted several spot inspections and raids, which have been criticized as unconstitutional but have continued uninterrupted at USAID and other institutions, including the U.S. Institute for Peace. Many of these institutions and programs have also since been shut down. While the State Department has clarified that it will approve waivers on humanitarian grounds, only a few programs, including assistance to Israel, have been allowed to continue. Anatomy of a Shutdown Washington’s suspension of foreign aid and assistance has been met with mixed reactions, abroad and at home. The Democratic Party, in disarray since Kamala Harris lost the presidential election last November, has opposed the gutting of any foreign assistance. Critics contend that the president has no power to bypass congressional approval in enforcing such measures and that the agency tasked with those measures, headed by Elon Musk, a man who enjoys federal tax subsidies, is violating the Constitution. Since Trump’s assumption, DOGE, which is not an officially mandated body, has accessed personnel data, ostensibly to ensure compliance with Trump’s “America First” policy and “curb wasteful spending.” In a press release after it halted USAID operations, the State Department declared that ensuring conformity with the president’s mandate, and auditing how taxpayer money is being spent abroad, is no longer an option but a moral imperative. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that in the future, aid programs should be able to address three questions: “Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?” On February 3, Rubio was appointed as acting administrator at USAID. Around that time, officials confirmed the agency would be merged with the State Department – a move critics say will undermine its independence. Samantha Power, the head of USAID under Joe Biden, has been openly critical of these developments. In a spate of interviews, she argued that USAID operations have saved countless lives in the developing world. In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, she wrote that its closure would be “a win for autocrats everywhere.” The USAID Withdrawal in South Asia Despite the State Department’s clarification, the suspension has impacted aid operations in the most vulnerable regions, including South Asia. In Nepal, projects to do with disease surveillance, malnutrition, and other critical health issues have stopped. According to one report, the suspension in Nepal could affect the operation of U.N. agencies that were financing these projects. Pakistan and Bangladesh are reeling from multiple crises; USAID held a significant presence in both countries. Though not as badly affected, India’s social sector has also unraveled. Sri Lanka and Maldives, reliant on USAID assistance, are bracing for similar impacts. It's not just civil society and the development sector that have been left in the dark. In Sri Lanka, parliamentary committees have relied on technical expertise from USAID. In a recent interview, opposition parliamentarian Harsha de Silva, who chairs the country’s Committee on Public Finance, admitted that while it was the government’s responsibility to ensure “we have high quality analysts,” they have depended on foreign assistance. Whether the government can resolve this is left to be seen. While Cabinet Spokesperson Nalinda Jayatissa said the Sri Lankan government would continue USAID projects, if necessary with alternative funding, how such funds will be secured has not been mapped out. In certain cases, humanitarian waivers have come into play. U.S. funding for certain projects, including a $121 million initiative for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, has been allowed. On the other hand, it is unclear how these programs will run without proper personnel to oversee them. For the Trump administration, the USAID shutdown is part of a broader effort to align foreign aid with U.S. foreign policy and national interests. Supporters of the move claim that the organization has been funneling taxpayer money to “woke” causes, including Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), gender, and climate resilience. In one of many such “disclosures,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Must accused USAID of having disbursed funds for, among other things, “the expansion of atheism in Nepal” through the State Department. The Heritage Foundation-authored Project 2025, which some see as the basis for Trump’s agenda, devoted a chapter to USAID, pointing out that it was overhauled during the first Trump presidency but that under Biden it reverted to the old model of making “scores of poor countries underdeveloped and dependent on aid.” Many of these allegations have been echoed by nationalist-populist politicians in the Global South, including in Sri Lanka, as well as left-wing critics of U.S. and Western aid. Opponents of Trump’s move, on the other hand, contend that by gutting USAID, the United States stands to lose more than goodwill and influence in the developing world; they argue that it will empower China and Russia, as well as authoritarian leaders around the world. In the days after the USAID shutdown, statements from Russia and Belarus, and the likes of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, to say nothing of politicians in countries like Sri Lanka, appeared relieved and exultant at the gutting. On X, both Elon Musk and Trump tweeted details about projects that USAID supported, including one in Sri Lanka to educate journalists on “gender pronouns.” Many of these disclosures have since been shown to be false or misleading, including by local media. Still, that has not stopped politicians from recycling claims critical of such organizations. This has been true in Sri Lanka, where politicians have frequently linked foreign assistance with “regime change,” and in Bangladesh, where, according to one State Department official, USAID was involved with political changes last year – though Trump himself has since denied such claims. The situation has become particularly complex in Myanmar, where in the aftermath of the recent earthquake employees from USAID were dispatched for humanitarian work, only to be informed of their dismissal and termination while going about their work. Fueling Nationalist Narratives in Sri Lanka In the days following the initial USAID stop order, Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan (Sinhala) nationalist ex-MP, tweeted his support for Trump’s decision. In his book “Nine: The Hidden Story,” published in 2023, Weerawansa accused a host of actors, including an ambassador, of having helped with then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s removal from power in 2022. Weerawansa went as far as to accuse USAID of conspiring to reduce the country’s population. He has since regularly been retweeting right-wing figureheads on Twitter, including Elon Musk himself. Namal Rajapaksa, Gotabaya’s nephew and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son, soon joined these harangues, penning a long tweet against USAID and calling for a probe into local NGOs. According to a Sri Lankan journalist, however, these parliamentarians made use of USAID funding for government projects when they were in power. To be fair, of course, USAID has not entirely been free from controversy. When then-President John F. Kennedy initiated it through an executive order in 1961, Washington was engaged in a battle of propaganda with the Soviet Union. USAID was one of several outfits, including the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress, that aimed on the one hand at projecting to other countries, mainly postcolonial societies in Latin and Central America, Africa, and Asia, a positive, benevolent image of the United States, and on the other ensuring economic and political stability in states that seemed vulnerable to communism. No doubt USAID, like all foreign government funding, has been hard to extract from the quagmire of geopolitics. During the Cold War, such institutions helped achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives, particularly in regions like Latin America. However, the Trump administration’s argument is that while billions of dollars have been spent on spreading “American values,” this has not helped project American power. “It was always about promoting an agenda,” Rathindra Kuruwita, a Sri Lankan international relations analyst, said. “Trump has made the geopolitical underside of U.S. aid more transparent.” While the politics and geopolitics of USAID remain debated, the humanitarian fallout from its shutdown continues. In regions like South Asia, development sector organizations that were working with marginalized communities, including sexual minorities, relied on USAID funding. Because of the shutdown, they have all been forced to lay off staff, or worse, wrap up operations altogether. In a newspaper interview, a Sri Lankan transgender activist stated that, given Trump’s policies, they did not expect a waiver after the 90-day period. It goes without saying that alternative funding for such organizations will be hard to come by. As a Sri Lankan analyst observed, “this shows how dangerous it was to become complacent about U.S. government funding and to not look into other sources.” In fact, such funding is increasingly being seen as a two-edged sword. On the one hand, in countries like Sri Lanka, U.S. government involvement in advocacy for gender rights, climate resilience, and democratic governance has been criticized as an intrusion on sovereignty or an attempt at undermining “national culture.” On the other, in the United States, such funding has been viewed as inimical to U.S. interests. On both counts, activism on gender, minority, and climate issues will suffer; as one activist noted, “smaller agencies that were not able to diversify their funding will take the bigger hit.” An Inside Perspective Since Trump’s executive order and subsequent cancellation, USAID employees have faced a dilemma over whether to obey instructions and halt projects or not. While some in the agency have opposed the shutdown, they have so far been powerless to stop it. USAID employees in the United States and outside have, despite the pressure on them, voiced concerns about what they view as a capitulation by the U.S. to interest groups and lobbies. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a USAID employee who was based in Sri Lanka questioned the rationale for Trump’s orders. While Musk has supported the gutting as a means of promoting transparency on government spending, the employee said that “in fact, the data on USAID funding was available online, including on the Congressional Research Services website.” However, the employee said that the Trump administration has “developed and perfected a robust and successful communications ecosystem which has enabled disinformation on USAID to be amplified, especially on Elon Musk’s platforms.” Democrats, who are currently in opposition, lack an effective communications strategy to counter this. The USAID employee also questioned the motives behind these decisions, speculating whether they were part of a bigger effort by Musk to preempt investigations into his companies, “including SpaceX and Starlink,” which have long benefited from government subsidies. Moreover, by terminating contracts without thinking of replacements, “the government is making the work of the U.S. State Department even harder,” the employee said, contradicting its own objective of making government leaner and more efficient. “On the one hand, Trump is claiming credit for revealing information on USAID grants, which was already online before,” the employee argued. “On the other, he and Musk are demonizing employees for wasting funds in a context where federal workers pay taxes and billionaires find so many ways of avoiding it.” All these arguments are being watched closely in developing countries, including Sri Lanka. “Today, the view is that the United States has damaged its international credibility. Even if USAID resumes tomorrow, how can we assure our partners in the Global South we will not break their trust again?” the USAID employee said. This can impact the governments of poor countries. “In Sri Lanka, nationalist politicians can use Trump’s policies to discredit the current government.” This is becoming more likely. Already, social media posts and articles linking USAID funding to important officials, including the prime minister herself, are making the rounds. Finally, the official criticized the view that USAID does not serve American interests, pointing out that USAID agriculture projects have benefited American farmers, and that the suspensions will adversely affect these stakeholders. Perhaps the most important takeaway from these developments is the extent to which the domestic consensus on U.S. foreign aid has ruptured. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have their international aid organizations. The International Republican Institution (IRI), affiliated with the Republican Party, has expanded its presence across countries like Bangladesh. Yet while the Democratic Party-affiliated National Democratic Institute is still online, the IRI website has been disabled – supposedly to “mitigate expenses.” In the meantime, the National Endowment for Democracy, created during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, has come under attack by Musk for being a “scam.” Filling the Gap The question remains as to who will step forward to fill the gap left behind by these policy turnarounds. Western liberal commentators argue that China and Russia will take up the mantle, weakening the United States’ soft power in the Global South. Some even suggest that this will make the U.S. weaker. However, such a scenario remains unlikely for at least two reasons. First, as an economic and business analyst in Sri Lanka noted, “China may not want to devote much of their budget to aid when confronted with domestic economic challenges.” While China’s overseas aid has increased since 2009 – reaching, according to one source, more than $3 billion last year – this has been a fraction of what the U.S. has been able to muster, which according to PEW, came to more than $70 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, the EU allocated $1.9 billion for its humanitarian budget this year, against the backdrop of “decreased cooperation funding.” Second, despite being a key development partner in the Global South, China holds different positions on issues like human rights, media freedom, and good governance, which have long been seen as the mainstay of Western government funding. The flurry of responses by Sri Lankan journalists to reports of a media agreement between Sri Lanka and China, along with one media organization’s critique of Beijing’s attitude to journalists, indicates that media advocacy groups in such countries tend to prefer U.S. aid to agreements with other countries. Given the blowback against USAID’s activities in the Sri Lankan media landscape, however, it remains debatable whether this will continue. Some commentators argue that China has more potential in meeting the shortfall in U.N. organizations like the World Health Organization, which have a significant presence in South Asia and Africa. Doing so would certainly be in China’s interest, though it could reinforce accusations that such organizations have become a part of Beijing’s agenda. On the other hand, both India’s and China’s quick response to the Myanmar earthquake, coupled with Rubio’s recent declaration that the U.S. can no longer “bear the burden of providing the majority of global humanitarian aid,” means that other countries will have to reassess their funding commitments. It is significant that Rubio specifically mentioned China and India as countries that should pitch in to do humanitarian work. Europe can be pointed out as another possible alternative, even if, given the political compulsions there, it is doubtful whether they will be able to match the United States’ aid spending capacity. If anything, it is likely that Europe will offset increased defense expenditures by cuts to foreign aid: the United Kingdom, for instance, will slash foreign aid to 0.3 percent of Gross National Income from 2027, a move academics and policymakers have criticized. Yet even as Europe appears to be bracing for foreign aid cuts, there are signs that some countries are moving in to fill the gaps left behind by the USAID suspensions. Recently, for instance, the Sri Lanka Police launched a new training program on LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion. The program, the first-ever in the history of the Sri Lanka Police, commenced in the presence and under the patronage of the Dutch ambassador in Colombo. Others point out that countries within the Global South themselves can, as one journalist put it, “build an organic civil society more responsive to the needs of our societies.” The Future: A Question Mark? All this underlines a fundamental though uncomfortable truth for civil society organizations, which is that competition for funding will now be more intense than before. This is especially true of South Asia, where funding shortfalls were a problem even before the USAID freeze, and it will impact even those CSOs that had a diverse donor portfolio. More than anything, these developments call into question the United States’ claim of being a reliable partner in the region, seen as an indispensable plank in Washington’s Indo-Pacific policy. How the Trump administration can balance its aggressive foreign policy posturing with the need to project a positive image of itself across the Global South remains to be seen. The recent arrival of the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Sri Lanka, with the aim of strengthening security partnerships between the two countries, shows that the U.S. military-security establishment is still very much focused on the region. The question can be asked as to whether the withdrawal of foreign aid and assistance initiatives will have an impact on U.S] activities across the Indo-Pacific, particularly in small states like Sri Lanka. At the same time, the funding freeze has made civil society in countries like Sri Lanka aware of the need to break away from the dependency that U.S. funding institutionalized in the first place. One activist, interviewed by a local newspaper, said that foreign funding tends to be “counterproductive” in “thinking creatively” and “responding to ground realities.” There is no doubt that the withdrawal of aid has made vulnerable communities who relied on such programs insecure, in a context where nationalist and conservative forces frame such groups as handmaidens of Western agenda. Yet there is also no doubt that, for a long time, even local activists have felt foreign funding benefits a host of intermediaries, resource personnel, and consultants, rather than those for whom such funding is intended. Things were far from perfect before the freeze. The Trump administration’s claim that USAID entrenched contractors, rather than actual people, is not wholly false. At the same time, as Jake Johnston tweeted, the result of the USAID shutdown will be to direct aid toward political objectives: in effect, to “make political interventionism an even more explicit aim of U.S. foreign assistance.” In regions like South Asia, hardly a stranger to electoral shifts, this is likely to have broad ramifications in the future.","summary":"Donald Trump’s gutting of the American aid agency has adversely impacted humanitarian work in countries like Sri Lanka – while calling into question the reliability of Western foreign aid in the Global South.","url":"https://thediplomat.com/2025/04/the-usaid-freeze-a-view-from-sri-lanka-and-the-global-south/","image":"https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-04-11-202506.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 20:21:00","author":"Omar Rajarathnam,Uditha Devapriya","authors":["Omar Rajarathnam","Uditha Devapriya"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":310782246,"title":"Stephen A. Smith insists ‘I have no choice’ but to consider presidential run as pastor encourages him","text":"Well, that’s a take. \n\nESPN host Stephen A. Smith said Sunday that he might not have a choice but to run for president in 2028 if the Democrats fail to produce someone better. \n\nThe ESPN “First Take” host claimed that he’s been inundated with requests to contemplate a presidential run that he has to leave that option on the table. \n\n“I have no choice because I’ve had elected officials, and I’m not going to give their names, elected officials coming up to me,” Smith told ABC News’ “This Week” Sunday. \n\n“I’ve had folks that got a lot of money, billionaires and others that have talked to me about exploratory committees and things of that nature,” he added. “I’m not a politician. I’ve never had a desire to be a politician.”\n\nSmith gained national prominence for his fiery hot takes on sports but, over recent years, has frequently waded into politics, criticizing President Trump and Democrats for losing to him. \n\nDespite flirting with a 2028 bid, Smith admitted that he would like to see someone with the necessary experience step up. \n\n“I would hope somebody else would step up that’s more qualified than me, but if it has to come down to me, it is something I would consider,” he added.\n\nLast week, the sports host drew headlines for declaring that he will “no longer close the door” on a possible presidential run. \n\n“Here’s the reality: People, literally people, have walked up to me, including my own pastor, for crying out loud, who has said to me, ‘You don’t know what God has planned for you,'” Smith claimed, adding that his pastor told him to respect “the people who believe” in him. \n\nDuring the 2024 election, Smith voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, though he later admitted to feeling like a “fool” because the ex-veep got the Dem nod without a primary.\n\nDespite his fierce criticism of Democrats, Smith is not thrilled with Trump.\n\n“I don’t like what I’m seeing, but I’m not surprised. I mean, this whole tariff war situation is utterly ridiculous,” he lamented. “He should have immediately targeted China and not every nation on the planet, for crying out loud.”\n\n“There doesn’t appear to be a plan. Let’s be, let’s be very, very clear about that,” he added. “But in the end, you know, what you have to applaud them for is for trying something.”\n\nSmith’s pet peeve with Democrats is that “they talk and they talk and they talk” but fail to achieve anything. \n\n“It’s an indictment against a Democratic Party that doesn’t have leadership,” he argued. “It doesn’t have a vision.”\n\nThe 2028 race is shaping up to be the first presidential contest in about a decade without an incumbent running on either side of the aisle, creating a massive opening for Democrats and Republicans alike. \n\nTrump has openly cast doubt on that, suggesting that he may pursue a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment forbidding him from running.\n\n“If any Republican supports that, I don’t want to hear a word out of their mouth ever again about following the Constitution,” Smith chided. \n\n“That’s what they’ve been living off for years. And then you’re talking about circumventing the 22nd Amendment, and you think that’s cool? No way.”","summary":"ESPN host Stephen A.

It remains unclear whether the fire was politically or antisemitically motivated.\n“While the investigation is ongoing, the State Police is prepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson,” the agency stated.\nNo details have been released about how many of the couple’s four children were present in the home at the time of the incident.\nWho is Josh Shapiro?\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s third Jewish governor, is a rising figure in the Democratic Party. He was reportedly on the shortlist for Kamala Harris’ running mate during the 2024 presidential election and has fielded questions about a future White House run.\nSince October 7, 2023—when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israeli border communities, killing 1,200 people—Shapiro has faced criticism from pro-Palestinian groups due to his staunch pro-Israel stance. Antisemitic incidents in the U.S. have surged since that time, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting record-high levels of such incidents in the year that followed.\nIn a separate 2023 incident, a Pennsylvania man was arrested and charged for threatening to assault Shapiro.\nPassover at the Shapiro Residence\nJust hours before the fire, the Shapiro family was observing the start of Passover. The holiday, which began at sundown on April 12 and ends at sundown on April 20, commemorates the Hebrews’ liberation from slavery in Egypt and the sparing of the Israelites’ firstborn during the biblical plagues.\nIn a message posted at 3 p.m. on the day of the fire, Shapiro wrote: “From the Shapiro family's Seder table to yours, happy Passover and Chag Pesach Sameach!”\nLike many Jewish families, the Shapiros held a traditional seder meal, which includes storytelling, singing, special foods, and ritual wine-drinking.\nState Police Announce $10,000 Reward\nThe arson investigation is being conducted as a “multi-agency” effort, according to law enforcement.

Crews evacuated the family and no one was injured. While the investigation was ongoing, state police say they are “prepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson.”\n\n“The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was on the scene and while they worked to put out the fire, we were evacuated from the Residence safely by Pennsylvania State Police and assisted by Capitol Police,” Shapiro said in a post on X. “Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished.”\n\nShapiro and his wife, Lori, have four children. \n\nThe fire broke out overnight on the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which Shapiro and his family had celebrated at the governor's official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg. Shapiro had shared a photo of his family’s Seder table just hours prior.\n\nPolice gave no other details about the cause.\n\nThe fire caused a “significant amount of damage” to a portion of the residence, state police said. Shapiro was in a different part of the residence when the fire was lit.\n\nAs of Sunday, fire damage is still visible on the residence’s south side, primarily to a large room often used for entertaining crowds and art displays. There was still a police presence early Sunday afternoon as yellow tape cordoned off an alleyway and an officer led a dog outside a iron security fence.\n\nState police are leading a multiagency investigation.

Eric Schmitt believes censors are ‘on the run’","text":"The hearing wasn’t halfway through when the chairman walked away.\n\nInside the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room earlier this month, the head of the subcommittee on the Constitution, Sen. Eric Schmitt, stepped out as testimony on “the censorship industrial complex” was ongoing. He had an excuse: The Senate was voting on the nomination of Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, author of the anti-lockdown Great Barrington Declaration and later a plaintiff alleging government censorship in the lawsuit Missouri v. Biden, to lead the National Institutes of Health.\n\nQuipped the chairman, now back behind the dais, “Who was the attorney general leading that?” Answering his own question about the lawsuit, he added, “Oh yeah, his name was Eric Schmitt. My glory days I suppose.” Schmitt had just voted to confirm his old client.\n\nIt was “the irony of all ironies,” and it was more evidence that the censors “are on the run,” Schmitt tells RealClearPolitics. His lawsuit, the one that temporarily blocked the Biden administration from communicating with social media companies, “was playing defense.” Those once censored are now ascendent, Republicans are now the party of free speech, “and now we are playing offense.” At least, according to Schmitt.\n\nAnother moment of ironic levity from the hearing:\n\n“Mr. Chairman, just for the record when I was here alone, I was getting drunk with power,” joked Sen. Cory Booker, the Democrat who presided over the committee in Schmitt’s absence.\n\n“Thank you for showing restraint,” the Missouri Republican replied.\n\nThe unspoken, and perhaps unrealized, subtext of the moment: The right is still furious that the left didn’t show any such restraint when the world went mad, allowing and facilitating what Schmitt describes as “the darkness that enveloped a core tenet of our American experiment.” Yes, the pandemic is over, but there won’t be any amnesty for infringing on free speech.\n\n“This instinct that is on the left hasn’t gone away,” Schmitt says of the temptation to curb free speech. The difference, as he sees it, is that his opponents “just have fewer levers of power to do it.” Fast forward four years, he predicts, and another Democrat “will try to do it again.” His goal, then, is to shatter the aforementioned censorship industrial complex and scatter it to the winds. But first Republicans must define it. Democrats insist it does not exist.\n\nThe term was coined by author Michael Shellenberger to describe a shadowy network of ideologically aligned academics, Big Tech companies, NGOs, and government agencies, each with the stated goal of defending the democratic process but with the effect of undermining it. Their byword is “misinformation.” The commonality? Taxpayer funding. An example: The National Science Foundation awarded no less than 64 grants worth $31.8 million to countering “misinformation” and “disinformation.”\n\nSchmitt likens it to nothing less than “a second state,” an apparatus that is “faceless” but motivated by “collective purpose,” a system with “dispersed power” but collective purpose operating beyond “the limits and liberties of our Constitution.” Stories of abuse come to hand easily for Republicans. Chafing under the yoke of alleged censorship has become intertwined with the core of their party identity.\n\nWhen the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020, detailing the overseas business dealings of the Biden family, they were not heralded as the New York Times had been in 1971 when that paper put the Pentagon Papers on the front page. Instead, they were censored.\n\nThe Stanford Internet Observatory, a now-defunct academic outfit funded by taxpayer dollars for the study of “abuse in current information technologies,” cautioned that the basis of the story might be part of a “hack-and-leak” operation. The Aspen Institute, which received taxpayer dollars, had held a “tabletop” exercise ahead of the election that year, attended by Facebook and Twitter executives, to prepare for the possibility of foreign interference. NewsGuard, a company that purports to evaluate the credibility of news outlets and previously received taxpayer dollars, dismissed the laptop story as “a hoax perpetrated by the Russians.”\n\nTwitter listened. Under pressure from the FBI and Biden administration, the social media giant locked the account of the New York Post. Journalists who simply shared the story, like Jake Sherman, then of Politico, were suspended from the website until they deleted their tweets. Even Kayleigh McEnany, spokesman for the president, was similarly muzzled – during an election year no less.\n\nBut what was dismissed as a hoax was verified by the federal government. Years later, that is. Mum during the censorship of the New York Post, the Department of Justice prosecutors introduced the laptop as evidence in their case against Hunter Biden. The FBI had the laptop in their possession for more than a year. “They knew it was real, and they were working with these companies so that when this came out, it would be dismissed,” Schmitt complains.\n\nIt was not just one story. Opposition to medical face coverings, or support for the Wuhan lab leak theory, or objection to the vaccine mandate – and any number of lingering COVID controversies – all trigger an avalanche of raw anecdotes of censorship by social media at the behest of a shadowy network in the ether – funded by a bubbling glut of money built on what George Washington University Law professor Jonathan Turley calls a “a cottage industry of disinformation experts.”\n\nFree speech was “commoditized,” censorship was “monetized,” and partisan advantage was taken often in the name of public health. “Suddenly, the market was awash with money for those who could offer systems or staff to combat viewpoints deemed misleading or false,” Turley testified.\n\nOrganizations such as NewsGuard and a British-based NGO called the Global Disinformation Index thrived. Both received federal funding, both leaned on Big Tech to deplatform alternate voices, and both launched pressure campaigns to push advertisers away from publications that even gave voice to dissent on anything from the election to the pandemic. It was, conservatives allege, government censorship with extra steps. Other times, there was a direct line.\n\nBiden spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters as much. She admitted the administration was actively flagging what they saw as problematic posts for Facebook to remove. “It is life and death,” Psaki told RCP in July of 2021. “It is a public health issue in the country.” Schmitt came to a different conclusion: “It just didn’t feel like America.”\n\nAs Missouri AG, he filed suit in May of 2022, alleging that the Biden administration was colluding with Big Tech companies to censor and suppress free speech, related not just to public health information but also to the previous election. “I was just honestly shocked,” he recalls, “that it could take hold in America like it has over the last five years.”\n\nIt was never supposed to be this way, he says as he talks fondly about a time when “liberals used to believe in free speech.” There was the political correctness in the 1990s when Schmitt was a law student, and while that was an attempt to “narrow the bandwidth of what was acceptable,” he never believed that the American mind had closed.\n\nThen came “the Great Awokening.” And then came COVID. “It just blew the lid off,” Schmitt says. The guise of policing misinformation during a national health crisis, he says, “just gave them an excuse.”\n\nRepublicans have gotten pretty good at telling this kind of dystopian story. The examples are well worn, but memories of the abuses are still fresh. For Democrats, well, they have heard it all before. An unseen but also all-powerful Orwellian octopus working in concert with a Democratic Machine to police wrong-think? Massachusetts Sen. Peter Welch almost finds the idea amusing.\n\n“I’m part of the Democratic Party,” Welch protested in committee. “You give us way too much credit for being that organized to be able to put this whole massive enterprise together.”\n\n“Because you can rely on the censorship industrial complex to do the work for you,” shot back Mollie Hemingway, editor-in-chief of the Federalist, who testified in committee that the conservative website had been the target of censorship.\n\nAsked about that exchange, an affable Schmitt gives his Democratic colleague an out. “Do I think he was the one connecting all the dots?” he asks of Welch. “No, but the point is that there’s a whole network that is very well funded where that is their purpose.” He alleges also that the censorship apparatus marches in lockstep with Democrats and shares a goal of “absolute power and control with no room for dissent.”\n\nSalvation in this telling came not in court, but from Donald Trump. A loyal surrogate who helped Trump with debate prep, Schmitt was standing next to then-Sen. J.D. Vance in Butler, Pennsylvania, when an energetic Elon Musk barreled onstage. The election was a referendum on democracy itself, the world’s richest man told the crowd as Trump stood by beaming. “The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech,” said the owner of X, the social media website formerly known as Twitter. A Trump loss, Musk warned, would end the First Amendment and end democracy altogether.\n\nSchmitt agrees. Earlier that summer, he had lost at the Supreme Court.\n\nMore specifically, his successor, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, lost; Schmitt had been elected to the Senate the year prior. But notably, they did not lose on the merits. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the states suing Biden did not have standing. All the same, writing in his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito complained that the court had just allowed “the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear, and think.”\n\nYet Schmitt still counts the case as a victory.\n\nBecause before the “Twitter Files,” before the admissions from the Biden White House, before any congressional testimony, he won the right of pre-trial discovery, which allowed him and his legal team access to the censors’ internal communications. This, in turn, gave Americans their first look behind the curtain to see exactly how the government leaned on Big Tech. “You’ve got to remember, at that time, nobody had done it,” he recalls. “It was called a conspiracy theory.” Once granted discovery, Schmitt was able to peer into the communications between the Biden administration and Big Tech, revealing what he calls “the worst instincts of folks who should have never had that much power” and laying bare “what they were willing to do with it.”\n\nIn March 2021, Rob Flaherty, White House director of digital strategy, wrote an unnamed Facebook official to accuse that company of “hiding the ball.” He complained that they weren’t doing enough to police social media posts that ran counter to the administration’s public narrative. The White House, he wrote ominously, had become “gravely concerned that [Facebook] is one of the top drivers of vaccine hesitancy.” He wasn’t alone.\n\nOn the same email chain, Andy Slavitt, a senior Biden administration COVID advisor, then fumed that White House officials did “not sense [urgency] from you at all,” adding that “100% of the questions I asked have never been answered and weeks have gone by.” He then dangled what some read as a threat: “Internally we have been considering our options on what to do about it.” Facebook listened – and promptly got in line.\n\nInternal emails from the company, Alito wrote in his dissent, “paint a clear picture of subservience” as the Big Tech giant worked to stay in the government’s good graces.\n\nTo Republicans these emails showed prima facie evidence, they argued, that Biden was willfully violating the First Amendment. “The government really was coercing these companies to do their bidding,” Schmitt explains. “We all know the government can’t censor speech, but they also can’t outsource that to private companies, which is what they were doing.”\n\nFor Schmitt, the peek behind the curtain revealed an elite defined by “their loathing of regular people to make decisions.” A far cry from live-and-let-live liberalism, the political correctness of his youth had blossomed into a censorship regime governed by an expert class whom he says “want their beliefs to be shoved down the throats of everyone,” telling anyone of a dissenting opinion to “shut the hell up.”\n\nBut Schmitt isn’t the quiet type.\n\nHence the hearing where two radically different visions emerged, and where what has solidified into consensus among conservatives and libertarians is dismissed as overblown hype by many of those on the left.\n\nThe emails brought forward by his lawsuit didn’t reflect poorly on anyone in government or tech, insisted Mary Anne Franks. A constitutional law professor at George Washington Law School – and Turley colleague – she testified in committee that the censorship industrial complex was a “myth” used by conservatives to harass academics and nonprofits working to put up “safeguards against foreign and domestic misinformation and media manipulation.” She read the same emails that Schmitt obtained in discovery. Her conclusion: “There’s no evidence to support collusion between the Biden administration and Big Tech.”\n\nThat’s news to Mark Zuckerberg. The Meta founder told Joe Rogan earlier this year that “people in the Biden administration” would “scream at them and curse” his team in an ultimately successful attempt to pressure Facebook to censor posts the White House considered COVID misinformation. The social media giant has since loosened its speech standards.\n\nJack Dorsey would be similarly surprised. The former Twitter CEO has expressed regret with how his company censored the New York Post, writing after his exit from the company that Twitter failed to withstand “corporate and government control.”\n\nSchmitt sees a window as a result, one that would never have opened if Kamala Harris had won in November. With Trump in office and Musk at the helm of DOGE, the Republican administration has instead started a long march through bureaucracy. It started on Inauguration Day when the new president signed an executive order condemning his predecessor for “trampling free speech rights” and ordering his administration to immediately “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct.”\n\nHours earlier, the same Silicon Valley CEOs whom conservatives consider little more than co-conspirators in the censorship racket gladhanded at the inauguration. While members of Congress watched remotely in another room, inside the Capitol Rotunda Big Tech had the best seats.\n\nMusk attended, too, though he had already been canonized after turning Twitter into a safe space for conservatives. Then there was Zuckerberg, who after his very sudden, very public mortification on Rogan, had donated $1 million to the Trump inaugural committee. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also enjoyed a first-class seat despite long-standing conservative skepticism of his digital behemoth.\n\nPresident Biden complained, incongruously, that his biggest regret was failing to do more to police misinformation, and in his final address, he warned the nation of a rising “oligarchy” driven by a “tech-industrial complex.” For his part, Trump welcomed his billionaires. “They were all with him, every one of them,” he told reporters of his new supporters, “and now they are all with me.”\n\nShould Republicans trust those elites too? Schmitt struggles to make sense of the dizzying realignment. “I don’t know. That’s the answer,” he replies while holding out hope that the conversion, and the condemnation of censorship, is legitimate. “Maybe they’ve been red-pilled,” he speculates. He isn’t naïve, though. “It could very well be that it’s just because President Trump’s in power now,” the senator says. “There’s no way of knowing that. Time will tell.”\n\nIn the meantime, the new administration advertises the fight for free speech as a battle for Western civilization. A less-than-diplomatic Vice President Vance brought that blunt message with him to the Munich Security Conference during his first diplomatic mission. Existential threats abound on that continent, but what Vance told the assembled leaders he worries the most about is the “threat from within,” specifically “the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.”\n\nHe castigated the United Kingdom for charging an anti-abortion protestor with demonstrating silently outside a clinic. He attempted to shame the government of Scotland for encouraging citizens to report on neighbors guilty of prayer in private homes located in so-called safe access zones. He said that across Europe “free speech is in retreat.”\n\nAnd while Vance claimed the previous U.S. president was sympathetic to such capitulation, he warned Europe that they would not find a partner in Trump: “There is a new sheriff in town.” The assembled elite were aghast. Schmitt beamed.\n\nWatching from the audience in Bavaria that day, the Missouri Republican thought each word his former Senate colleague delivered was pitch-perfect. “You can’t say to the American people, to the American taxpayer, that their generosity should be unlimited in defense of these ‘Western values’ and of these borders that are nowhere near ours when, at the same time, Europe is rejecting core values like free speech,” Schmitt says of the “hypocrisy” Vance was confronting.\n\nWhile allies back stateside were thrilled, critics at home complained that the new administration shouldn’t have gone abroad lecturing allies. The real threat to free speech, they say, is at home. Here Democrats cite their own, more recent examples.\n\nThe Trump administration threw the Associated Press out of the White House press pool for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” The president swore to defend and uphold the Constitution one moment but complained the next, during a speech at the Department of Justice, that news organizations who criticize him are “scum” and their actions “illegal.” Foreign college students who protest American foreign policy are being rounded up off the street and targeted for deportation.\n\n“These attacks on free speech and association have a chilling effect,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, warning that the actions “signal to others that if they don’t fall in line with the Trump administration’s preferred views, they could be next.”\n\nSchmitt has ready rebuttals for those critiques:\n\nThe Associated Press doesn’t have a First Amendment right to be included in the press pool, the rotating group of reporters who travel with the president daily, he notes. As things stand, he says, “the AP can write all the stories they want – informed or ill-informed.” The president, meanwhile, is still allowed to speak his mind. Press criticism is a far cry from press censorship, the senator replies when pressed on Trump’s DOJ speech, insisting that “the fact that President Trump has an opinion about them is not a ‘threat to democracy.’”\n\nDeportations of foreigners over their speech is a thornier issue. Schmitt is not familiar with the case of Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey arrested by DHS last month for allegedly engaging in activities in support of Hamas. The administration hasn’t yet provided detailed evidence, but Ozturk did write an op-ed in the school newspaper condemning Israel for “the Palestinian genocide.”\n\n“I don’t know the specifics, but I think writ large, if somebody’s here on a student visa, that is a privilege,” he says. “If you’re not a citizen, you’re guests in this country.” And unruly guests, like the ones who shut down campus buildings and intimidate others with political violence, he adds, should not be tolerated. “I don’t think this gets to a place where somebody who has dissenting views is being deported,” he qualified. “That’s not happening. That’s not the case.”\n\nThese views are foundational to Schmitt and his current political project. They cannot be quickly abandoned. Defending free speech wasn’t just his springboard to the Senate, it remains his work there. “I’m about as free speech absolutist as you’re going to find,” he says. “I’m not threatened in any way shape or form by somebody having a different point of view.”\n\nThe problem, and the reason for his ongoing work, he insists, is that “I just don’t think you find – sadly – all that many people on the political left who believe that anymore.”","summary":"But given a chance, 'another Democrat will try to do it again'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/retribution-sen-eric-schmitt-believes-censors-are-on-the-run/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/censorship.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 17:21:49","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":310741088,"title":"Kamala Harris mocked for reported interest in think tank creation: ‘The Coconut Tree Institute’","text":"Social media commentators had a field day after a report that former Vice President Kamala Harris was considering starting a center for “policy and ideas.”\n\nThe New York Times released a piece on Thursday, headlined, “Sidelined and Still Processing Her Defeat, Harris Looks for a Way Back In.”\n\nThe article observed how Harris and her husband are“weighing each new opportunity with the potential political blowback in mind” as they chart a course for the future.\n\n“One possibility: establishing an institute for policy and ideas,” The Times reported. “Brian Nelson, an adviser to Ms. Harris since she was California’s attorney general, has broached the idea with several universities, including Howard and Stanford.\n\nBut some allies have noted that raising money for such a center could, depending on the donors, create liabilities in future races.”\n\nThe notion that Harris’ next political move could involve starting a think tank — despite a presidential campaign often criticized for gaffes — resulted in many jokes on social media outlets like X.\n\nWashington Free Beacon senior writer Andrew Stiles summarized the report as “NYT: Kamala Harris, known for her deep knowledge and ability to articulate complex issues, is thinking about launching ‘an institute for policy and ideas.'”\n\nHe joked the institute would be called, “The Kamala D.

Let him die and move down to Florida.” \n\nLater, during Trump’s first term in office, Fred came to the White House to appeal to his uncle to provide more resources to people with disabilities. Fred writes that his uncle responded to this request: “Those people, the costs. They should just die.” This is language that sounds eerily close to eugenics.\n\nThen, in the aftermath of the tragic helicopter crash in Washington D.C. in January, Trump cited a dubious Fox News claim that “the FAA’s diversity push includes hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.” This led to his antagonistic and unfounded suggestion that intellectually disabled traffic controllers may have been the cause of the horrific event. \n\nMost recently, with the tacit support of Health and Human Services head Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his devotion to junk science, there was Trump’s February executive order which bizarrely asserted that a host of conditions affecting American children, particularly autism and ADHD, “poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life,” and emphasized that “these trends harm us, our economy and, our security.” \n\nCharacterizing the rich and nuanced neurodiversity across the lives of so many of our young people as a threat to national security does seem like a dangerous prospect, but not for the reasons the Trump administration states.\n\nIn her 2012 book, “A Disability History of the United States,” Kim E. Nielsen chronicles how the early European colonists in America tended to define disability primarily in terms of economic productivity. \n\nAs long as an individual was able-bodied enough to be at least somewhat of an economically productive laborer, whatever disability might exist was ostensibly irrelevant to the community at large. \n\nIn the early 1700’s, Massachusetts passed laws prohibiting the “poor, vicious, and infirm” from coming to North American land if they were incapable of managing and maintaining themselves economically. This draconian and hyper-ableist attitude toward the disabled population seems to be rearing its ugly head again in the age of the Trump administration where economic and geopolitical prowess seems to take complete priority over every other consideration, including community, empathy, and humaneness.\n\nBlatant discrimination against the disabled continued for decades. After World War II, disability as a form of self-identity, shared experience and culture started taking shape. Out of this development sprouted political activism. \n\nAfter centuries of overt bias, steady momentum grew for stronger federal protections for people with disabilities. In 1973, the Rehabilitation Act was passed with the critical language embedded in section 504 stating people with disabilities could not be “denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” \n\nThis was soon followed by the passage of the 1975 landmark Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which federally mandated that students with disabilities must have access to public education. A little more than a decade later, the 1990 passage of the American with Disabilities Act, another product of committed activism, further shifted the perception of disability as a burdensome and costly problem for society toward a sense of societal obligation that the environment needed to adjust itself in order to provide appropriate accommodation and access. \n\nDisturbingly, based on Trump’s recent harsh rhetoric and conduct, we seem to be sliding backwards from this enlightened point in history.\n\nAs aggressive efforts to dismantle the federal Department of Education continue, the grim outlook for students with disabilities warrants our committed vigilance. One of the main responsibilities of the federal Education Department has been overseeing and enforcing IDEA, which provides the legal, regulatory and financial apparatus to ensure the rights and access for students with disabilities across the whole country. \n\nThe massive federal spending cuts to education and Medicaid being proposed in conjunction with the gutting of the federal Education Department’s staff leaves the effective and appropriate delivery of special education in the state of New Jersey in serious question moving forward. \n\nIn the current 2025 fiscal year, the federal government has provided $1.24 billion in education funding to New Jersey, including more than $500 million for grants dedicated to special education and $4 million for school-based mental health services. With the federal spending cuts that have already been made and many more on the horizon, utter catastrophe could be waiting for the more than 240,000 New Jersey K-12 students who receive some type of special education services.\n\nThe projected cuts to special education and adult disability assistance, along with the Trump administration’s contempt for diversity, equity and inclusion goals readily leave one to conclude that the end game here is to deliberately degrade the crucial support for people with disabilities while undermining their dignity and treating them as second-class citizens. \n\nIn troubled times like these, it is a moral imperative to exercise our collective voices in countering the pernicious forces that abound. \n\nWe need to be in contact with our senators and representatives in the U.S. congress. We need to urge them to ensure that special education and Medicaid continues to be properly and fully funded for our disabled population in the state of New Jersey. \n\nWe should all be champions for the civil rights and humanity of those with disabilities, while helping preserve their rights and access to proper educational services. \n\nThey are not to be dismissed as economic liabilities or logistical burdens, but celebrated as essential additions to the multifaceted tapestry of our society, a tapestry that, indeed, helps make America truly great.\n\nBill Cole is a New Jersey-based school psychologist and adjunct professor of developmental psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University.\n\nLocal journalism needs your support.

Homer City will now be the largest electricity producer in the state, and Steffee’s members in Western Pennsylvania will be instrumental in building and maintaining the facility.\n\nOpportunity, Steffee said, has not been available to his members for four years, forcing them to leave their families and communities behind to travel to New Mexico, Washington, Ohio, West Virginia and Tennessee because nothing new was being built in Pennsylvania.\n\n“What this means for us is, I can bring the boilermakers home back to Pennsylvania. This will be anywhere from a four- to six-year job. They will need hundreds of boilermakers and thousands of construction workers. This is good for everybody in the building trades,” Steffee said.\n\n“This is a mega, mega project. Everybody’s going to benefit, and I am in the process of recruiting new apprentices … not only for this job but what’s coming in the future in my other counties throughout West Virginia, Ohio and here in other places in Pennsylvania,” he continued.\n\n“All we want to do is build new energy infrastructure. We want to be a part of the new industrial revolution of reliable base-load electricity. Whether it’s gas, coal, nuclear, we want to be a part of it,” Steffee explained.\n\n“I dunno a damn thing about artificial intelligence, but I sure as hell know how to build power plants,” he added.\n\nThe former coal-fired generating station will immediately begin converting into a 3,200-acre natural gas-powered data center campus, which will begin producing power by 2027.\n\nThe project is facilitated by a $10 billion investment from Knighthead Capital Management. HCR made the announcement in Indiana County. Kiewit Power Constructors Company is set to construct the new facility. GE Vernova will be a big partner, providing seven turbines to produce nearly 4.5 GW of power.\n\n“This is great for my hometown [and)] my school district that my family has gone to for six generations of kids. My family still lives there. I still live here in the community, and this is definitely a shot in the arm for a county that’s been really economically challenged,” Steffee said.\n\n“I do think that there’s going to be a lot of ripple effect jobs produced. The data centers and the construction jobs will be unreal. And hopefully this helps with the load on the grid too. That’s a lot of megawatts,” he added.\n\nSteffee, who said he didn’t want to get too political, said the emphasis from one campaign on bringing manufacturing back meaningfully in Pennsylvania—as well as a push for American dominance in energy production—sent a message to investors and businesses: It was a good time for shovel-ready jobs.\n\nWhen visiting Indiana County in September, then-candidate Donald Trump vowed to a packed rally that if elected to a second term in the White House, he would unleash Pennsylvania’s energy sector. He pledged to get workers in the key swing state “pumping, fracking, drilling and producing like never before.”\n\nFlanked by energy workers in hard hats at the event, Trump said of untapped natural gas reserves, “We have all of this stuff, more than anybody. We don’t use it.”\n\nSteffee agreed that there are political ramifications.\n\n“It’s game on for America first, and we want to be the ones leading the world in data centers, artificial intelligence, and we want the manufacturing,” he said.\n\nThe AI data centers need a lot of one thing—power. Pennsylvania is known for producing reliable base-load electricity. If AI is this country’s second Industrial Revolution, Pennsylvania is poised to power this one too.\n\n“The state of Pennsylvania is the largest exporter of electricity in the country as of right now, and we’re sitting on the second-largest natural gas deposit in North America. We’ve got all these great producers, and they’re ready to produce gas,” Steffee said.\n\n“Everybody in the building trades in construction and the gas industry in Pennsylvania; we all take pride in our jobs. We’ve just been really taking a hammer here for the last four years,” he said.\n\nLess than a year after his inauguration, former President Joe Biden issued an executive order phasing out the purchase of gasoline-powered vehicles and requiring that the federal government’s buildings be powered by wind, solar or other clean energy.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, in December 2021, that order directed the government to transform its 300,000 buildings and 600,000 cars and trucks and use its annual purchases of $650 billion in goods and services to meet its goal.\n\nThe result of that order and the language he and former Vice President Kamala Harris both used around clean energy research and development hurt union and trade workers in the fossil fuels industries.\n\nOnce completed in 2027, it will be the largest natural gas power plant in the United States, surpassing NextEra Energy’s main utility, Florida Power & Light’s West County Energy Center, which has a capacity of nearly 3.8 GW, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nSteffee and others involved in the announcement said the project will create over 10,000 direct on-site construction-related jobs, a big boost for the trades, and over 1,000 permanent high-paying operations jobs in the technology sciences. These will include jobs in geology, chemistry, engineering and energy infrastructure.\n\nKiewit Executive Vice President Dave Flickinger was pleased with how quickly all the stakeholders came together to make the project immediately shovel-ready.\n\nThis rebirth has the entire community abuzz with hope for a better future. It’s hard to find anyone in Indiana County and the surrounding regions unhappy about the development, said Republican Pennsylvania state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, whose district includes the Homer City site.\n\n“This is going to completely change the dynamic of the economy, not just in Indiana County but really the entire region,” said Pittman. “Not only from a capital investment perspective, which ultimately leads to growing the tax base, but also the infusion of construction jobs,” he said.\n\nPittman said that while some characterize those construction jobs as temporary, “The reality is, whenever you’re able to employ skilled labor for multiple years, that essentially allows that workforce to be trained and ready for the next project. So that is significant.”\n\nPittman said the projection of a thousand permanent good-paying jobs truly is a game-changer.\n\n“In a county of our size, it will absolutely revolutionize our economy,” he said.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","summary":"HOMER CITY, Pa.—Eleven days after the massive smokestacks and cooling towers of Pennsylvania’s largest coal-fired power plant came down in a dramatic fashion in this...

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a surprise pit stop while on the road for his “fighting oligarchy” tour with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) across the West. He appeared at the Coachella annual music festival.\n\nSanders took the stage to introduce the singer Clairo, whom he praised for standing up for reproductive rights and speaking out against the war in Gaza. He then urged the crowd to get energized and fight back against President Donald Trump’s lawless, authoritarian agenda.\n\n“The future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation,” Sanders told the crowd. “Now you can turn away, and you can ignore what goes on, but if you do that, you do it at your own peril. We need you to stand up, to fight… for economic justice, social justice, and racial justice.”\n\nComing on the heels of Sen. Cory Booker’s (D-N.J.) recent marathon speech to Congress, Sanders’ music festival appearance is the latest high-profile attempt by a sitting member of Congress to rally opposition against Trump. The president had made significant gains among young voters in the November election compared to his 2020 race, and Coachella’s audience, which tends to be mostly Gen Z and millennials according to one survey, is a crucial demographic for the Democrats. Sanders was not the only lawmaker at Coachella: he was introduced by Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), the youngest member of Congress. \n\nSanders got a warm welcome; Trump, not so much. Each time Sanders mentioned him, the crowd roared with boos. “I agree!” he replied at one point. The 83-year-old Sanders warned, in a roughly three-minute speech, of the threats Trump and the GOP pose to tackling climate change and improving abortion rights, worker’s rights, and access to equitable healthcare.\n\n“We have an economy today that is working very well for the billionaire class, but not for working families. We need you to help us to create an economy that works well for everybody, not just the one percent,” Sanders told the crowd. “We have a health care system that is broken. We are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We need you to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and understand that health care is a human right.” \n\n View this post on Instagram \n\nAs my colleague Tim Murphy wrote, Sanders has become something of a leader of the Trump resistance these past couple of months, seeking to gain the support of otherwise apolitical voters as other high-profile Democrats largely have remained silent. “I mean, Kamala [Harris] is not talking, Barack [Obama]’s not talking, [Joe] Biden’s not talking,” one longtime Democrat said. “Right now, he’s the only one talking, and he’s the only one making sense.”\n\nSanders appears to be doing exactly what Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Democrats should be doing during an appearance on CNN Sunday morning. “I think our secret, super-duper strategy is, just tell the truth about what’s going on,” she noted. “The American people will see pretty clearly who’s fighting for the billionaires and who’s fighting for them.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have been hitting the road. He delivered the Coachella speech after making a stop earlier in the day in Los Angeles with the New York lawmaker. In a post on X, Sanders said the LA turnout was about 36,000 people, making it “our biggest rally ever.”","summary":"On Saturday, Sen.

Smith, Democrats don’t let outsiders win their primaries","text":"In his decades covering sports, Stephen A. Smith has seen a lot of cheating and dirty tricks, but it’s nothing compared to what he'd face in a longshot bid for the Democratic nomination for president. Those who run the nation’s oldest political party will not just hand Smith the car keys. In fact, they will do everything they can to destroy his nascent political career, even if that means destroying him. STEPHEN A. SMITH SAYS HE'S STRONGLY CONSIDERING PRESIDENTIAL RUN On Sunday, Smith appeared on ABC’s \"This Week,\" after confirming last week that he is not ruling out a run at the highest office in the land. And after all, you might say, if a celebrity like Donald Trump can find himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., then why not Stephen A. Smith? The answer to that question is that Democrats are not Republicans. Just ask Robert F Kennedy, Jr., who Democrats denied any opportunity to challenge Joe Biden in the 2024 primary, and who now works for Trump. The party didn’t just try to defeat RFK Jr., they sought to humiliate and marginalize him. Smith should take heed. Democrats do not go with the hot hand just to win. If they did, Bernie Sanders would've been their nominee in 2016, not Hillary Clinton. And they proved it again at Sanders' expense in 2020, when they pushed him aside for Joe Biden. Democrats want someone from their club, or at least someone they can control. Stephen A. Smith is neither. To be sure, there is a very positive case to be made for Smith as the Democratic Party wanders through the political wilderness, shivering in the long cold shadow of Biden’s incompetence and decrepitude. Smith is obviously a gifted communicator, and more than that, he appeals to the Achilles heel of the party, working-class men. He also appears more or less immune to wacky woke ideas like men playing in women’s sports. Smith has an undeniable everyman appeal. After all, almost by definition a sports analyst is the guy you want to have a beer with, and even in that world, Smith balances the brutishness of sport with high-mindedness and impeccable style. His wildly successful career in the aggressive and high-stakes world of sports media is an asset for Smith. Before voters can agree with what a politician has to say, they have to want to hear what they have to say. Smith knows how to get attention. But before we start designing the fully lit basketball court in the Rose Garden, it is worth considering the extensive tools that the Democrats’ elite have to thwart Smith, a set of tools that, had they had them, Republicans would have used to kneecap Trump in 2016. First of all, superdelegates, which is to say unelected party insiders who cast ballots for the nominee at the party convention, play a vastly bigger role in the Democrats’ primary process than in the GOP’s. Added to this, given the dominance of Democrats in our major urban areas, local Democratic Party machines play an outsized role. It was Rep. James Clyburn’s get-out-the-vote effort in South Carolina cities that propelled Biden to his 2020 win, even though just a week earlier his candidacy had looked dead as a doornail. The party elders pick the candidates, whether the voters like it or not. Let’s not forget that just five months ago Kamala Harris ran for president, having never won a primary. Does it really matter how many votes Smith can get in a party that anoints nominees nobody voted for? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In 2016, Donald Trump didn’t so much win the Republican nomination for president as he did take over the GOP, fundamentally transforming it in ways we are still seeing play out with young and working-class voters, and with tariffs and peace deals. To become president, Stephen A. Smith would have to likewise. It wouldn't be enough to simply get the most votes for the Democratic nomination. He would have to fundamentally change the party itself, and the power structures within it, like Trump did.

That is, Trump aims to severely punish and brutalize his enemies, big and small, even if they didn’t do anything illegal or wrong — and he wants to wield the massive power of the state to do it, no matter how arbitrary or authoritarian his conduct. \n\n In the middle of last week, the president notched yet another significant escalation in his government’s sprawling efforts to force this kind of American democratic backsliding. And due to the avalanche of other scandals, outrages, and international embarrassments perpetrated by his administration in recent days, that rather significant escalation was almost buried in the mainstream news cycle.\n\n It wasn’t for Trump’s lack of trying, however.\n\n On Wednesday, Olivia Troye was at her home working just like any other average weekday in Trump’s (second) America. Troye, then a Republican aide, had worked on Trump’s White House coronavirus task force during the hell-days of the pandemic, but later went public during the 2020 presidential election to campaign against Trump and warn voters that his mismanagement of the Covid-19 crisis was utterly disqualifying. During the 2024 campaign, she endorsed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, and continued to harshly criticize the fully Trumpist GOP. \n\n She tells Rolling Stone that on Wednesday, “I was sitting at home working and suddenly my phone started blowing up, including from some former Trump administration officials. And someone messaged: ‘Turn on Fox News,’ and I got a text from someone else saying, “Oh my God, Miles.’”\n\n When her husband walked in the room, Troye says he told her she looked “pale as a ghost — and he looked at the TV and could see why.” \n\n She had reason to be worried. It’s currently unknowable if the second Trump administration will retaliate in any meaningful way against Troye, but during his first presidency, his White House cared enough about her to make her a target of its Two Minutes Hate, during the 2020 election and height of Covid-19.\n\n Troye had been watching Wednesday’s live broadcast that the White House had convened for the media, with the president sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, during which Trump was handed new executive orders to sign. In two of these documents, Trump ordered senior government officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, to investigate Miles Taylor, a former Trump Homeland Security official who wrote the famous Trump-trashing “Anonymous” op-ed and book, and Chris Krebs, who had been a top cybersecurity official who infuriated Trump and other Republicans by refusing to co-sign the then-president’s democracy-subverting lies that he had won the 2020 race against Joe Biden. The Department of Justice is then required to report the results of these investigations to the Trump White House.\n\n In signing the orders on Wednesday, Trump told the cameras and the assembled press that “I think he’s guilty of treason,” referring to Taylor and — of course — citing zero evidence for such an egregious statement. Before signing the Krebs order, the president falsely insisted that it had been “proven” that Krebs was wrong, thus wielding the powers of the Executive Branch to cement the lie (which got people killed on Jan. 6, 2021) that Trump had won the 2020 presidential contest into Republican Party ideology and current federal policy. The president also used the televised moment to endorse carrying out further crackdowns on expanded voting rights, and also claimed that the U.S. political press is not “free,” presumably because it is too mean to him.\n\n It is woefully unclear — which may be the point — what conceivable crimes these two men could have committed that would warrant publicly announced federal probes of them, specifically. It appears their primary offense was each pissing off Trump in the media by, particularly in Krebs’ case, stating demonstrably true things in the face of Trump’s efforts to steal an election he had clearly lost. \n\n President Trump did not have to sign those executive orders on Wednesday. Trump — who was formerly criminally charged due to his attempted coup and other matters — and his White House staff could have privately directed the supposedly independent Justice Department to launch criminal investigations. \n\n That still would be scandalous and represent a larger breakdown of the alleged independence of federal law enforcement in the United States. (To be fair, it is a breakdown that Trump explicitly promised the voters he would initiate, in a planned onslaught of political “retribution,” during his 2024 run.) But there is no reason that any executive order needed signing, much less a televised unveiling, for this to occur.\n\n Trump and his lieutenants saw things a little differently.\n\n “Donald Trump needed to send a message,” a White House official explains to Rolling Stone, adding that the public, executive-order-branded nature of it was in large part because Trump had said he wanted to deliver warning to others on his enemies list. “It’s true. He technically didn’t need to sign an E.O.”\n\n Another Trump administration official adds that the president’s “showmanship qualities” practically necessitated, at least for this administration, a televised salvo of vengeance.\n\n In doing so, the president ordered the Justice Department — which in his second administration has become little more than an incredibly powerful arm of his personal and political desires — to crack down and invasively probe two of his far less powerful political foes. He and his White House didn’t even bother with the patina of reasonable suspicion of any actual crime. They just blurt out terms like “treason” against the United States, which to President Trump can mean something as simple as: You hurt my feelings, therefore you must pay.\n\n In other, recent, and more “normal” times, such brazen actions by the White House — shamelessly targeting, using vast federal resources, a pair of guys because they made the “king” mad — would be considered a massive scandal. These orders would be widely denounced, across mainstream partisan lines, as a blatant abuse of presidential power, and as the actions of an autocratic despot in some other nation, somewhere else, but not here in the land of the free.\n\n But this is the new Trump era — and he has the backing of an entire political party that holds trifecta control of the federal government in Washington, along with their super-majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n Krebs did not respond to Rolling Stone’s messages seeking comment. Taylor declined to comment, beyond what he had already posted to social media following Trump’s signing of the E.O. \n\n “Dissent isn’t unlawful,” Taylor posted online. “It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”\n\n The grim reality of Trump’s two for-show executive orders is that even if criminal prosecutions and imprisonment don’t ultimately transpire, the damage has already been inflicted. \n\n “It works! Several people [I know] were saying they were worried about speaking out against Trump now even more so than they were before,” Troye says. “This is the stuff of a banana republic, where the government is directing investigations of outspoken critics. It’s about silencing people… It’s really scary when you say you’re going to use every lever of power of executive authority to target individuals. That is what happens in failed democracies. I wish more people would understand this, because I don’t think they do. It’s not about whether you agree with Miles Taylor or his politics, or if you disagree with what Chris Krebs did when he was doing his job. This is about everything we stand for as a democracy.”\n\n She concludes: “If you don’t think it can happen to you, I hope people now realize that it can.”","summary":"The president just accelerated America’s democratic backsliding — all with just the stroke of his signature on two brazenly vengeful executive orders","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/donald-trump-order-investigate-miles-taylor-chris-krebs-1235316424/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-prosecution-orders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 14:00:00","author":"Andrew Perez,Asawin Suebsaeng","authors":["Andrew Perez","Asawin Suebsaeng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":310708898,"title":"Lizzo takes a swipe at Trump tariffs with cheeky t-shirt during ‘SNL’ performance","text":"Truth hurts?\n\nLizzo took a jab at President Donald Trump’s tariff increase with a cheeky T-shirt during her performance on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nDuring a medley of “Love in Real Life” and “Still Bad” on the NBC show Saturday night, the pop star, born Melissa Jefferson, rocked a black sleeveless crop top with red letters that read, “TARIFFIED.”\n\nLizzo paired the shady shirt with a pair of black sequin hot pants adorned with silver stars, fishnet stockings and a pair of patent leather red heels. \n\nThe “Good As Hell” singer’s message comes after Trump, 78, placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. \n\nThe president also taxed goods from all other countries, arguing that the tariffs would boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.\n\nLizzo, who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election against Trump, has previously spoken out against the billionaire.\n\nLast October, the four-time Grammy winner slammed Trump during one of Harris’ Michigan rallies after he compared the city of Detroit to a “developing nation” during a campaign event.\n\n“I’m so proud to be from this city,” the singer, a Detroit native, told the crowd. \n\n“You know, they say if Kamala Harris wins, then the whole country will be like Detroit, okay?

That's created a political divide in Silicon Valley","text":"Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things, Lyons said. Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce, said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. The shift hasn't been for a lot of people, said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention. The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. We're still in the belly of the beast, said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice. The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was don't be evil, a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. Now, she said, if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable. Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. I feel sick to my stomach now, she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK, Sylvester said. It was not all OK. It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me, said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over. Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone, Wood added. We're all scared. Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on, he said. It's going to be different forever.","summary":"Silicon Valley's political landscape is shifting as tech leaders embrace conservative populism, creating a divide with their largely liberal workforce.

IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries.\n\n“I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said.\n\nSylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden.\n\n“I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.”\n\nIt is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration.\n\nAt first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs.\n\nBut it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives.\n\n“The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.”\n\n“Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.”\n\nKamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift.\n\n“The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what’s going on,” he said. “It’s going to be different forever.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles and video journalist Haven Daley contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. – Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Several Prominent Tech Executives Support Trump, Sparking Political Rift in Silicon Valley first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/several-prominent-tech-executives-support-trump-sparking-political-rift-in-silicon-valley/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/MTHCV6ZV6RCYJASETZAHC435VU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 12:57:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.009},{"id":310679858,"title":"Gretchen Whitmer just did all of us a huge favor","text":"“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life. And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.”\n\n-Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) Wednesday spouting MAGA rhetoric before a meeting with the America-attacking Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n“She’s really done an excellent job. She’s a very good person.”\n\n-The America-attacking Donald Trump during the meeting with Whitmer, in which he moved her around like a piece of used office furniture, before converting her into a photo/op where he once again said the 2020 election was “rigged.”\n\nFirst, I want to thank Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer for getting all this out of the way early before a 2028 presidential election that may or may not happen. \n\nBy doing us the courtesy of not wasting our time any longer pretending she’s anything but a complete phony we can move on to rooting for and supporting candidates who really do share our ideals, and understand the extreme danger we are in right now in America.\n\nBecause either you understand that, or you don’t. This is no time for playing cute, and screwing around in the squishy middle.\n\nUntil her embarrassing public surrender Wednesday, I actually had Whitmer pegged for possible stardom. \n\nI believed in “Big Gretch” and wrote glowingly about her and the women in Michigan, who had played a large part in facilitating the resistance against the ghastly Trump the past seven years. Frankly, they were inspirational and made me proud to support a party that stood up for voters, and against those who facilitated violent attacks against them.\n\nSure it was an easy stand to take, but I appreciated their toughness, panache and zeal nonetheless. They were on the right side of the fight, and damn, I was proud to fight alongside them.\n\nTurns out, there is nothing Whitmer will do for the good people of Michigan unless she thinks it is good for herself, and that is just terribly, terribly sad. \n\nHer political career died an ugly death Wednesday, because she’s too damn weak, and self-centered to understand that real leaders don’t walk into enemy territory and surrender to racist tyrants, they fight them every damn step of the way.\n\nHere’s how AP reported her self-induced kidnapping to the vile woman-abusing Trump:\n\n“She was feet from his desk when he signed a pair of memoranda directing the Justice Department to investigate two of his critics and signed an executive order exacting retribution against a law firm whose work he opposed.”\n\nA national Democratic strategist quoted by NBC-News put it this way:\n\n“It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”\n\nAnother strategist, who admires Whitmer put it more succinctly:\n\n“Just a f------ disaster.”\n\nThere was no damn reason for Whitmer to be within three states of the White House, yet there she was literally in the lions (er, lyin’s) den. Worse, this was not the first time she has met with this monster since he was reelected. \n\nWatching her show so little self-respect for herself is absolutely painful. Watching her show so little respect for people like myself, who have supported her with my time treasure, and endorsement is absolutely galling. \n\nIn a feeble statement, Whitmer claimed she was brought into the Oval Office in front of the press \"without any notice\" and emphasized her presence was not an \"endorsement of the actions taken or statements\" made at that event.\n\nSure, OK. She just happened to be at the bank with the crook while it was being robbed …\n\nAll of this surrendering and capitulation by “marquee” Democrats points to a larger problem within the fast-fading party itself. People are sick and tired of their sick and tired act.\n\nEither you believe what you are saying, or you don’t. Either you believe Trump is an extreme danger to our democracy, the rule of law, clean air and water, and any damn American value you tell us you care about, or you don’t. \n\nOnly roughly one in four Americans have a favorable opinion of a party that has become littered with out-of-touch “leaders” running on the old, stale fumes of recycled garbage.\n\nFrom a CNN poll last month:\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned independents say, 57% to 42%, that Democrats should mainly work to stop the Republican agenda, rather than working with the GOP majority to get some Democratic ideas into legislation.The survey was taken March 6-9, days before 10 Democratic senators — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — voted with Republicans in the chamber to advance a GOP-authored spending bill to avert a government shutdown, much to the chagrin of many other Democratic lawmakers and progressive critics.The majority’s desire to fight the GOP marks a significant change in the party’s posture from the start of Trump’s first term. A September 2017 poll found a broad 74% majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying their party should work with Republicans in an attempt to advance their own priorities, and just 23% advocating for a more combative approach.\n\nThey simply aren’t listening to us. \n\nToo many Democratic leaders aren’t fighters, they are whiners, right Schumer? \n\nInstead of standing up for Americans, they are doing nothing at all, or even worse: They are rolling over for Trump.\n\nIt’s pathetic. \n\nWas there ever a better illustration of how little they think of us when just days after losing the most important election of our lifetimes, Joe Biden eagerly invited the America-attacker back to the White House and the scene of the January 6, 2021 crime, and in front of roaring fire flashed his toothy smile, and heartily exclaimed, “Welcome back!”\n\nI’ll never be able to unsee that. “Welcome back.” Holy hell …\n\nAnd, say, have you been reading all these stories recently about the never-ending sniping between the Clintons, Biden, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama teams during the most important election of our lifetimes? \n\nWe’re out here knocking on doors with our hair on fire, shoveling our hard-earned cash out the door and were (are) frankly terrified of what another Trump term would mean, while these inbred, lifetime campaigners were airing petty feuds behind closed doors. \n\nThe party needs a bath. \n\nA few Democrats like Cory Booker, and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren, Reps. Jasime Crockett, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez before him, have finally owned up to their their gross inaction, and are busy doing what they were elected for — the very least of which should be standing relentlessly against a two-bit, lying crook who sees good people on both sides of a KKK rally, and whose violent attack on our vote may have irreparably wrecked this country for good. \n\nDemocratic Party leadership is full of too many complete phonies, and the only ones who can’t seem to see this are the so-called leaders themselves. \n\nA lot is rightfully made of Republicans’ appalling refusal to take on the odious Trump, but tell me: When are Democrats going to start taking action on their own?\n\nWhy are Schumer and Dick Durbin still leading the Democratic senate?\n\nUnless they see a 29 percent approval rating as something to be proud of …\n\nYa know, what happed here in Wisconsin last week should be instructive to Democrats going forward. There are lessons to be learned.\n\nWe won a crucial Supreme Court race up here by double-digits, because instead of it being about professional politicians, the race was simply about the issues.\n\nBy electing Judge Susan Crawford, thus ensuring liberals will control this court until at least 2028, Wisconsinites by huge margins signaled they don’t want billionaires like the grotesque Elon Musk interfering with our elections.\n\nWisconsinites said they believe in fair political maps. \n\nWisconsinites said they believe in a woman’s right to choose.\n\nIn fact, the only national politician who got involved up here was the despicable Trump himself, who gave a full-throated endorsement of the race’s ultimate loser, Brad Schimel.\n\nThat terrible tandem lost by a whopping 10 points, an almost unheard of margin in this razor-close state.\n\nTurns out, Trump’s toxic agenda is not popular here, and this vote happened BEFORE people’s life savings were battered by these destructive tariffs that Whitmer wants to politely haggle over, instead of doing everything in her power to shove in the nearest s---can. \n\nThe Democratic Party is broken, people, and it’s OK to say that. \n\nIt would be far, far worse not to.\n\nWe have the power, so we must demand change, dammit.\n\nUnless you don’t think we’re worth it … \n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Since this piece published, The New York Times has reported this: “The day after the inauguration, Ms. Whitmer penned a handwritten letter — which has not been previously reported — congratulating Mr. Trump, saying she looked forward to working together and praising his support for the auto industry in his first address, according to a person who relayed the text of the letter. Ms. Whitmer included her cellphone number and invited Mr. Trump to call her if she could be of any help to him.”","summary":"“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life.

At their town halls, they have encountered constituents angry representatives weren’t doing enough to oppose policies of President Donald Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nAnd what about other avenues of communication?\n\nMLive attempted to contact all 13 of Michigan’s members of the U.S. House, reaching out via two common communications channels available to constituents: the representatives’ Washington D.C.-based office phone lines and email-style forms available on their websites.\n\nAn MLive reporter, identifying himself as such, asked each representative the channels of communication they rely on most, their thoughts on in-person town halls and the tensions surrounding those, and their opinion of their House peers’ efforts to communicate with their constituents.\n\nDuring more than a two-week span — between the submission of those questions and the publication of this report — the offices of seven representatives answered MLive’s queries. Those were Republicans Jack Bergman and John Moolenaar, and Democrats Debbie Dingell, Kristen McDonald Rivet, Hillary Scholten, Haley Stevens, and Shri Thanedar.\n\nThe offices of four members of Congress from Michigan did not acknowledge receiving multiple messages from MLive during that timeframe. Those representatives were Republicans Lisa McClain, John James and Tim Walberg, and Democrat Rashida Tlaib.\n\nThe offices of two Congress members — Republicans Tom Barrett and Bill Huizenga — acknowledged the reception of MLive’s questions but did not answer them. \n\nHuizenga was the lone member of Michigan’s House delegation whose Washington D.C. phone line does not feature a messaging system. A recording advises callers to write messages via the Congressman’s website.\n\nSocial spaces\n\nSome House members have substituted in-person town hall meetings with virtual gatherings, where residents call in or log on to online sessions and wait their turn to address an elected representative.\n\nMoolenaar, a Republican, in March hosted an online session where he said over 800 people joined the conversation, even posting an image of himself engaging with the session on his social media channels.\n\n“Congressman Moolenaar and the office are engaging with constituents daily with in-person meetings, on the phone, through social media, email, and written letters,” a Moolenaar spokesperson told MLive.\n\nIn explaining Moolenaar’s decision to host virtual town halls, the Congressman’s spokesperson said many of those heated in-person gatherings across the U.S. “have been overtaken by far-left activists and unfolded into chaotic screaming matches.” \n\n“It’s no coincidence these activists were not interested in a town hall as the Biden administration unleashed chaos at the southern border, oversaw inflation that hurt Michigan residents, defied the Supreme Court with his illegal student debt transfer program, and the embarrassing withdrawal from Afghanistan,” the Moolenaar spokesperson said.\n\nScholten, a Democrat, remains among members of Michigan’s House delegation who has continued engaging with in-person town halls. \n\nOn back-to-back days last month, she hosted sessions in Grand Rapids and Grand Haven. There, she met constituents who expressed frustration about a perceived weak response to fighting Trump policies. Scholten also drew cheers as she verbally took aim at those GOP initiatives unpopular with the crowd.\n\n“Our job as elected representatives is to listen, engage, and take action,” Scholten told MLive. “It’s critically important to be present and accessible, even when the conversations are tough, and that’s exactly what I’m committed to doing.”\n\nScholten said the anger at in-person town halls in 2025 has transcended political party affiliation. \n\nShe hosted a town hall in February in Cannon Township, a Kent County community where voters favored Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris by 17.8 percentage points in November 2024. \n\n“I fully expected tough questions and criticism for standing up to Trump and (Trump adviser Elon) Musk, but the opposite was true,” Scholten said. “The room was at capacity, and the overwhelming sentiment was fear — fear about what’s happening to their health care, their livelihoods, and their future.”\n\nEscanaba in the spotlight\n\nIn some cases, constituents have applied creative methods for expressing that fear to Congress members. \n\nLast month in Escanaba, residents organized their own town hall in the district represented by Bergman. Organizers said they invited the Republican. When he did not attend, they instead addressed an empty seat meant to represent the Congressman. It was an effort that gained attention from national media.\n\nA spokesperson for Bergman told MLive the Congressman has assembled a staff committed to helping him respond to constituent concerns, calling it “one of the most important tasks we have.”\n\n“Some prefer to call or email, while others prefer writing in via regular mail,” a Bergman spokesperson said. “If a constituent wants a meeting with the Congressman, they can request that online or through the aforementioned ways of communication and we will work to make that happen.”\n\nBergman has met with “thousands” of constituents since taking office in 2017, the spokesperson said. “He will continue to do so in the years ahead.”\n\nDingell, a Democrat, has hosted in-person town halls in recent weeks, with more planned later this month.\n\n“Being accessible to constituents is the most important thing to me, and I do everything I can to make sure people can always let me know what’s on their minds,” Dingell told MLive. “While town halls are one way, I try to meet constituents where they are by participating, attending, and visiting many places including labor halls, farmer markets, veteran’s events and halls, schools, rotaries, forums, and more.”\n\nDingell said the prevalence of virtual town halls in part was a result of the acceptance of such forums, developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when social-distancing measures led elected leaders to seek new avenues for communicating with constituents.\n\n“I think we can always improve, and I will always prioritize ensuring my office’s communications are timely and effective” Dingell said. “Every member of Congress should make it a priority to give constituents ample opportunity to talk with them.”\n\nA first-year member of Congress, McDonald Rivet has engaged constituents via in-person and virtual meetings since taking office in January.\n\nA spokesperson for the Democrat said, to engage with constituents, her office also leans heavily on her website’s online communication forms.\n\n“The website is a catch-all resource where constituents can send a message to the Congresswoman, share how they feel about a piece of policy, share stories about how government actions impact their lives, read about what the Congresswoman has been working on lately, request help navigating a federal agency, and much more,” McDonald Rivet’s spokesperson said. “The Congresswoman has issued responses to over 6,000 constituent inquiries since she took office in January.”\n\nOther residents call or show up at her office in Flint, where staff members help constituents navigate issues related to Social Security, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs, the spokesperson said.\n\n“Nothing is more important to the Congresswoman than being present and responsive to her constituents, which is why she is constantly in community and listening to our neighbors,” McDonald Rivet’s spokesperson said.\n\nAll the tools available\n\nStevens, a Democrat, said she has introduced several pieces of legislation based on conversations with constituents.\n\n“Keeping a line of communication open with constituents is part of the job. Period,” Stevens told MLive. “You can’t represent people well if you don’t take the time to get to know them. I’ll always work my tail off for Michigan and do whatever it takes to make sure people are heard.”\n\nSince joining Congress in 2019, Stevens said her “mantra has been to listen, learn and lead — in that order.”\n\n“What keeps me awake at night is the question: who needs to be in front of me?,” Stevens said. “Who needs my help but doesn’t know or think they can get in touch? I spend a lot of time promoting the services and ways my office can help people with their problems.”\n\nThanedar said the fast-paced nature of Trump’s policy pursuits this year puts a premium on communications with constituents.\n\n“There is so much happening at once and a slew of misinformation and disinformation on what these things mean for working families,” Thanedar told MLive. “I think my Democratic colleagues recognize that and are strongly interested in using new methods to get our message out.”\n\nThanedar said he considered his office “one of the most communicative in Congress.”\n\n“My constituents are angry, scared, and have questions about what’s happening in Washington, and I want to be able to tell them quickly and in a digestible way,” the Congressman said. “As a result, we use almost every tool available to a congressional office to communicate. These include emails, newsletters, physical mailers, telephone town halls, in-person town halls, and social media posts, and that doesn’t even cover them all.”\n\nHere’s how to contact Michigan members of Congress:\n\n1st district: Jack Bergman, Republican\n\nEmail: Bergman.constituent@mail.house.gov\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-4735\n\n2nd district: John Moolenaar, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://moolenaar.house.gov/contact \n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-3561\n\n3rd district: Hillary Scholten, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://scholten.house.gov/contact\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-3831 \n\n4th district: Bill Huizenga, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://huizenga.house.gov/contact/ \n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-4401\n\n5th district: Tim Walberg, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://walberg.house.gov/address_authentication?form=/contact/email\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-6276 \n\n6th district: Debbie Dingell, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://debbiedingell.house.gov/contact/\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-4071 \n\n7th district: Tom Barrett, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://barrett.house.gov/contact/email-me \n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-4872\n\n8th district: Kristen McDonald Rivet, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://mcdonaldrivet.house.gov/address_authentication?form=/contact/email-me\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-3611\n\n9th district: Lisa McClain, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://mcclain.house.gov/contact\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-2106\n\n10th district: John James, Republican\n\nWebsite form: https://james.house.gov/contact/\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-4961\n\n11th district: Haley Stevens, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://stevens.house.gov/address_authentication?form=/contact/email-me\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-8171 \n\n12th district: Rashida Tlaib, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://tlaib.house.gov/contact\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-5126\n\n13th district: Shri Thanedar, Democrat\n\nWebsite form: https://thanedar.house.gov/contact/email?clear\n\nWashington D.C. phone line: (202) 225-5802","summary":"From empty chair protests to virtual meetings, the way constituents communicate with Michigan's U.S. House delegation is changing.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/tense-town-halls-have-michigan-lawmakers-rethinking-communication-strategies.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/2B4IOVBIXFHCPORNS65IDBXEMY.jpg?auth=45718c207b14117a2b8d65cd47010575ea7ac377bcb188ea9718d57b9d98b4f8&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 12:00:00","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":310748856,"title":"New books chart Biden’s downfall – and the picture is damning for Democrats","text":"Joe Biden plans to write a book about his presidency which ended in his historic withdrawal from the 2024 election, pushed out by senior Democrats convinced he was too old and infirm and replaced by his vice-president, Kamala Harris.\n\nSources close to Biden told news outlets the book could be published next year, by which time Biden will be 83 and doubtless – like other US presidents’ autobiographies – it will be a self-serving narrative lauding his time in office.\n\nBut readers have not needed to wait for an inside look at Biden’s time in power, especially his final year, which ended in his withdrawal from his re-election bid. This month saw the publication of two books containing explosive reporting on Biden’s downfall, and coming months will bring two more: so far the picture emerging is a damning one for Biden, his top aides and the Democratic party.\n\nThe books have detailed a president increasingly unfit for the task of taking on Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election and his top aides in denial about it, or actively seeking to cover it up, even as the administration warned about the existential threat Trump posed to American democracy.\n\nJournalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes were first out of the gate with Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House. Revelations included how Biden aides planned for his withdrawal in 2023, then when his disastrous June 2024 debate against Donald Trump supercharged calls for him to quit, “aggressively” argued that he should not, given Harris would be a “disaster”.\n\nThen Chris Whipple, author of a book about Biden’s 2020 win, released Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History. Whipple’s book is slim, at just 204 double-spaced pages. But it hits hard. Ron Klain, a former White House chief of staff, describes debate preparations in which Biden seemed “out of it”, unable to “grasp … the back and forth”, and also says that after the debate disaster, Biden declined to do political work necessary to survive, preferring to enjoy the trappings of power.\n\nResponding to Guardian reporting on Whipple’s book, Klain said he “never doubted the president’s mental acuity”, and had merely expressed concern that Biden made tactical errors, such as thinking “being a great foreign policy president was enough”.\n\nIn his interview with Whipple, Klain also describes his opposition to calls for Biden to drop out and anguish when he did so. Observers asked why Whipple did not challenge Klain on this, given his unsparing depiction of Biden’s aged state.\n\nBiden dropped out on 21 July. That gave Harris a near-impossible task, just 107 days to put together a campaign to beat Trump. Nonetheless, Allen, Parnes and Whipple report extensive shortcomings in the vice-president’s own approach, including the flawed selection of the untested Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, as well as infighting between Harris staffers and Biden aides who maintained campaign control.\n\nThe result was a crushing defeat, and Trump’s return to power.\n\nMolly Jong-Fast, host of the Fast Politics podcast, said Parnes, Allen and Whipple had shown Biden’s aides to be chiefly at fault: “Had Harris not had the Precision Strategies crew, think of what she could have done. I think that had she had a little more time and a little bit better advising, she could have won it.”\n\nReed Galen, a Republican strategist turned anti-Trump campaigner and host of The Home Front podcast, was more blunt: “Anyone who knew [about Biden’s decline] and did nothing, or knew and went to work for Kamala Harris’s campaign and didn’t let her run her own race, should never be given a position of responsibility again.”\n\nFor Biden, worse could yet be to come. In May, Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios will release the starkly titled Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\n\nAnnouncing their book, the two reporters pointed to widespread reporting, including by Parnes, Allen and Whipple, that family members including Jill Biden and Hunter Biden, eventually pardoned by his father, persuaded Joe Biden to seek a second term.\n\n“Biden, his family and his team let their self-interest and fear of another Trump term justify trying to put an at times addled old man in the Oval Office for four more years,” Tapper and Thompson said. “What was the extent of it? Was it a cover-up? Was it a conspiracy?”\n\nAccording to Politico, Original Sin is the book “Biden allies fear most”, with aides “shocked to read the ‘cover-up’ framing [which] wasn’t used explicitly in some of the interviews facilitated by Biden handlers”.\n\nA spokesperson said Tapper and Thompson “found people post-election much more willing to talk candidly” and “interviewed more than 200 people to figure out just what went behind the scenes of the Biden White House, conducting extensive reporting and factchecking, including with former president Biden’s team”.\n\nA fourth campaign book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by Josh Dawsey (Wall Street Journal), Tyler Pager (New York Times) and Isaac Arnsdorf (Washington Post), was said to be the only one that “involved the Biden and Harris teams in a factchecking process”.

Nonetheless, Jong-Fast said Allen, Parnes and Whipple had already shown Democrats were simply in “big denial” about Biden’s decline until it was too late.\n\n“I’m not convinced that it was a huge conspiracy,” Jong-Fast said. “What the right wants is a smoking gun, a moment where a cabal got together and was like, ‘Yes, we will do this [cover-up].’ And from what I’ve read from all these books, there’s not a smoking gun, it’s just Biden got older and older, and people were in denial about it, which is a larger problem with the gerontocracy writ large.”\n\nThe former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a key player in all accounts of Biden’s downfall, sits in Congress at 85. Chuck Schumer, whose role in pushing Biden out is described in another recent book, Mad House by Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of the Times, is 74 and shows no sign of quitting as Democratic leader in the Senate.\n\n“This should be a call to action,” Jong-Fast said. “Democrats should read these books and go, ‘Oh my God, we need people to retire at normal ages and not stay on and on. You’re not an airline pilot at 85. I don’t have an 87-year-old doing eye surgery on me. That doesn’t mean you’re not worthy and wonderful and valuable. It just means that you probably shouldn’t be serving.\n\n“If Democrats are going to run on this idea that American democracy is in trouble under Trump, then they can’t keep their friends in office for as long as they want.

In 2018, Republicans lost the House and the Democrats gained 41 seats.In the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority, meaning a net loss of just seven seats would cost them control of the chamber.What To KnowThis week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) identified 35 Republican-held districts it is targeting for the 2026 midterms. While former President Trump won 13 of these districts by double digits, the DCCC expressed confidence in its chances to flip several.Only three House Republicans represent districts that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris carried in 2024. On the other hand, Democrats hold 13 districts that Trump won.Meanwhile, according to CNN pollster Harry Enten, Trump's disapproval rating is at 43 percent - a similar level to November 2018, when the Republicans lost the House.Republicans won two Florida special elections in April, though the narrow margins could raise concerns within the party about waning support in some areas.Experts suggested these factors could lead to Democratic victory in the House.What People Are SayingWilliam F. Hall, adjunct professor of political science and business at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, told Newsweek there could be a \"major shift\" in the House makeup after the midterms.\"It is my opinion, increasingly, in view of the extremely negative ratings experienced by a Republican led Administration, it does appear that, barring some highly unlikely unforeseen circumstances, the midterm elections will bring about a major shift in the makeup of the House of Representatives, with an overwhelming victory for Democratic House candidates,\" he said. \"This view reflects the negative ratings held by a Republican led Administration, virtually in every significant category, related to political success, including the state of the economy, employment, inflation and especially lack of optimism being displayed by the vast number of Americans.\"Kyle Kondik wrote in a recent analysis for the University of Virginia's Center for Politics Crystal Ball report: \"Democrats became favorites to flip the House as soon as Trump won [in 2024], and what has happened since then has not really changed that assessment,.\"He predicts that 207 seats are safe, likely or lean Republican while 209 are safe, likely or lean Democratic.However, Heath Brown, associate professor of public policy at City University of New York said politics was too unpredictable at the moment to make strong predictions. \"If there's someone in the prognostication business that feels confident about anything right now, that's something to take note of,\" he told Newsweek.\"I think most people wake up each morning bracing to read something truly without precedent in their morning newsfeed. In that environment, 2026 projections should be taken with a boulder-sized grain of salt.\"What Happens NextRoughly 18 months remain before the midterm elections.

Biden’s cognitive problems have infected his fellow Democrats because they don’t seem to have any recollection that they lost the 2024 election.\n\nMake no mistake: They did lose, and it was not particularly close. Donald Trump won the Electoral College by 312-226 over Vice President Kamala Harris. He also won the popular vote and all seven battleground states.\n\nYou would never know that by examining the behavior of Washington Democrats. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, they have spent every moment fighting the same battles they lost in November.\n\nThe election went the way it did for many reasons, but some of the overarching issues are obvious. Mr. Trump won over voters because he promised to do specific things on specific issues.\n\nHe promised to stop the woke nonsense of biological men invading women’s spaces.\n\nHe promised to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nHe promised to cut outrageous and wasteful government spending and that Elon Musk would help him do it.\n\nHe promised to attack inflation and bring back American manufacturing jobs, and he would, yes, use tariffs on imported goods to achieve some of those goals.\n\nThese were all things he discussed in detail on the campaign trail, and he won.\n\nSo it’s puzzling, and seemingly self-destructive, for Democrats to keep fighting on that same ground some five months after Election Day. Indeed, numerous public polls show that congressional Democrats have never been more unpopular.\n\nNevertheless, they keep trotting out their failed vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for fake town hall events that are open only to Democrats.\n\n“If you say you love freedom and you want to restrict that, and restrict certain groups, you don’t love freedom. What you love is privilege, and that’s a different thing,” Mr. Walz said at one of the Democratic pep rallies falsely billed as a town hall meeting.\n\nThat’s pretty rich coming from the running mate of Ms. Harris, whose administration treated concerned parents as domestic terrorists because they objected to their daughters getting raped in school bathrooms by boys pretending to be girls. Democrats also don’t want parents involved if minor children undergo irreversible surgery on their sexual organs.\n\nYes, restricting parental rights was on the ballot in 2024, and Democrats lost.\n\nSen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, has been one of the leaders in the charge to oppose President Trump’s efforts to deport illegal aliens or foreign nationals who have engaged in behavior that undermines the United States.\n\nMr. Murphy told MSNBC near the end of March that the president had placed the country under “quasi-martial law” because he was arresting and removing noncitizens with cause.\n\nTo apply an old joke to Mr. Murphy, it’s clear that the most dangerous place in Washington is between the senator and a television camera. You can bet that if Mr. Murphy is on TV, he is probably sticking up for criminal illegal aliens or foreign subversives over the interests of law-abiding Americans.\n\nWhen they aren’t trying to thwart Mr. Trump’s efforts to make the country safer, Democrats have been defending every single dollar of federal government spending as indispensable to global survival.\n\nEven though Mr. Trump announced his plan to attack the bloated federal budget and that Mr. Musk would lead it, fully two months before Election Day, Democrats and their followers have been defending ridiculous government programs as if they are their children.\n\nSen. Cory A. Booker, New Jersey Democrat, took to the Senate floor to rail against Trump policies for more than 25 hours, a record for time wasted all at once in that chamber, in a massively monotonous display of performance art. The media loved him, and he will no doubt use this as his origin story when he runs for president again, but his actual impact will be like that of a glass of water thrown into the sun.\n\nInflation is down, gasoline is cheaper, and job creation is up. Democrats can’t talk about any of that, so they wail about Mr. Trump’s imposition, and then suspension, of tariffs on countries around the globe. Naturally, many Democrats have strongly supported tariffs in the past but now think they are bad because it’s Mr. Trump using them.\n\nIn ancient times, before Mr. Trump, a Democratic president named Barack Obama had an answer to Republicans who complained about his policies.\n\nElections have consequences, he explained. “I won,” he chided.\n\nNow, years later, maybe Democrats will grasp that they have already had a chance to stop everything Mr. Trump is doing.\n\nIt was the election last year.\n\nAnd they lost.\n\n• Tim Murtaugh is a Washington Times columnist and founder of Line Drive Public Affairs.

So many of them were trying to figure out what was really happening in the economy and what the impact would be on them.\n\nA recent Young America’s Foundation poll showed that tax cuts were the most popular item on President Trump’s agenda for 18- to 29-year-old voters. They are still concerned about high prices, so it makes sense that they want to keep more of their hard-earned dollars to help pay their bills.\n\nOne of the most important things members of Congress can do right now is pass a budget that extends the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump in 2017. Failure to do so will result in a more than $4 billion tax increase on the American people, as the tax cuts will soon expire.\n\nDespite the rhetoric from the left and many in the media, the Trump tax cuts gave the largest cut to low-income working families. Under the Trump tax cuts, their federal tax rate fell to the lowest in 40 years. Working families making $20,000 to $30,000 annually, the largest income group, received a 13.5% tax cut. Historically, the bottom half of earners paid less income taxes than ever.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center found that about 86% of middle-income households would get a tax cut from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If Congress fails to extend these tax reductions, 70% of the expirations fall on American families making less than $500,000. If that happens, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee estimates, a family of four with a median income of $80,610 would get a $1,695 tax increase — all the more reason to pass a budget with an extension of the tax cuts.\n\nOpponents of Mr. Trump’s tariffs claim they will massively increase the tax on the American consumer. Anyone who read “Trump: The Art of the Deal” understands that this was the president’s initial bargaining position. His announcement Wednesday that countries that did not retaliate against the United States would be included in the 90-day pause made my point. The markets reacted with a surge. At the same time, he announced a 125% tariff against communist China as retaliation for its actions.\n\nDuring my tenure as governor of Wisconsin, I spoke with Mr. Trump several times about trade. In particular, I remember talking to him as he attended the Group of Seven summit in 2018. There, he offered to remove all tariffs and restrictions on trade if the other industrial countries did the same for the United States. None of them took him up on his offer, further fueling his argument that we are getting bad deals from other countries.\n\nMy hope is that we get as close to zero tariffs as possible while leveling the playing field for trade, which would greatly benefit American manufacturing and workers. China has long been a barrier to us, much like the Soviet Union was until President Reagan brought it to its knees with a booming American economy and extensive defense buildup.\n\nIronically, some politicians screaming the loudest about the tariffs and their potential impact on prices oppose extending the Trump tax cuts. Many of the same politicians voted for trillions and trillions of dollars in new government spending.\n\nRising inflation, overwhelmingly driven by out-of-control government spending, drives high prices. From the beginning of 2021 to the beginning of 2025, prices went up for food, fuel and housing. It was Bidenomics, and many believe that was why Vice President Kamala Harris lost the November election.\n\nGovernment spending soared at the end of 2020 and continued long after the COVID-19 crisis. Prices went up after the “Inflation Reduction Act” as government spending at the federal level continued to grow and grow and grow. This was a big reason Mr. Trump ran on the idea that he would cut waste, fraud and abuse through the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nLiberals now falsely claim that Mr. Trump, Elon Musk and others on his team want to cut Social Security. That is a lie, as I repeatedly declared on CNN last week. Radicals and many in the corporate media are repeating this falsehood.\n\nYoung people, like most of us, overwhelmingly want to be able to pay our bills. The best way to provide relief is to extend the tax cuts to hardworking taxpayers, move quickly to restore free trade so that the United States and other nations are on a level playing field, and rein in the out-of-control government spending that is driving up prices.\n\n• Scott Walker is president of Young America’s Foundation.

Series one surprised the sceptics by rising above its pixelated source material, and the characters of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), far from coming across as NPCs, felt human and relatable. Just to bring you up to speed, global civilisation has collapsed following Trump’s announcement of tariffs (or maybe it was the deadly parasitic fungal virus that ate everyone’s brains), and humans are living under military rule and under the constant threat of attack by the Infected. Joel is charged with a perilous mission to bring teenager Ellie, who could hold the secret of a cure, across the wasteland that is now the US. The second series starts five years after the end of series one, and finds Joel and Ellie settling into a new community that looks like any frontier town from your favourite western. But this one is enclosed by a wall and heavily guarded, and the Clickers and Bloaters are out there somewhere preparing for their next attack. Even worse, Joel’s past is lurking in the shadows and about to catch up with him. Catherine O’Hara and Kaitlyn Dever join the cast for this second season, alongside Isabela Merced, who plays Dina, the girlfriend of Ramsey’s character, Ellie.\n\nTaken: Putin’s Stolen Children\n\nSunday, RTÉ2, 11.05pm\n\nSince Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have been accused of kidnapping Ukrainian children and bringing them to Russia for forced adoption. Families in Ukraine have been desperately trying to find out what happened to their stolen children, and this 2023 BBC documentary investigates the disappearance of more than 40 children from a children’s home in Kherson, following a trail that leads all the way up to the Kremlin.\n\nSunday, Channel 4, 9pm\n\nPassion, profound sensitivity and meticulous artistry – that’s Mika Penniman and John Batiste describing some of the nimble-fingered contestants on the new series of The Piano. Claudia Winkleman has been busy overseeing the back-stabbing fest that is hit reality contest The Traitors, but now she’s back to present this heartwarming search for Britain’s most talented amateur pianists. There’s no studio – the contest takes place in railway station concourses around the country where pianos have been installed for public use. We not only get to hear the contestants play – we also hear their stories of what moves them to make music. Singer-songwriter Penniman is back as a mentor, with Grammy, Oscar and Bafta winner Batiste – no stranger to performing in railway stations himself – joining the team.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nMonday, RTÉ2, 9.35pm\n\nElizabeth Moss is brilliant in this series based on the classic dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, but we can’t avoid the niggling feeling that stretching things out to a sixth series might be diluting the drama a bit. But this tale of Trumpian totalitarianism is still one of HBO’s biggest shows, and the final series promises to go out with a bang as June, formerly known as Offred, returns to Gilead to take down the patriarchal dictatorship formerly known as the United States of America once and for all. She’s not alone: the women of Gilead have had enough (so have we) and are ready to rise up and stick it to the man – all they need is someone like June to unite them in rebellion. Let’s hope she fares better than Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Golden Toilet Heist\n\nMonday, BBC One, 8.30pm\n\nIn the small hours of September 14th, 2019, thieves broke in to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire and made off with ... a toilet. Not just any old loo, but a solid-gold commode entitled “America”, made by conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan and valued at £5 million. It was a fully operational jacks, truly a throne fit for royalty to do their business, and visitors to Blenheim would queue up for the privilege of using the world’s most expensive WC. This documentary tells the inside story of this daring heist, which captured the public imagination and led to any number of potty puns in the press.\n\nRebuilding Notre-Dame: The Last Chapter\n\nMonday, BBC Two, 9pm\n\nIn April 2019, a devastating fire ripped through Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, destroying the wooden spire and most of the roof, and causing extensive damage to the walls and interiors. French president Emmanuel Macron promised the French people that Notre-Dame would be rebuilt within five years, and in this documentary, presenter Lucy Worsley gains exclusive access to the church to see how the final stages of its reconstruction are coming along. She finds technicians racing to complete the complex works and have the cathedral ready for its grand public reopening.\n\nHow to Cook Well in Morocco\n\nWednesday, RTÉ One, 8.30pm\n\nNeven, Donal and Catherine frequently jet around the globe cooking up exotic meals on the telly, and now it’s Rory’s turn to hit the global culinary trail in this new series of How to Cook Well. O’Connell has chosen one of his favourite destinations, Morocco, to make this seven-part series, the first time RTÉ has filmed a cookery series on the African continent. His journey begins in the cultural melting pot of Tangier, which has been a magnet for such writers as Tennessee Williams and Samuel Beckett. O’Connell visits the Blue Door Cuisine cookery school, run by women, and cooks up a fish tagine, enjoys harira soup and flatbreads cooked in a clay oven, and samples the city’s renowned street food.\n\nThe Stolen Girl\n\nFrom Wednesday, April 16th, Disney+\n\nElisa and Fred’s nine-year-old daughter, Lucia, has been invited for a sleepover with her new best friend, Josie, and she’s very excited. Elisa has no problem with this overnight playdate: Josie seems like a nice kid, her mum, Rebecca, is charming and personable, and their family home is gorgeous. The next morning Elisa goes to collect her daughter, and her whole world collapses. The house was nothing more than a holiday rental, and Rebecca and Josie have vanished – along with Lucia. But as police search Europe for the missing child, Elisa and Fred suddenly find themselves under suspicion, and as more is learned about Rebecca’s motives, Elisa’s perfect family facade begins to crumble. Denise Gough, Holliday Grainger, Ambika Mod and Jim Sturgess star in this British-made psychological thriller adapted from Playdate, Alex Dahl’s bestselling novel.\n\nThe Not Very Grand Tour\n\nFrom Friday, April 18th, Prime Video\n\nJeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond went on their final Grand Tour last year, in the swansong series One for the Road. So what are they doing back behind the wheel? And haven’t we seen some of this footage before? In this new series May and Hammond motor back through the archives to pick some of their favourite moments from previous Grand Tours. There’s no sign of Clarksie, however – he must be busy at Diddley Squat farm – although he’s there in footage form. It sounds as if Prime Video is trying to squeeze another series out of the trio before sending them to the wrecking yard, but if you’re a Grand Tour fan you might enjoy this drive down memory motorway. Episode one is a celebration of the combustion engine – well, what else would the petrolhead trio be celebrating?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) appeared to draw his largest crowd ever as part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in Los Angeles near City Hall on Saturday. About 36,000 people gathered for the rally, according to his team. Joan Baez, Maggie Rogers, Neil Young performed leading up to Sanders’ speech, and progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) introduced him.\n\n When Sanders took the stage, the crowd chanted “Bernie, Bernie.” He stopped them: “Nope. It’s not ‘Bernie.’ It is you.”\n\n The former presidential candidate strongly condemned President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire leading Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Sanders touched on a variety of issues including the minimum wage, climate change, and Medicare for All, but the main thread was one that has been consistent in his messaging: His movement is that of the 99 percent, not the one percent. \n\n “We’re going to make our revolution with joy,” Sanders said. “We’re going to sing and dance our way to victory against hatred and divisiveness.”\n\n Sanders noted that Musk had posted a video to X on Friday showing that Sanders has been warning that America is becoming an oligarchy for decades. “Well, Elon, you’re damn right, that’s what I’ve been talking about,” Sanders said.\n\n “The difference is I’m no longer talking about how we’re moving to oligarchy. I’m talking about how we are living today in an oligarchic form of society. Three months ago, when Trump was inaugurated, standing right behind him during his inauguration, were the three wealthiest people in this country, Mr. Musk, Mr. [Jeff] Bezos and Mr. [Mark] Zuckerberg. And right behind them, were 13 other billionaires who Trump had nominated to head up major federal agencies. And that, brothers and sisters, is what oligarchy is all about.”\n\n Musk, for his part, spent $290 million to elect Trump and Republicans in 2024, before being gifted a role with DOGE to purge the federal workforce. \n\n Following Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump, Democratic leaders have struggled to mobilize an opposition in Washington. Some voters appear to be looking to Sanders for an answer.\n\n “He understands this moment,” Sanders adviser Faiz Shakir told The Washington Post. “There’s a muscularity in the way he wants to fight against them with a clear conviction of where we would go.”\n\n “Look, I don’t have to tell anyone here that this is a difficult moment,” Sanders said. “We’ve never gone through anything like this, but this is what I do want to say. Despair is not an option. Giving up and hiding under the covers is not acceptable. The stakes are just too high.”\n\n Ocasio-Cortez emphasized that Sanders’ progressive movement is about class solidarity.\n\n “Hate is a trap that sticks us all, and standing together without exception to reject division — that is the only way we can win,” she said. “It’s the only way we can win. So I hope you see that this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but it’s about class solidarity. It is about the thousands of you who came out here today to stand together and say, ‘Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect, no matter who we are.’”\n\n Sanders ended by appealing to people across the political spectrum to fight the oligarchy. \n\n “I’m not going to tell you that it’s going to be easy. It’s not,” Sanders said. “We’re going to have to fight them, door to door, workplace to workplace, school to school. We’re gonna have to educate, we’re gonna have to mobilize, we’re gonna have to stand up in a dozen different ways.

Kennedy Jr. called out establishment media attacks against him in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, saying that he believes “it’s always ironic how the liberal media weaponizes woke cancel culture to safeguard the interests of Big Pharma and Big Food.”\n\nKennedy was responding to a baseless onslaught after several publications misquoted him Friday in his use of the word “retarded” to evoke the proper name of a New York state mental facility.\n\nThe deluge of condemnation came after reports of the Secretary’s remarks to a gathering of the staff of the Food and Drug Administration at the agency’s headquarters in White Oak, Maryland.\n\nMediaite spun his appearance with the headline: “FDA Staffers Dish on Unhinged Meeting With RFK Jr. Where He Called Special Olympics Athletes ‘Retarded.’”\n\nThe Daily Beast headlined it: “Staffers Walk Out of RFK Jr.’s Slur-Ridden Speech About Deep State.”\n\nKennedy told Breitbart News the coverage is yet another demonstration of the axiom by 17th century satirist Jonathan Swift: “Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it.”\n\nThe mischaracterization of Kennedy’s remarks came from the 33-minute mark of his 40-minute speech where he was explaining his passion for solving autism and other mental health issues. There, according to the speech’s official transcript, Kennedy said:\n\nBecause of my family’s commitment to these issues, I spent 200 hours at Wassaic Home for the Retarded when I was in high school. So, I was seeing people with intellectual disabilities all the time. I never saw anybody with autism. We, you know, we prided ourselves on Special Olympics about being able to take care of every child, no matter how.\n\nThe HHS Secretary said Politico reporters first mischaracterized his remarks, writing he’d used a disparaging term for the mentally disabled. Early versions of the story were corrected after Kennedy’s staff repeatedly complained to editors there. However, using anonymous sources, Politico is still reporting:\n\n“The remark jolted several FDA employees in the audience, who misheard the reference and thought he was making a derogatory remark about people with intellectual disabilities, according to two employees granted anonymity for fear of retaliation. By the end of the event, billed as a welcome from the new commissioner, Marty Makary, several FDA staffers had walked out of the rooms where the speech was being broadcast…”\n\nIn fact, Kennedy was talking about the New York state facility in Wassaic that’s gone by several names over the decades, including for many years the “Wassaic State School for the Mentally Retarded.” It was founded in 1931. Other historical names could be considered equally outdated, including the school for “Feeble Minded Children” and the “School for Mental Defectives.”\n\nAs late as 1973, the New York Times was calling it the “School for the Retarded” in its headlines.\n\n“I was referring to an institution,” Kennedy told Breitbart News. “They turned it into a vile slur of a vulnerable group that my family has spent generations championing.”\n\nThe HHS Secretary was no doubt referring to his aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics in 1968. His uncle President John F. Kennedy also pushed research into intellectual disability, including the establishment of the “President’s Panel on Mental Retardation.” The word “retarded” eventually fell out of favor as a medical term.\n\nPolitico, meanwhile, clarified its coverage of RFK Jr.’s remarks in a mid-afternoon Friday post on X:\n\n“For the record: This article and headline have been updated to make clear that Kennedy was referring to the Wassaic State School for the Mentally Retarded where he worked in high school, not using a derogatory term for people with intellectual disabilities.”\n\nBy then, however, the out of context reporting had taken flight in damning copycat headlines, tweets and comments under stories featured on news websites.\n\nMore generally, this fake attack on Kennedy comes amid a broader debate on the use of the word “retarded” and whether it should be acceptable. While Kennedy’s use of the word does not seem to fit into that debate–he was literally using the proper name of a major institution when he said the word–podcaster Joe Rogan has argued it should be culturally acceptable to use the word in a manner to describe undesirable things. Rogan has called the word’s renewed acceptance culturally in that framing as a cultural victory against cancel culture:\n\nEven with its clarification, the Politico story and others painted a negative picture of the Kennedy FDA appearance. Its Friday story also implied Kennedy insulted his audience by telling FDA employees they were the “sock puppet” of industry and that he was a conspiracy theorist for saying the “Deep State is real.”\n\nAccording to the official transcript of the speech, Kennedy was referring to the immense influence the food and drug lobby has had on the FDA as well as its revolving door of directors who have come from and gone back to those industries.\n\nKennedy told attendees: “It (the FDA) was created out of the most idealistic impulses. But it, like every agency, became captured by the industry and at one point really became a sock puppet of the industry it was supposed to regulate.”\n\nKennedy laughed when Breitbart News asked him about his emotional reaction to the coverage. He’s had to develop a thick skin. “It’s not the first time,” he told Breitbart News.\n\nKennedy has long been attacked by the establishment media, even before he abandoned the Democrat Party to first run as an independent for president last year and then endorse now-President Donald Trump.\n\nLoosely portrayed for years as an “anti-vaxxer,” Kennedy continues to maintain he’s not opposed to shots but is for “safe vaccines” and wants them studied more thoroughly.\n\nAfter a 2019 speech at a rally in Washington he was called an antisemite because he said the state surveillance ability with modern technology was far more powerful than the secret annex Anne Frank had hiding from the Nazis.\n\nWhen he suggested the COVID virus was hatched from a lab in Wuhan, the Scientific American labeled Kennedy an anti-Asian racist and “known conspiracy theorist.”\n\nLegacy Media took him to task for arguing that scientific papers showed COVID-19 was attacking certain races disproportionately, specifically blacks and Caucasians, while Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese had higher immunity. Kennedy later had to refute reports that he was hatching a bioweapon conspiracy, saying he never implied one was engineered to target groups.\n\nOther disparaging stories in 2024 reported Kennedy went looking for a job with a future Kamala Harris administration, was rebuffed, and settled for Donald Trump. Kennedy has said it was never about a job, which would pay much less than what he made as an environmental attorney, but who would commit to bringing the USA back to good health.\n\nAny other version could be nothing further from the truth. Ironically, for many years he was a harsh Donald Trump critic.\n\n“Every morning I prayed for 19 years,” he’s said in several settings. “I have been praying every day when I get out of bed that God will put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic so we can restore health to our children. And God sent me Donald Trump.”\n\nKennedy added in his conversation with Breitbart News about all this that he was “lucky” he didn’t mention the National Association of Colored People (NAACP) or the United Negro College Fund in his speech at the FDA. “The media outrage would have been predictable,” he said.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

That’s the percentage of people who support requiring a photo ID to vote, according to Gallup polling, with 83% supporting showing proof of citizenship when registering to vote. \n\n“Today, we’re voting on what Republicans are calling the SAVE Act, but let’s be real, it’s a straight-up voter suppression bill,” claimed Rep. Jasmine Crockett (R-TX), who is quickly emerging as the face of the Democratic Party on the media front. Crockett also argued the United States needs more illegal immigrants to pick cotton, which isn’t racist or anything. \n\n“The SAVE Act is a voter suppression bill,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) declared before the vote. “We dare you to bring the SAVE Act to the floor.” \n\nCrockett and Jeffries are at least partially correct: This is a voter suppression bill. But their false premise is that voters who live here legally will be suppressed when the fact is that the only people who will find it far more difficult to vote will be millions of illegal immigrants Democrats welcomed into the country under the Biden-Harris administration. \n\nAnd that was always the plan. Allow millions into the country, give them free stuff like healthcare, provide the ability to obtain a driver’s license, and eventually, the right to vote. This is what happened in Democratic Gov. Tim Walz’s Minnesota, where more than 80,000 illegal immigrants received driver’s licenses after the governor signed the Driver’s Licenses For All Act in 2023. \n\n“The Democrats have made their election playbook clear. Let over 10 million illegal immigrants into our country and allow them to vote,” Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) said in response to the law. “Minnesotans need to be able to trust in our election system, which is why we will not stop fighting to ensure that only legal citizens are voting in our elections.”\n\nIn New York City, Democrats attempted to allow 800,000 illegal immigrants to vote in mayoral, city council, and school board elections. But the Republican National Committee fought back and challenged the city council in court, which struck down the measure in the New York State Court of Appeals by a 6-1 vote. \n\nOn the national level, the Blue Team continues to make the ridiculous argument that it is somehow exceedingly difficult for minorities to obtain proof of citizenship. Take former Vice President Kamala Harris, for example, the runaway favorite, as of now, to be the Democratic nominee in 2028, who once made this case for ID-less voting: \n\n“In some people’s mind, [a voter ID requirement] means you’re going to have to Xerox or photocopy your ID to send it in to prove who you are,” she told BET. “Well, there are a whole lot of people, especially people who live in rural communities, who don’t — there’s no Kinkos, there’s no OfficeMax near them.”\n\nSpoken like a true San Francisco elitist, don’t you think? \n\nDemocrats like Harris have no leg to stand on here. Not just because of polling showing that even a majority of Democrats support proof of citizenship when voting, but also given their hysterical overreactions to Republicans in Georgia passing commonsense voter ID laws in 2021. \n\n“This is Jim Crow in the 21st century. It must end,” then-President Joe Biden bellowed.\n\n“There are components of it that are indeed racist because they use racial animus as a means of targeting the behaviors of certain voters to eliminate their participant and limit their participation in elections,” Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams said in Senate hearings after the law was passed in 2021.\n\nAs this was happening, Democrats were attempting to pass a “voting rights” bill that would have imposed a federal takeover of the election system. One key component of the bill would have greatly weakened voter ID requirements, which included allowing student IDs to be used to vote and “sworn written statements” to be submitted if a voter didn’t have an ID. \n\n‘No, really. … I am John Smith. I swear! You have to believe me.”\n\nWell, that should do it. \n\nFortunately, former Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema refused efforts to blow up the filibuster, and the bill died in the Senate despite all 50 Democratic senators supporting the bill. \n\nNo matter. On cue, the media took the side of the party they serve. \n\n“Failure on Voting Rights Would Be Historic” — New York Times\n\n“Manchin, Sinema join with GOP in rejecting attempt to change filibuster rules, effectively killing Democratic voting bill” — Washington Post \n\n“How Joe Manchin Knifed the Democrats — and Bailed on Saving Democracy” — Rolling Stone\n\nFor its part, MLB moved its All-Star Game out of Atlanta, a huge blow to local businesses. Georgia-based companies, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, and the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons condemned the new law. \n\nBut then, a funny thing happened: In Georgia’s next statewide election, voting records were shattered. In three weeks of early voting in 2022, there was a 212% jump over the 2020 presidential primaries and a 168% increase over the 2018 gubernatorial primaries. \n\nAs for making things more difficult to vote, a survey conducted by the University of Georgia at the time found that precisely 0% of black respondents said they had a “poor” experience when voting. \n\nOverall, Democrats keep walking into the same trap. Yes, they aren’t allowing some GOP bills to pass in the Senate, but they’re also writing the easiest campaign ads for Republican candidates. \n\nProtecting biological women from competing against biological men? Democrats took the 20 side of that 80/20 issue, with 203 Democrats in the House voting against a bill to do just that. \n\nPresident Donald Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency to audit hopelessly bloated and wasteful government agencies, and Democrats not only oppose it but say Trump and Elon Musk are attempting to destroy democracy in the process. A recent CBS poll shows 77% of people support DOGE’s mission. \n\nDemocrats are also opposing any and all of Trump’s proposals on the economy, including extending the Trump tax cuts from his first term. Not smart. \n\nDemocrats say Trump isn’t bringing down costs of everyday items, and then a report came out this week showing inflation is at a five-year low. Egg prices are down 50%, and energy prices are down 30%. \n\nBetter trade deals are coming. \n\nThe border is secure. \n\nPrivate sector employment is skyrocketing. \n\nMilitary recruitment is way up. \n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are a thing of the past. \n\nAs Trump approaches 100 days in office, Democrats are seen as the party of blind resistance while they tacitly support what can only be called domestic terrorism. The party refuses to condemn publicly the firebombing of Tesla dealerships and the vandalism of privately owned Teslas, which were once embraced by Democrats as the electric vehicle here to help save the planet.\n\nApproval of the party that appropriately uses a donkey as its logo stands at 21%, according to Quinnipiac. NBC News has the party in its polling at 27%, while CNN clocks in at 29%. Gas station sushi is more popular. \n\nAnd it gets worse in another CNN poll regarding Trump’s tariff war. On the question to voters, “Who cares for the needs of people like me?” Republicans and Democrats are now tied thanks to big gains among working-class voters. \n\n“One of the most shocking pieces of poll data I truthfully have seen this year, or maybe in any prior year,” CNN pollster Harry Enten exclaimed. “Look at prior years! Democrats ALWAYS lead on this question! 13 points. 23 points. 19 points … now, a tie?! \n\n“All of a sudden the Democrats, who were the party of the people. No more!”\n\nOut of its instinct to reject Trump on everything, the party has lost all common sense. \n\nVoters certainly know what Democrats are against, even on policies and positions that 8 in 10 people support. The big problem is it’s increasingly more difficult to know exactly what they’re for.","summary":"208.

We don’t even see ‘impact documentaries’ anymore. We see them at festivals, but they’re not being sold. The buyers aren’t really interested in impact documentaries anymore. So, it’s particularly meaningful and important that the Miami Film Festival has given me this award at this time in history.”\n\nThe presentation of the award, made by MFF executive director James Woolley, came after a screening of Williams’ 2023 feature Stamped From the Beginning – one of the rare ‘impact documentaries’ to be backed by a streamer, in this case Netflix (would Netflix acquire it today, were it were being released now, in Trump’s America? A hypothetical for another day). The film, based on the book by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, examines structural racism in the U.S. stretching from before the country’s founding up to the present day.\n\n“I think Stamped From the Beginning is particularly important now, but I also think it’s kind of inspiring for folks who are down about what’s going on in the world because this isn’t new,” Williams says. “Throughout history, especially for Black Americans, we have always fought. We’re always the people who are fighting for democracy, fighting for human rights, and in Stamped you see when we have big setbacks and historical setbacks that have happened over and over and over and over and over again to Black Americans, there’s a resistance. We get inspired, we get motivated, then there’s a [backlash], and the pendulum swings the other way. So, we’re looking at the backlash right now from the Obama years, Biden years, Kamala Harris. We’re looking at the pendulum swing, but there will be a resistance to that.”\n\nHe adds, “This isn’t permanent, what’s happening. And when someone as brilliant as Ibram X. Kendi, a historian, can look at the bigger history — that’s what’s great about seeing the film, you see it in a new light. You’re like, ‘Oh wait, this isn’t something new. This isn’t something that’s happening to us for the first time, to marginalized people, people of color.’ This has happened before, and we fought back, and we’ve won. So, I look at it as an inspirational, positive call to action.”\n\nStamped From the Beginning was shortlisted for the Academy Awards and earned a nomination for a primetime Emmy Award. It’s consonant with Williams’ 2023 Emmy-winning documentary series The 1619 Project, based on the sensational Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times series created by Nikole Hannah-Jones. In fact, Stamped connects with a great deal of the Williams canon.\n\n“There’s no one in America more resilient than Black Americans. And that’s what The Apollo was about, that’s what 1619 is about. Stamped From the Beginning, High on the Hog, all of it,” he observes. “The theme of my work is Black resilience, and that will continue in future work and will continue to be the reality of Black people. There’s no one more resilient than us. There’s no one who’s been through more than we have been through — dragged here against our will, through the Middle Passage and slavery, and thrived and defined culture in many ways in America. We’ve had a president, culture-defining music, jazz and rap, and R&B, and dance. Every fabric of American life is built on Black culture and Black labor.”\n\nStamped From the Beginning, winner of the National Book Award, was published in 2016, the year Donald Trump was elected president the first time. Now, in his second term of office, Trump has made a top priority of dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion programs – and, indeed, scrubbing mention of diversity or the achievements of African Americans from anything that falls within the purview of the federal government or that benefits from government funding. According to a New York Times report published Friday, just over a week ago the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD purged books from its library shelves related to the Holocaust, gender, LGBTQ identity, and Maya Angelou’s memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, among hundreds of other books. But it left untouched Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf and other books with a racist ideology.\n\nPer the report, “Political appointees in the Department of the Navy’s leadership decided which books to remove.”\n\nSimilarly, the Trump administration is investigating Yale, MIT and dozens of other colleges and universities “for alleged racial discrimination,” according to reports in Fortune and other news outlets, “as part of President Donald Trump’s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs.”\n\nLast week, Williams traveled to Yale for a screening of Stamped From the Beginning hosted by the university’s Office of Inclusion and Diversity.\n\n“They said to us, ‘Well, you’re probably one of the last events because Diversity and Inclusion is being renamed,’” Williams shares. “And even the Afro-American Center, which has been there for 55 years, is under threat of losing their space and shutting down.”\n\nWilliams was joined for a Q&A at Yale by Stamped producers Alisa Payne and David Teague; Dr. Kendi participated via Zoom. “The questions [from the students] were all, ‘Can you give us words of encouragement to keep fighting? How do we find the strength to keep going when all this is happening to us?’” Williams notes. “And Dr. Kendi said, ‘If you do nothing, terrible things will happen to you. You will keep suffering. But if you get out and you fight and you do something, terrible things may happen to you. So, they’re going to happen regardless. If you fight, you actually may make a difference and create change. You can sit back and let it all happen to you and do nothing, or you can go out and fight and let it all happen to you and actually maybe make a difference…’ They were very inspired by that.”\n\nWilliams says neither he nor the African American community as a whole has abandoned hope.\n\n“We going to continue to fight to uphold the ideals of democracy,” he says. “But we’re also going to continue in our lives and Black joy and the positive things and community.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor a documentary filmmaker, there’s no greater compliment than to hear the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Miami Film Festival Honors Roger Ross Williams with Impact Award for &#8216;Stamped From The Beginning&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/miami-film-festival-honors-roger-ross-williams-with-impact-award-for-stamped-from-the-beginning/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-‘Stamped-From-The-Beginnings-Roger-Ross-Williams.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 21:56:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.272},{"id":310584366,"title":"Kamala Harris Looks for a Way Back In","text":"Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

Six agencies being hobbled by illegal mass firings? Not an emergency. The Trump administration’s desire to keep six agencies hobbled by illegal mass firings? Totally an emergency. \n\nRelated | Supreme Court blocks order for Trump to reinstate federal workers \n\nTo be fair, the meager two-paragraph ruling doesn’t say that. Instead, it’s about standing—that the organizations that brought the lawsuit are not the proper parties to do so. That standing discussion let the court sidestep a key basis for the lower court’s reinstatement ruling: the Office of Personnel Management, which dictated and oversaw the mass firings, has no authority to do so, as one agency can’t hire and fire employees in another agency. It also rewards the Trump administration’s obviously false assertion that the individual agencies, not OPM, made the firing decisions. \n\nThe Supreme Court also decided to do Trump a solid by temporarily blocking two lower court orders reversing the removal of appointed members of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. \n\nThe removal of Cathy Harris from the MSPB destroyed that board’s quorum, so it can’t hear any matters about wrongfully fired federal employees. \n\nThe removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB means that body also has no quorum and therefore can’t hear any cases about private sector unions and labor disputes. Again, there seems to be no sense of urgency that public and private employees be allowed to pursue the remedies they’re entitled to under law. The only urgency is that Trump be allowed to do what he wants. \n\nThe Trump administration’s legal theory here is that the Supreme Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor, the nearly 100-year-old case that makes it illegal for Trump to remove the heads of these boards without cause. Normally, parties do not get to defy existing law outright and then, after being ruled against, race to the Supreme Court to make an argument about why the law should change while still refusing to follow existing law. Harris, Wilcox, and workers everywhere are the ones who are out of luck here, not the administration. \n\nAllowing the administration to change its story every time it gets caught out or to break the law whenever it suits Trump is just as much of a problem for the Supreme Court as it is for the lower courts. \n\nIt’s unimaginable that any other party—or any other administration—would be allowed this much grace. These aren’t theoretical discussions over timeless legal principles. These are cases where the administration is doing everything it can to flout the law, and everyone else is just trying to stay afloat. But somehow, it’s the administration that keeps getting its way. \n\nHouse GOP votes to ban nationwide injunctions, forgetting how much they love nationwide injunctions\n\nRepublicans are unhappy federal district courts are issuing nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration rather than narrow orders that only apply to the parties in the lawsuit. To fix that, the House GOP pushed through a bill that would bar federal district court judges from making those nationwide rulings. \n\nRelated | House Republicans rally around 'idiotic' plan to punish judges\n\nConservatives, however, love nationwide injunctions when they get to pick who does the enjoining. That’s why they file cases in two Texas courts where they’re guaranteed to get results. \n\nJudge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, has issued nationwide rulings blocking Obama-era guidance on student access to bathrooms based on gender identity, invalidating a Biden administration restriction on ghost guns, and striking down many of the Affordable Care Act’s requirements for preventative coverage. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump appointee and anti-choice fanatic Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk singlehandedly blocked the sale of mifepristone across the country, albeit only briefly.\n\nThe real issue here isn’t nationwide injunctions. It’s that the Trump administration keeps getting handed losses by pesky lower court judges who don’t understand that their job is to let Trump do whatever he wants. How dare they. \n\nTrump stays losing, defamation edition\n\nIt’s not just the Trump administration that keeps losing in federal court. \n\nTrump still faces civil cases where he’s a defendant for personal, not official, behavior. Last week, he was handed a loss when a federal judge in Pennsylvania refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by the long-exonerated Central Park Five. \n\nDuring the September 2024 presidential debate, after then-Vice President Kamala Harris brought up that Trump took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the boys, Trump doubled down, “They pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.” \n\nAfter the exonerated men sued him for defamation, Trump argued the case should be dismissed because his statement was substantially true. \n\nOf course, none of them pleaded guilty, none of them hurt anyone, and no one was killed, period, which makes Trump’s statement not even remotely true. \n\nThis ruling means their lawsuit against Trump can continue. Well, at least until Trump figures out how to get the Supreme Court to invent a new kind of presidential immunity that covers his actions as a private citizen. \n\nThe Bible says Trump can target law firms. Checkmate, libs.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see what it would look like if a Daily Caller comment section gained sentience and wrote a legal brief, look no further. \n\nA motley collection of fringe gun types joined forces with a couple of the more low-rent conservative legal groups to file a truly breathtaking amicus brief in Perkins Coie’s lawsuit against the Trump administration over the executive order targeting that law firm. \n\nTypically, amicus briefs are intended to provide additional expertise or context beyond what is presented by the parties in the case. \n\nThis … isn’t that. Instead, it’s a wild ride that cites multiple random Bible verses that happen to mention judges, leans heavily on a Dan Bongino book from 2018, and stitches together a bunch of news articles about the Steele Dossier and former Perkins Coie attorney Marc Elias. It also has a list of injunctions and restraining orders issued against the administration. Actual law, not so much. \n\nTaken together, this is all supposed to prove that the lower federal courts hate Trump and “are working at the behest of Big Law and Democrat state Attorneys General to resist the very changes which the American People elected President Trump to implement.” \n\nIt’s tough to develop a conspiracy theory that sounds more unhinged than those floated to support Trump’s contention that he won the 2020 election, but this one might just take the cake. \n\nBig Law watch: Which knees this week?\n\nBy this time last week, another two big firms, Milbank and Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, had each agreed to give the administration $100 million in pro bono work to avoid the now-familiar attack by executive order. \n\nThis week, mega-firms Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett are reportedly preparing to do the same. Trump boasted about his latest victory on his social media platform on Friday, claiming the firms will provide “$500 Million Dollars in pro bono and other free Legal services, during the Trump Administration and beyond.” \n\nAt least the earliest firms to buckle didn’t know yet that Trump would make a mockery of their vague agreements about shared pro bono goals. But the Trump team spent this week crowing about firms that “bend the knee”—an actual quote from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt—saying they’ll provide free legal services to implement his so-called America First agenda, perhaps by representing coal companies or negotiating tariff deals. \n\nSomehow, that didn’t deter more of America’s highest-paid and highest-profile lawyers from lining up for the same treatment. Meanwhile, their willingness to let Trump take over their firms just emboldened him further. \n\nHis latest executive order is against Susman Godfrey, saying the firm “spearhead[ed] efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.”\n\nRelated | Trump targets law firm that made Fox News pay for 2020 election lies\n\nSusman isn’t a firm associated with representing mostly Democrats or employing lawyers Trump hates. Nor is it a firm that usually handles election matters. However, Susman represents Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuits against Fox News, Newsmax, Rudy Giuliani, and other 2020 Big Lie types. Susman also represents Media Matters in its lawsuit against Elon Musk’s X. \n\nSo now, even if a firm steers clear of Democratic clients and election work and never employs someone Trump is mad at, it’s still not enough.","summary":"Now that some cases against the Trump administration are reaching the Supreme Court, it’s time to find out whether the conservatives on the nation’s highest court will remember how checks and balances work.\n\n\n\nThus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory, even though these cases only deal with early stages and preliminary relief. \n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court paused a California lower court’s ruling reinstating 16,000 probationary employees displays similar confusion about what constitutes an emergency. Six agencies being hobbled by illegal mass firings? Not an emergency. The Trump administration’s desire to keep six agencies hobbled by illegal mass firings? Totally an emergency. \n\n\n\n\nRelated | Supreme Court blocks order for Trump to reinstate federal workers \n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, the meager two-paragraph ruling doesn’t say that.

But it's not just the prime minister's vernacular where podcasters — and others with big social media followings — are showing influence.\n\nThis election, politicians have opened the door to podcasters and social media personalities like never before.\n\nExclusive interviews, invitations to budget lock-up, early access to policy announcements and the chance to join the campaign trail — should they want to.\n\nThe ABC has revealed some influencers are even being paid by teal independent Allegra Spender and Climate 200 to create content.\n\nIt is being quietly facilitated by Sentiment Agency — founded by musician and activist Holly Rankin, also known as Jack River.\n\nThe web connecting politicians and influencers has caused experts to raise transparency questions, suggesting current laws haven't kept pace.\n\n'Teal' pays for positive influencer comment\n\nInfluencer and mental health advocate Milly Rose Bannister this week posted two \"in collaboration\" videos — one with independent Allegra Spender, the other with Climate 200.\n\nSpender has admitted to paying Sentiment agency to commission the content. \n\nClimate 200's executive director, Byron Fay, also acknowledged they connected with Australians through \"creator partnerships\".\n\n\"We're proud to work with Aussie creators to make content that aligns with their values,\" he said.\n\nTik Tok creator Luke Gallagher is among those to have posted a video \"made in collaboration\" with Spender.\n\nA spokesman for Spender said sometimes creators were \"compensated for their time, to cover things like production costs,\" but, \"the final editorial decisions of the content are completely up to the content creators\".\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, Bannister defended the content and partnership, saying she strongly believed in Spender’s approach to politics and delivering information to young Australians. \n\n\"The content I create is entirely based on my own views, voice and research, and I stand by them,\" she said. \"Digital advocates like me, who follow the publishing guidelines of the AEC, are entitled to be remunerated for their time and quality of work, just as traditional media workers are. We are helping to bridge the gap between politics and young people and reaching voters who don't connect with old media. We should be encouraging more of that, not less.\" \n\nRegarding the authorisation wording, the AEC said the specific words of \"authorised by\" were not required.\n\nMarketing agency, Sentiment, that worked with Spender to identify content creators, also defended its work.\n\n\"We ensure compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our business, which in an electoral campaign means working with clients on appropriate authorisation under the electoral laws,\" the agency said in a statement. \n\nLabor invited influencers to the budget lock-up\n\nBannister was also part of a group taken on a Parliament tour in February by Rankin, where they were introduced to a range of independents.\n\nLast month Labor also invited a group of content creators into the government's budget lock-up, including Bannister. The party paid for some of the influencers' travel costs, but it insists there was no requirement for the attendees to post, let alone share something positive.\n\nRather, it was part of an influencer outreach program that has been running for a year. As part of this, Labor is continuing to consider how it can engage with content creators as part of its on-the-road campaign, but so far none have joined them.\n\nLabor also appeared to have sent an early copy of its press release about a mental health policy announcement to Bannister, as is common with mainstream media outlets.\n\nCollaborative posts across the parliament\n\nOther parties and candidates are engaging in the influencer space too.\n\nOlympic diver and social media star Sam Fricker was invited to attend Peter Dutton's budget reply speech, and filmed a video with him afterwards. Fricker said he was not paid.\n\nGreens senator Larissa Waters has also filmed videos with supportive content creator Holly MacAlpine, who is a party member but said she had never been paid to create political content. Both Greens leader Adam Bandt and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also made high profile appearances on Abbie Chatfield's podcast It's A Lot, but she too said no payment was involved.\n\nAs politicians continue to engage with podcasters and other social media personalities, the Australian Electoral Commission has updated its guidance, telling politicians and parties they must authorise co-authored Instagram posts with influencers.\n\nHow much influence does an influencer have?\n\nWhie some politicians have sought to raise concerns about the rise of influencers in the political space, there's acknowledgement from all sides that they are a useful communication vehicle to connect with younger and online audiences. \n\nParticularly podcasts. The general consensus is it's an hour of their time, can result in hundreds of thousands (if not more) of ears and eyes across various platforms, and largely doesn't have the same combativeness a journalist might apply. It's also just a chance to meet Australians where they are: online.\n\nHannah Ferguson is a 26-year-old podcaster and commentator who delivers \"news that talks back\" through her business Cheek Media. Across her Instagram accounts, her following is 200,000 strong.\n\nFerguson says she's talking to an audience of largely young women — a demographic that can be hard to capture through traditional media. That makes her and Cheek Media influential, and politicians know it.\n\nIn recent weeks she's landed interviews with both PM Albanese and Greens leader Bandt. \n\nIn a sign of how influential those in the halls of Canberra think content creators have become, nearly a dozen politicians cleared time in their schedules during a busy sitting week in February to meet her, including Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.\n\nFerguson was also one of the social media influencers invited to the federal budget lock-up, where they received a briefing from Senator Gallagher. She said her travel was not paid for.\n\n\"I think that the new wave is Instagram and TikTok and…what they [voters] are consuming defines their view of the news and their view of politicians, so I think it's hugely important,\" Ferguson says. \"It could define the federal election in 2025.\"\n\nPolitical marketing expert Andrew Hughes called this election a \"tipping point\" because of how many people consume news through their devices.\n\n\"That means now you have to have knowledge of online platforms and methods to be effective at changing behaviour in politics,\" he says.\n\nThe political influence of influencers is growing\n\nFerguson's page posts news, but she says she's not a journalist. She's openly biased and admits she's trying to sway voters to the left.\n\n\"I would describe it as incredibly left wing, progressive feminist content, I don't think there's any point in shying away from that language,\" she said.\n\n\"I am a young, 26-year-old woman with my own company, and I am talking, especially, to an audience of young women, predominantly about the issues they are facing.\"\n\nShe's a former Labor party member, current Greens member and supports the independent cause. So much so, she sits on the advisory council of Viva Fund — which distributes money to female independent candidates.\n\nShe's also fiercely anti-Peter Dutton — to the point she had T-shirts made.\n\nAustralian laws not keeping up\n\nAhead of the upcoming election, political marketing researcher at the Australian National University, Andrew Hughes, has been observing the influence of content creators and is concerned transparency isn't top of mind for everyone.\n\n\"If you're a person on TikTok [and] you've got 100,000 people watching you and watching your content, when you put a view out — are you influenced by a political party, or are you doing it because you're a person?\" he questioned.\n\n\"I think that point will become very hard to spot in the years ahead.\"\n\nHe said Australian laws had failed to keep pace with the changing online environment.\n\n\"There's been no clarity at all provided in Australian legislation on having podcasters identify their brand partnerships, and particularly whether or not they're being paid any money for a brand partnership to do an interview which is friendly or not towards a leader,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the scary thing.\"\n\nPodcasts allow personality over policy\n\nNovember's US election saw both Presidential candidates turn to podcasts to connect with an audience they may not otherwise have been able to — and they clocked up millions of views.\n\nJoe Rogan's interview with Donald Trump was watched on YouTube by more than 60 million people, while Shannon Sharpe's chat with Kamala Harris reached 1.7 million eyes on YouTube. Dr Hughes warned the pivot to podcasts put greater emphasis on the person rather than their policies.\n\nHughes warned it put a greater emphasis on the person rather than their policies.\n\n\"It means we move away from policy analysis,\" he said.\n\nThat was already becoming clear in the Australian campaign, Hughes said, with both leaders appearing in a series of podcast interviews.\n\n\"The leaders have come out quite clearly with a plan to make people like them, make people see that other side to them — the non-political side to them.\"","summary":"Politicians are on a mission this election to connect with voters online like never before.

Shapiro appearance hints about future of Democratic Party","text":"Believe it or not, the 2028 presidential election isn’t all that far off, especially in this modern era of political fundraising and positioning. On the Republican side, one might assume that Vice President J. D. Vance is a strong favorite to be the party’s nominee to succeed President Donald Trump. On the other side, the Democratic Party is in shambles, lacking a standard-bearer, a message, or policies that register on the common-sense meter. That doesn’t mean that the jockeying hasn’t begun. On the West Coast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has started distancing himself from progressive policy and ideology, publicly admitting that biological men competing against biological women in sports is unfair. Newsom has even started a podcast, on which he has featured right-wing commentators such as Charlie Kirk.\n\nHere in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro has begun to do the same thing. He recently appeared on Bill Maher’s HBO program to position himself as a moderate Democrat. Shapiro spoke with the host of “Real Time” on a variety of subjects, including the Democratic Party’s struggle with male voters, whether his Jewish heritage played a role in losing out to Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate, and other issues.\n\nShapiro and Newsom’s gradual slide rightward is part of a plan to separate themselves from Democrats’ left-wing faction in light of new polling that shows an historic decline for Democrats. According to CNN, the Democrats’ favorability rating has plummeted to just 29%, the lowest mark since 1992, and it represents a twenty-point drop in just four years.\n\n“Common sense is going to be what wins the election. Trump has already said, ‘I want a revolution of common sense.’ The fact that he can appropriate that term!” Maher marveled. “I’m not sure he’s the arbiter of common sense,” Shapiro replied. “That’s certainly one reason why he won the election,” Maher said. “People saw Democrats as less commonsensical.”\n\nMaher is right: Trump won because his policies made sense. A thriving economy, reducing inflation, cutting spending, creating energy independence, securing the border, stopping pointless wars and restoring law and order. That message resonated. It won.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party decided to label straight, white, male voters as the definition of toxic masculinity. The question remains: How will Democrats win those voters back, after alienating them and speaking down to them? It’s not by nominating a Jasmine Crockett, J. B. Pritzker, or even a Gavin Newsom. Josh Shapiro is likely their best chance in 2028. But bridging the great American political divide will be easier said than done.\n\nAccording to Steve Kornacki of NBC News, the largest divide in the American electorate is between white, non-college-educated male voters and white, college-educated female voters. The data reflect a massive ideological gap that might not be correctable in one election cycle. Trump enjoys a +41 rating with non-college white males. He registers a -38 with college-educated white women. That’s a 79-point difference. The same pattern and trend exists between the two demographics when the personalities or topics are replaced. Swap out Trump and insert J. D. Vance, Elon Musk, DOGE, Ukraine, or DEI policies and the results are almost identical.\n\nFactor in Trump’s gains with the Latino community as well as the gains he made with African-American male voters, and the Democrats face an uphill battle, to say the least. They have fallen out of favor with common-sense, middle-of-the-road, working-class men.\n\nMaher asked Shapiro if Democrats have a problem courting male voters. Shapiro denied it. “I don’t think we do,” he said. “I think it’s about giving everybody equal opportunity.”\n\nThe evidence points the other way. The female vote is not enough to carry Democrats over the finish line. Neither is the support of coastal elites or fringe communities. They need more male voters to abandon the GOP – or overcome their voting apathy and come out and support Democrats. If Shapiro’s appearance on Maher’s program was a preview of the case he’ll make nationally a few years from now, it doesn’t bode well for the Democratic Party.","summary":"'Gradual slide rightward' called part of a plan to distance from 'left-wing faction'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/shapiro-appearance-could-hint-about-future-of-democrat-party/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/josh-shapiro-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 17:02:45","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":310523430,"title":"‘Kookin’ with Kamala’: Marlow Suggests Harris Starts New Career as Social Media ‘Chef-luencer’","text":"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Ingraham Angle,” “Alex Marlow Show” host and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow talked about the prospects for Kamala Harris and her possible future endeavors.\n\nMarlow stated, “[S]he’s dominating the Democrat polls right now for 2028, but she’s actually fading really fast relative to the field.
