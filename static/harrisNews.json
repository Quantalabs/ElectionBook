You do not go out of the country and badmouth your country or your politicians. You just don’t do it. And we never used to do that. That changed under the Obama administration,\" Blaze Media co-founder Glenn Beck explains.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Newsom did.\n\n\"Trump is a T. rex. You mate with him or he devours you, one or the other,\" Newsom said at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nAnd consequentially, even Scott Bessent felt the need to take Newsom down.\n\n“I think it’s very, very ironic that, you know, Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris,” Bessent said.\n\n“He’s here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is a perfect place for a man who, when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having thousand-dollar-a-night meals at the French Laundry. And I’m sure the California people won’t forget that.”\n\nBessent went on to say that he had a “message to Governor Newsom,” and that message is that the Trump administration is “going to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse” in his state.\n\n“I was told he was asked to give a speech on his signature policies, but he’s not speaking, because what have his economic policies brought? Outward migration from California, a gigantic budget deficit, the largest homeless population in America, and the poor folks in the Palisades who had their homes burned down,” he continued.\n\n“He is here hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless. Shame on him. He is too smug, too self-absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything,” he added.\n\nGlenn is thrilled by Bessent’s speech.\n\n“I just don’t know who my biggest hero is right now, but Bessent is one of them,” Glenn says.\n\n“He’s one of the best, well-put-together, deep-thinking, calm secretaries that we’ve ever had in that position,” he continues. “I mean, I just have complete confidence that if he says it, I’m like, ‘Okay, I may not understand or I may not agree with it, but I’m going to roll the dice with you.’”\n\nWant more from Glenn Beck?\n\nTo enjoy more of Glenn’s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/the-glenn-beck-program/scott-bessent-destroys-gavin-newsom-after-davos-trump-smear","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=63377159&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0},{"id":396765894,"title":"Josh Shapiro wants “a national referendum on Trump and his policies”","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the residents of Minneapolis “inspiring” during a lengthy interview Tuesday with MS NOW’s Nicolle Wallace on “Deadline White House.”\n\nThe 2028 presidential contender lauded the city’s residents for standing up to what he called overreach by federal immigration officers.\n\nDespite freezing weather, thousands of demonstrators have turned out in Minneapolis to protest “Operation Metro Surge,” particularly after the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti – two U.S. citizens – at the hands of federal immigration officers.“I believe ICE is acting outside the bounds of the law,” Shapiro said, adding that Pennsylvania is “preparing as though we can be next.” “We will be prepared in the court. We will be prepared in the community,” Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro also called on Congress to vote to “put some guardrails around ICE spending” and encouraged Americans to continue to speak up. Asked what he would do in Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s shoes, Shapiro said he would bring charges against federal officers if they shot peaceful protesters in his state.\n\nShapiro also recounted a story from his new book, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” in which a man scaled a security fence around the governor’s mansion last April, smashing windows with a hammer and igniting Molotov cocktails. Shapiro and his family were unharmed but the blaze caused substantial damage.\n\nCody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Shapiro, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other related offenses. He was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison and will not be eligible for parole until 2050.\n\n“There are some emotional scars from it. We’re still working through it,” Shapiro told Wallace, adding that his son asked him if they were targeted for their Jewish faith.\n\nShapiro, who is rumored to run for president in 2028, addressed the 2024 presidential election, when he was under consideration as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. He praised Harris, who ultimately selected Walz, but spoke about the intense vetting process he went through. Shapiro said someone on Harris’ team asked him if he was a double agent for Israel – a question he said offended him. Shapiro revealed he eventually told Harris to take him out of consideration.\n\nShapiro added: “I think the country would have been far better off had they won the election.”Shapiro ended the interview with a call to action to the country: “We need a national referendum on Donald Trump and his policies.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/josh-shapiro-wants-a-national-referendum-on-trump-and-his-policies","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769552113/260127-josh-shapiro-es_11612950e610_1161295a0064/260127-josh-shapiro-es_11612950e610_1161295a0064.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 23:51:41","author":"Allison Detzel","authors":["Allison Detzel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":396766662,"title":"Martha Stewart's Granddaughter Called Her Out For Not Speaking Up About ICE.

And I lost friends there.\"\n\nHe cited the UK losing 457 service personnel, fuming, \"Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect.\"\n\n\"Charles understands the emotion,\" a palace source tells royal insider Rob Shuter, who wrote about it on Substack. \"But he’s horrified by the timing. This is diplomacy – not podcast politics.\"Prince Harry's Comments About Trump Made a 'Sensitive Situation Far Trickier'Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, are expected to visit Washington, D.C., later this year in honor of the United States' 250th birthday celebrations. Trump, who gets along quite well with the couple, will get to serve as the host with the most for their state visit. \n\n\"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier,\" a second source revealed. \"The King can’t clap back – even if he agrees.\"\n\nGiven that Britain is one of the U.S.'s longest-standing and closest allies, the king would never consider publicly speaking out against America's head of state. \n\nEven in the U.K., the royals are required to remain publicly neutral politically and nonpartisan, as the sitting monarch has always held weekly meetings with the current prime minister to discuss government matters.Prince Harry Has 'Enough Problems With His Wife'Trump has made comments about Harry in the past, on everything from his visa status to criticism of the duke's American wife, Meghan Markle. \n\n\"I don’t want to do that,\" the president said in February 2025, referring to not deporting the unemployed prince, as the former royal's visa type has remained confidential during the six years he's lived in the U.S. \n\nTrump then got in a dig about Markle, adding, \"I’ll leave him alone... He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.\"\n\nIn April 2022, the tycoon called Harry \"whipped.\"\n\n\"I won't use the full expression, but Harry is whipped like no person I think I've ever seen,\" Trump told Piers Morgan. \"I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Tried to Sway U.S. VotersHarry and Markle immediately waded into U.S. politics after quitting the royal family and moving to California in 2020.\n\nIn a videotaped message ahead of the election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, the duo made not-so-veiled appeals to voters to oppose the then-incumbent Republican. \n\nHarry and Markle called it the \"most important election of our lifetime\" while urging Americans to get out and vote.\n\nThe duke confessed, \"This election, I am not able to vote in the US. But many of you may not know that I haven't been able to vote in the UK my entire life. As we approach this November, it’s vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity.\"\n\nBiden ended up the winner in the 2020 presidential contest, although Trump secured a second term in 2024 by beating Kamala Harris.","summary":"King Charles has been put in an awkward position after his son, Prince Harry, attacked Donald Trump over comments regarding NATO troops.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/king-charles-uncomfortable-prince-harry-attack-on-trump-nato/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Zp7RuwvRN/0x0/king-charles-prince-harry-trump-attacks-cringe-1769546375660.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 21:45:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":396753386,"title":"Republican Rep.

Fair means those who benefit would face mandatory work requirements, forgo public assistance and pay fines and any back taxes they might owe.”\n\nLawler additionally criticizes sanctuary city policies and calls for administration officials to investigate the deaths of Good and Pretti and testify before Congress.\n\nLawler is a co-sponsor of the “dignity act,” which would put a temporary pause on the removal of some migrants working in the United States.\n\nThe swing district congressman recently bucked the party line by voting to resurrect COVID-era Obamacare premium tax credit levels that expired at the end of 2025.\n\nThe essay received mixed reception in some conservative circles.\n\n“Been saying watch out for the amnesty push,” wrote Mike Howell, president of The Oversight Project, in response to the essay. “I imagine the legislation will be some modest sanctuary city reform + gigantic amnesty.”\n\nByron York, a long-time conservative journalist, wrote in response that “this kind of talk has been going on for decades” and that history indicates “Congress will not legislate Trump-level deportation numbers.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials did not immediately reply to The Daily Signal with response to Lawler’s essay.","summary":"Republican Rep.

Josh Shapiro pushed back Tuesday against \"The View\" co-host Ana Navarro’s characterization of his memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" as just being a response to criticism from former Vice President Kamala Harris in her own memoir about the 2024 presidential campaign. \"Kamala wrote things about you in her book that weren’t very flattering — like saying you wanted to be co-president and all of these things — then you and Democrats didn’t like it, and she wrote about it — about a bunch of other people on the short list as well,\" Navarro said, noting a feud between the two Democratic Party figures. \"Now you’re responding and rehashing it all in yours,\" she continued. \"And so my question, as somebody who wants to move the debate forward and wants to see a Democrat elected to undo all the craziness and bad things that [President] Trump has done, is what’s the point?\" Harris wrote in her \"107 Days\" memoir that Shapiro insisted on being \"in the room for every decision\" if he were to become vice president, but Shapiro rejected her claims as \"bulls---\" and \"blatant lies.\" Shapiro’s book also includes critiques of Harris, including the accusation that in the Harris team’s vice-presidential vetting process, Shapiro was asked if he had ever been an agent of the state of Israel. JOSH SHAPIRO ACCUSES HARRIS' VETTING TEAM OF MAKING DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTARY TOWARDS HIS WIFE As Shapiro began to push back, Navarro argued that his book is \"dishy.\" \"I didn’t view my book as a response. In fact, I finished that before I ever read hers, so it’s hardly a response,\" Shapiro said. \"I wanted to make sure that I was being forthright with people about what I went through, how I processed these decisions.\" \"As I said a moment ago, getting the chance to speak about this for the first time in what is otherwise a process that’s pretty closed,\" he continued. \"And to me, this wasn’t about ‘dishing,’ respectfully, it was just more about how we went through the process, what I thought, what I felt coming out of it,\" Shapiro added. \"And I hope the story there shows that I’m someone who is driven to serve, and to serve in a way that still allows me to be a good dad, a good husband and have an impact on people’s lives.

On July 24, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved the $8.4 billion merger.\n\nColbert blasted new FCC guidance as trying to 'silence' late-night TV\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission issued a Jan. 21 public notice with new guidance stating that daytime and late-night television talk shows do not have a blanket exemption under the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe law required FCC licensees, both in radio and later in television, to offer equal broadcast opportunities to political candidates and was amended in 1959 to exempt newscasts, news interviews, news documentaries and on-the-spot coverage of news events.\n\nIn the Jan. 22 episode of \"The Late Show,\" Colbert said the new guidance was an attempt to silence him, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel, whose show ABC temporarily pulled off the air following pressure from FCC Chair Brendan Carr.\n\n\"Hey, I'm flattered you think that appearing on my show has the power to affect politics in any way, OK? I've been doing this job for 21 years, and let me tell you something, buddy. If our government had turned out the way I had chosen, you would not have the power to make this announcement,\" Colbert quipped.\n\nColbert, a Comedy Central alumnus who was previously a \"Daily Show\" correspondent and host of \"The Colbert Report,\" has hosted \"The Late Show\" for nearly 10 years, taking over on Sept. 8, 2015. He succeeded David Letterman, who sat in the host's chair for nearly 22 years, from August 1993 until May 20, 2015. \n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander and Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/01/27/stephen-colbert-late-show-last-episode-end-date/88381997007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/27/USAT/88382392007-2250373785.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6456,3632,x266,y379&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 20:14:52","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":396733246,"title":"Don Lemon in Risk of Being Axed From NYC&#8217;s The Polo Bar: &#8216;He Acts Like It’s His Private Club&#8217;","text":"CNN reject Don Lemon has long been a fixture at Ralph Lauren’s exclusive Polo Bar — the New York City restaurant where the newsman married Tim Malone in 2024. But insiders say the elite hotspot’s well-heeled crowd is growing fed up with Lemon’s unruly behavior.\n\n“He acts like it’s his private club, but it’s not,” a source says. “He’s always there, talking loudly, seeking attention, and his raw, unbuttoned style isn’t what this scene wants anymore.”\n\nSources point out The Polo Bar, which is famed for discretion, draws celebrities such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, pop star Taylor Swift and songbird Jennifer Lopez, who come to dine in peace and privacy.\n\n“He got married there, sure — but that doesn’t give him a lifetime reservation,” the insider adds. “His lips are too loose, and other customers have complained. The restaurant wants a classy vibe, not someone peacocking from table to table making everyone uncomfortable.”\n\nStaff and regulars are reportedly growing tired of Lemon’s over-the-top presence.\n\n“If he doesn’t dial it back, he could be looking at a velvet-rope exit,” another source warns.","url":"https://nationalenquirer.com/don-lemon-in-risk-of-being-axed-from-nycs-the-polo-bar-he-acts-like-its-his-private-club/","image":"https://nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Featured-One-1-Don-Lemon-Polo-Bar.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 20:12:11","author":"Rob Shuter","authors":["Rob Shuter"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.223},{"id":396745116,"title":"Biden condemns ‘our own government targeting’ US citizens in Minneapolis","text":"Joe Biden has joined other former Democratic presidents in condemning the fatal shooting of the 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, saying that it “betrays our most basic values as Americans”.\n\nIn a statement that alluded to the constitutional right to due process, Biden said: “We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street. We are not a nation that allows our citizens to be brutalized for exercising their constitutional rights. We are not a nation that tramples the fourth amendment and tolerates our neighbors being terrorized.”\n\nHe continued: “Minnesotans have reminded us all what it is to be American, and they have suffered enough at the hands of this administration. Violence and terror have no place in the United States of America, especially when it’s our own government targeting American citizens.”\n\nIn a barely veiled reference to Donald Trump, who is facing a mounting backlash over his administration’s federal immigration enforcement tactics, Biden said: “No single person can destroy what America stands for and believes in, not even a president, if we – all of America – stand up and speak out.\n\n“We know who we are. It’s time to show the world. More importantly, it’s time to show ourselves.”\n\nBiden called for “full, fair and transparent” investigations into the “senseless” killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good earlier this month. Good was shot dead as she drove away from a federal immigration agent, which – like Pretti’s killing – sparked widespread protest and scrutiny.\n\nBiden’s latest statement joins condemnation from Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Obama – for whom Biden was vice-president – and Clinton urged Americans to speak out and warned that core American values were under assault amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nSince leaving office Biden has largely kept a low public profile. He is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer and focusing on his memoir and presidential library. His return to the national dialogue with his statement was therefore notable.\n\nHis remarks come as many Democrats remain frustrated by his decision to hold on to the party’s presidential nomination late into the 2024 election cycle, a move critics say weakened the party’s momentum. He eventually ceded the nomination to Vice-President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated for a second term in the White House.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has been the target of near-daily verbal attacks from Trump, who continues to blame him for a wide range of issues, including federal immigration policy.","summary":"Ex-president avoids naming Trump but says ‘Minnesotans have suffered enough at the hands of this administration’\n\nJoe Biden has joined other former Democratic presidents in condemning the fatal shooting of the 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, saying that it “betrays our most basic values as Americans”.\n\nIn a statement that alluded to the constitutional right to due process, Biden said: “We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street.

She's Wrong.","text":"Katie Miller is a conservative podcaster and former spokesperson for the Trump administration. She was briefly involved with the Department of Government Efficiency, but left government employment to work for Elon Musk full time. In August 2025, she quit that job too, and launched her own podcast, The Katie Miller Podcast. She is married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nOne would hope that an individual who has spent so much time in close proximity to high-ranking conservative political figures—and who is married to the avatar of a very particular brand of conservatism, New Right populism/nativism—might be able to properly define classical liberalism, an extremely well-known philosophy that undergirds the entire American project.\n\nAlas, Katie Miller recently issued a warning on X that betrayed a fundamental ignorance about classical liberalism: She is conflating it with leftism, and for good measure, wokeness.\n\nThe post in question was an attack on Chris Olah, a co-founder of Anthropic, an AI company. Miller expressed concern about Olah's stated commitment to \"the principles of classical liberal democracy.\"\n\n\"If this is what they say publicly, this is how their AI model is programmed,\" she wrote. \"Woke and deeply leftist ideology is what they want you to rely upon.\"\n\nCo-Founder of Anthropic: \"My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy.\"\nIf this is what they say publicly, this is how their AI model is programmed. \nWoke and deeply leftist ideology is what they want you to rely upon. https://t.co/OkyxhOPiRU\n— Katie Miller (@KatieMiller) January 26, 2026\n\nShe is clearly saying that \"classical liberal democracy\" and \"woke and deeply leftist ideology\" are one and the same. They are not.\n\nClassical liberalism is the forerunner of modern libertarianism: It is a philosophy that emphasizes individual rights, including civil rights and property rights. Classically liberal thinkers such as John Locke helped establish the notion that government should be accountable to the people. Economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo used classical liberalism as a guiding principle when arguing in favor of free markets and free trade. In the realm of government, the political leaders associated with classical liberalism and laissez faire economic policies are people such as former President Calvin Coolidge, former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Argentinian President Javier Milei. Note that these figures are not exactly defined by their love of wokeness. To the extent that \"wokeness\" is even a coherent set of views, it emphasizes collective rights for various identity groups instead of the individual-rights framework of classical liberalism.\n\nLeftists tend to agree with classical liberals and even most conservatives on some broad principles, like the notion that people should elect their leaders. But modern liberals, progressives, and leftists tend to disagree sharply with classical liberals and libertarians on economics: They want much more government regulation, taxation, and centralized government control of the economy. On these issues, leftism bears a closer resemblance to the version of conservatism advocated by Stephen Miller—who supports tariffs and extreme restrictions on immigrant labor—than it does to classical liberalism.\n\nKatie Miller's former boss, Musk, seems to understand this much better than she does. In a reply on X on March 8, 2024, he wrote: \"I believe in liberalism in the sense [of] supporting freedom of thought and action, but modern liberalism is the opposite of that.\" In other words, he was drawing a distinction between the classical liberalism of, say, America's Founding Fathers and the modern liberalism of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nStephen Miller frequently talks in apocalyptic terms about threats to Western civilization. Given this, one might hope that the Miller household could easily provide the name of Western civilization's defining political philosophy. Hint: It's classical liberal democracy.","summary":"How are the Millers going to defend Western civilization if they don't know the name of its defining philosophy?","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/27/katie-miller-thinks-classical-liberalism-is-woke-leftism-shes-wrong/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01.27.26-v1-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 19:53:05","author":"Jacob Sullum,Robby Soave","authors":["Jacob Sullum","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.07},{"id":396715690,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres claims she wasn't properly served in lawsuit stemming from 2023 car crash","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jan 27th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid and Cruz Beckham join Victoria for a Paris family day out as it's revealed how Nicola Peltz could 'barely say mother-in-law's name' in interview amid dress row\n\nInquest jury is shown CCTV of tragic 14-year-old boy's final journey cycling naked through streets of Belfast before being found dead in a storm drain days later\n\n'Far too little, far too late': Fury as Reeves sends junior minister to announce paltry 15% off business rates for pubs - but only for three years and wider hospitality sector gets nothing\n\n'There were three people in Olivia Attwood's marriage.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ADAM S. LEVY, US SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER and MARJORIE HERNANDEZ, US WEST COAST NEWS EDITOR \n Published:19:44 GMT, 27 January 2026 |Updated:19:47 GMT, 27 January 2026 \n\nEllen DeGeneres says she wasn't properly served with court papers amid a lawsuit over an October 16, 2023 collision in Santa Barbara County, California she was involved in.\nLast month, the plaintiff requested a jury trial, claiming DeGeneres' negligence behind the wheel led her to careen into her Tesla, leaving her with 'multiple serious personal injuries and damages.'\nThe suit was initially filed in September, when DeGeneres (who turned 68 Monday) was on a vacation in Florence, Italy with wife Portia de Rossi, 52; currently, a non-jury trial is slated for November 2026. \nAttorneys for DeGeneres described the complications that led to the papers not reaching the talk show host, US Weekly reported Monday, citing January 21 court filings it reviewed.\n'On December 23, 2025, certain documents were dropped off at the receptionist desk at [the business management firm] Neuman + Associates,' lawyers for DeGeneres said. \nDaily Mail has reached out to reps for DeGeneres for further comment on the story.\n\nEllen DeGeneres says she wasn't properly served with court papers amid a lawsuit over an October 16, 2023 collision in Santa Barbara County, California she was involved in. DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi were pictured in September in Paris, France \nAttorneys for DeGeneres continued, 'Neuman + Associates is not Ms. DeGeneres' dwelling house, usual place of abode, or usual place of business.\n\n Gaunt Ellen DeGeneres posts video supporting anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis \n'Further, Ms. DeGeneres was not at Neuman + Associates at the time of the drop off.'\nThe plaintiff said that a process server also tried to relay the legal documents at NKSFB, LLC - the parent company of Neuman + Associates - on two occasions, January 6 and January 7.\nThe plaintiff said the process server gave the documents to an employee/security guard.\nLawyers for the talk show host said in response that 'there was no reason to believe Ms DeGeneres would be there at all, and specially not on those two random days in January.\n'It should be reasonably apparent to anyone, especially a process server, that a security guard at a 20-story building is not \"in charge\" of a business on the fifth floor of that building.'\nLawyers for DeGeneres said that it was 'extremely unlikely' the employee who was presented with the docs would 'have a relationship with Ms. DeGeneres such that the security guard would reliably deliver the Complaint documents' to the star.\nThe firm's Harley Neuman in the filing detailed the allegedly nondescript exchange between the process server and employee.\n\nAttorneys for DeGeneres described the complications that led to the papers not reaching the talk show host, pictured in 2022 in Washington, DC\n\n'I have a business relationship, through Neuman + and am generally familiar with Ms. DeGeneres' business operations and personal living situation,' Neuman said. 'Ms. DeGeneres was not at Neuman + Associates at the time of the drop.'\n\n Inside the toxic bullying claims which led to Ellen DeGeneres' downfall \n'There was no verbal interaction with the process server that I am aware of. The process server did not inform anyone of the contents of the documents that I am aware of.'\nNeuman continued, 'Nobody signed any acknowledgement of receipt of the documents that I am aware of. Likewise, I am not aware of a copy of the summons and complaint being mailed to my office.'\nDeGeneres has yet to be formally served due to the fact that she 'resides overseas' in the Cotswolds region of England, per court docs filed last month reviewed by Daily Mail. \nThe plaintiff will use the Hague Convention Service to have the complaint presented to her, according to court docs.\nThe plaintiff said she suffered 'sustained serious injuries and incurred significant income/business loss' as complications in the aftermath of the collision, according to legal docs. \nA complaint filed last September alleged that the plaintiff had 'made sure there were no other vehicles' in the way as she came to a stop at a stop sign.\nThe complaint continued: 'Ellen DeGeneres entered the intersection without stopping at the stop sign' in a manner described as 'suddenly and without any warning' - resulting in the collision.\n\nDeGeneres did not properly stop at a stop sign ahead of the October 16, 2023 collision in Santa Barbara County, California, the plaintiff said in legal docs \nDeGeneres' performance behind the wheel at the time of the collision 'fell below the standard of care of a reasonable person,' the September complaint read.\n\n Megyn Kelly claims Ellen DeGeneres hid bad behavior while blasting her anti-ICE video clip \nDeGeneres is accused of causing or contributing 'to causing plaintiff's vehicle to be collided with by the defendants' vehicle.'\nThe plaintiff said as a result of the crash, they experienced 'loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress and anxiety,' the outlet reported, citing legal documents. \nDeGeneres and de Rossi have resided in the English countryside in the wake of President Donald Trump's defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\nThe couple, who have had a lucrative run in flipping houses, in July sold a farmhouse they purchased for $30 million, The Wall Street Journal reported. \nThey subsequently moved into a bigger home to make room for horses de Rossi owns.\n'Portia’s living her dream riding her horse through the English countryside and into the village,' Ellen said on Instagram in August. 'Gosh I hope she comes home soon.'\nDeGeneres was one of Tinseltown's most powerful entertainers until a toxic workplace scandal that began amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 escalated, hurting the ratings of the popular show, which wrapped up in May of 2022. \nItalyEllen DeGeneresTeslaCalifornia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllen DeGeneres claims she wasn't properly served in lawsuit stemming from 2023 car crash\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

That corporate lobbying paid off under President Joe Biden, when at least 10 million illegal migrants were imported via Biden’s border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. Understandably, Conway also backed California progressive Kamala Harris in 2024 as she promised more mass migration.\n\nMany of the migrants welcomed by Conway are now part of the Democrats’ political base, and they are the expected supporters and recipients of free health care once the wealth tax becomes law after November.\n\n“Democrat Billionaires in Silicon Valley are learning: Play socialist games, win socialist prizes,” said a January 23 tweet from David Sacks, a tech investor who is now working at President Donald Trump’s White House to develop a low-migration, high-tech future for the U.S. economy.\n\nConway’s advocacy for more migration has been channeled through FWD.us, which he created with Mark Zuckerberg and many other investors and supporters in 2013. Their goal was to lobby for the disastrous “Gang of Eight” amnesty that helped Trump get elected in 2016.\n\nSince then, the lobby group has pushed for mass migration and has fought many curbs against welfare-dependent migrants.\n\nZuckerberg stopped funding FWD.us once its agenda for mass multicultural migration helped ensure Trump’s election for a second time in 2024. The group is still lobbying the Democratic Party to build opposition to Trump’s preference for migrants who raise Americans’ productivity.\n\nConway is also pushing for more migrants via the Economic Innovation Group, which focuses on migration and real estate investments.\n\nFor his Pirate Wires article, Solana interviewed 21 billionaires, most of whom are somewhat left wing and supportive of the Democratic Party. But all are aghast at the tax, which they expect will wreck the state’s lucrative tech sector:\n\n“If it does or doesn’t pass, this is the single most radicalizing red pilling thing to ever happen to push them into the arms of the Republican Party, and I think it makes clear, more than anything else that happens, that it’s not about helping the poor but impoverishing the rich, and the pain is part of the point. That’s a new realization for a lot of people.”\nAnother billionaire said it seemed, from conversations he’d been having with other men impacted by the ballot proposition, that it would harm the Democratic party: “The vast majority of people affected by this are Democrats, including many of the biggest donors to the party,” he said.\nHe characterized this as a catalyzing event among Democratic donors, many of whom he was now privately engaging with, “unlike any other issue I’ve seen.” Yes, he said, there was a big “leopards eating faces element to this.” But actual asset seizure was truly not something any of them expected.\n\n“This is where virulently left-wing policy wonks seem to not understand the technology industry,” Solana wrote.\n\nHowever, progressives are ambitious political entrepreneurs; they have bigger goals than economics, and they understand their circumstances and goals much better than do Solana’s billionaires.\n\nFor example, President Barack Obama has worked for decades to expand the number of migrants because he is trying to transform the United States into a progressive-run multicultural nirvana.\n\n“There’s never been an experiment [emphasis added] like this, where you have people from every corner of the globe show up in one place,” Obama said, adding:\n\n[We] say, based on these ideals — we hold these truths to be self-evident…all men are created equal … and a constitution and a Bill of Rights and a democracy — that we can somehow figure out how to get along and maintain our private beliefs and pray to god in our own ways, and retain aspects of the [foreign] cultures that we bring from wherever it is that we’re coming from, and yet still decide that we are all Americans … and try to make it better for each successive generation.\n\n“I think George W. Bush believed that … I know John McCain believed it. I know Mitt Romney believed it,” Obama added.\n\nAmericans who oppose the cultural diversity sought by Obama are just Nazis, says Silicon Valley journalist Kara Swisher:\n\nHowever, more business leaders are responding to the progressives’ inability to curb their mass migration, including migration from countries with Islamic, tribal, caste, and ethnic collectivist-minded countries.\n\nBut some West Coast investors are still bullish about Indian migration amid the vast damage done to American-style professionalism by ruthless use of the H-1B program. For example, Vino Khosla, a Kamala Harris supporter, recently slammed South African-born Elon Musk for his opposition to mass unskilled migration:\n\nThose progressives include a few billionaires who are eager to dismiss Americans who are concerned about the civic and economic impact of mass migration:\n\nMany CEOs recognize the damage caused by white-collar migration to the U.S. professional stack, but few speak about it freely","summary":"Pro-Democrat investor and pro-migration lobbyist Ron Conway is the biggest loser — so far — in the expanding fight to impose a wealth tax on California billionaires, according to a report.\n\n\nThe post Report: California Billionaires Turn on FWD.us Founder Ron Conway appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2026/01/27/report-california-billionaires-turn-on-fwd-us-founder-ron-conway/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GettyImages1447277693-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 19:41:43","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":396736808,"title":"CBS News’ Bari Weiss unveils new strategy amid backlash, viewership lags","text":"CBS News Editor-In-Chief Bari Weiss has unveiled the network’s new plan to grow the audience amid efforts to broaden the network’s political appeal after a set of blunders.\n\nAmong the changes that were announced in an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, the network will bring on 18 new commentators akin to US cable news powerhouses, CNN, MS Now and Fox, as well as steep staffing cuts to those who don’t align with Weiss’s vision for the network, as first reported by NPR which sourced the information from a set of journalists within the network who spoke under condition of anonymity.\n\nIn an all-hands call with staffers, the network said that it will need to expand its reach beyond typical broadcasting and lean more into podcasting, according to audio first obtained by the outlet Business Insider.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that if we stick to that [focusing on broadcast] strategy, we’re toast,” Weiss said.\n\nThe new hires include conservative podcasters Niall Ferguson and Patrick McGee and others like physician Mark Hyman, who has close ties to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr who has been controversial for scaling back vaccines.\n\nWeiss, who despite not having any previous television experience, was tapped in October to lead the storied news organisation after Paramount Skydance acquired the conservative opinion writer’s publication, The Free Press, for $150m amid efforts to reach a more politically diverse audience.\n\nThe hiring of Weiss was among several key moves the network made in recent months to appease the White House, including settling a lawsuit alleging that 60 Minutes doctored an interview with then–presidential hopeful Kamala Harris for $16m, and appointing Kenneth Weinstein, a former Trump administration official, as ombudsman to investigate allegations of bias.\n\nWeiss missteps\n\n“The honest truth is, right now, we are not producing a product that enough people want,” Weiss said in audio of the all-hands meeting, according to Business Insider.\n\nBut Weiss has been behind many of the recent decisions that led to a slump in viewership. The network’s town hall with Erika Kirk — wife of the murdered far-right provocateur Charlie Kirk, saw a 11 percent decline in viewership compared to typical viewership in the same time slot.\n\nWeiss has also been behind several other missteps in her short tenure at the network thus far. She delayed the airing of a 60 Minutes segment about the notorious CERCOT mega prison in El Salvador. Weiss claimed that the segment, which was already set for air, needed more reporting, which correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi criticised, calling it a “political decision” in an email.\n\nShe also oversaw the relaunch of the CBS Evening News with a new host, former CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil, who has been with the network since 2016. The show has gone through five different anchor teams since he joined the network.\n\n“We put too much weight on the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you,” Dokoupil said in a video promoting his new spot.\n\nBut that was not well received.\n\n“You wouldn’t want ‘academics and elites’ who have actually studied a subject to outweigh the off-the-cuff opinions of village idiots. This is how we’re seeing the resurgence of measles, and the widespread belief in almost non-existent vote fraud, among many other great leaps backward in the Trump era,” Larry Sabado, director of the Center For Politics at University of Virginia, said in a post on X.\n\nAnd that message has not won over viewers either. While CBS has been last place among broadcast evening news programmes for decades, it continues to lose its market share under Weiss. The network’s flagship news show lost more than a million viewers during its inaugural week under the new host compared to the same time the year before.\n\nIt comes as the network’s parent company continually lobs hostile takeover bids to Warner Bros Discovery, which would include another news network often in the White House’s crosshairs – CNN.\n\nIn December, Ellison visited the White House, as per media reports, and told Trump that Paramount would execute “sweeping changes” if it acquired CNN’s parent company.\n\nOn Wall Street, CBS parent Paramount Skydance is down 2.6 percent in midday trading.","summary":"The network is set lean into podcasters bringing on more controversial conservative leaning voices.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-27T132028Z_183358991_RC2ZZT9VDGMP_RTRMADP_3_MEDIA-CBS-1769538848.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 19:36:34","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.363},{"id":396712354,"title":"Gov Shapiro pushes back against 'The View' host's characterization of his memoir","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nMedia January 27, 2026 01:25 \n\n Gov Shapiro pushes back against 'The View' host's characterization of his memoir \n Gov/ Josh Shapiro pushed back after \"The View\" host Ana Navarro argued his memoir was a response to criticism he received in former Vice President Kamala Harris' book. \n Tags MEDIAV-VIDEO","summary":"Gov/ Josh Shapiro pushed back after &quot;The View&quot; host Ana Navarro argued his memoir was a response to criticism he received in former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; book.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6388389676112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/cbbf4cfd-b3d6-4b59-9504-81bfade25ff1/b2068d43-298e-4868-8bc1-6277b4f50f00/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 19:31:35","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.161},{"id":396715290,"title":"Democrats and the Media Now Suggesting that ICE Agents Should Be Shot; UPDATE: ABC Predicts More Guns","text":"One of the more interesting phenomena surrounding the death of Alex Pretti is the newly discovered respect for the Second Amendment among liberals. \n\nPretti was a holder of a concealed carry permit here in Minnesota, which means he had the right to carry at the protest. Perhaps. Minnesota law is actually ambiguous about that, and it appears he was not carrying either identification or his permit at the time, but those are details. \n\nHis right to carry, in any case, ended when he interfered with law enforcement officers and resisted arrest, but again, for the purposes of this essay, that, too, is a detail. Although I will note that all those idiots making the absurd claim that even if he was illegally carrying that is not a capital offense miss the point: he was not shot as \"punishment\" for committing a crime, but because an officer (rightly or wrongly) believed he was an imminent threat. \n\nLaw enforcement cannot execute you as a punishment; they can shoot you if they reasonably believe you present a threat to themselves or others. Pretti may, in fact, not have been a threat, but if the officer reasonably believed he was, the shooting was both a good one and regrettable. All I can say about that is that assaulting law enforcement officers while armed is extremely stupid. \n\nThe left doesn't see it that way at all, and all of a sudden, carrying weapons while impeding law enforcement is the best thing on earth, because Orange Man Bad. \n\nAnd more and more of them are openly suggesting that federal law enforcement officers should be threatened with guns or even shot. \n\nIllegitimate Kris Mayes is calling on people to kill law enforcement officersA LEGITIMATE Attorney General would prosecute someone making threats to law enforcementKris belongs in jail NOT the Attorney General’s office pic.twitter.com/BqpiB4I1j6— Nico Delgado 🇺🇸 (@NicoDelgadoAZ) January 23, 2026\n\nAttorney General Kris Mayes of Arizona openly mused, quite wrongly with regard to the law, that people who are being confronted by federal agents should consider threatening them with weapons. \n\nThe Attorney General. Of a state. It was a remarkably obtuse comment, both because the suggestion itself is outrageous, and because it is a misstatement of the law by the state's lawyer. It got some attention nationally, although far less than it should have, because of course the media loves to see the outrage meter pegged when it comes to Trump and especially immigration. \n\nDemocrat Arizona AG Kris Mayes top police liaison tenders her resignation after blow back from her insane video, where she basically tells Arizona residents they can shoot agents under “stand your ground law” pic.twitter.com/Yo5IIa1abV— Imperfect Believer (@Imperfectblever) January 26, 2026\n\nWithin the state, which has a deep gun culture, the reaction has been less muted.

The Arizona Sheriffs’ Association has just issued a powerful open letter condemning AG Kris Mayes' dangerous rhetoric on Arizona's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws potentially justifying force against law enforcement.They explicitly state her comments show \"a lack of understanding of state law – or much worse, a willful and reckless interpretation of the law.\" Arizona law is clear: deadly force against known or reasonably identifiable officers performing duties is unlawful and expressly exempted from self-defense statutes (A.R.S. §§ 13-404, 13-405, 13-409, etc.).This comes on top of condemnations from the APA, PPSLA, FOP and other law enforcement leaders. Every major layer of Arizona law enforcement has now unified in rejecting her statements as reckless, endangering officers, and fundamentally misguided.Kris, the unified voice of those who risk their lives daily is unmistakable: retract these statements, clarify unequivocally that shooting at law enforcement is never justified, and tender your resignation. Arizona deserves an AG who stands with—not against—our officers and the rule of law.\n\nUnderstandably so. It's not like local law enforcement doesn't face the same kind of attacks, both physically and politically, as federal law enforcement does. Liberals may not like to recall that they fully backed \"defund the police\" and defended riots that left officers wounded, but I can assure you that law enforcement officers do. One of the ironies of the body cam movement is the fact that many of the accusations of police brutality have been proven false by the video evidence those cameras provide. You rarely hear about that, because Pravda loves the Narrative™ that the police are a fascist force, but many an officer has been exonerated by video evidence. \n\nBut it's not just one radical politician musing about shooting federal officers. It has now crept into the media, which has hardly covered itself in glory now, or at any time in recent memory. Their reporting is as sharp and coherent as a typical Joe Biden speech. \n\nCNN's Kasie Hunt suggests people should be pointing guns at the Trump administration because it has become \"tyrannical\" citing \"what we saw on the streets\" of Minneapolis:\"I want to bring back a tweet from Charlie Kirk in 2018.

He says this, 'The Second Amendment is not for hunting. It's not for self protection. It is there to ensure that free people can defend themselves if, God forbid, government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens.' And I think a lot of people are pointing to this because, I mean, what what we saw in the streets.\"\n\nSuddenly shooting federal agents is thinkable, which fits with the Civil War narratives that are now being floated. We have Gettysburg analogies, which are amazing, if unintentionally revealing (guess which side is trying to secede?), talk of being at \"war\" with the federal government, Lieutenant Governors, city officials, state legislators, and political consultants to governors participating in attacks on federal agents or coordinating what amounts to an insurgency. \n\nWhen political reporters are suggesting that law enforcement officers should be shot, we have entered a new phase of this now warm Civil War. \n\nLess than 5 months ago Nicholas Decker wrote an essay calling for Republicans to be shot. https://t.co/cQ5tBc9h34 pic.twitter.com/1AeTcyJ4A8— Chris Brunet (@chrisbrunet) September 10, 2025\n\nYour average liberal is bombarded by messaging that completely distorts what is happening here. Minnesota is not, in fact, deportation central. It's just that most states and localities cooperate with federal law enforcement and protect the operations, not just for the safety of law enforcement, but for the public. Even the illegal aliens being arrested are much safer than here because the violent and chaotic environment caused, intentionally, makes the situation very dangerous. \n\nAs Beege wrote earlier, even the number of deportations is not wildly up compared to the last months of the Biden administration, when they were trying to give Kamala Harris political cover. The big thing that has changed is that, starting on January 21, 2025, the violence began because a coordinated operation was put in place. \n\nNo major media outlet has covered the Signal chat revelations, which reveal the extent of the planning and coordination and the tactics used to create escalation. Because that doesn't fit The Narrative™. \n\nDHS Sec. Kristi Noem: \"An agent's finger was BIT off.”These people are incredibly dangerous and out of control.Attacking officers, biting fingers off, storming churches, trashing businesses.There is serious demonic energy taking over Minnesota.pic.twitter.com/pxehnzDRw6— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) January 24, 2026\n\nBut if the rhetoric reflects another escalation, soon enough, federal agents will be killed. The level of violence is already quite high here in Minnesota, but soon enough, it could get much, much worse. \n\nUPDATE: I didn't see this, but ABC got in on the \"guns coming to protest\" movement\n\nABC's Trevor Ault predicts more Minneapolis protesters will start bringing guns to their confrontations with CBP and ICE and possible use against the agents, claiming fear of their safety...\"I mean, anger is the absolutely main emotion that we are seeing, George.

They feel like they have a right to continue pushing back and they feel like it has been working, but they're especially upset because they feel like ICE has been everywhere. When I got to town, my team who had already been here said don't rent a dark SUV. People will assume you are a federal agent b/c they're all over the place and people will not be happy. You, of course, also, have immigrant communities. They are very afraid. There are people who have not left their homes in weeks. And maybe, George, the most dominant emotion is dread. As long as the raids continue, the protests continue and another shooting could happen at any moment and especially after Alex Pretti shooting, more demonstrators could bring weapons under the belief they have to be prepared to defend themselves from federal agents who could shoot them. It is a very dangerous recipe. People are scared, but they're also resolute that they have to fight back.\"George Stephanopoulos: \"What a tense situation\"\n\nEditor's note: If we thought our job in pushing back against the Academia/media/Democrat censorship complex was over with the election, think again.

Mikie Sherrill in a special election that could serve as an early indicator of how Democratic voters feel just weeks before the midterm election season kicks off in March. \n\nFormer Rep. Tom Malinowski, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way and organizer Analilia Mejia are among the leading Democratic contenders in the blue-leaning 11th District in North Jersey. \n\nThe primary debate among the Democratic candidates has focused on how to fight back against the Trump administration and who is best suited to oppose the president. The candidates have also talked about lowering costs, with some tying high costs to Trump’s policies. The affordability issue fueled much of Democrats’ electoral success in 2025, including in the Garden State, where Sherrill was elected New Jersey’s second female governor. \n\nThe primary has intensified in its final stretch. Outside groups have begun pouring money into the race, with the United Democracy Project, the political arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spending $1.5 million to oppose Malinowski and the Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s Association PAC spending $1.4 million to boost Way so far with just over a week to go. \n\nThe primary also comes as Democrats are poised to tighten Republicans’ narrow House majority via a special election in Texas, which will be decided this weekend by an all-Democratic runoff. \n\nThe winner of the 11th District Democratic primary will advance to an April 16 general election against Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, who is unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kamala Harris carried the 11th District by 8 points in 2024, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, meaning the Democratic nominee will be favored to hold the seat. \n\nThe Democratic field\n\nOf the 11 Democrats, a handful have received the most attention through endorsements and outside spending. While polling of the race has been limited, Malinowski’s campaign has said an early survey showed him leading the field. \n\nMalinowski, who served two terms representing the neighboring 7th District, leads the pack in fundraising, having raised $1.2 million through Jan. 16 with $404,000 on hand. He’s been endorsed by Sen. Andy Kim, who was first elected to the House in 2018 alongside Malinowski and has focused much of his political activity since his Senate campaign on fighting political corruption. \n\nIn ads, Malinowski has emphasized that he stood up to Trump during his previous stint in Congress and also vowed to take on corporations, in addition to the administration.\n\nBut Malinowski has been the target of spending by the United Democracy Project, with an ad attacking him over a 2019 House vote to provide $200 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency has been at the center of deadly protests this month in Minnesota and a focal point of Democratic opposition to the administration. \n\nGill, an Essex County commissioner, raised $808,000 and had $348,000 banked as of Jan. 16. Former Gov. Phil Murphy and a slate of other state Democratic officials have endorsed Gill, who worked for two decades in New Jersey politics as an operative and elected official. \n\nGill has gone after Malinowski over an earlier controversy over his stock trades, which became the subject of a House Ethics investigation while he was in Congress. Gill has argued that the stock trades were part of why Malinowski lost his 2022 reelection bid, which he said “contributed to allowing MAGA Republicans to take control back.”\n\nGill said that the administration’s decisions, including Trump’s tariff policies, the expired enhanced health insurance subsidies and the funding freeze for the Gateway Tunnel Project are all affecting how people think about the administration and elections. \n\n“These are decisions that are hurting middle-class and working-class families that make up this district and they’re being made by a person who’s not only doing that but who is essentially hollowing out our democratic institutions,” he said.\n\nNow, Gill said there’s “a lot more connecting of the dots out there,” as people link arguments in favor of affordability with the need to protect democracy. \n\nWay, a former Passaic County commissioner before she joined the Murphy administration first as New Jersey secretary of state and then lieutenant governor, has highlighted her efforts to push back on the Trump administration, including in court. \n\n“When there’s chaos all around us, you need someone who is seasoned and ready to lead on day one,” Way said in an emailed statement. “I’ve lowered costs for working families, helped make New Jersey a national leader in protecting democracy, and taken on Donald Trump in court — and won.”\n\nWay is backed by the Congressional Black Caucus PAC and the Collective PAC. The Rolling Sea Action Fund, which supports Black candidates, spent $15,000 on phone banking and texting to support Way. \n\nThe political arm of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association has also spent $1.4 million on Way’s behalf, giving her a boost through phone calls, mailers and ads. Way has trailed some of the other top contenders in fundraising, with Federal Election Commission filings showing she raised $405,000 as of Jan. 16.\n\nMejia, a first-time candidate who has worked for several unions and led New Jersey’s Working Families Party before working for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, has consolidated support from the party’s progressive wing. Sanders visited the district this month to hold a rally for Mejia, who has also campaigned with Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.\n\nMejia said her campaign has held town halls that have also served as trainings for how to interact with ICE officers. She has called for abolishing ICE, calling it a “rogue agency.”\n\n“I’m running to win this race, but I’m also an organizer that understands that regular, everyday Americans deserve the kind of information, are hungry for the kind of political and community organizing that empowers them,” she said.\n\nMejia had raised $420,000 as of Jan. 16 and had $358,000 banked for the final stretch of the campaign. The Working Families Party PAC has spent $183,000 on digital and cable ads and phone banking to support Mejia. \n\nOther candidates running include Army veteran Zach Beecher, who’s garnered support from veterans groups; Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel; Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland; former Maplewood Mayor Dean Dafis; former Obama administration official Cammie Croft; attorney and Trump impersonator J-L Cauvin; and Anna Lee Williams, a political newcomer who works for a digital music company.\n\nBeecher is among the top three fundraisers in the field, having raised $505,000 through Jan. 16. Bartlett raised $466,000 while Grayzel took in $428,000.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/27/new-jersey-special-election-democrats-trump/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/NJ11.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 18:59:26","author":"Posted January 27, 2026 At 6:59pm","authors":["Posted January 27, 2026 At 6:59pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.393},{"id":396711580,"title":"Katy Perry sounds off on ICE: 'Turn anger into ACTION'","text":"Spread across five slides, Perry’s message read: “Who: You, the power is in your hands.

Trump had promised a mass crackdown and deportations of criminal illegal aliens. Now, Biden is calling out the Trump administration's actions after the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. \"We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street. We are not a nation that allows our citizens to be brutalized for exercising their constitutional rights. We are not a nation that tramples the 4th Amendment and tolerates our neighbors being terrorized,\" Biden wrote in a statement posted on X.

Jill and I are sending strength to the families and communities who love Alex Pretti and Renee Good as we all mourn their senseless deaths,\" Biden said. Federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis has faced increased scrutiny in recent weeks following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Both deaths sparked mass demonstrations and calls for federal immigration officers to be pulled out of the state. 'MOB MENTALITY' ENDANGERS OFFICERS AMID ANTI-ICE UNREST AND CHAOS IN MINNEAPOLIS, RETIRED COPS WARN Harris, who served as Biden's vice president, has also been a vocal critic of the immigration crackdown. She called the shooting of Good \"shocking\" and said that \"the horrifying and painful video\" of the incident showed \"that the Trump administration's explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting.\" After Pretti was shot, Harris said she was \"heartbroken for Alex, his family, Minneapolis and America.\" Minnesota leaders have criticized the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, with Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey telling U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to \"get the f--- out\" of his city after Good was shot and killed during an interaction with an ICE officer. SEN RUBEN GALLEGO: I WON'T FUND A ROGUE ICE THAT SHOOTS FIRST AND CALLS IT LAW ENFORCEMENT On Monday, Trump announced that he would be sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota as Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, the face of his administration's campaign to arrest and deport criminal illegal immigrants, would be leaving, signaling a possible shift in policy. \"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight. He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,\" Trump said on Truth Social. In the same post, the president announced \"a major investigation\" into allegations of welfare fraud in Minnesota. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Trump later said that he and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had a \"very good call\" despite their disagreements on the handling of immigration enforcement. \"I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all criminals that they have in their possession. The governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,\" Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. \"He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!\" Trump added that both he and Walz share the goal of further reducing crime in Minnesota.

Panic at the paper bled onto social media Monday, with staffers sounding the alarm by using the hashtag \"#SaveThePost,\" as reports of major pending layoffs spread in the newsroom. Post leaders have been working for roughly two years to be in a position to break even financially after reported $100 million losses in 2024, and an upcoming headcount reduction is expected to help accomplish that goal. \"It’s a tense period,\" Glenn Kessler, the Post's former fact-checker, told Fox News Digital. \"Many have dedicated their professional careers to the Post and are worried an important American institution is being dismantled.\" WASHINGTON POST STAFFERS PLEAD WITH BILLIONAIRE OWNER JEFF BEZOS TO SAVE THE PAPER AMID MAJOR LOOMING LAYOFFS The Post's foreign correspondents penned a letter to the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, urging him to preserve their beat as it has emerged as a high target in looming budget cuts. \"We are The Washington Post’s international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper’s global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts,\" they wrote to Bezos. Bezos, who irked Post staffers by ignoring a petition for him to visit the newsroom when he was in town for President Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, has not offered any recent public comment regarding the paper’s issues. On Monday, as current and former Post journalists begged Bezos to save the paper, he attended the Dior fashion show at the Musée Rodin in Paris, France. His silence has been so frustrating that employees have considered reaching out to celebrities like Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep with the hopes a Hollywood heavyweight could get his attention, according to Status. The two actors starred in \"The Post,\" a 2017 movie about the publication of the Pentagon Papers. The sports section faced a roller coaster of its own after it was initially reported that the Post was forgoing sending any of its journalists to cover the Winter Olympics next month in Italy, a decision that was reversed on Monday following intense blowback. Like the foreign affairs beat, the sports section may also be gutted. \"The Washington Post, the paper I grew up reading, is potentially considering shuttering its sports desk entirely amidst layoffs, isn’t sending baseball reporters to spring training, and in general is just going down the tubes,\" ESPN’s Clinton Yates, who spent nine years at the Post, said Monday on his radio show. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD \"Shutting down the sports section at the Washington Post is akin to removing a monument as far as I’m concerned,\" he continued. \"And I think a lot of people would agree with me.\" New York Times reporter Peter Baker believes international and sports coverage are \"two of the strongest parts\" of the Post. \"They have amazing must-read writers. If they are gutted by Bezos's publisher, it would be one of the most self-destructive acts in American journalism in years. Praying it's not true,\" Baker wrote on X. But prayers might not be enough, as the Post's former media reporter, Paul Farhi, told Fox News Digital that he heard rumors from his former colleagues that \"up to 300 people\" could be laid off by the next round of cuts. \"I was just texting with a friend. She said it was genuinely heartbreaking,\" Kessler said. \"Then I got [a] text from another former colleague, a star reporter. She said it was incredible that she could be laid off.\" NY POST, WSJ, NY TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST ALIGN AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN OVER ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS Kessler left the Post last summer after 27 years at the paper, taking a voluntary buyout. His former boss, Washington Post CEO and publisher Will Lewis, called for staffers who don't \"feel aligned\" with the new direction of the paper to consider taking the buyout. \"There were many who wanted to stick with the Post and chose to stay. So they feel especially betrayed — though of course no one knows what’s really happening. Except it sounds bad,\" Kessler told Fox News Digital. The Post has been plagued by low morale and financial struggles for years, and there has already been a significant exodus of staffers, many of whom have taken positions at rival publications like The New York Times and The Atlantic. Bezos took heat from employees in 2024 when he abruptly axed the paper's planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for the White House, after the editorial board had previously declared Trump the worst president in modern history. The surprising decision shortly before the election sparked massive subscriber losses and a slew of staff resignations. Bezos later fueled more outrage when he announced he was overhauling its editorial pages to promote \"free markets and personal liberties.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Amazon founder is fueling outrage once again, with headlines such as \"Jeff Bezos Is Putting The Washington Post Into Hospice\" popping up across the internet. Bezos is the fourth-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $250 billion, according to Forbes. Many in the media industry have long wondered why he wouldn’t reach into his pockets in order to save rank-and-file Post employees. \"Jeff Bezos’ destruction of a great newspaper will be part of his legacy. #SaveThePost,\" famed baseball reporter Ken Rosenthal posted Monday on X. \"You know what, let’s spend a little less on the boat foam wedding party and keep some f---ing reporters in Tehran,\" Jon Stewart quipped Monday night on \"The Daily Show,\" referring to Bezos’ extravagant 2025 wedding that cost a reported $50 million. Others have thought it presumptuous that Bezos should continue to shell out money for a company that's losing money. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Democrats, who landed three of Iowa's four House seats in the 2018 midterm elections during Trump's first term, see a prime opportunity to unseat Iowa incumbents.\n\nThis election will be the first since 1968 with open seats for both governor and U.S. senator at the top of the ticket after Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds and Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst opted out of reelection bids. The political shake-ups have rippled throughout the state, with Republican Reps. Randy Feenstra and Ashley Hinson seeking new offices for governor and for U.S. senator, respectively.\n\nDemocrats hope Rob Sand, the lone Democrat in statewide office who is running for governor, will make the entire state more competitive with his appeal to moderate and conservative voters and his $13 million in cash on hand.","url":"https://news.net/news/trump-visits-iowa-trying-to-focus-on-affordability-during-fallout-over-nurses-minneapolis-shooting/","image":"https://dymlcaxjpm5z9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23235728/Trump_Switzerland_Davos_48780-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 18:16:12","author":"Seung Min Kim","authors":["Seung Min Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":396712200,"title":"John Stamos Attacks ICE Agents as 'The Bad Guys'","text":"Full House star John Stamos came out swinging against federal immigration officers, calling them “the bad guys” and saying they aren’t treating people “like human beings.”\n\nOn Monday, the actor posted to his Instagram Stories an image of a handwritten note laying out his feelings on the left-wing agitator-induced unrest in Minneapolis.\n\n“I usually stay out of politics. This doesn’t feel like that,” Stamos wrote in his note. “What I’m seeing from ICE feels cruel. I don’t need it explained away or reframed. I trust my own eyes!”\n\n“When people are treated like threats instead of human beings, when fear is the tactic, something is broken,” he expounded. “‘Stay in your lane, actor’ doesn’t apply when basic humanity is the lane. This is all of our lane! I’m tired of the hypocrisy, too. The speed of the cycle has erased shame. Harm happens, outrage flashes, then we move on like nothing stuck.”\n\n“But it sticks,” he concluded, “This doesn’t feel right, and staying quiet feels worse. Lately, it feels like the bad guys are winning. Maybe the least we can do is not look away.”\n\nStamos endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, even going so far as to say that he wouldn’t mind paying far more in taxes under Harris, writing on Instagram, “I’m okay with paying higher taxes if it means a stronger, fairer system that lifts everyone. My cup overflows, and I believe it should help fill others’ too.”\n\nLeft-wingers were upset with Stamos, though, when he appeared at Mar-a-Lago last April and they accused him of supporting Trump. But the accusation was incorrect because he was not at the resort to support Trump, but was instead there to emcee an event for the nonprofit Palm Beach Ray of Hope, which was running its “Dancing with the Palm Beach Stars” to raise money to support nursing students.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: Facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston, or at X/Twitter @WTHuston","summary":"\"Full House\" star John Stamos came out swinging against federal immigration officers, calling them \"the bad guys\" and saying they aren't treating people \"like human beings.\"\n\n\nThe post John Stamos Attacks ICE Agents as &#8216;The Bad Guys&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/27/john-stamos-attacks-ice-agents-as-the-bad-guys/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/johnstamos-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 18:04:21","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":396677176,"title":"The truth behind the '5-year-old detained by ICE' story — that the Democrats don't want you to know","text":"The Democrats' manipulation of the truth is truly unmatched, and the latest example of this is one of the most egregious BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales has seen yet.\n\nIn a post on X, the Democratic Party’s official account posted a photo of a young boy whose father was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement alongside the caption, “In Minneapolis, ICE arrested a 5-year-old coming home from preschool and tried to use him as human bait. His teacher describes him as ‘a bright young student.’ These monsters are sick.”\n\n“The claim then got repeated, over and over and over again,” Gonzales says.\n\nEven Kamala Harris bought and sold the lie, writing in her own post on X, “Liam Ramos is just a baby. He should be at home with his family, not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center. I am outraged, and you should be too.”\n\nIlhan Omar joined in, writing in another X post, “ICE just detained a 5-year-old. Don’t tell us this is about ‘the worst of the worst.’ That’s a lie. Absolutely vile.”\n\nThe mainstream media also picked up the claim, with a headline from ABC News reading, “5-year-old asylum seeker detained as ICE expands enforcement in Minnesota.”\n\nVice President JD Vance also chimed in, but instead of repeating the lie, he told the truth.\n\n“I see this story, and I’m a father of a 5-year-old ... and I think to myself, ‘Oh my God, this is terrible. How did we arrest a 5-year-old?’ Well I do a little bit more follow-up research, and what I find is that the 5-year-old was not arrested, that his dad was an illegal alien, and then when they went to arrest his illegal alien father, the father ran,” Vance said.\n\n“So the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death?” he asked.\n\n“And now the story becomes much different because it transformed from ICE just arrested a 5-year-old to wait a second, this loving father just literally abandoned his kid,” Gonzales comments.\n\n“They’re just trying to save themselves from ICE. And ICE ends up being the true heroes of the story. Ironically enough, ICE were the ones who heroically swooped in to help this poor child who was abandoned by his awful father,” she adds.\n\nWant more from Sara Gonzales?\n\nTo enjoy more of Sara's no-holds-barred takes on news and culture, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/sara-gonzales-unfiltered/the-truth-behind-the-5-year-old-detained-by-ice-story-that-the-democrats-dont-want-you-to-know","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=63297923&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C13%2C0%2C107","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 18:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":396736920,"title":"Sad reason Twilight star Kristen Stewart wants to quit US","text":"Kristen Stewart may have to give up her multimillion-dollar property portfolio after revealing her plans to leave the US due to President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on films – an industry that has secured many of the star’s assets.\n\nThe Twilight actress, who owns homes in Los Angeles and New York, opened up about her desire to relocate to Europe because she “can’t work freely” in America.\n\nHer directorial debut, The Chronology of Water, was shot in Latvia as she told The Times “it would have been impossible to do in the States”\n\nThe Panic Room star then took aim at Mr Trump’s tariff plans on films made outside of the US, describing them as “terrifying” for the film industry as a whole.\n\n“Reality is breaking completely under Trump, but we should take a page out of his book and create the reality we want to live in,” she said.\n\nStewart, who splits her time between Los Angeles and New York, confessed she’s “probably not” going to stay in America.\n\n“I can’t work freely there, but I don’t want to give up completely.

Josh Shapiro on Tuesday to respond to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ insults against him.\n\nIn his memoir, “Where We Keep The Light,” Shapiro revealed that the vetting team for Harris’ presidential campaign asked the governor if he was a “double agent” for Israel, which personally offended him. During his appearance on “The View,” Shapiro said he harbored no ill will toward Harris and was grateful to have been considered for the role.\n\n“It was an honor to be considered and throughout that whole process. Laura and I just talked about is this the best way for us to serve? Is this the best way for us to have an impact to get stuff done?” Shapiro told co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin. “And as we were reaching the end of this process where I was quite literally on my way to meet with the vice president, to have, by the way, what ended up being an unbelievably candid and honest conversation and to this day I’m grateful to her for that candor.” \n\n“I did receive a call on my way in asking me that question of really about I think dual loyalty, which is how it landed on me. Look, I don’t harbor any ill will I these folks had a job to do. They got questions to ask. I’m a big boy,” the governor continued. (RELATED: Josh Shapiro Gives Clearest Indication Yet That Kamala May Have Snubbed Him Because He’s Jewish)\n\nHarris wrote in her own book, “107 Days,” that she worried about Shapiro being overly confident and wanting to serve as a “co-president” rather than a vice president. Shapiro extended some grace to the former vice president when co-host Ana Navarro brought these claims up.\n\n“Well, first of all, I didn’t view my book as a response. In fact, I finished that before I ever read her. So it’s hardly a response. I wanted to make sure that I was being forthright with people about what I went through, how I process these decisions,” Shapiro said. “As I said a moment ago, getting the chance to speak about this for the first time and what is otherwise a process that’s pretty closed. And to me, this wasn’t about dishing respectfully.\n\n“It was just more about how we went through the process, what I thought, what I felt coming out of it,” Shapiro continued. “And I hope the story there shows that I’m someone who’s driven to serve and to serve in a way that still allows me to be a good dad, a good husband and have an impact on people’s lives. That was my focus.”\n\nWhile Harris considered Shapiro as a potential running mate, she faced pressure from left-wing Democrats, including former Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who claimed Shapiro was too pro-Israel. In a December 2025 interview with The Atlantic, Shapiro angrily disputed Harris’ worries about him in her memoir, calling her claims “utter bullshit.”\n\nHarris also claimed in her book that Shapiro “mused” about being in the room for every decision and had “unrealistic expectations.” She later picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate following the support of most of her staff and her 17-year-old godson. Her husband, Doug, threw his support behind Shapiro because he had known him longer.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Bill Cassidy didn’t simply criticize the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nFollowing the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer, the Louisiana Republican warned of broader implications for the federal government.\n\n“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” Cassidy wrote in a social media post, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, President Donald Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies. Administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis and contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\nIn the hours after Pretti’s killing, top Trump officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem were quick to cast Pretti as an instigator who “approached” officers with a gun and acted violently. But videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer before a half-dozen agents descend on him.\n\nDuring the scuffle, he held a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry. The administration has said investigations are ongoing, though information hasn’t yet emerged to support some of the provocative initial claims.\n\n“We trust our national leaders to tell us accurately about the world that we don’t experience directly but about which they have knowledge,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “If someone is credible in that role, then their description of reality should match your perception of reality if you’re a dispassionate, fair individual.”\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, sought to distance Trump from some of the initial claims about Pretti — including allegations that he was a domestic terrorist — noting they didn’t come from the president himself.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust.\n\nIn calling for a “transparent, independent investigation,” Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, wrote to constituents online that “you’ve trusted me, and maintaining that trust matters.”\n\n“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” he wrote.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., is pushing an amendment to a DHS funding bill that would force independent probes of DHS, ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. She hasn’t yet won GOP support for the measure but said in a statement “this isn’t a red or blue issue.”\n\n“It’s about truth and accountability,” she said.\n\nFeeding social media platforms with content\n\nTrump and his team have spent much of his second term studiously feeding content to social media platforms to engage their most loyal supporters in ways that independent fact checkers have found to be distorted or baseless. During its immigration crackdown, the administration’s accounts have posted unflattering images of people being taken into custody.\n\nThe extent of efforts to manipulate images became clear last week when the White House posted a picture on its X page of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong crying with her hands behind her back as she was escorted by a blurred person wearing a badge. The photo was captioned in all caps: “Arrested far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.”\n\nA photo posted by Noem’s account showed the same image with Levy Armstrong wearing a neutral expression.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, fueled false claims online that Haitians in an Ohio community were abducting and eating pets. Pressed on the issue, Vance said he was amplifying the claims to draw attention to immigration policies advocated by Democrats.\n\n“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” Vance said at the time, quickly clarifying that he “created the focus that allowed the media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by policies.”\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to face questions about trust.\n\nPresidents and credibility\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration was undone by his handling of the Vietnam War, which ushered in an era of broad skepticism about Washington. Just 38% of Americans said last year that they trusted the federal government’s ability to handle domestic problems at least a fair amount, according to Gallup polling. That’s down from 70% in 1972.\n\nOnce they leave the White House, presidents are often candid about mistakes that eroded their credibility. In his memoir, President George W. Bush wrote about the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was a predicate for launching a deadly and costly war there.\n\n“That was a massive blow to our credibility — my credibility,” he wrote. “No one was more shocked or angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons. I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan marked a turning point in his administration. And in her memoir of the 2024 campaign, his vice president, Kamala Harris, wrote of rejecting the Biden campaign’s talking points after his dismal debate performance.\n\n“I was not about to tell the American people that their eyes had lied,” she wrote. “I would not jeopardize my own credibility.”\n\nBut none of that compares to the credibility challenge facing Trump, according to Barbara Perry, the co-director of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, who noted the sheer volume of lies and exaggerations that have emerged from his administration.\n\n“Donald Trump is unique,” she said. “If you count up all of the times he has prevaricated, it would have to outweigh all other presidencies.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

He claims that Vice President Kamala Harris’ team took issue with his critique of the COVID-19 response.\n\nShapiro was in the running to become Harris’ vice presidential pick after she unexpectedly became the Democratic nominee during the 2024 election cycle. This happened after President Joe Biden decided not to seek re-election, citing concerns about his age.\n\nIn his book, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” which will be released on Tuesday, Shapiro mentions twice how his critical stance on COVID-19 measures upset Harris’ team during his interview process.\n\nDuring his 2022 gubernatorial campaign, Shapiro expressed that prolonged closures of schools and businesses were unnecessary. These measures had been implemented during Donald Trump’s presidency, with significant support from Democrats.\n\nHe also argued that mandates for masks and vaccinations were excessive, a position that contrasted with the Biden administration’s policies, which were upheld while Harris served as vice president.\n\n“I believed in those views then, and I still stand by them today. It became evident that the individuals assessing me saw these opinions as potentially damaging to Kamala, interpreting them as a criticism of her,” Shapiro reflected in his book.\n\n‘I wasn’t being critical of her, I told them. But I didn’t think that the Biden-Harris administration got everything right. Nor did I think that the Trump administration did,’ he added. \n\nShapiro wrote that he was simply ‘willing to say the quiet part out loud,’ even asking Harris’ aides if they thought the Biden White House had done everything right, ‘to which they generally agreed that we had not.’\n\nThe 52-year-old Democrat, who is widely expected to run for the White House in 2028, writes negatively about the veepstakes process, which was done in a rushed fashion due to Biden dropping out of the race in late July. \n\nIn excerpts from the book, it was previously reported that Shapiro, who is Jewish, was asked if he had ever been an agent of Israel by former White House counsel Dana Remus, a member of the vice presidential selection committee.\n\n‘Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,’ Shapiro wrote.\n\nBut he was also miffed at how some policy differences – including on COVID-19 and that he was against defunding the police – were somehow considered to be detrimental to the Democratic ticket. \n\n‘The questions kept coming: Did I think it would get awkward if my positions were at odds with the Vice President’s? Are you going to have a hard time supporting her views? Will you have a hard time doing what she says? Don’t you think your views would cause her to be embarrassed?’ Shapiro recounted.\n\n‘All I kept saying was this is what I believe, and these positions have been widely accepted here in Pennsylvania,’ he said. \n\nShapiro won the governor’s mansion in 2022 by nearly 15 points in the state that could decide the 2024 presidential election. \n\n‘I felt like my views could be an asset. I didn’t see anything wrong with not aligning perfectly,’ he argued. ‘And they weren’t going to expand her universe by doing the exact same thing that she had been doing all these years.’\n\nWhen he finally sat down for an interview with Harris in the vice president’s residence, he recalled how miserable she made the job seem. \n\n‘She explained that her time as Vice President had been tough,’ Shapiro wrote. ‘That she answered to President Biden’s senior staff, and her schedule and priorities weren’t her own. That a meeting she’d prepare for weeks for would get scrapped in an instant. But that was how it went.’\n\nHarris characterized the job not as a partnership, but to only serve the president. \n\n‘I was surprised by how much she seemed to dislike the role,’ Shapiro recalled. ‘She noted that her chief of staff would be giving me my directions, lamented that the Vice President didn’t have a private bathroom in their office, and how difficult it was for her at times not to have a voice in decision making.’\n\nShapiro repeated a line that Harris had written in her own book, 107 Days, in which she was critical of the Pennsylvania governor, saying she had a ‘nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two.’ \n\n‘You need to remember that song “99 problems,”‘ Shapiro said Harris told him. ‘That’s what it’s like.’ \n\n‘Your job, she explained to me is to make sure that you are not a problem for the President,’ Shapiro wrote. \n\nShapiro said that he hoped the job could be more like the setup he had with his Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis, but Harris couldn’t agree to that.\n\n‘I told her that I knew I wasn’t going to be the decision maker here,’ Shapiro recalled. ‘If we had door A and door B as options, and she was for door A and I was for door B, I just wanted to make sure that I could make the case for door B. And if I didn’t convince her, then I’d run right through a brick wall to support her decision and make sure it succeeded.’ \n\n‘She was crystal clear that that was not what she was looking for,’ the Pennsylvania governor recalled. ‘I would primarily work with her staff. She couldn’t say to me that I would have that kind of access to her.’\n\nIn the book, Shapiro credited Harris for her candor, explaining that it ‘allowed me to walk out of the room knowing full well everything I needed to know in order to understand the role.’\n\nThe governor got more irritated about what happened after the interview.\n\nHe was told to stick around Washington, D.C., and so he was taken to the apartment of former Attorney General Eric Holder in case Harris needed to question him again.\n\nHolder was in charge of the veepstakes process – but wasn’t there when Shapiro arrived.\n\n‘At one point, a tall young man came into the apartment. It turned out to be Eric’s son, who lived there and, appropriately, seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see him,’ Shapiro recalled. \n\nHe had told Harris’ team he needed to get back to Pennsylvania, but they left him at Holder’s apartment for several hours.\n\n‘I was growing less and less patient and more and more sure that this was not what I wanted to sign up for,’ Shapiro wrote.\n\nFinally, Remus came to the apartment and bluntly told Shapiro that she thought he didn’t want the job – she added that she was concerned, after years in public service, he couldn’t afford it. \n\n‘From the financial vetting, she said that she knew we didn’t have a lot of money, and that Lori was going to have to get new clothes and pay for people to do her hair and makeup,’ Shapiro said, referring to his wife. ‘[T]hat we would have to pay for all of the food and entertainment at the Vice President’s residence, and that could be really challenging for us.’ \n\nShapiro recalled being a ‘little slack-jawed’ by the conversation, asking Remus if she was trying to convince him not to sign up for this. \n\nThe former White House counsel said she was just trying to be realistic, Shapiro wrote.\n\n‘The comments were unkind to me. They were nasty to Lori. I hold no grudge against Remus, who I know was doing the job she had to do, but I needed to leave,’ he recalled.\n\nShapiro wrote that he pulled out of the veepstakes before Harris announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but Remus ‘told me that the VP would not handle bad news well’ and so he didn’t tell Harris personally – nor was it ever made public.\n\nIn fact, Shapiro wasn’t sure if Harris ever knew he bowed out.\n\n‘I still had no idea whether Dana Remus and the rest of her team had shared that I’d called to inform them I didn’t want to move forward the night after our meeting,’ he recalled. \n\nHarris did call the governor to tell him that Walz was her pick. \n\n‘I told her how excited I was by her choice,’ Shapiro said. ‘I meant it.’ \n\nA Harris spokesperson and Remus did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail’s requests for comment. \n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, who is also Jewish and has floated a 2028 run, told reporters this week that he wasn’t offended by the Harris campaign’s line of questioning.\n\n‘The questions are tough,’ Pritzker said. ‘I think you’ve got to be tough during the process.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has added a new twist to the vice-presidential&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Josh Shapiro Unveils the Unspoken Truth: How Kamala Harris&#8217; COVID Misstep Impacted VP Selection first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/josh-shapiro-unveils-the-unspoken-truth-how-kamala-harris-covid-misstep-impacted-vp-selection/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Josh-Shapiro-reveals-saying-the-quiet-part-out-loud-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 17:03:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":396657794,"title":"Trump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis","text":"By STEVEN SLOAN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.

Bill Cassidy didn’t simply criticize the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nFollowing the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer, the Louisiana Republican warned of broader implications for the federal government.\n\n“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” Cassidy wrote in a social media post, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, President Donald Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies. Administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis and contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\nIn the hours after Pretti’s killing, top Trump officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem were quick to cast Pretti as an instigator who “approached” officers with a gun and acted violently. But videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer before a half-dozen agents descend on him.\n\nDuring the scuffle, he held a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry. The administration has said investigations are ongoing, though information hasn’t yet emerged to support some of the provocative initial claims.\n\n“We trust our national leaders to tell us accurately about the world that we don’t experience directly but about which they have knowledge,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “If someone is credible in that role, then their description of reality should match your perception of reality if you’re a dispassionate, fair individual.”\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, sought to distance Trump from some of the initial claims about Pretti — including allegations that he was a domestic terrorist — noting they didn’t come from the president himself.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust.\n\nIn calling for a “transparent, independent investigation,” Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, wrote to constituents online that “you’ve trusted me, and maintaining that trust matters.”\n\n“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” he wrote.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., is pushing an amendment to a DHS funding bill that would force independent probes of DHS, ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. She hasn’t yet won GOP support for the measure but said in a statement “this isn’t a red or blue issue.”\n\n“It’s about truth and accountability,” she said.\n\nFeeding social media platforms with content\n\nTrump and his team have spent much of his second term studiously feeding content to social media platforms to engage their most loyal supporters in ways that independent fact checkers have found to be distorted or baseless. During its immigration crackdown, the administration’s accounts have posted unflattering images of people being taken into custody.\n\nThe extent of efforts to manipulate images became clear last week when the White House posted a picture on its X page of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong crying with her hands behind her back as she was escorted by a blurred person wearing a badge. The photo was captioned in all caps: “Arrested far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.”\n\nA photo posted by Noem’s account showed the same image with Levy Armstrong wearing a neutral expression.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, fueled false claims online that Haitians in an Ohio community were abducting and eating pets. Pressed on the issue, Vance said he was amplifying the claims to draw attention to immigration policies advocated by Democrats.\n\n“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” Vance said at the time, quickly clarifying that he “created the focus that allowed the media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by policies.”\n\nTrump is hardly the first president to face questions about trust.\n\nPresidents and credibility\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration was undone by his handling of the Vietnam War, which ushered in an era of broad skepticism about Washington. Just 38% of Americans said last year that they trusted the federal government’s ability to handle domestic problems at least a fair amount, according to Gallup polling. That’s down from 70% in 1972.\n\nOnce they leave the White House, presidents are often candid about mistakes that eroded their credibility. In his memoir, President George W. Bush wrote about the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was a predicate for launching a deadly and costly war there.\n\n“That was a massive blow to our credibility — my credibility,” he wrote. “No one was more shocked or angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons. I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan marked a turning point in his administration. And in her memoir of the 2024 campaign, his vice president, Kamala Harris, wrote of rejecting the Biden campaign’s talking points after his dismal debate performance.\n\n“I was not about to tell the American people that their eyes had lied,” she wrote. “I would not jeopardize my own credibility.”\n\nBut none of that compares to the credibility challenge facing Trump, according to Barbara Perry, the co-director of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, who noted the sheer volume of lies and exaggerations that have emerged from his administration.\n\n“Donald Trump is unique,” she said. “If you count up all of the times he has prevaricated, it would have to outweigh all other presidencies.”","summary":"The situation highlights ongoing challenges with credibility in the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/27/presidential-trust/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Homeland_Secretary_Kristi_Noem_01640_068e1f.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 16:51:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":396686940,"title":"Nolte: Stephen Colbert Sinks to Lowest January Demo Ratings in Show’s History","text":"The far-left Late Show with Stephen Colbert is suffering some of the worst ratings in the history of the now-canceled show.\n\nThis is a pretty good data point as to why Colbert was canceled [emphasis original]:\n\nAccording to Nielsen data reported this week, Colbert’s show is averaging roughly 285,000 viewers in the crucial 25–54 demographic, putting it on track for its worst January performance ever in the category that advertisers actually care about. With just months left before the curtain closes for good, the ratings trajectory suggests viewers have been checking out long before CBS formally pulled the plug.\n\nThe age demo is what sets advertising rates, and that kind of collapse not only explains why the show is costing CBS a reported $40 million a year in losses, but as his May end-date approaches, it proves that any hope he had to use the martyrdom of the cancellation to boost his ratings is not happening.\n\nHere’s some more context…\n\nThroughout 2025, Colbert averaged 2.545 million viewers. Last week, Colbert averaged only 2.249 million viewers. While he beat Jimmy Kimmel (2.1 million) and Jimmy Fallon (1.25 million) last week, over at Fox News, Greg Gutfeld tops them all with 3.2 million.\n\nKeep in mind Gutfeld! is pulling in those numbers when he is only available through cable. Colbert is on a broadcast network, which is available for free to almost everyone.\n\nYou would think millions of Trump haters would be tuning into Colbert just to spite Trump or to make CBS look bad for canceling him. Instead, he’s losing viewers, which proves the cancellation decision was the correct one. The audience just isn’t there, not even in a country where just five percent of Kamala Harris voters would save his show.\n\nThe problem with Colbert is what it has always been: the guy sucks. He’s not funny. He’s not honest. He’s didactic, charmless, and has no real charisma. Everything always has to be about Colbert and his hatred for Trump and his precious feelings about things. He’s not there to entertain. He’s there to lecture, scold, and preen.\n\nEven leftists get tired of being lectured.\n\nDon’t accuse me of being partisan when I find Bill Maher funny. Maher’s wrong about almost everything, but he knows how to craft and deliver a joke. Colbert and Maher are both smug, but Colbert’s smugness is not part of his comedy persona. It’s oily and self-satisfied and just there, whereas Maher’s smugness is part of the act. Maher’s the loudmouth in the back of the classroom. Colbert is the kiss-ass in the front row.\n\nGutfeld is hilarious for the same reason as Maher: great writing, but Gutfeld’s got something neither Maher nor Colbert has, and that’s charm. Gutfeld is likable and self-deprecating.\n\nColbert has nothing to offer, and as we can see, even leftists aren’t going to miss him.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.","summary":"The far-left Late Show with Stephen Colbert is suffering some of the worst ratings in the history of the now-canceled show.\n\n\nThe post Nolte: Stephen Colbert Sinks to Lowest January Demo Ratings in Show’s History appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/27/nolte-stephen-colbert-sinks-to-lowest-january-demo-ratings-in-shows-history/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/GettyImages-2250634619-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 16:37:10","author":"John Nolte","authors":["John Nolte"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":396655188,"title":"Trump's about-face after Pretti's death latest in pattern of shifts","text":"By AAMER MADHANI and STEVE KARNOWSKI\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shifted toward a more conciliatory approach with Democratic leaders in Minnesota on Monday, a sudden change in tack following an outcry over the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the state this month during the administration’s nationwide crackdown on undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe about-face comes after Saturday’s shooting death of Alex Pretti by federal agents raised doubts — including from some Republicans — over how the Trump administration has gone about aggressively deporting migrants and confronting protesters opposed to the policy.\n\nBut it’s just the latest in a string of moments where Trump has first taken a maximalist position only to appear to later retreat.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force to squelch recent antigovernment protests.

The White House offered scant details about the deal, which Trump announced the day after the stock market saw one of its worst days in months in response to his tariff threat.\n\nThen on Monday, Trump’s administration changed up oversight of his immigration operation in Minnesota, and the typically bombastic Trump offered a warmer tone toward Gov.

Greg Abbott, who has been a strong supporter of Trump’s crackdown on immigration, offered measured criticism in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Davis, saying the White House needs to “recalibrate” what it was doing in Minnesota. Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott called on Trump to reset and de-escalate.\n\n“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”\n\nTrump had scorched Walz.

Human rights groups said thousands were killed, but Trump says he’s holding off on acting after he received assurances Tehran was suspending hundreds of planned executions.\n\nLast week, Trump first announced plans to impose new tariffs on European allies that refused to go along with his calls for the U.S. to take control of the Arctic territory of Greenland — only to abruptly cancel the tariffs after saying he’d come to terms of the “framework” of an agreement. The White House offered scant details about the deal, which Trump announced the day after the stock market saw one of its worst days in months in response to his tariff threat.\n\nThen on Monday, Trump’s administration changed up oversight of his immigration operation in Minnesota, and the typically bombastic Trump offered a warmer tone toward Gov. Tim Walz after speaking with the Democrat, saying he and Walz were now on a “similar wavelength.”\n\nSome Republicans took issue with what happened in Minneapolis\n\nIt was a particularly jarring turnabout for Trump, who had promised to be uncompromising on carrying out mass deportations of undocumented migrants during his 2024 campaign — and because Trump has repeatedly scorched Walz and other Minnesota Democrats in personal terms for resisting his policies.\n\nTrump said he had dispatched border czar Tom Homan to take charge. Meanwhile, senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and some agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump declared on social media that Walz “was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Later, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirmed that some agents would be leaving the city after he spoke with Trump — and suggested that the president seemed to be coming to the conclusion that the current state of federal operations was unsustainable. Homan and Frey were expected to meet Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s change-up in Minnesota came after some Republicans questioned federal agents’ tactics in Saturday’s shooting as well as the White House’s response. Some high-ranking administration officials had branded Pretti a domestic terrorist even as videos of the encounter contradicted their narrative.\n\nMinnesota gubernatorial candidate Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney, ended his GOP campaign in a surprise video announcement Monday, calling the recent immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities an “unmitigated disaster” and saying he no longer wanted to be a member of the party because of it.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been a strong supporter of Trump’s crackdown on immigration, offered measured criticism in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Davis, saying the White House needs to “recalibrate” what it was doing in Minnesota. Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott called on Trump to reset and de-escalate.\n\n“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”\n\nTrump had scorched Walz. Now, they’re on a ‘similar wavelength’\n\nThe president’s approach toward Walz, who served as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024, amounted to a sharp U-turn.\n\nJust a day earlier, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, had derided Walz on social media as trying to “incite attacks on” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The White House social media team in a series of posts called the governor “a truly disturbed, unstable individual” and an “unhinged lunatic” who “rants and raves and lies.”\n\nMiller also referred to Pretti, a nurse who worked at a Veterans Affairs hospital, as a “would-be assassin” while Homeland Security Kristi Noem labeled the ICU nurse as committing an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe White House sidestepped whether Trump agreed with his senior aides’ rhetoric or whether the administration would apologize for it.\n\n“This incident remains under investigation,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. “And nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives.”\n\nHis response has been muted compared to other recent deaths\n\nTrump’s response to the deaths of the two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis has been much more muted than reactions to political violence that he’s portrayed as targeting his own political movement.\n\nAfter conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September, the president spoke to the nation from the Oval Office and called Kirk’s death “a dark moment for America.”\n\nIn November, Trump gave a national address after two National Guard members were shot in Washington by an Afghan national, one fatally. The guard members had been deployed to the nation’s capital as part of a federal mission to assist with local policing, and the president called the shooting “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.”\n\nBut the president has yet to speak directly to the nation about the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good, another U.S. citizen who was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis earlier this month. Trump has so far largely chosen to keep the public informed in the wake of Pretti’s death with social media posts.\n\nEven as his comments Monday appeared to be aimed at turning down the rhetoric, Trump’s chief spokesperson, Leavitt, continued to blame Walz and other Minnesota Democrats for encouraging “left-wing agitators to stop, record, confront and obstruct federal officers who are just trying to lawfully perform their duties.”\n\n“This is precisely what unfolded in Minneapolis on Saturday morning,” Leavitt added.\n\nAP writers Josh Boak and Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed reporting.

Tim Walz spoke by phone on Monday to discuss cooperation on the deteriorating illegal immigrant roundup in that state. Also, Trump announced that Border Czar Tom Homan will take over enforcement in Minnesota and will allow a state-level investigation into the killings of two anti-ICE agitators. Walz says that his state has cooperated in handing over criminal illegals and blamed county- and city-level officials for non-cooperation. Gov. Walz is the leader of the Gopher State, and so far, his “leadership” has entailed encouraging agitators and promising to prosecute ICE agents. The intervention of an anti-ICE agitator that turned fatal over the weekend led to the escape of a criminal illegal sought by ICE. If Walz is serious about cooperation, he will need to force the cities and counties in his state to hand over criminal illegals.\nHotel standoff: On Sunday evening in Minneapolis, a group of anti-ICE agitators surrounded a Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel and smashed windows, destroyed the hotel’s sign façade, graffitied the building with “ICE OUT” and “ICE KILLS” messages, and raised a din of noise. These agitators were members of the Sunrise Movement, a radical leftist outfit that receives funding from nonprofits such as George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Ford Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. A post on Sunrise’s social media states their objective: “Our strategy to target hotels that are housing ICE agents is WORKING,” adding, “Two hotels in the Twin Cities just decided to pause their operations rather than house ICE agents.” Eventually, heavily armed federal agents arrived and quickly deployed tear gas and flash-bangs to disperse the agitators.\nMidterm conventions? Both the Republican and Democrat Parties are pursuing the idea of holding a midterm convention to boost turnout this November. The Republican National Committee approved a rule change on Friday that would enable its first-ever midterm convention. Democrats are quietly floating the same idea, pulling from their own historical playbook, having held such conventions in the 1970s and ‘80s. The RNC is acting in accordance with the president’s suggestion to hold a convention. RNC Chair Joe Gruters proposed that the event would likely be held in August, which is usual for RNC conventions, and that it would be a “Trump-a-palooza” highlighting the president’s accomplishments and congressional candidates. Eighteen House races are expected to be toss-ups this fall, with the Republicans looking to hang on to a razor-thin majority.\nVenezuela’s shift: The acting president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, made an appearance on the nation’s state-run TV on Sunday and stated that she has had “enough already of Washington’s orders over politicians in Venezuela.” She called on the Trump administration to allow Venezuela to resolve its internal political differences without U.S. interference. President Trump praised Rodríguez’s leadership just last week, saying she “had done a very good job” of working with the U.S. It’s unclear whether Rodríguez is sending a message to the Trump administration or posing to the cameras to show strength to her own people. Regardless, Rodríguez might want to tread carefully with Nobel Peace Prize recipient María Corina Machado waiting in the wings should Trump decide that Rodríguez is not working out.\nNBC discovers that ObamaCare is lousy: Government healthcare has always been a bad idea. It’s obvious in the UK, where wait times are routinely months or years; it’s obvious in Canada, where the Medical Assistance in Dying scheme has become a leading cause of death; and it’s obvious in the U.S. with the (Un)Affordable Care Act. It’s so obvious that even NBC News is now reporting about the system’s failure. One couple, NBC explains, had to switch to a bronze plan under ObamaCare for economic reasons, leaving them with an $18,000 annual deductible despite only a couple of thousand dollars in savings. The average deductible for an individual on the bronze plan, NBC discovered, is $7,500. NBC is quick to blame the expiration of enhanced subsidies in January as the root issue, but all that the expiration exposed is the unaffordable nature of the Democrats’ healthcare scheme.\nAAP ignores CDC: The American Academy of Pediatrics, which comprises approximately 67,000 pediatricians, released its vaccine recommendations on Monday, standing by its stance from last year and rejecting the CDC’s changes to the schedule. The AAP is refusing to follow the CDC’s lead on removing hepatitis A and B, COVID-19, influenza, rotavirus, and meningococcal immunizations from its list of 18 recommendations. Dr. Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician who chairs the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases, claims the CDC is not making decisions based on science, but rather ideology, and that the AAP is going to continue to make its recommendations “based on what’s in the best interest of children.” A spokeswoman for HHS countered that the CDC’s positions are informed by a whole scientific panel of public health experts, physicians, and scientists, noting that the AAP “is angry that the CDC eliminated corporate influence in vaccine recommendations.”\nVirginia group starts new sanctuary 2A movement: As newly inaugurated “moderate” Democrat Abigail Spanberger continues to push the hardest-left agenda she can think of on the good citizens of the Old Dominion, some are beginning to fight back. The Virginia Citizens Defense League is calling for the “Second Amendment sanctuary movement 2.0,” which would essentially be a reactivation of a movement that swept the Commonwealth in 2019 and 2020 when leftists were pushing gun control laws. At that time, 95% of county leaders in the state pledged not to enforce unconstitutional gun laws. The Lynchburg City Council is set to vote today to reaffirm its Second Amendment sanctuary status in the face of Spanberger’s new spate of gun control laws. VCDL leader Philip Van Cleave says the group is also focused on flipping the control of the Virginia Senate back to Republicans in 2028.\nLast Israeli hostage returned: The remains of 24-year-old Ran Gvili were brought into Israel on Monday, marking the return of the last remaining hostage taken into Gaza by Hamas militants during their October 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Gvili was a police officer who was killed on the day of the attack, and his body was taken into Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces stated that Gvili’s remains were identified and confirmed by the National Center of Forensic Medicine, the Israel Police, and the Military Rabbinate, and his family had been notified. Since the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, the IDF carried out a “large-scale operation” to locate Gvili’s body. The return of the last hostage was “an extraordinary achievement,” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “We promised — and I promised — to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive.”\nPersecution of Christians rises around the world: According to the Christian organization Open Doors, almost 400 million Christians across the globe face persecution this year. The organization’s 2026 World Watch List notes the top 50 countries, including the likes of Eritrea, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, where Christians are being threatened with extreme persecution. Nigeria topped the list for the most Christians martyred last year, as the African nation was home to 3,490 of the 4,849 Christians who were killed for their faith in 2025. Syria also rose to the top 10 most dangerous countries for Christians as the Islamic State surged to power. Last June, 22 Christians were attacked and killed in Damascus. American Christians need to pray for their brothers and sisters in the faith across the world who are enduring persecution.\n\nGregory Bovino relieved as Border Patrol commander-at-large (NewsNation)\nFBI investigating Minnesota anti-ICE Signal group chats (Fox News)\nFederal judge blocks Trump DOJ access to Oregon voter rolls (Fox News)\nZelensky: U.S.-Ukraine security deal “100% done” after trilateral talks (Washington Times)\nIran regime reportedly issued nationwide shoot-to-kill orders (Fox News)\n\nThe Executive News Summary is compiled daily by Jordan Candler, Thomas Gallatin, Sterling Henry, and Sophie Starkova.

Their objective is to discredit ICE and the entire Trump administration by provoking the kinds of conflicts that got Renee Good and Alex Pretti killed. People died, these radical leftists rationalize, but at least ICE looked really bad.\n\nOh, and the guy ICE originally sought — a violent criminal named Jose Huerta-Chuma — escaped capture while the subversives occupied ICE agents.\n\nAs the New York Post editorial board put it, “The anti-ICE crew is getting exactly what it wants right now. People looking at a video on TikTok don’t get any of the context: All they’re seeing is a crowd of agents beating a guy onto the ground, with shots then ringing out and him ending up dead. Having Homeland Security double down now is all too likely to produce more such scenes.”\n\nThat means Team Trump had better adjust its own strategy. That doesn’t mean pulling out of Minnesota or ceasing to detain and deport illegal alien criminals, but it does mean a shift in how ICE interacts with the agitators, and it also means some significant personnel changes.\n\nIt seems that President Donald Trump is working on this, beginning with a shift in tone. “Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America’s streets. This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement, and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. “It is President Trump’s hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos to end today.”\n\nPersonnel moves came next. “I am sending [Border Czar] Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” the president announced on Truth Social yesterday. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”\n\nHoman is a serious man who has served in immigration enforcement for decades under administrations of both parties. He has also been at the center of a seemingly growing internal dispute with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over who should be deported. Homan and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons have advocated that the emphasis be put on illegals with criminal records or final deportation orders. Noem and other administration players, by contrast, have favored and pushed a broader approach.\n\nThe one that is causing optics problems for ICE.\n\nNoem herself has caused optics problems with her irresponsible rhetoric after Pretti’s death. She called him a “domestic terrorist,” which is at best hyperbolic nonsense. That term has a specific definition under federal law, and Pretti doesn’t meet it. Neither did Renee Good, whom Noem hit with the same label. Noem (falsely) added that Pretti was “brandishing” his gun, saying, “This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.” None of that is supported by the known facts of the case, and as our Mark Alexander says, it “serves only as an accelerant.”\n\nNoem is a team player and praised Trump’s decision to send Homan. “This is good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis,” she said. “I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team.” Both Noem and Homan directly report to Trump, and Noem had a long meeting with the president on Monday.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Noem’s job is entirely safe. Naturally, many Democrats are rallying for impeachment or demanding that Trump fire her.\n\nThat won’t happen — yet. However, Trump ordered Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino out of Minnesota after he essentially said the same things as Noem — that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”\n\nWe certainly can’t count on Democrats like Governor Tim Walz to speak responsibly. He’s busy comparing Minnesota to the story of Anne Frank and the Nazis, for which even the U.S. Holocaust Museum rebuked him. We should be able to count on Team Trump to accurately speak about incredibly tense situations. Doing so would calm Americans, rather than fomenting more division and anger.\n\nSpeaking of Walz, he wrote an op-ed in which the first paragraph condemns “the Trump administration’s assault on Minnesota” and “campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state.” He assails the enforcement of immigration law as targeting people who “have done nothing wrong except exist as a person of color.” That’s inflammatory hogwash that inspires the people harassing federal agents in the streets.\n\nOn the same day Walz’s incendiary op-ed was published, the president and the governor had what Trump called “a good conversation.” I’m skeptical that a guy who thinks the Trump administration is the reincarnated Nazi regime is interested in cooperating at all, even to meet Trump’s series of very reasonable conditions.\n\nLet’s conclude with a strategic view: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris opened the border, allowing 10-15 million illegals to flood across. Minnesota and several other states and cities, all run by Democrats, are sanctuary jurisdictions, and ICE has to operate in these places because more illegal aliens reside there. Anti-ICE agitators organize, provoke, and film in order to discredit law enforcement. Precious few people appear capable of speaking honestly about the situation or what they (think they) see on video. Everyone is angry and spoiling for a fight.\n\nIt turns out that the more access to “information” people have, the more difficult it becomes to restore the Rule of Law.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nMichael Swartz: ICE Draws Criticism From Clinton and Obama — Two former presidents trash accepted “norms” so they can offer harsh criticism of Donald Trump and his administration’s policies and tactics.\nEmmy Griffin: Vance, Our Pro-Life ‘Ally in the White House’ — Positive reinforcement was given to the March for Life crowd from stalwart pro-life advocate JD Vance.\nDouglas Andrews: Carney Caves — The temporarily tough-talking Canadian PM was “aggressively walking back” his earlier remarks about a new trading partnership with Communist China.\nJack DeVine: Trump in the Court of Public Opinion — I hear alarm bells.

The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nThe latest comes as the Trump administration is grappling with the weekend shooting death of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse killed by federal agents in the neighboring state of Minnesota.

Their objective is to discredit ICE and the entire Trump administration by provoking the kinds of conflicts that got Renee Good and Alex Pretti killed. People died, these radical leftists rationalize, but at least ICE looked really bad.\n\nOh, and the guy ICE originally sought — a violent criminal named Jose Huerta-Chuma — escaped capture while the subversives occupied ICE agents.\n\nAs the New York Post editorial board put it, “The anti-ICE crew is getting exactly what it wants right now. People looking at a video on TikTok don’t get any of the context: All they’re seeing is a crowd of agents beating a guy onto the ground, with shots then ringing out and him ending up dead. Having Homeland Security double down now is all too likely to produce more such scenes.”\n\nThat means Team Trump had better adjust its own strategy. That doesn’t mean pulling out of Minnesota or ceasing to detain and deport illegal alien criminals, but it does mean a shift in how ICE interacts with the agitators, and it also means some significant personnel changes.\n\nIt seems that President Donald Trump is working on this, beginning with a shift in tone. “Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America’s streets. This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement, and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. “It is President Trump’s hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos to end today.”\n\nPersonnel moves came next. “I am sending [Border Czar] Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” the president announced on Truth Social yesterday. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”\n\nHoman is a serious man who has served in immigration enforcement for decades under administrations of both parties. He has also been at the center of a seemingly growing internal dispute with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over who should be deported. Homan and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons have advocated that the emphasis be put on illegals with criminal records or final deportation orders. Noem and other administration players, by contrast, have favored and pushed a broader approach.\n\nThe one that is causing optics problems for ICE.\n\nNoem herself has caused optics problems with her irresponsible rhetoric after Pretti’s death. She called him a “domestic terrorist,” which is at best hyperbolic nonsense. That term has a specific definition under federal law, and Pretti doesn’t meet it. Neither did Renee Good, whom Noem hit with the same label. Noem (falsely) added that Pretti was “brandishing” his gun, saying, “This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.” None of that is supported by the known facts of the case, and as our Mark Alexander says, it “serves only as an accelerant.”\n\nNoem is a team player and praised Trump’s decision to send Homan. “This is good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis,” she said. “I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team.” Both Noem and Homan directly report to Trump, and Noem had a long meeting with the president on Monday.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Noem’s job is entirely safe. Naturally, many Democrats are rallying for impeachment or demanding that Trump fire her.\n\nThat won’t happen — yet. However, Trump ordered Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino out of Minnesota after he essentially said the same things as Noem — that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”\n\nWe certainly can’t count on Democrats like Governor Tim Walz to speak responsibly. He’s busy comparing Minnesota to the story of Anne Frank and the Nazis, for which even the U.S. Holocaust Museum rebuked him. We should be able to count on Team Trump to accurately speak about incredibly tense situations. Doing so would calm Americans, rather than fomenting more division and anger.\n\nSpeaking of Walz, he wrote an op-ed in which the first paragraph condemns “the Trump administration’s assault on Minnesota” and “campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state.” He assails the enforcement of immigration law as targeting people who “have done nothing wrong except exist as a person of color.” That’s inflammatory hogwash that inspires the people harassing federal agents in the streets.\n\nOn the same day Walz’s incendiary op-ed was published, the president and the governor had what Trump called “a good conversation.” I’m skeptical that a guy who thinks the Trump administration is the reincarnated Nazi regime is interested in cooperating at all, even to meet Trump’s series of very reasonable conditions.\n\nLet’s conclude with a strategic view: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris opened the border, allowing 10-15 million illegals to flood across. Minnesota and several other states and cities, all run by Democrats, are sanctuary jurisdictions, and ICE has to operate in these places because more illegal aliens reside there. Anti-ICE agitators organize, provoke, and film in order to discredit law enforcement. Precious few people appear capable of speaking honestly about the situation or what they (think they) see on video. Everyone is angry and spoiling for a fight.\n\nIt turns out that the more access to “information” people have, the more difficult it becomes to restore the Rule of Law.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/124569-noem-on-thin-ice-homan-dispatched-for-cleanup-2026-01-27","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KG02KJ3SRD3J5RDXT6TT0EQ0.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 16:04:37","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":396640652,"title":"Can Josh Shapiro Turn His Jewishness Into an Asset?","text":"Sometimes the country wants a man of faith. This happened when Jimmy Carter, a former Sunday-school teacher, was elected following Watergate, and when the born-again George W. Bush’s slim victory looked like a repudiation of Bill Clinton’s sex-scandal-marred presidency. To speak in the register of faith—not a particular sect or even God, but a grounding belief in a higher order—is to reach beyond partisanship, to try to return to basic moral precepts. In calmer times, a leader expounding from such heights risks sounding preachy and self-righteous. But when the country is exhausted, this might be just what people want.\n\nRight now, the country is exhausted. And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a top contender for president in 2028, has a new memoir in which the word faith appears nearly 100 times.\n\nIn Where We Keep the Light, Shapiro is doing what presumptive candidates for the highest office usually do when they write such a book: He is laminating his narrative. Here is the regular guy who loves shooting hoops, who is hopeless with a hammer, who loves a self-deprecating story about walking into a glass wall or almost falling off a ladder, and whose wife, Lori, is always, always right. He is, in short, pretty boring by almost any measure, and his book can lapse into the gobbledygook of clichés that fill such memoirs—Shapiro is able, for example, “to make a choice and then execute it” when “all eyes were watching.” What stands out, however, is the centrality of his religion—or rather, his faith—which is Judaism.\n\nAt the moment, Shapiro would seem to have every reason to downplay his Jewishness. When he was one of two top contenders to be Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, this part of his identity was frequently touted as a liability. “He’s Jewish,” CNN’s John King pointed out, so “there could be some risk in putting him on the ticket.” Others put it less nicely. Certain camps on the far left of the Democratic Party branded him as “Genocide Josh” for his support of Israel after October 7—though his views were not much different from those of most of the Democratic establishment. Add to this the rise of an ambient anti-Semitism on both the right and left, along with the unavoidable reality that Jews are a minuscule minority in this country; any candidate who keeps kosher must overcome a certain strangeness factor if he wants to pass that all-important test of being someone to have a beer with.\n\nBut rather than downplay his Jewishness in his memoir, Shapiro puts it at the center of the political identity he is prepping for the national stage. He does this, however, in a quirky—and perhaps savvy—way: Shapiro uses the flexibility of Jewish identity to speak about faith without really delving into the particularity of Judaism.\n\nHe can do this because Jewishness is not one thing. It can be a cultural identity—like the Seinfeld-and-bagels version. It can be an ethnic or even a national identity (otherwise known as Zionism). And it can be a religious identity, a set of rituals and practices either strictly adhered to or modified over time. For any individual Jew, the mix will vary wildly. The crux of Shapiro’s Jewishness, by his account, is the religion, but he writes that it is “less about the story and the text than about the lesson and the deed.” He does abide by many of those rituals and practices—such as keeping kosher and not missing Shabbat dinner with his family—but these aren’t the elements he emphasizes. The book is heavily weighted instead toward the thing he calls “faith,” with himself as its “steward.” To my ear at least, this sounds more like the way an evangelical Christian might speak of their religion, but for Shapiro, this word becomes a bridge between who he is and the people he is trying to reach.\n\nFaith here means a kind of centeredness, an inner voice, a prayerfulness. He admits that this all might “sound a little vague”—it does—and he struggles to define exactly what faith means to him beyond the fact that it is the most important aspect of his identity and that it allows him to judge right from wrong, to separate the trivial from what actually matters. Defining his beliefs is “kind of like when you get asked to explain how you fall asleep or blink,” he writes. “You just know to do it.” But faith, for all its squishiness, is the force he deploys, again and again, as a way to connect with other Americans. It is, in other words, not just a central part of himself, but also what turns his Judaism from a potential liability into a potential asset.\n\nAfter the governor’s mansion was firebombed last year, hours after the Shapiro family had held their Passover Seder, an elderly fire-department chaplain named John Wardle handed Shapiro a handwritten prayer. Shapiro choked up immediately: These words of blessing and protection (from Numbers 6:24–26) were the same that he utters in Hebrew over his children every night. “Despite our differences, at our cores, our values are the same,” he concludes. “Our humanity is shared.” When he calls the family of the man who was killed in the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, he worries at first that fierce Trump supporters, even in grief, won’t want to speak with him. But then: “I told them about my faith and how much strength it has brought to me in my life,” Shapiro writes, “and that while we didn’t share the same faith, I knew theirs would bring them calm.”\n\nEpisodes like these coalesce into the central motif of his memoir: faith as an eraser of difference. Whom does he count as his closest adviser on keeping this faith? Well, Lori, of course. But after her, the person he turns to when he has a problem is a Black Baptist pastor named Marshall Mitchell. In an ecumenical text chain, they go “back and forth about a line from the Book of John or a passage from the Book of Joshua.”\n\nThe laws of Judaism are traditionally meant to create distance, to distinguish Jews from other people. This is what kashrut or Sabbath observance are about—avoiding certain food or workdays as a way of setting themselves apart. When Joe Lieberman was Al Gore’s vice-presidential candidate, he made a point of emphasizing this difference—everyone near him knew that he was strict about not doing business on Saturday and would bring his tuna sandwiches on the road to make it easier to keep kosher. This was part of the appeal of his candidacy, a return to traditionalism after the Clintonian chaos (Bush’s born-again Christianity promised the same). But Shapiro de-emphasizes the rules of Judaism. He has to because it’s the only way faith can function for him in this story. “For me it is spirituality more than religiousness,” Shapiro writes.\n\nAs he elides the rules of Judaism to focus on the “soul work,” he also makes only passing references to October 7, and he manages to completely avoid mentioning Gaza—as in, not even once. Shapiro has been outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli government (Benjamin Netanyahu, he has said, is “one of the worst leaders of all time”). He has also called out some of the pro-Palestinian protests on campuses, believing they tipped over into being anti-Semitic. Shapiro is a liberal Zionist, which means he has a nuanced position on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians at a moment when, on this topic, few people who care about the issue really want to hear nuance. But when Israel does appear in the book, he doesn’t lay any of this out. Instead, the Jewish homeland is just the place where he first connected with—yes—his faith. “In Israel, it was just everywhere,” he writes. “It was the first time I could feel faith. I could see it and touch it and it wasn’t abstract.”\n\nThere is something unique, perhaps even brave, about discussing Israel in this way, as a place perceived not just through a political lens but one that could have so much meaning to a Jewish teenager from suburban Philadelphia (he even proposed to Lori in Jerusalem). And yet the faction in the Democratic Party that called him “Genocide Josh” has not gone away, and neither has the unfair suspicion that he had to confront when he was vetted by Harris’s people and was asked, he writes in the book, whether he had ever been “an agent of the Israeli government.” These voices have only gotten louder, with large parts of the Democratic Party openly opposing the United States’ continued support of Israel. A Jewish candidate such as Shapiro might want to focus on faith, but he has to face up to the reality, fair or not, that he will be asked to explain Israel’s actions more than a Mormon or Catholic candidate would. By avoiding it completely in his campaign memoir, he only confirms just how much he does not want the subject to overtake his candidacy—and concedes, in a way, that it very well could.\n\nWhat comes across loud and clear, though, is Shapiro’s bet that Americans want someone like him, who can talk earnestly about concepts such as good and evil or what it means to have moral clarity. “Now, more than ever, we yearn for and need a world defined by faith,” he writes in the book’s closing lines. “It’s universal, this belief in others to help us through what feels unsettled, uncivil, un-American. It’s a guidepost, a path through the woods.”\n\nAt a time when citizens are on the streets in Minneapolis risking their lives in order to protect their neighbors, this sentiment feels like a resonant one. The motivation for confronting masked, armed agents with whistles and phones is not as much political as it is moral. These people are angry that something has gone awry in the way we treat one another, that we have lost a sense of the common good—an understanding of what is normal and what isn’t.
