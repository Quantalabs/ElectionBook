We are not allowed to charge more or less.’\n\nHe added: ‘I’ve done a lot these high society weddings, it’s nothing new to me.’\n\nMeanwhile bewildered tourists were today seen wandering into the church yard, renowned as one of the most beautiful in the country.\n\nOutside the church, thousands of red roses were placed into 5ft-tall balls dotted around the yard.\n\nSt Michael’s is one of the most beautiful venues in the Cotswolds and was the choice when film director Sam Mendes and classical musician Alison Balsom had their 2017 ceremony there. \n\nEve, who once was named by society bible Tatler as one of its ‘new generation of It Girls’, and sportsman Harry got engaged last September and began dating in 2022, making their debut just a year ago at the Paris Olympic Games. \n\nOn Thursday, the couple – joined by their groomsmen and bridesmaids – completed a final dress rehearsal at the church for a 90-minute run through. \n\nParents of the bride and groom – Eve’s mother Laurene and Harry’s parents Peter and Tara – arrived in the picturesque village of Great Tew by private limousine.\n\nThe glamorous bridesmaids and the groomsmen, meanwhile, were bussed to the event in private hire coaches.\n\nUpon their arrival, the party were shielded from prying eyes as they entered the church grounds surrounded by orange umbrellas hoisted by private security guards.\n\nThe wedding party is due to take place at the stunning Estelle Manor country hotel set at Eynsham Hall this evening, where rooms start at £795.\n\nThe Manor is renowned internationally as venue for huge weddings as its copious grounds can accommodated hundreds of guests – while some guests are believed to be staying at the and the celebrity-famous Soho Farmhouse nearby.\n\nSoho Farmhouse is a glamorous private members club is beloved by A-list celebrities – even hosting Meghan Markle’s hen do in 2018 – as the place to go for private events for the social elite, all with the background of Britain’s finest countryside. \n\nAnd on the guestlist are a mixture of British sports stars, American politicians and even a sprinkling of royalty. \n\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris was pictured at a pre-wedding evening in The Bull pub in Charlbury, which also reportedly included Bruce Springsteen’s equestrian daughter, Jessica. \n\nBlacked-out SUVs and men in black suits identifying themselves as US secret services swarmed the country pub as it held the event.\n\nEve’s mother Laurene, left a widow following Jobs’ passing in 2011 aged 56 from pancreatic cancer, is said to have gone ‘all out’ for the wedding with help from renowned society events planner Stanlee Gatti.\n\nA-list parties flew to Oxford airport on their private jets, where they were met by helicopters to transport them to the venue.\n\nMaking the VIP guestlist are Kamala’s daughter Phoebe and Bill Gates’s daughter Jennifer, according to The Sun newspaper.\n\nKamala’s attendance is thanks to her long-time friendship with Eve’s mother.\n\nLaurene and Kamala have been friends for over 20 years, with the billionaire philanthropist backing Kamala’s run for US presidency last year, which she eventually lost to President Donald Trump. \n\nAnd it’s not just Kamala set to make an impression from the politics scene in the US – as a source told the paper that ‘a lot of important American political figures’ will be present. \n\nBelieved to have joined them are celebs including Arctic Monkeys star Matt Helders, Apple designer Jony Ive, Sofia Abramovich, daughter of ex-Chelsea owner Roman and Bill Gates’ daughter Jennifer. \n\nSources close to the family previously said invites have gone out to figures from fashion, sport, and business, with Princess Beatrice and her husband Edo among the confirmed guests. \n\n Brooklyn Peltz-Beckham and his wife Nicola Peltz, 30, are understood to have attended the wedding, just a stones throw away from the Beckham family home in the Cotswolds.\n\nNicola and Brooklyn, who is estranged from his former footballer father David, fashion designer mother Victoria and from brothers Romeo and Cruz, is said by guests to be staying at Soho Farmhouse which neighbours the Beckham’s estate.\n\nIt’s not known how the Peltz-Beckhams know that happy couple, and a spokesman for Brooklyn did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.\n\nKourtney Kardashian is also believed to have jetted in for after sharing a number of idyllic snap from the Cotswolds on Instagram ahead of the wedding.\n\nEve, a model and show jumper in her own right, has two older siblings and one half-sibling. Reed Jobs, 33, and Erin Jobs, 29, will likely be at the wedding. However it’s currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\n\nAside from her siblings, Eve has a plethora of high-profile friends descended from other tech billionaires, who will likely see her walk down the aisle.\n\nShe is also friends with Lilli Hymowitz, daughter of billionaire Gregg Hymowitz, the CEO and founder of investment firm EnTrust Global.\n\nIn 2023, Eve was spotted mingling amongst high society’s wealthiest members at a gala in New York City, including Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, who she struck a pose with for photos, and Lili Buffett, the granddaughter of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet.\n\nOn top of Eve’s impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage.\n\nHis father is Peter Charles, whose team won Britain’s first team jumping gold medal for 60 years at the 2012 London Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile his Olympic teammates Scott Brash and Ben Maher would have been expected to make the guestlist, having claimed victory in team jumping together at the Paris Olympics. \n\nHarry has represented Great Britain internationally and is currently one of the sport’s top-ranked athletes.\n\nThe couple share a passion for horses and are frequently seen supporting each other at events.\n\nEve, a self-described ‘horse girl’, started riding when she was just six years old and had made some considerable achievements, including winning a bronze medal in the team event at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\n\nShe was front and centre to watch Harry win his gold medal last year and shared a loving post on Instagram with the caption: ‘TEAM GOLD!!!!!! Beyond proud of you my love!!!!’ \n\nEve made her modelling debut in a 2020 holiday campaign for makeup brand Glossier alongside Sydney Sweeney and Naomi Smalls. Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must’ve grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn’t doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a ‘strong-willed, funny firecracker.’\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father’s assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a ‘low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street’ in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt’s been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had ‘no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.’\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids’ technology use – even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won’t get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn’t want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n‘I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn’t care about the accumulation of wealth,’ she said.\n\n‘I’m not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that… Steve wasn’t interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.’\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame ‘Rider of the Month’ in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nApple heiress Eve Jobs has exchanged vows with Team GB showjumper Harry&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Apple Heiress Eve Jobs Marries Team GB Olympian in Charming Cotswolds Ceremony first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/apple-heiress-eve-jobs-marries-team-gb-olympian-in-charming-cotswolds-ceremony/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Apple-heiress-Eve-Jobs-weds-Team-GB-Olympic-star-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:32:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":345560980,"title":"Democratic Party Hits Lowest Approval in Over 30 Years: Poll","text":"A Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday shows the Democratic Party's image has deteriorated to its lowest point in over three decades according to the newspaper's records that date back to 1990.Only 8 percent of registered voters said they view the Democratic Party \"very favorably,\" while 63 percent said it's out of touch with the everyday concerns of Americans. In contrast, Republicans are now trusted more on key issues like the economy, immigration and crime.The poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters between July 16-20, found Republicans have taken the lead on eight of 10 issues tested. Despite President Donald Trump's continued unpopularity in the polls, the GOP leads in overall party identification. The Journal's poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.Why It MattersIn last year's presidential election, Trump beat then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, by 2 points in the popular vote, 50 to 48 percent. Trump also won the electoral vote, which decides the winner, 312-226.The Democratic Party faced a string of defeats in the 2024 election cycle when it came to the U.S. House and Senate, with the party's struggles for a clear message and effective leadership intensifying as the 2026 midterm elections approach.The new poll signals a significant warning for Democrats. Although Trump remains a polarizing figure, the data suggests that voters are increasingly viewing the party as ineffective on core issues like inflation, border security, and crime.What To KnowAccording to the Journal's poll, Democrats now face a net favorability of -30 points, with only one-third of voters expressing any positive sentiment toward the party. This marks the worst performance for Democrats in the newspaper's polling history to date.While Trump's handling of inflation and tariffs drew significant disapproval—11 and 17 points respectively—voters still trust Republicans more than Democrats to manage those issues in Congress. The GOP holds a 10-point advantage on inflation and a 7-point edge on tariffs.The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the poll are health care and vaccine policy, suggesting the party retains some credibility on public health issues.The president's net unfavorability stands at -7 points, with the GOP slightly worse at -11. However, Trump's favorability has remained relatively steady through the first six months of his second term, even as other polls show sharper declines.Despite the negative sentiment, 46 percent of voters say they would back a Democrat for Congress if an election were held today, compared to 43 percent who would support a Republican. That margin is narrower than the 8-point advantage Democrats had at the same point in Trump's first term in 2017.What People Are SayingBill McInturff, a Republican pollster not connected to the Journal's survey, said: \"We were already watching the tide moving out for the Republican Party by this point in 2017, and that's not where we are today. And that's worth jumping up and down and trying to explain: how much more competitive Trump and the Republicans are today than in 2017.\"John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Journal survey, said: \"The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party. Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they're for and what their economic message is, they're going to have problems.\"What Happens Next?Democrats face mounting pressure to redefine their economic message and rebuild trust with working-class voters. Meanwhile, Republicans are likely to double down on their perceived strengths in fiscal and foreign policy ahead of next year's midterms.","summary":"The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the new poll from the Wall Street Journal are health care and vaccine policy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-party-approval-rating-hits-30-year-low-wsj-poll-2104572","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690902/chuck-schumer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5c33b35b0790e7ee1ff3997195e2def6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 21:53:08","author":"Amanda Castro","authors":["Amanda Castro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":345559150,"title":"Rep. Ro Khanna lashes out at Democrat establishment in fiery speech to young progressives","text":"Rep. Ro Khanna sounded off on the Democratic Party establishment in his address to the Voters of Tomorrow Summit for young progressives in Washington, D.C.\n\n“How can we trust government to do big things when government has been corrupted? My friends, for those who want a progressive future, for those who want a government that works to build security and opportunity for the working class, we must get rid of the big money in politics,” Khanna said in his address on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe California Democrat then mentioned the Jeffrey Epstein files, which have become a major point of debate in Washington as some demand more information about the case.\n\n“We must restore a government for the people, by the people, of the people. The release of the Epstein files is not a magic cure for trust, but it is a first step. \n\n“It’s a first step to say we will have a new era of transparency,” he continued.\n\nKhanna then bluntly called out his party’s establishment in his closing call to action.\n\n“I’ll end with this clear point: The old guard needs to go. The old ways have not been working. This party needs a new rebirth. This party needs a rebirth to stand for human rights,” he said. “This party needs a rebirth to stand for the working class. This party needs a rebirth to stand for people over the donor class.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to give virtual remarks at the summit on Friday, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also a major speaker at the event.\n\n“We have no doubt that we will win the election with the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said during her speech. “No doubt.”\n\n“It’s important to be strong in the year in advance, because that’s when the troops line up. We have our messaging, we have our mobilization, we need the money to do it, but they go only next to a school to hold up the most important part: the candidate,” she continued.\n\nYounger Democrats, like freshman Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari and Illinois congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, took part in panels at the summit.\n\nKhanna’s address comes as the Democratic Party is striving to navigate the second Trump administration and adapt to the major shifts that occurred across voter demographics in the 2024 election, including among Generation Z. \n\nThe 2026 election is being seen as an opportunity to get more information about Gen Z voters, as many voted for the first time in 2022 and 2024.\n\nSome in the party have encouraged a more moderate direction, while others have echoed Khanna’s populist sentiment.\n\n“This party needs a rebirth to find our courage in standing up for immigrant rights instead of running away when people talk about immigration. This party needs more people like you in Congress than the current people we have in Congress,” Khanna added.\n\n“I’m here to say that a new Democratic Party, a reborn Democratic Party, a populist Democratic Party, a multiracial Democratic Party, a Democratic Party that centers the working and middle class, a Democratic Party that looks like the future is a Democratic Party that can lead us back to victory and lead us to a better America. \n\n“It’s time to take back our party and then to take back our country,” he continued.","summary":"Pelosi believes Democrats will win House while progressive wing pushes for party overhaul.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/us-news/dem-rep-ro-khanna-demands-old-guard-must-go-calls-for-rebirth-of-party/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-7ewlty0s8-1753563267293.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1753548905&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 20:59:17","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":345546484,"title":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs weds Team GB Olympic star in front of high society friends and family in idyllic Cotswolds village - but disappoints locals as blushing bride sneaks into her own nuptials through rear entrance","text":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs has tied the knot with Team GB showjumper Harry Charles in a star-studded ceremony in front of high society friend in the picturesque Cotswolds countryside.\n\nThe late Apple CEO's wife Laurence Powell Jobs, 61, is said to have splashed out £5million to make the four-day wedding of model daughter Eve, 27, and her gold medalist fiancé Harry, 26, the society wedding of the year.\n\nTheir nuptial celebrations started on Wednesday - almost exactly one month after Eve jetted to the Italian isle of Capri for a glitzy hen do - and culminated in today's extravagant ceremony. \n\nThe model and her new husband practically took over the Cotswolds, where the Beckhams, Simon Cowell and Ellen De Generes all have country homes, for the lavish wedding at St Micheal’s and All Angels Church in Great Tew.\n\nGuests celebrating their wedding wearing elegant dresses and dinner jackets, as a stream of Mercedes limousines and top class Range Rovers, and luxury minibuses dropped off the family and friends of the Apple founder heiress.\n\nBruce Springsteen daughter, Jessica, was among nine bridesmaids who were dressed in startling red satin cocktail gowns, holding posies made of ferns, with groomsmen arriving just before them wearing flowers in their button holes.\n\nThe blushing bride arrived to the church via a private road, around half an hour late, at 6pm, and around 45 minutes later, she and Harry Charles said 'I do' as wedding balls rang to signify the beginning of their marriage. \n\nHowever locals were left disappointed as they didn't see the bride enter or the newlyweds leave the church hand-in-hand, as they were quickly whizzed away in the back of a Mercedes limousine van to their evening celebrations.\n\nOne resident told HELLO!

Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must've grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn't doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a 'strong-willed, funny firecracker.'\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father's assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a 'low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street' in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt's been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had 'no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.'\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids' technology use - even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won't get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn't want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n'I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn't care about the accumulation of wealth,' she said.\n\n'I'm not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that... Steve wasn't interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.'\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame 'Rider of the Month' in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.","summary":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs has tied the knot with Team GB showjumper Harry Charles in a star-studded ceremony in front of high society friend in the picturesque Cotswolds countryside.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14942647/Apple-heiress-Eve-Jobs-Team-GB-Olympic-Cotswods-wedding.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/17/100595069-0-The_happy_couple_pictured_tied_the_knot_today_after_getting_enga-a-5_1753547355593.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/05/671253307486129849/1024x576_MP4_671253307486129849.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-26 20:57:12","author":"Editor,Nick Fagge,Robert Folker,Shannon McGuigan","authors":["Editor","Nick Fagge","Robert Folker","Shannon McGuigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.181},{"id":345540166,"title":"Comic-Con 2025: All the movie and TV announcements you need to know","text":"Comic-Con International is underway in San Diego, and fans of geeky film and TV are getting fed.\n\n The 10 best TV shows of 2025 (so far), and where to stream them\n\nBetween new trailers, exclusive clips, and first look images, there's an immense amount of nerdy news to take in.

Voters overwhelmingly believe that Republicans are better able to handle key issues in Congress than Democrats. \n\nThe survey found that the majority of voters, 63 percent, have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party. Only 33 percent hold a favorable view. This is the most unpopular that Democrats have been according to Journal polls dating back to 1990. \n\nAs President Donald Trump enacts an increasingly authoritarian agenda and provides little economic benefit to the average American, Democrats are hopeful anti-Trump backlash will give them a strong showing in the 2026 midterm election. While slightly more people expect to vote for Democrats next year than Republicans, according to the Journal poll, Democrats’ overall favorability has only dropped since Trump took office. \n\n“The Democratic brand is so bad that they don’t have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the survey, told the Journal. “Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they’re for and what their economic message is, they’re going to have problems.”\n\nAnzalone’s firm, which consulted for both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaigns, worked on the survey with Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio.\n\nAccording to the survey, voters think Republicans in Congress are more capable at handling the economy, inflation and rising prices, tariffs, immigration, “illegal” immigration, the Russia-Ukraine war, and foreign policy. On the topic of “illegal” immigration, 48 percent have their faith in Republicans and 24 percent choose Democrats.\n\nDemocrats scored higher on health care and vaccine policy. Both parties tied at 37 percent on the issue of looking out for middle class families. \n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\nThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\n\n“As much as I fully believe that Democrats are not doomed for all eternity, I also believe that many Democrats aren’t quite grappling with the serious credibility problems the party still faces,” Democratic operative Tré Easton posted on X. “The podcasts and everything are real cute, but we’ve got work to do.”\n\nDemocrats also scored low in a Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month. In that survey, approval of congressional Democrats reached a new low of 19 percent, with 72 percent of voters saying they disapproved. \n\n“This is a record low since March 2009 when the Quinnipiac University Poll first began asking this question of registered voters,” the university wrote. \n\nThe Quinnippiac poll found that even registered Democrats disapproved of the party: Thirty-nine percent approved of how Democrats in Congress were handling their jobs, while 52 percent disapproved. Among registered Republicans, 77 percent approved of how Republicans are operating in Congress.\n\nIn the findings from the Journal, voters are mixed on Trump. About half, or 55 percent, of voters say the country is headed in the wrong direction. This is down from 70 percent in January, meaning voters have become more optimistic since Trump took office, yet Trump is not wildly popular. He has a favorability rating of 45 percent, and an unfavorability rating of 52 percent. A total of 46 percent approve of what Trump is doing as president, and 52 percent disapprove. Fifty-three percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 44 percent approve. \n\nTrending Stories\n\nTrump White House Rages Over ‘South Park’ Episode, Calls Show ‘Fourth-Rate’\n\nAstronomer Enlists Gwyneth Paltrow as 'Temporary Spokesperson' Amid Coldplay Viral Scandal\n\nI Worked With Stephen Colbert.

They want you to give up. They are joyful every time you post that democracy is over because they know you are obeying in advance and giving up.\n\nFor the love of all things beautiful, do not give up.\n\nYes this is awful. Yes there are many reasons for worry.\n\nBUT there are also reasons to be hopeful for the future.\n\nWhen I think back to the first six months of this, these are the 10 things that gave me hope and kept me going and that CONTINUE to do so!!\n\n1. Democrats Doing Great things\n\nHere is something from just this week:\n\nOur colleagues Abha Bhattarai and Andrew Ackerman reported this month that inflation began to tick up in June, “a sign that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to push up costs of appliances, furniture, clothing and other everyday goods across the economy.”\n\nIt’s a trend that Democrats are keenly aware of and prepared to use as one of their chief attacks against Republicans in next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“On tariffs, it’s prices,” Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told us on Monday. “It’s the prices of everyday goods that people are buying.”\n\nThere is a nuance to Democratic messaging here. Yes, Democratic candidates will talk about tariffs, especially in states that are trade-dependent and whose business communities — be it manufacturing, agriculture or technology — rely on trade to operate. But the bulk of Democratic messaging on the issue will probably focus less directly on two aspects of the debate: How tariffs raise costs on goods families purchase every day and how the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff plan has affected businesses.\n\nand (also recently) Rep. Ro Khanna, who has been at the forefront of bringing a discharge petition to the floor of the House. \n\nAnd this new news:\n\nA group of more than 20 attorneys general are suing the Trump regime to “stop its unlawful attempt to gut … programs for low-income families,” a statement read. NY AG Letitia James declared: “This is a baseless attack on some of our country’s most effective and inclusive public programs, and we will not let it stand.”\n\nDemocrats: They’re Fighting For Us\n\nCheck out these recent New York Times headlines about the state of the Democratic Party:\n\nOkay, I made that last one up. But it’s only a matter of time before the Times prints it.\n\nHere’s a headline I’d propose:\n\nDemocrats Across the US are Fighting Back\n\nThat one might not be clickbait, but it has the benefit of being true.\n\nThe corporate media’s “coverage” of the Democrats has chosen to overlook the party’s most spectacular asset: a roster packed with gifted politicians. In fact, I’d argue that the Democrats have more talent than they’ve had in a generation.\n\nAnd they’re fighting for us.\n\nSome reader nominations:\n\nJB Pritzker from Illinois. He is the best Governor we've had in a very long time\n\nMy vote for the Democrat to lead the resistance is either AOC or Jasmine Crockett. Both of whom are easily able to overwhelm either Trump or Musk.\n\nJamie Raskin, who said, \"Given that I was marching at age three, you know I’m not letting any coup-plotting, election-denying, insurrection-supplying autocrat, kleptocrat, plutocrat or theocrat, or any techno-feudalist Silicon Valley broligarch aspiring dictator, turn me around now. I am going to honor and participate every day in this urgent national fight for strong constitutional democracy, personal freedom and social progress.\"\n\nSenator: Raphael Warnock. House: Sarah McBride (Del); Becca Balint (Vt). If you haven’t heard of them, find them. Brilliant minds and kick-ass attitude. Governor: Gretchen Whitmer. \n\nCT Sen. Chris Murphy –\n\nDavid Hogg. He lived through the hell of a Florida high school massacre as a student, and hasn't stopped since then.\n\nYou can find a deep dive into Democrats being awesome here.\n\n2. Trump is Deeply Unpopular\n\nWatching Trump’s popularity plummet has given me hope.\n\nAs Trump was inaugurated in January 2025, his net approval stood at +9\n\nA new poll on Tuesday from the influential data guy G. Elliott Morris confirms just how much the country has rejected Trump and his early agenda:\n\n Trump’s approval is a terrible 42%-57% (-15). In line with all the public, independent polls we saw last week. Remarkable harmony in current data.\n\nThis MATTERS. It matters to him (and makes him change behavior). It matters to other Rs who are slowly seeing that carrying his water is not going to benefit them. AND it matters for 2026...\n\n3. Predictors of 2026 look good\n\nThis is going to be a hard election year and we are all going to have to chip in (in any way we can) in order to win, but we CAN win. There have been a number of signs in 2026 which are good for us.\n\nFirst, the elephant in the room: will there be elections?\n\nYes. I don’t have a crystal ball but I do have the ability to see what is happening and I see Trump acting VERY MUCH like there will be elections. All reports indicate that he is obsessing about it and spending much of his time trying to talk Rs into not retiring from congress and trying to voter suppress and gerrymander wherever he can.\n\nand this from Robert Hubbell:\n\nI continue to receive daily emails from readers about the 2026 elections being canceled by Trump. If that happens (it won’t), there will be no House of Representatives (the terms of all representatives expire on January 3, 2027) and Democrats would assume control of the Senate with 34 Democrats and 31 Republicans. (The terms of 22 Republicans and 13 Democratic terms expiring on January 3, 2027.)\n\nAnd how will those elections turn out? We can’t know for sure but we do know that we CAN win. Even with their shenanigans!\n\nWe are doing amazing in special elections.\n\nThis got me thinking… Are the districts moving to Democrats in 2025 places that have already been trending toward them? That would be useful to know, since if so, that would make the swing to the left since 2024 somewhat less notable.\n\nTurns out: no!\n\nBeyond what the historical record suggests, there is an additional warning sign for Trump allies who want to continue single-party GOP rule in Washington: Democrats have made big gains in special elections since Trump took office in January 2025. A Washington Post analysis of these races suggests Democrats might be on track for a very good 2026.\n\nAmong all special elections this year, Democrats have outperformed Kamala Harris’s vote share in 2024 by 13 percentage points, based on Harris-Trump baselines calculated by the Downballot, an election data newsletter. That’s the largest shift toward any party in years. In fact, all but four of the 31 special elections have seen movement toward Democrats.\n\n4. Words of Inspiration from wise people\n\nA lot of really awesome people have kept me going. Here are some of the words that moved me:\n\nI know it feels overwhelming right now, like the corruption and cruelty go so deep there’s no other side to them, but history shows us that even the most crooked and depraved governments can be brought down eventually, if the populace bands together and peacefully resists. The trick is to not give up, even though such governments try to make us do exactly that.\n\nChop wood. Carry water. One day at a time we’ll keep doing this work. In time we will prevail. I promise.\n\nI am optimistic about the long term. We will survive and recover from this challenging period. Although progress will be painful and hard fought, our nation will emerge as a more resilient, smarter, and more just democracy. Adversity makes us stronger. Although America is imperfect and deeply flawed, it is a great nation because its character has been chiseled by the repeated journey from defeat to victory, sorrow to joy, and enmity to charity.\n\nThe foundation for our eventual success is being laid every day, brick by brick, with every protest, letter, postcard, call, text, and meeting in living rooms across the nation. The scale and distributed nature of our efforts to reclaim democracy ensures that the new foundation will be stronger than the buckling footings under siege by the president.\n\nWe should take heart from the steadfast support of the judiciary during our nation’s hour of need. While expected and appropriate, the judiciary’s robust response was not guaranteed. Many (including me) have been surprised by the breadth and vigor of the judicial response.\n\nRobert Hubbell\n\nThe good news is that there are tens of millions of us. No single person must carry the weight of the nation’s future on their shoulders alone. That is a collective burden shared by millions across many years. True, we must persevere even when we are sick of the “news.” In reality, our resistance is the “news.” Future historians will look back on this period and accurately report the most significant story of 2025 was that “millions of Americans rose up to save democracy.” That is the news from today. The rest is detail.\n\n5. Historical perspectives help calm me down\n\nIt is easy to get lost in the awful of this moment and not realize that we have always struggled for good to win over bad and America has faced lots of tough moments before.\n\nRealizing that this is a normal part of the human condition can help it from feeling overwhelming and it can remind us of all the times that good has won in the past.\n\nIt can remind us of our place in history.\n\nIt can keep us from catastrophizing.\n\nfrom Robert Hubbell\n\nHistory teaches us that those who fight to preserve their country will outlast those who capitulate in a futile attempt to preserve their wealth, power, and privilege. During World War II, the members of the Vichy regime sought to protect France (and themselves) by surrendering to and collaborating with Nazi Germany. Other French citizens resisted Hitler by organizing an underground armed resistance (the French Resistance), a government in exile (Free France), and an army in exile (the Free French Army).¹\n\nHistory remembers the Vichy collaborators and capitulators as traitors to France. Members of Free France, the French Resistance, and the Free French Army are rightfully remembered as the saviors of France. They resisted in exile for four long years.\n\nInitially, the forces in exile lacked support from most French citizens and the country’s territories. Those in exile watched in horror as France’s political, social, and military elite collaborated with the Nazi regime, including the deportation of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps. Under the Vichy regime, collaborators continued to live lives of privilege, power, and affluence while those in exile lived in tent encampments for four years.\n\nSupport for the French resistance grew over time as the resistance and the Allies made advances against German forces. Eventually, the French resistance prevailed because they were fighting for France while the Vichy regime fought to preserve their power, wealth, and privilege.\n\nThere are parallels to our present position and that of France in World War II.\n\nThe tide is shifting in our favor. Trump and the Republicans know and fear that truth. They are trying to inflict as much damage and extract as much profit as possible during their shrinking time in power.\n\nFrom Mike Madrid\n\nI want to offer some perspective.\n\nEvery generation of Americans has been summoned to defend the promise of democracy. Some have stood in snow-covered camps with no shoes and no certainty of survival. Others have crossed oceans into fire, fighting for freedom not only for themselves but for the world. Some marched in the Deep South against the racist laws that have scarred us since our founding. And some have stood their ground at home, marching, organizing, speaking up, so that our institutions might endure and our ideals might live.\n\nNow, it is our turn.\n\nOur moment may not look like Valley Forge, Gettysburg, or Omaha Beach. We are not dodging bullets or charging trenches.\n\nBut make no mistake, we too are in a war for democracy. It is a different kind of battle, fought not with muskets and bayonets, but with ballots and truth, with civic engagement and institutional defense. The stakes, while less visible than physical combat, are no less meaningful. If we fail to engage, if we lose faith in truth or drift into apathy, the American project, the promise that people can govern themselves, will erode from within. This bloodless war may be quieter than its predecessors, but defeat for our freedoms and our Constitution would be no less final.\n\nLet us be clear-eyed: we are not asked to cross icy rivers or charge into enemy fire. We are asked to vote, to speak, to organize, to protest, to resist authoritarianism not with muskets or tanks, but with conviction and clarity. It is not glory we are called to, but responsibility.\n\nTo believe that our time is uniquely cursed is a form of arrogance. We are heirs to people who endured far worse and prevailed. But to believe that democracy will survive without our effort is a form of delusion.\n\nThis nation has survived civil war, global war, economic collapse, racial injustice, and constitutional crisis. It has done so not by accident, but because enough people, sometimes just barely enough, rose to the challenge.\n\nWe must do the same.\n\nThis is a moment of choosing. Between fact and fiction. Between hope and fear. Between democracy and something much colder.\n\nLet us be worthy of the moment. Let us honor Washington's quiet plea for courage, Lincoln's call to finish the work, and Eisenhower's faith in ordinary people to do extraordinary things.\n\nToday, fear has gripped millions of Americans, but the moment must be met with catalyzing action, not paralysis. Turn fear into righteous anger. Do not let it leave you frozen.\n\nThe cause of liberty has always depended on imperfect citizens rising to perfect occasions.\n\nNow it depends on us.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I find some comfort in the knowledge that this is a not a completely new battle and that we have won it again and again and again.\n\n6. The Epstein thing is real\n\nfrom Robert Hubbell\n\nI was initially skeptical that the Epstein scandal would be a political liability for Trump and a political advantage for Democrats. But Trump's reaction—shutting down Congress, accusing President Obama of being a traitor, and dangling a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell—suggests that it is a major political liability. Still, the primary focus should always be on the fact that the victims have never received justice. The perpetrators (including possibly Trump) have, so far, escaped accountability.\n\nthe scandal has forced the House to grind to a halt. “Republicans on the House Rules Committee continue to oppose allowing any legislation to reach the House floor for a vote this week,” the Washington Post reported. “That’s because they fear Democrats will introduce amendments related to Epstein. Democrats on the panel did so twice last week, and Republicans faced blowback from constituents and the MAGA base for voting against releasing the files.” The GOP chair of the committee said it might not meet again until September, and the House is set to scurry out of town for recess on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is in a frenzy. Republicans are no longer complacent about a coverup. The public overwhelmingly disapproves of his handling of the scandal. Social media continues to stay on the case. And now the spectacle of Maxwell’s testimony provides the opportunity for wall-to-wall coverage.\n\nWhy is this one sticking? Because it crosses party lines\n\nHouse members on both sides of the aisle are irate with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who refused to move forward with a vote to compel release of the documents. Rep. Tom Massie (R-Ky.) earned the ire of the Speaker (and Trump) after he scolded Johnson: “Who’s he gonna pick? Is he going to stand with the pedophiles and underage sex traffickers? Or is he gonna pick the American people and justice for the victims? … It’s irrespective of what the president wants.”\n\n7 The world isn’t following trump’s lead\n\nBy keeping our voices loud about how this isn’t good, we are teaching the rest of the world. The better other countries keep things, the easier it will be to right our own ship.\n\nbased on the probably-at-least-partly Trump-inspired drubbing inflicted on right-wing parties in Canada and Australia in recent elections, it’s not clear that being known as the “Trump of” your country really gets you all that much. Whatever his ultimate legacy for the United States and the world, he doesn’t seem likely to be remembered as the man who made global far-right populism great again.\n\nThat was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I watched the last few hours live. It was riveting. What a leader! \n\nSen. Cory Booker stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate for 25 hours and 5 minutes, speaking about the threat Donald Trump poses to our democracy. To avoid needing to use the restroom, Booker went without food and water for days in advance. To give his voice an occasional rest, other Democratic senators engaged in colloquies with him.\n\nThrough it all — from evening to the middle of the night, to the next day and evening again — Booker stood and delivered his message with force, grace and eloquence. When he was done, he limped off the floor having made history.\n\nOver the course of his speech, many observers grew excited that a Democratic politician was taking action to disrupt the Senate. Others noted the symbolism of a Black senator breaking Strom Thurmond’s record for the longest speech in Senate history.\n\nWhile these aspects may offer satisfaction, they miss the deeper significance of what Booker accomplished. His actions were not merely symbolic or performative; they were substantive.\n\nBooker did not read the phone book, as other senators have done. He did not simply read state laws into the Congressional Record, as Thurmond did to pass the time. He did not read children’s books, like Ted Cruz.\n\nInstead, Booker used his time to argue that what we are witnessing in our country is not only abnormal, but fundamentally wrong. He connected his argument to the U.S. Constitution, the Bible and our shared sense of right and wrong. He explained how the moment we live in fits into the broader context of history while also being unique. Seamlessly, he wove references to literature, religion, law and politics.\n\nBooker was not killing time merely to inconvenience others; he was using the time to persuade an audience. That is why his speech became so captivating and why millions tuned in to watch. He was not wasting our time or his. He was using it efficiently and effectively to sound an alarm that too few have heard.\n\n9. YOU are amazing\n\nLots of whining about how no one is fighting this time around. UNTRUE\n\nprotests against ICE raids have been intensifying around the country for months, alongside protests opposing perceived power-grabs by the Trump administration. And we know that the movement’s tactics have been extraordinarily peaceful.\n\nIn fact, as we discussed in March, protests in the U.S. have been quite robust since Trump took office the second time. Our ongoing research on protests in the United States reveals that within the first two weeks of the second Trump administration, protest activity surpassed that of 2017. By the end of March 2025, there had been three times as many protests as had taken place in 2017. Protest has been surging since, with large boosts coming from major, multi-location actions in April and May. \n\nTwo notable surges of protest came on the nationwide Hands Offs protests on April 5 and No Kings protests on April 19. To date, we have tallied 1,145 protests on April 5, with events occurring in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Significantly, protest activity occurred throughout the country, including in rural and GOP-leaning towns.\n\nFor April 19, we tallied 928 protests also occurring in all 50 states and D.C. And on May 1 and May 3, we tallied over 1,000 anti-Trump May Day protests.\n\nThese are significant showings. If we look back to the first Trump administration, in April 2017 the most prominent multi-location protest was the March for Science on April 22, which occurred in 390 locations including most major cities. In 2017, we tallied 80 May Day protests nationwide, compared to over 1,000 this year. Overall, 2017’s numbers pale in comparison to the scale and scope of mobilization in 2025 — a fact often unnoticed in the public discourse about the response to Trump’s actions.\n\nIt turns out that when you attack Americans and American institutions from inside, Americans fight back.\n\nThe real problem, for the Trump regime in the making, is that Americans are turning out in large numbers to defend the vulnerable by exercising their right to free assembly and protest.\n\nAuthoritarianism depends on breaking the horizontal bonds of solidarity and empathy that lead people to risk their safety to protest injustices against others. The massive and exaggerated deployment of state security personnel and the display of arms and uniforms is designed to frighten people into hiding. There is nothing stronger than solidarity shown publicly, which is why the state responds with outsized threat and violent acts.\n\nWeak authoritarians fear empathy, a sense of justice and morality, love for others, and collective action. All they have is force and lies. They may feel immensely empowered right now, but those protesting them are on the right side of history. A reckoning will come for the aggressors as more Americans open their eyes to the criminal nature of this administration.\n\nAfter a Seattle immigration judge dismissed the deportation case against a Colombian man — exposing him to expedited removal — three people sat with him in the back of the courtroom, taking his car keys for safe-keeping, helping him memorize phone numbers and gathering the names of family members who needed to be notified.\n\nWhen Judge Brett Parchert asked why they were doing that in court, the volunteers said Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers were outside the door, waiting to take the man into custody, so this was their only chance to help him get his things in order. \"ICE is in the waiting room?\" the judge asked.\n\nAs the mass deportation campaign of President Donald Trump focuses on cities and states led by Democrats and unleashes fear among asylum-seekers and immigrants, their legal defenders sued this week, seeking class-action protections against the arrests outside immigration court hearings. Meanwhile, these volunteers are taking action.\n\nA diverse group — faith leaders, college students, grandmothers, retired lawyers and professors — has been showing up at immigration courts across the nation to escort immigrants at risk of being detained for deportation by masked ICE officials. They're giving families moral and logistical support, and bearing witness as the people are taken away.\n\nThe Northwest Immigrant Rights Project was inundated by so many community members wanting to help that they made a volunteer training video, created “Know Your Rights” sheets in several languages and started a Google sheet where people sign up for shifts, said Stephanie Gai, a staff attorney with the Seattle-based legal services non-profit.\n\nI hope at least a few of those help all of you as well!!","summary":"There is no sugarcoating how very very bad the first six months of Trump 2.0 have been for America and for the world.\n\n\n\nBut keep in mind: they want you to feel hopeless.

The dismissal ended a 28-year-career at the network.\n\nMoran’s latest diatribe — which critics would say confirms the reporter’s biased mindset when he was purportedly a mainstream reporter at ABC — was sparked by Matthews lamenting the recent CBS/ Paramount settlement with Trump.\n\n“Is this going to keep going?” Matthews asked, wondering if other networks and publications would “grovel” before President Trump.\n\nMoran told Matthews:\n\nI think they’re going to, at some point, get rid of the news divisions, is my prediction. It will either be stripped from them — look, unless Trump is stopped, there’s a playbook here. You see it in all the authoritarian countries. [Viktor] Orban did it, [Vladimir] Putin did it in Russia and the Law and Justice Party in Poland — they stripped the media, the news operations away from independent corporations that will stand up, and they sell them to their cronies.\n\nMoran then cited a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigation of his former employer over debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis’s fact-checking of Trump during the 2024 presidential debate while sparring with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“Muir did nothing wrong, but because, you know, the law that governs these news operations and networks is that they have to operate in the public interest as defined by the Trump administration,” Moran said.\n\nHe continued, “At some point, they will find a reason to strip the ownership of these things from the corporations that now own them and sell them to their cronies, unless someone stops them.”\n\nMatthews chimed in with CBS’s cancelling of the “Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert” as another example, describing it not as comedy and entertainment hour but a “politically thoughtful show.”\n\nMoran also said he’s heard from “book agents” that publishers don’t want to do books critical of President Trump because the major corporations that own them fear reprisals.\n\n“The shadow is lengthening over our civil society,” Moran said. “We’ve seen it in other countries. It’s now happening to us.”\n\nMoran did take a moment to also be critical of the Democratic Party.\n\n“I think the Democrats have a special problem because they don’t know what they believe in anymore or what they should say to the American people,” he said. “How do they fix that?”\n\nMoran also criticized the Biden administration’s border policy that allowed millions of illegal aliens into the country with “watered down” asylum rules.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

But her career might change as time goes on. “As my life unfolds a bit, I’m going to find my avenue to impact the most people in the best way possible,” she told VF. “I want to take my time and get it right and find something I love, just as I see my mom finding ways in which to reach people.”\nShe’s referring, of course, to her mother Laurene, who Kamala Harris described as a member of her “extended family” in 2017. According to the New York Times, Powell Jobs is one of the former vice president’s “most essential confidantes,” donating millions to her failed presidential campaign. So, unlike the seeming grab bag of guests at the Bezos and Sánchez nuptials, there’s a certain logic to Harris’s attendance Saturday, which the UK Times reports has been presaged by “steel fences, Secret Service SUVs and strict security protocols.”\nBut Eve Jobs isn’t the only side of the couple with a family legacy in the public eye. Her imminent spouse, 26-year-old Harry Charles, was a member of the gold medal-winning British show-jumping team at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics; he also competed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in both team and individual events. His father, Peter Charles, is also an Olympian, representing both England and Ireland over the years. His mother, Tara Charles, is also a well-known horsewoman.\nThe couple, who hard-launched their relationship with an effusive Instagram post last August, are spending a rumored $6.72 million (£5M) on this weekend’s event in the Cotswolds, a scenic area of southwest England. Other rumored attendees include a laundry list of famous scions, Page Six reports, including Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson’s daughter Princess Beatrice, equestrian Jessica Springsteen (the daughter of Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa), and Jennifer Gates Nassar, the eldest daughter of billionaire Bill Gates and ex-wife Melinda French Gates.\nElton John, who was long-rumored as a performer at the Bezos/Sánchez shindig, has also been touted as a likely performer at the event. John ended up not performing at the Amazon founder’s event (reasons for his absence vary), and representatives for John have neither confirmed nor denied his plans for the weekend.","summary":"The daughter of Steve and Laurene Powell Jobs is tying the knot Saturday in the British countryside.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/eve-jobs-harry-charles-wedding-kamala-harris","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6884efc8f09b3db40f3caf5e/16:9/w_6000,h_3375,c_limit/2153889286","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 16:49:28","author":"Vanity Fair","authors":["Vanity Fair"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.685},{"id":345523402,"title":"David Letterman calls out CBS' 'pure cowardice' for canceling 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'","text":"\"The Late Show\" creator David Letterman slammed CBS' decision to cancel the long-running late-night show, now hosted by Stephen Colbert, as \"pure cowardice\" and asserted that the network mistreated his successor by canceling the show.

He referred to the founder of Skydance, David Ellison, as \"the Oracle twins\" during his blistering takedown of the company. \"The Ellison twins, the Oracle boys, they don’t want any trouble along the lines of freedom of the press or free speech or freedom of expression,\" he claimed. \"They don’t want to get their hands dirty.

Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to cough up $16 million to Trump after the president sued the network for allegedly unfairly editing an interview with Kamala Harris, an accusation that many legal experts have called “baseless.”\n\nAs my colleague, Inae Oh, has reported, Colbert’s cancellation marks a dark new chapter for our culture as a whole. Oh writes:\n\nThough his second term has already produced a string of stunning capitulations by some of the most powerful forces in the country, one could argue that Trump’s attacks had yet to take down our actual culture. I’m talking about the literal content we consume—the television, art, movies, literature, music—no matter how much Trump complained. That it remained protected and free-willed, a rare area of control for a public that otherwise feels powerless to take action. Clearly, that was magical thinking. If this can happen to Colbert and a storied franchise, this can happen to anyone.\n\nAnd when it comes to using his presidential power as a cudgel against the media that critiques him, Trump clearly shows no signs of stopping. This week alone, the president threw a tantrum over two TV shows that joked about him. On Wednesday, the White House issued a statement threatening the ladies of The View after host Joy Behar joked that Trump was jealous of former president Barack Obama’s “swag.”\n\nA White House spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly, “Joy Behar is an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome” who “should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.” \n\nBehar’s joke was tame compared to the animated show, South Park‘s treatment of Trump, who was depicted naked in bed with Satan. In response, the White House claimed that the show hasn’t been relevant in “20 years” and said “no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\n\nHow long will South Park, whose creators just signed a 50-episode deal with Paramount, last under Trump’s regime? Let’s hope the ombudsman finds the Trump jokes funny.","summary":"On Thursday, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount, a deal that would allocate more than a billion dollars towards the latter company&#8217;s staggering debt.

The Atlantic reported ahead of the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., that at least two Democrats, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, plan to stop paying their dues when asked to renew their membership this month over the NGA's response to President Donald Trump's second term. \"We shouldn't be playing politics like they do in Washington, D.C.,\" Stitt told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at the summer meeting. \"But sometimes, if you're a governor running for president or a higher office, you make it political.\" Kelly is chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA), the partisan gubernatorial arm that has been vocal in resisting the Trump administration. As Walz weighs a third gubernatorial run, the former vice presidential candidate has remained a leading critic of Trump's administration since losing the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

The Oklahoma governor said it can be \"frustrating\" when Democrats are constantly targeting Trump, but as a business leader, he said there are plenty of instances in which governors can find common ground, including a reduction of the United States' more than $36 trillion in debt. Ahead of the summer meeting, Eric Wohlschlegel, NGA communications director, emphasized the bipartisan nature of the NGA and told Fox News Digital the NGA’s \"mission hasn’t changed.\" According to The Atlantic report, Democratic members of the NGA complained the group \"did not respond forcefully enough\" when the Trump administration paused federal funding early this year, as Gov. Janet Mills of Maine clashed with Trump over biological men playing in women's sports and, more recently, when Trump authorized the National Guard to California to amid the anti-ICE protests. \"Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus. So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don’t agree, we simply don’t issue one. That’s how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won’t compromise,\" Wohlschlegel explained. Thirteen Republican and seven Democratic leaders planned to attend the summer meeting, featuring discussions with Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A source familiar with the situation blamed the controversy on \"Democratic infighting, unspoken campaign jockeying and a few anonymous voices looking to reshape a nonpartisan institution into a political one.\" The source added that \"no governors are on the record expressing discontent with the NGA. No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised.\" And without addressing the controversy directly, Conor Cahill, a spokesperson for Polis, told Fox News Digital the governor \"has been honored\" to lead the NGA and to \"work across the aisle with governors on education, permitting reform, standing up to federal efforts to strip away gubernatorial authority around the National Guard and elevating the priorities of states.\" He added that \"during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Stitt, told Fox News Digital ahead of the NGA that \"people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Walz and Kelly for comment but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"National Governors Association (NGA) faces tension as Democratic governors reportedly plan to stop paying their dues, as incoming chair Gov.

A List stars have already jetted to the Cotswolds where the lavish event is due to take place. With the groom reportedly worth as much as $2.5 million (£1.8 million) and the bride worth a reported $2 million (£1.5 million) the pair can afford to host a lavish party. However, the fact that Eve's mum is reportedly worth over $14 billion (£10.4 billion), it may be less of a surprise that the nuptials are set to cost several million. The couple have been an item for almost three years and have been engaged for less than a year. However, their romance has been clear for all to see as they have shared cute snaps of themselves on social media where they have openly declared their love - and they will become husband and wife on Saturday 26 July 2025. As the pair prepare to swap vows and begin their happy future together, photos have emerged of their wedding venue and church in the UK. Ariel shots of the St Michael & All Angels Church in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, show huge flower displays at the entrance of the almost 1,000 year old place of worship. The church was originally built in 1170 - and restored in 1827 by Thomas Rickman and stands proudly among the trees and green grass of the English countryside. Further snaps have shown huge tents and structures placed - with a red carpet stretching through the countryside. Eve is the youngest child of the late Apple business founder Steve Jobs and his businesswoman wife Laurene Powell. She has an older brother named Reed, 33, sister Erin, 29, and a 47-year-old half-sister named Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Eve's father died in October 2011 at the age of 56 after a battle against cancer. He had an estimated wealth of $7 billion (£5.2 billion) at the time of his death. Eve is a fashion model by profession and a keen equestrian. Her love for horses led to her meeting British Olympic show jumping competitor Harry Charles, 26 - who competed in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games where he won gold in team jumping. He achieved the impressive feat with his arm strapped up having broken it four weeks before the games. The pair reportedly began dating in September 2022 - and Harry popped the question soon after winning gold at the 2024 Olympics. The happy couple have reportedly spared no expense for the event - splashing a reported $6.7 million (£5 million) on their big day. The pair have reportedly taken over the charming town of Witney and will host their wedding at Estelle Manor. Pre wedding celebrations reportedly took place in the nearby Soho Famhouse - with VIPs among those attending the celebrations. Celebs and high powered politicians are among those said to be jetting to the British countryside to watch the model and show jumping hunk say \"I do\". Failed American Presidential candidate Kamala Harris and music legend Bruce Springsteen are just two of the big names tipped to attend the ceremony. Estelle Manor is described as \"Oxfordshire's most exclusive hotel\" - helping the couple build a luxurious feel to their celebrations. The hotel has impressive amenities including a 25m pool, two paddle courts, and over 60 acres of land. The Grade II listed building boasts 108 bedrooms, 4 restaurants, and a spa - and it's real name is Eynsham Hall. Built in 1908, the country home initially hosted hunting parties - but was used as a maternity hospital rest and relaxation centre during World War II before becoming a police training centre and then, ultimately, being converted into a hotel. Ahead of their wedding, Eve enjoyed a sun-soaked hen do - heading to a luxury hotel on a sun soaked beach with close family and friends. She shared highlights from her fun-feulled trip last month, showing her cavorting around in a little white dress with a wedding veil and splashing in the sea with a lilo with the word \"Bride\" written on it. While it is unclear if Eve's proud mum, Laurene, is footing the wedding bill, she has previously suggested her children won't inherit much of her $14 billion fortune. She previously told the New York Times: \"I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn't care about the accumulation of wealth. \"I'm not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that... Steve wasn't interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.\" Steve and Laurene were married in 1991 and stayed together until his death in 2011. He died following a long fight against pancreatic cancer - which resulted in respiratory arrest. Steve was previously in a relationship with American memoirist and painter Chrisann Brennan, 70, with whom the Apple founder shared his first daughter, Lisa. Like this story?

He was replaced by Colbert, who has remained at the helm until recently, when the network announced last week that its popular late-night talk show would be ending in 2026. The network cited costs for ending the show. \n\n“10 years ago, I quit and left, and then Stephen Colbert comes along and pretty quickly established himself as a precise, crisp, witty political satirist. And often, his target has been the current administration,” Letterman told former Late Show producers Barbara Gaines and Mary Barclay in a recent YouTube video posted to his channel. \n\n“And based on that and just the overall entertainment quota of the show, it drew a great audience, and people ... always [looked] forward to political satire from Stephen Colbert. [He] was very good at it for 10 years, and I think became the face of the network.” \n\nLetterman addressed how CBS and its parent company, Paramount, were up for sale. A merger with Skydance was announced last week. Letterman surmised that Colbert's firing was so the $8 billion merger would be approved by the Trump administration. Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of billionaire and Trump ally Larry Ellison.\n\nLetterman stated that Colbert, a noted Trump critic, was cut to appease the president. Trump also recently reached a $16 million settlement with Paramount over allegations that its news program, 60 Minutes, deceptively edited an interview with his 2024 presidential rival, Kamala Harris.\n\n“So the CBS people say, ‘Hey boys, here’s what I’m gonna do. Not only are we gonna get rid of that guy [Colbert], we’re gonna get rid of the entire franchise so you don’t have to worry about another guy,’” he quipped. \n\nWhile CBS has maintained that Colbert’s firing was a “financial decision” and “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,” Letterman was skeptical.\n\n“If they were losing this kind of money, you’re telling me losing this kind of money happened yesterday? I bet they were losing this kind of money a month ago, or six weeks ago — or they have never been losing money,” he suggested. \n\n“They did not do the correct thing; they did not handle Stephen Colbert, the face of that network, in the way he deserves to have been handled,” he continued. \n\n“The fact that they killed the franchise and told Stephen to go,” he said. “Now, for Stephen, I love this. He is a martyr. Good for him.”\n\nLetterman went on to celebrate Colbert’s legacy, saying: “If you listen carefully, you can hear them unfolding chairs at the [TV] Hall of Fame for his induction.\n\n“And they’ve given [Colbert] another 10 months. Well, that’s another huge chunk of money they’re gonna lose, according to them,” he added. “I don’t think it was money. I think it was all to make sure [David Ellison was] solid spending dad’s money.”\n\nCalling the situation “sad,” he noted, adding that it indicated the downfall of the freedom of the press. \n\n“This is pure cowardice,” he said. “I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS who have manipulated and ‘handled’ this are gonna be embarrassed because this is gutless.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted CBS and Paramount for comment.","summary":"Colbert’s ‘Late Show’ predecessor surmised cancellation was both a financial and political move","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/david-letterman-stephen-colbert-cbs-b2796528.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/26/13/19/David-Letterman-and-Stephen-Colbert.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/S2C4X4R2-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-26 15:23:27","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":345488768,"title":"Psychologists predicted Trump’s 2024 win before a single vote was cast — here’s how they did it","text":"Psychologists pulled off what political pundits and polls failed to do: predict the 2024 presidential election winner. \n\nBefore a single ballot was cast in 2024, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania say they already predicted Donald Trump as the winner by tracking how optimistically each candidate explained bad news.\n\nWhile Trump’s tone grew increasingly upbeat in the final weeks of the campaign, Kamala Harris’s stayed flat. That shift correctly forecast not just that Trump would win, but by how much, according to a new study from Penn’s Positive Psychology Center. \n\n“Starting around October 10 or so, Trump started to get significantly more optimistic,” Martin Seligman, the study’s co-author and a professor of psychology at Penn, told The Post. “By the 27th, it was a very large difference between Harris and Trump.” \n\nThe team analyzed 1,389 explanations of negative events — such as war, crime, or economic hardship — from both candidates. Their dataset drew from speeches, interviews, and their only presidential debate, all delivered between early September and October 27. \n\nEach explanation was scored using the CAVE method, or Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations, a positive psychology technique that analyzes how people explain events in speech or writing. Researchers used it to measure optimism by assessing whether causes were described as temporary, specific, and fixable.\n\nThe narrower and solvable the cause, the more “optimistic” the candidate’s message.\n\nTrump referenced more than 1,000 negative issues or events — over four times the number cited by Harris — often blaming outside forces while insisting the problems were fixable, usually by himself, the study found.\n\nHarris, by contrast, described deep, lasting threats with little sense of resolution, Seligman said. \n\nTo see whether any other speech patterns could have predicted the results, the researchers also looked at emotional tone, focus on past vs. future and language about control or responsibility. None of them tracked with the outcome. Optimism stood alone.\n\nSeligman’s earlier research found that more optimism predicted the winner in 9 out of the 10 elections between 1948 and 1984.\n\nAfter that, he advised both political parties on using optimism in their campaigns. But when candidates began scripting fake optimism, he shelved the method.\n\nHe only revived it this cycle because Trump’s off-the-cuff style allowed for real-time analysis. \n\nThe researchers encrypted their prediction before Election Day and shared it with four outside verifiers, including Wall Street Journal reporters Lara Seligman — daughter of Martin Seligman — and Al Hunt, University of Washington political scientist Dan Chirot, and Hope College psychologist Dave Myers, before publishing the results after the race.\n\n“We’re the only people who predicted a Trump election, as far as I know,” Seligman said. \n\nA separate forecasting model, based on economic conditions and presidential approval ratings, was developed by Cornell University professor Peter Enns and also correctly predicted Trump’s win in all 50 states.\n\nThe findings suggest voters respond more favorably to optimistic candidates who present problems as fixable rather than systemic — and that Trump’s tendency to “go off script” gave researchers an authentic glimpse of his true mindset, Seligman said. \n\n“When optimism is genuine, I think there’s a lot of reason to believe that the American public wants optimism and wants hope,” he said. “It speaks to the general optimistic slant of American history.”","summary":"Before any ballots were cast, Penn researchers say they correctly predicted Trump’s 2024 victory by analyzing his upbeat rhetoric in the final weeks of the race.

Polo Bar, a bar and restaurant owned by fashion icon Ralph Lauren, has a \"toxic culture\" and \"rampant drug use and alcohol consumption at work,\" Frank Nobiletti, a terminated former server, claims in a federal lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that male bosses groped employees under the guise of checking their uniforms, and managers and servers often openly used cocaine on the job. One server allegedly sold cocaine at the establishment, and workers \"regularly mixed cocaine with water in a spray bottle and used that bottle to ingest cocaine\" through their skin during their shift, Nobiletti, 42, says in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that Dodson was known to hire only attractive men, even if they had no experience, in the hopes of having \"a sexual relationship with them.\" Nobiletti added that male employees who had a sexual relationship with him \"would receive preferential treatment.\" Employees also allegedly played a \"Rating Game\" in which they judged female customers on attractiveness. \"The male servers frequently made offensive and graphic sexual comments about the women customers,\" the lawsuit claims. Nobiletti claims he was fired last year after he complained to human resources about how he \"faced terrible sexual harassment.\" Supervisors informed him he was being terminated \"for drinking at work even though, since the Polo Bar opened in 2015, management and staff regularly drank alcohol and used illegal drugs during work hours with little to no consequences for such actions,\" he said in the lawsuit. \"While the restaurant and its hard-working staff do everything they can to ensure that their guests have a first-class experience, the defendants completely failed to guarantee that their employees had a safe and legal work environment,\" he said in the filing.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) was the only conservative to appear on “The Late Show” since 2022, making her Colbert’s lone right-leaning guest during that period. \n\nThe two sparred on-air in December 2023, with Cheney pushing back against Colbert’s critiques of the GOP and Donald Trump.\n\nCheney has since been a notorious critic of Trump, consistently speaking out against his influence in the Republican party and even campaigning with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. \n\nShe could not be reached for comment.\n\nColbert also hosted former Illinois Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger in January 2025, though the study did not count him in the tally due to his repeated criticism of Trump and comments aligning with Democrats — including a 2024 interview where he said there’s “nothing more conservative” than voting for Kamala Harris, Houck said.\n\nThe study’s release came a few weeks before CBS announced “The Late Show” will be canceled in May 2026. \n\nThe network cited massive financial losses and called the move “purely a financial decision.”\n\nBut the timing raised eyebrows.\n\nJust three days earlier, Colbert used his June 30 monologue to slam CBS parent company Paramount Global for settling a $16 million defamation lawsuit with Donald Trump. \n\nThe settlement helped clear the way for Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance Media — a deal approved Thursday by the Trump-led Federal Communications Commission.\n\n“It’s a ‘big fat bribe,’” Colbert whined to viewers and warned, “They left me alive. And now for the next 10 months, the gloves are off.”\n\nThe jab sparked speculation that the cancellation wasn’t just about ratings or revenue. \n\nSome CBS staffers reportedly called the decision “chilling,” while others said the numbers spoke for themselves — pointing to The Late Show’s massive $100 million-plus annual budget and costly $40 to $50 million yearly losses, all while its audience keeps shrinking.\n\n“Year after year of this show has been defined by unrepentant sneering, visceral hatred for more than half the country,” Houck said. \n\n“So between that and the precipitous decline in linear TV subscribers providing a steady revenue stream, Paramount was left with no choice.”\n\nSince 2022, NewsBusters tracked 511 liberal or Democratic guests across late-night TV, compared to just 14 conservatives and Republicans.\n\nThe study covered the shows of five major late-night hosts: Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and The Daily Show.\n\nIn the first six months of 2025, “The Daily Show” stacked 32 left-leaning guests, Meyers had 16, Kimmel 10 and Fallon five. \n\nNot a single conservative, aside from “The Daily Show’s” lone outlier: policy expert Oren Cass who spoke on Trump-era tariffs, NewsBusters found.\n\nTheir tally found 106 of 107 guests — spanning partisan officials and journalists or celebrities who discussed politics — leaned left, for a 99% liberal tilt.\n\nCass, who praised “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart for being open-minded and “genuinely interested” during his own March appearance, said Colbert seemed to be more focused on “reinforcing a dogmatic worldview and trying to preach to a choir.”\n\nColbert, who did not return a request for comment, will stay on air through next spring. \n\nOver at rival networks, Kimmel is set to film the final season of his three-year deal this fall, while Fallon and Meyers re-upped last year to stay on through 2028.\n\nPresident Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon said a serious review is needed of the companies producing late night TV shows. \n\n“The Federal Election Commission and [Department of Justice] must commence an immediate investigation into these companies for illegal campaign contributions,” he told The Post. \n\n“This is a deeply ingrained pattern of criminal behavior to assist the Democratic Party.

She ran for president as a Democrat in 2020. If the parties and election results were reversed, and a Republican congresswoman had joined the Kamala Harris administration, the liberal media elites would have found her courageous and fascinating, like a Liz Cheney-style figure. So, when Gabbard released new documents showing the Obama administration manufactured intelligence to frame incoming President Donald Trump as the illegitimate beneficiary of Russian collusion in the 2016 election, the media treated it like toxic waste. Any press event designed to please Trump was automatically dismissed as the craven act of a loyalist kissing up to the Big Boss. The nightly newscasts of ABC and NBC skipped it. CBS gave it 41 seconds. The next day, CBS and NBC reported on Gabbard suspiciously on the morning shows. NBC’s Garrett Haake denounced \"Tulsi Gabbard attempting to rewrite the history of Russia's 2016 election interference, accusing former President Obama without evidence of manipulating intelligence.\" She brought evidence, and they still scream \"without evidence.\" CNN HOSTS DISMISS NEW RUSSIAGATE EVIDENCE AS 'DISTRACTION' FROM EPSTEIN FILES: SHOULDN'T 'EVEN BE REPEATING' When Team Trump releases old documents, it’s partisan. It’s weaponized. It’s a desperate distraction. When the Democrat elites and the media conspired to release damaging allegations about Trump, it’s presented to the public as nonpartisan, as democracy in action, and anything but a distraction. It’s the main event. It’s bait for the Emmys, the Peabody Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes. For Democratic politicians, the media engage in damage control. For Republicans, their goal is damage. Damaging Republicans is what \"trusted, fact-based, independent journalists\" do. Scratch a journalist, and they’ll tell you it’s so politically clumsy (and Trumpy) for documents to be released on television in the White House briefing room by a Trump official. When the Democrats conspired to ruin Trump, they leaked it quietly to those \"independent\" journalists, who then didn’t want to mention they received dirt from PR firms like Fusion GPS, that were paid by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to distribute false information, like the junk contained in the \"Steele dossier.\" The networks briefly touched on the Hillary connection when it came out, and quickly moved on, like that was a trifling matter. There’s no need to obsess over the nasty sausage they were making. NEW RUSSIAGATE EVIDENCE 'DIRECTLY POINT TO' OBAMA, DOJ WILL DECIDE 'CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS': GABBARD Leftist journalists use anonymous sources to disguise the very partisan nature of the leakers, and there was a ton of surfing on anonymous sources in the tidal wave of anti-Trump journalism. The broadcast networks easily lapped up slime from \"mainstream\" sources like The New York Times or The Atlantic. These broadcast \"institutions\" are not about to unravel a Russian-collusion narrative that they relentlessly promoted during Trump's first term. We counted 2,284 minutes of Russiagate coverage on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts alone from 2017 to 2019. Even if then-FBI Director Robert Mueller never indicted Trump for collusion, it was a very persistent black cloud over everything Team Trump was trying to accomplish in his first term. In the first months of 2017, it was the dominant Trump story. When Trump held a press conference that February and denounced the press, NBC’s Chuck Todd tweeted, \"This not a laughing matter. I'm sorry, delegitimizing the press is un-American.\" He later added, \"Press bashing may feel good to folks but when it's done by people in power, it's corrosive.

They pretend only their critics look like partisans. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The networks didn’t want to focus on Trump’s accomplishments in his first term, and not just because successes in making conservative public policy aren’t \"accomplishments\" in their eyes. They wanted Trump to be best known for selling out America to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and laying out the scenario that the end of his presidency could occur at any moment. Their wishful thinking is often defined as \"news.\" It doesn’t sound like the \"nightly news.\" Its sounds like a nightly narrative, carefully constructed for political effect. It was a major part of Trump’s evening news coverage being around 90% negative every month. The broadcast networks easily lapped up slime from \"mainstream\" sources like The New York Times or The Atlantic. There’s any number of \"gems\" from the media’s anti-Trump collusion campaign. On ABC’s \"The View\" in 2017, co-host Sunny Hostin was mourning Hillary Clinton’s defeat: \"What cost her the election, in my humble opinion is Russia’s hacking,\" and racism – she cited what CNN’s Van Jones called a \"whitelash.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On ABC’s \"This Week\" in 2018, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg proclaimed, \"We don’t know if Putin is his handler, his hero or his co-conspirator, but it’s obviously where his loyalty lies as opposed to lying with the American people.\" Now, when Trump accuses Obama of treason in the Russia matter, \"The View\" co-host Joy Behar demanded to know: \"Why can't Obama sue Trump for defamation of character?\" But Behar and Hostin have repeatedly accused Trump of treason over the last five years.

Because Bezos owns a bunch of mega-corporations, including Amazon, that depend on Trump’s goodwill and could be in deep trouble if Trump decided to retaliate against Bezos. \n\nIt’s much the same story with Stephen Colbert, longtime host of CBS’s “The Late Show” and the top-rated late-night talk show host in the United States. \n\nOn July 14, Colbert openly criticized CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for its $16 million settlement with Trump of his frivolous lawsuit over the routine editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris that Trump claimed gave her an unfair advantage in the 2024 election. \n\nSaid Colbert in his opening monologue:\n\n“As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended. And I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company…. I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s big fat bribe. Because this all comes as Paramount's owners are trying to get the Trump administration to approve the sale of our network to a new owner, Skydance.”\n\nThree days later, on July 17, Paramount pulled the plug on Colbert’s show, eliciting from Trump a celebratory, “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”\n\n(A few days later, Colbert came out swinging, telling Trump to “go f--- yourself,” and joking that it had always been his dream to have a sitting president celebrate the end of his career.)\n\nYesterday, one week after Colbert’s show was cancelled, Trump’s Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s sale to Skydance. \n\nTo cinch the deal, Skydance CEO David Ellison promised that he’d eliminate all U.S.-based DEI programs at Paramount and CBS and create a new ombudsman to field complaints of ideological bias in news coverage. \n\nTrump says CBS also agreed to run $20 million worth of public service announcements consistent with his ideological beliefs.\n\nLet’s be clear. Jeff Bezos has silenced any criticism of Trump on the editorial pages of The Washington Post because Bezos fears Trump’s wrath. \n\nCBS and its parent corporation, Paramount, has silenced criticism of Trump on Colbert’s hugely popular “Late Show” because its top corporate brass fears Trump’s wrath. \n\nThe new owner of CBS has agreed to some federal interference in the content of what it produces because he fears Trump’s wrath. \n\nThe silencing is happening across American media because Trump cannot stand criticism, because he’s vindictive as hell, and because he’s willing and able to use every department and agency of the federal government to punish any media corporations that allow its writers or hosts to criticize him. \n\nIt’s the same with American universities, whose professors have often criticized Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional actions and whose research has often yielded conclusions that contradict Trump’s lies (such as that climate change is a “hoax”).\n\nColumbia University, Dartmouth College, and a handful of others have gone out of their way to “cooperate” with the Trump regime in order to avoid Trump’s wrath. \n\nWhat does “cooperation” entail? Silencing Trump’s potential critics. \n\nColumbia has just agreed to allow the regime to review its admissions and hiring practices in order to receive the federal research grants that the regime had held back. \n\nFriends, this is how democracy dies. \n\nShame on any media outlet or university that allows Trump to silence it. \n\nTrump is a dangerous despot.

And it’s been a long time since it’s gotten there. I mean, you’re looking at 2.5 percent inflation now.’\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent year-over-year in June.\n\nThough slightly over Smith’s mentioned number, the inflation rate has stayed under 3 percent for several months in a row, indicating a major decline from its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022 – the highest in 40 years, as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDespite the data, Nellis insisted that inflation continues to rise. \n\n‘Inflation is still going up,’ he said. ‘And it’s rising, according to the latest stats.’\n\n‘That’s not the case,’ Smith countered. ‘Inflation has come down. Inflation by nature is growth in prices, but the growth has slowed.’\n\nEarlier in the segment, Nellis blamed Republicans and President Donald Trump for ongoing economic concerns.\n\n‘Right now the president of the United States is Donald Trump. Republicans are in control of Congress,’ Nellis said. ‘They’re currently in recess rather than doing anything about inflation.’\n\nHe went on to claim that beef and alcohol prices hit record highs over the July 4 weekend and criticized Trump’s promises to reduce prices immediately after taking office.\n\n‘Donald Trump promised to make grocery prices go down on day one,’ Nellis said. ‘We’re six months in and everything’s more expensive.’\n\nSmith pushed back, noting that ‘prices have definitely come down,’ but that ‘they can go down more.’\n\nMeanwhile, some economic indicators suggest relief for American consumers, according to AAA, average gas prices hit a four-year low in June. \n\nThe tense exchange came just days after the Democratic Party had its own messaging blunder when its official X account posted a graphic blaming inflation from 2021 to 2024 on ‘Trump’s America’ – even though Joe Biden and Harris were in charge the whole time. \n\nThe post later deleted.\n\nThe White House later shared the same graphic again, this time fixing the mistake and crediting the Biden administration.\n\nThat slip-up highlights the tough spot Democrats are in as they face growing criticism over the party’s handling of the economy. \n\nA new Wall Street Journal poll this week showed that 63 percent of voters view the Democratic Party unfavorably – the worst rating they’ve seen in 35 years.\n\nJust 33 percent said they view the party favorably, and only 8 percent said they had a ‘very favorable’ view, according to the poll.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans, while also viewed more unfavorably than favorably, had stronger numbers – sitting at just 19 percent.\n\nPresident Trump’s job approval stands at 46 percent, higher than the 40 percent approval rating he received at the same point in his first term, according to the WSJ.\n\nWhen asked which party they trusted more on major issues such as inflation, tariffs, and immigration, voters consistently favored Republicans.\n\n‘The Democratic brand is so bad that they don’t have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party,’ Democratic pollster John Anzalone, who conducted the WSJ poll with Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, said.\n\n‘Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they’re for and what their economic message is, they’re going to have problems.’\n\nRepublicans currently hold a financial edge as well, with campaign filings showing the Republican National Committee has over $80 million on hand, compared to $15 million held by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the WSJ reported.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA previous top adviser to Kamala Harris appeared notably taken aback during&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former Advisor to Kamala Harris Stumbles Over Basic Inquiry first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/former-advisor-to-kamala-harris-stumbles-over-basic-inquiry/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kamala-Harris-ex-advisor-flustered-after-being-asked-simple-question.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 11:12:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.579},{"id":345482114,"title":"America could have avoided Trump's reign of terror with one simple task","text":"I am certain there has not been a time in my life that has stretched out any longer than the three decades that passed between July 23, 2024 and July 23, 2025.\n\nJust a year ago, Vice President Kamala Harris made her first public appearance after taking the baton from President Joe Biden to begin her historic sprint to the White House, while shattering glass ceilings and trying to save America from itself along the way ...\n\nIf successful, it would be the most audacious political Hail Mary in American history, during a time we never needed a good woman more.\n\nWisconsinites had traveled from all parts of the state with little notice to gather in this out-sized high school gymnasium tucked hard in the middle of a brawny suburb that helped wall off Milwaukee to the east.\n\nOne by one, Wisconsin’s Democratic royalty sauntered into the place … Gov. Tony Evers, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, and state Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler led a cast of dozens who wanted the teeming crowd in West Allis to know that despite all the recent tumult in the party they were firmly planting their flag with her.\n\nOnly 18 days earlier, off a terrible debate performance, Joe Biden had been in the state capitol of Madison in yet another high school auditorium in this battleground state where he literally begged for his political life, before mustering with George Stephanopoulos in a classroom onsite to make the same case to a national audience that evening.\n\nBiden’s speech drew a mostly sympathetic reception from the partisans in attendance, but it was clear as day he was not in the kind of good trouble the great John Lewis would have advocated this late in the campaign.\n\nOutside in the neighborhoods surrounding the school, the atmosphere was surreal. Hundreds of people, who couldn’t get in to watch the speech were turning on their best “Midwestern nice,” politely pleading with Biden to drop out. Others were there to show their support. Still others were there because when the president has traveled to your blue-collar neighborhood, the respectful thing to do is just shut up, and hear him out.\n\nThen there were the pro-Palestinian protestors — always the pro-Palestinian protestors — who brought plenty of noise and heat to the somber event. They were kept at a distance by law enforcement which had descended from everywhere, but with their drums and kazoos nonetheless could be heard 10 blocks over.\n\nI sympathized with their cause, just as I sympathized with the Israeli families who had been brutally terrorized, but all of them simply had to know that Biden would be miles better dealing with this sizzling issue than Bibi’s orange baby, who these days has given Israel’s disgusting, corrupt “leader” a spare room in the White House to help burp Stephen Miller.\n\nThat was the day I knew for sure these protesters were clearly prepared to burn it all down for their cause, even if it meant setting that cause back for a decade, by installing a complete madman in the White House.

Hundreds of people, who couldn’t get in to watch the speech were turning on their best “Midwestern nice,” politely pleading with Biden to drop out. Others were there to show their support. Still others were there because when the president has traveled to your blue-collar neighborhood, the respectful thing to do is just shut up, and hear him out.\n\nThen there were the pro-Palestinian protestors — always the pro-Palestinian protestors — who brought plenty of noise and heat to the somber event. They were kept at a distance by law enforcement which had descended from everywhere, but with their drums and kazoos nonetheless could be heard 10 blocks over.\n\nI sympathized with their cause, just as I sympathized with the Israeli families who had been brutally terrorized, but all of them simply had to know that Biden would be miles better dealing with this sizzling issue than Bibi’s orange baby, who these days has given Israel’s disgusting, corrupt “leader” a spare room in the White House to help burp Stephen Miller.\n\nThat was the day I knew for sure these protesters were clearly prepared to burn it all down for their cause, even if it meant setting that cause back for a decade, by installing a complete madman in the White House.

It’s not just another corporate merger: it’s a road sign on our accelerating march toward oligarchy, propaganda, and the collapse of honest media.\n\nWe’ve watched one of the most important legacy broadcast platforms in America pay a $16 million bribe to our convicted felon president, reportedly offer him another $16 million worth of free air time, and try to sell its entire operation to a billionaire with a God complex. It’s the worst of the Reagan revolution coming home to roost, on our screens, in our homes, and in our civic life.\n\nStart with the $16 million payoff: Trump sued CBS and its parent company Paramount over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, laughably arguing that CBS’s editing of the interview constituted unlawful election tampering. The lawsuit was instantly and widely regarded as frivolous, but instead of fighting it, CBS quietly settled for an astonishing $16 million. No trial. No discovery. Just a big, fat check.\n\nThis isn’t journalism: it’s tribute. It’s what oligarchs have done for centuries when they want to please the king.\n\nThis should shock the conscience of any functioning democracy, and has the rest of the world wondering about the health of ours. But in the GOP’s America — where billionaires are gods and corporations are people — this is just Thursday.\n\nAntitrust laws that were once enforced to keep our economy and our media diverse and competitive are now all but ignored.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way, as I lay out in . Before Ronald Reagan took office, the federal government blocked mergers that would’ve concentrated too much economic or political power.\n\nIn 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act that said giant companies couldn’t dominate markets simply because they had the financial muscle to buy up their smaller competitors or drive them out of business by dropping prices long enough to run them into bankruptcy. It was later augmented by the Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914) and the Celler-Kefauver Act (1950).\n\nThe law was so rigorously enforced — so the game of business could be played by comers, not just the “big boys” — that in the 1960s the Supreme Court barred the merger of the Kinney and Buster Brown shoe companies because the new combined company would control 5 percent of the shoe market.\n\nBut then Reagan, in 1983, ordered the DOJ, SEC, and FTC to basically stop enforcing the Sherman Act, which is why today Nike, for example, controls about a fifth of the entire nation’s shoe market. It’s the same across industry after industry, from retail to grocery stores to railroads to computer software to social media to chip manufacturing to airlines to hotels … and media.\n\nIn the decades since Reagan and the GOP stabbed small businesses in the back, things have deteriorated badly. In 1983, there were about 50 companies that owned 90% of American media, controlling roughly 90% of what Americans see, hear, and read. As of today, it’s six: Comcast, Disney, News Corp, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount (for now). That’s not a free press, it’s an oligopoly.\n\nAnd now Larry Ellison, the tenth-richest man in the world with a net worth north of $150 billion, and his son are stepping in to consolidate even more control. Ellison already uses his wealth to push far-right political causes; he was the single largest funder of a rightwing PAC. Now he’ll have one of the largest megaphones in America.\n\nThis is what oligarchy looks like, courtesy of the Reagan Revolution and, most recently, the corrupt decision by five bought-off Republicans on the Supreme Court.\n\nAn oligarch buys a media empire. A corrupt president extorts that empire for cash and air time. The journalists there who once held power to account get fired. And now Stephen Colbert — whose nightly monologue is one of the few mainstream platforms consistently skewering Trump and the GOP — is on the chopping block. So is the legendary 60 Minutes team, neutered to avoid offending Ellison’s political pals. All to grease the wheels for a merger and keep Trump happy.\n\nMeanwhile, the average American gets nothing. No trustworthy journalism. No independent voices. No real debate. Just more billionaire-driven narratives, more Trump hagiography, and more of the toxic sludge that passes for news in post-Reagan America.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán used state subsidies and friendly oligarchs to seize control of that nation’s media. In Russia, Vladimir Putin arrested or exiled journalists while his billionaire cronies bought up every independent outlet.\n\nTrump’s already following the blueprint to do the same here through Project 2025: purge career civil servants, seize control of the FCC, and turn the media into a mouthpiece for the regime. With CBS in the hands of Ellison and already making cash payments to Trump, we’re more than halfway there.\n\nMake no mistake: this isn’t about entertainment or even profits. It’s about power. When the press becomes the property of the morbidly rich and they wield it to defend their interests, as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams warned, democracy becomes their plaything.\n\nTrump is running a campaign of vengeance, vengeance against the media in particular, and CBS is handing him a gun. And the kicker? Shari Redstone — the morbidly rich heiress billionaire who’s cashing out of CBS and Paramount — is walking away with billions while the public walks away with nothing.\n\nWhat’s happening to CBS is not just one network’s moral collapse; it’s a symptom of our national disease. The disease Reagan diagnosed as “government is the problem” when he actually meant: “democracy is the problem.”\n\nSince 1981, Republicans have systematically deregulated, defunded, and dismantled every guardrail of democratic capitalism they could get their hands on. The result is an America where billionaires like Ellison can buy the truth, where the press kowtows to the criminal-in-chief, and where the public interest has no advocate left.\n\nWe are reaping what Reagan sowed. In 1996, the Telecommunications Act — passed with bipartisan support but cheer-led by Reaganites — blew open the floodgates of media consolidation. In the years that followed, Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) gobbled up over 1,200 radio stations. Sinclair Broadcasting used loopholes to flood local news with right-wing propaganda.\n\nAnd now, legacy TV networks are selling themselves to political oligarchs while laundering bribes to Trump through legal settlements and airtime giveaways.\n\nAll of this is happening in plain sight. It’s not even subtle anymore. Trump brags about “retribution,” and CBS offers him a microphone. He lies about the election, and they hand him airtime. He threatens journalists, and their bosses fire them.\n\nAnd where are the regulators? The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under Joe Biden had taken steps to revive antitrust enforcement, but Trump has ended all those efforts and put a bootlicker in charge of the FCC.\n\nAnd Congress? Half of them are on the take, funded by the very oligarchs who benefit from this media rot. According to OpenSecrets.org, media and internet companies spent over $600 million lobbying Congress in 2024 alone.\n\nWhat we’re witnessing is the logical endpoint of a 44-year experiment in trickle-down libertarianism called the Reagan Revolution. The billionaires got their tax cuts. The corporations got their deregulation. The politicians got their payoffs. And the people got lies, propaganda, and impoverishment.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. We could enforce antitrust laws. We could reinstate the Fairness Doctrine. We could limit media ownership and break up monopolies like Comcast and Sinclair. We could tax the billionaires who are using their wealth to warp our democracy and rebuild public-interest journalism from the ground up.\n\nBut first, we have to stop pretending this is normal.\n\nIt’s not normal to pay a criminal ex-president $16 million to go away and then invite him back on air; this sort of thing doesn’t happen in any other developed country in the world.\n\nIt’s not normal to fire comedians and journalists for telling the truth. It’s not normal for one politician to cow the nation’s news organizations. And it’s sure as hell not normal for the Fourth Estate to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the neofascist MAGA movement.\n\nThis isn’t just a CBS problem. It’s not even just a media problem. It’s a democracy problem. If Congress lets the Ellisons and Trumps and Redstones buy and sell the truth, it’ll be years before we get it back, if ever.\n\nThe Congressional switchboard number is 202-224-3121. Pass it along.","summary":"The CBS merger deal illustrates everything that’s wrong with post-Reagan Revolution America.

He won men under 30, won men of college age, and even won the youth vote in the swing state of Michigan. American young people were widely assumed to be uniformly liberal, and expected to remain so forever and ever. But the reality was anything but. I saw this trend playing out in real time as I toured the country speaking on college campuses to crowds of three, four, and even five thousand strong. Young Americans were not happy with Joe Biden’s America or Kamala Harris' vows to continue it, and they were ready to return to the president they associated with a more prosperous pre-COVID time. It was a big win. But it was also impermanent. It could be a one-off. It could easily be explained by the aftermath of COVID or the incredible political charisma of Donald Trump himself. The youth vote of 2024 wasn’t so much a win as it was an opportunity: A clear demonstration that conservatives actually can compete to win the votes of American young people, rather than writing them off. The challenge for Republicans now is seizing this Gen Z opportunity. Because Gen Z won’t become lifelong conservatives thanks to a good campaign or slick online memes. They’ll only become lifelong supporters if we’re able to deliver for them on the big issues that matter. Experts expend a lot of effort and ink explaining what Gen Z \"wants.\" But between my campus visits and my work running Turning Point USA, I talk to as many Gen Z’ers as anyone in the country. They want basic economic success and security like the generations before them. They want a home, they want a family, they want to feel like they are building something and that they are a part of something. GEN Z'ERS IDENTIFYING AS LIBERAL DROPS 12 POINTS SINCE 2016, ACCORDING TO MORNING CONSULT JUNE REPORT And right now, on that front, Gen Z has a lot of problems. Economically, things are dire. In 1984, the median American home cost about three and a half times the median income in America. Today, the median house costs almost six times the median income. Rent isn’t much better, and has risen more than 50% in real terms since the 1970s. In 1980, tuition at the average public college was about $2,800 in today’s dollars. Today it’s around $10,000, and, unsurprisingly, that means the average college student leaves school with a debt burden that previously could have bought them a car, provided the down payment on a house, or helped them start a family. CHARLIE KIRK SOUNDS THE ALARM ON THE BIGGEST THREAT TO REPUBLICANS HOLDING THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Financially, young people aren’t just facing more expensive necessities, but also a more predatory economic reality. Millions of Gen Zers are buying everything from concert tickets to groceries to Chipotle burritos through buy now, pay later (BNPL) setups from companies like Klarna and Affirm. Some polls indicate Gen Z prefers BNPL to traditional credit cards. Taking on debt for purchases may make sense when buying a house or a car, but once a person is paying for their groceries with 4 monthly payments at 10% interest, something has gone awry. Of course, America hasn’t become a poor nation. In fact, we’re as spectacularly wealthy as ever. Yet this wealth doesn’t reach young Americans (unless it’s by way of inheritance). Instead, over and over, policy decisions have ensured that elderly Americans grow wealthier and wealthier. Never in American history has so much wealth been concentrated in those who are already retired from the labor force. This reality became even more pronounced during COVID and the rampant inflation that followed. Older Americans with equities and assets in their portfolio saw their net worth skyrocket, while younger Americans just saw those assets become even more unaffordable. It wasn’t always like this. When the baby boomers of today were growing up, government policy routinely favored young people. Jobs were easier to get, with far fewer credentialing hurdles. Houses were built far faster. Wages were higher instead of being suppressed through sky-high legal and illegal immigration. Today, though, America is a country built for those who are already owners, and those too young to buy are finding themselves stuck becoming borrowers and renters. The median age of first-time home buyers is now pushing 40, about a decade higher than the 1980s when the average age was just 29! BUY NOW, PAY LATER PITFALLS: MANY CONSUMERS AREN'T PAYING LOANS This isn’t because Gen Z is lazy — a common retort I hear — it’s because they are contending with structural disadvantages older Americans didn’t experience. If this continues, something will break, and young people will lead the way in breaking it. Zohran Mamdani has become a celebrity for Gen Z with his slick promises of a New York City rent freeze, state-owned grocery stores, and free daycare as stepping stones to eventually seizing the means of production. Mamdani’s political surge is not a passing fad or pure TV news fodder. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It should be a giant flashing red alarm. There are millions of Americans who feel cut off from any meaningful economic progress or stability. Eventually, if they can’t obtain prosperity the old-fashioned way, they will simply try to vote themselves prosperity, and there will be plenty of demagogues promising this can be done easily by simply expropriating those with more than them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Most of Gen Z is ideologically fluid. They’re happy to give Republicans a shot, then turn around and elect a Marxist two years later. America will have a reordering of its economy. The only question is what that reordering will look like. There are two paths before us. We will either have stabilizing reforms like those of Theodore Roosevelt a century ago and those espoused by nationalist, populist conservatives, or we will have revolutionary, destructive \"reforms\" like those that have already ruined once-prosperous countries like Cuba or Venezuela. If we succeed in the next three years, or if we fail, will determine which.

He is a martyr. Good for him.”\n\nThe 78-year-old comedian says Colbert had immortalized himself as the face of the network since he took over the iconic talk show in September 2015.\n\n“10 years ago, I quit and left,” Letterman said. “Then Stephen Colbert comes along, and pretty quickly established himself as a precise, crisp, witty political satirist, and often his target has been the current administration.\n\n“Based on that and just the overall entertainment quota of the show, drew a great audience and people became not addicted to but always looking forward to political satire from Stephen Colbert, he was very good at it.

Yeah right,” he said. “I bet they were losing this kind of money six weeks ago, or they have never been losing money.”\n\nThe comedian called out the network’s news branch, saying CBS News doesn’t make money for the company and is still around.\n\n“Take a look at CBS News, it’s still in business and I’m not certain that that’s a profit center,” he said.\n\n“I think the idea that they’re hiding behind money and they’re giving him another 10 months. That’s a huge chunk of money they’re gonna lose,” Letterman said.\n\nColbert’s cancellation came as CBS-Paramount Holdings finalized the sale of the network to Skydance Media for $8.4 billion on July 24.\n\n“The f–k is Skydance? Honest to Christ. Is it a discount airline?” Letterman joked.\n\n“I think one day, if not today, the people at CBS who have manipulated and handled this are going to be embarrassed because this is gutless,” he added.\n\nThe purported $8.4 billion sale comes in light of CBS settling a lawsuit with President Donald Trump after the commander in chief accused CBS News’ “60 Minutes” of deceptively editing an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the weeks leading up to the 2024 general election.\n\nLetterman called the settlement “pure cowardice” as the lawsuit targeted the network’s “pinnacle of journalistic integrity.”\n\nColbert, 61, has also called himself a “martyr” as he blamed his show’s demise on Trump, telling the commander in chief to “go f–k yourself” in his opening monologue on July 21.\n\nLetterman wished the cancellation had happened on his watch as he now has to kiss “Colbert’s ring.”\n\nThe comedian had already commented on the shock ending to the long-time show.\n\n“You can’t spell CBS without BS,” Letterman captioned a YouTube video of his old jokes against the Turner network.","summary":"\"The fact that they killed the franchise and told Stephen to go,\" Letterman said in a video posted to his YouTube channel. \"Now, for Stephen, I love this.

On July 16, 2025, the Super Bass rapper shed light on Demoree Hadley's lawsuit (filed in May 2025) against Perez, where she claimed her mother had her institutionalized in a mental facility for two weeks without her consent.Hadley also claimed Perez attempted to cause a rift in her relationship with her husband, Javon Hadley, by accusing him of domestic abuse. In her post, Minaj highlighted the allegations mentioned in the lawsuit, writing:\"Good morning to everyone except Desiree Perez. CEO OF ROCCNATION. She’s being accused by her daughter in a lawsuit where she allegedly put listening devices & cameras in her adult daughter’s room.\" Minaj added:\"She allegedly lied that her daughter was on drugs & that her son in law was a woman beater to put him in jail & her in a mental facility. Shes alleged to have called her black son-in-law a N****R while beating on her daughter. She was pardoned by President Trump a few years ago on unrelated charges.\"In another post on July 16, Minaj implied that Jay-Z and Desiree Perez allegedly stole from their artists and blackballed them, accusing them of indulging in “unethical business practices.\"Nicki Minaj @NICKIMINAJLINKYou forgot one.

In the same tweet, she alleged that both Jay-Z and Perez did not support Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election due to the latter's pardon.As for her spat with Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj targeted the paternity lawsuit filed by his alleged son Rymir Satterthwaite in one of her posts on July 8. On July 18, Satterthwaite filed a notice to drop the lawsuit against the rapper.In another post on July 8, Nicki Minaj claimed that the Empire State of Mind rapper owed her a \"karmic debt,\" bringing up her 3% stake in Tidal, a streaming platform he founded in 2015 and sold in 2021. According to Rolling Stone, Minaj claimed she did not receive her share of the equity after the sale, alleging she was owed around $100-200 million.In her post on July 9, Nicki Minaj claimed Jay-Z and Perez \"ruined\" hip-hop and football, writing:“You ruined hiphop – You ruined football – You ruined basketball – You ruined touring – You ruined Instagram – You ruined Twitter. The jig is up. All of this is alleged & for entertainment purposes only.”Nicki Minaj's allegation that Jay-Z \"ruined\" football is a possible reference to the Anaconda rapper's 2024 tweets. Minaj had called out Hov for choosing Kendrick Lamar as the 2025 Super Bowl headliner instead of Lil Wayne.Jay-Z and Desiree Perez are not the only people Nicki Minaj called out this month. Minaj engaged in an online spat with singer SZA, resulting in the rapper insulting the singer's career and looks across multiple X posts.","summary":"Nicki Minaj recently resumed her comments on Desiree Perez, Roc Nation's CEO, after continually calling for Perez to be deposed and shedding light on her daughter Demoree Hadley's lawsuit against her.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/news-came-back-swinging-internet-reacts-nicki-minaj-mockingly-hails-rico-desiree-perez-the-iconic-debut-single","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/bfc64-17535136407130-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 08:44:57","author":"Juhi Marzia","authors":["Juhi Marzia"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":345414358,"title":"Donald Trump Wants To Punish Anyone Who Doesn’t Like Him","text":"This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.\n\nDonald Trump is aggressively escalating his pressure campaign on media he doesn’t approve of.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal — whose parent company is owned by Rupert Murdoch, a billionaire and powerful Trump ally — published a news story about Trump’s ties to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein last week, the president openly admitted that he had tried to get the story killed.\n\n“I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story,” Trump posted on Truth Social, the social media app he owns. “But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.”\n\n“Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but, obviously, did not have the power to do so,” Trump wrote in another post.\n\nThe story in question reported that Trump had apparently sent a crude letter to Epstein on his 50th birthday in which he alluded to things the two men had in common and included the phrase, “may every day be another wonderful secret.” When the paper didn’t kill the story as Trump had asked, the president filed a libel lawsuit claiming that the story would cause him “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” and demanding $10 billion in compensation. \n\nNot even Murdoch, whose media empire (which includes Fox News) has been of great political benefit to Trump, is safe. He, along with the Journal and the reporters who worked on the story, were named in the suit. \n\nIt’s no secret that the president is notoriously thin-skinned and can’t handle even mild criticism, nor does he hide that he’s particularly litigation-happy — Trump has long filed lawsuits, including spurious ones, against negative media coverage. But this time is different.\n\n“It’s unprecedented to have a sitting president file a lawsuit against a newsroom,” said Tim Richardson, the journalism and disinformation program manager at PEN America, an organisation that advocates for free speech rights.\n\nIf Trump can control the media, he will be free to enact whichever policies he wants — without anyone to hold him accountable for the harm they may do. It’s all a part of his effort to control what Americans can say, think, or engage with. \n\nThe Trump administration’s attack on freedom of speech has ensnared colleges, law firms, individual people, and, of course, Trump’s biggest enemy: the free press.\n\n“Trump is throwing a temper tantrum and saying if I shout loudly enough, maybe the people who criticise me will go away,” Peter Loge, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, told HuffPost. “But if you don’t want to get yelled at about what you think, don’t be President of the United States.” \n\nBecause of the First Amendment, it’s a standard of American law that people have the right to speak about and critique their government, and that includes news publications. What’s more, public figures have a higher bar to clear than a regular person when it comes to claiming defamation, or that a story or criticism damages them. It’s understood, and courts have supported, that if you are in public life, the public has an interest in your doings, even if they are not flattering.\n\nWell, it’s understood, except apparently by Trump himself. \n\n“Trump is basically saying, if you say something I don’t like, I’m going to punish you,” Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told HuffPost.\n\nIt is, in fact, something Trump has been saying to other institutions for a long time. Since January, Trump has signed executive orders threatening big law firms that have championed issues he doesn’t like, hamstringing their ability to bring legal challenges against his administration. The president demanded that the firms provide him with pro-bono services — and many, though not all, of them capitulated. \n\nHe has also turned the screws on colleges and universities, traditionally sites of political protest and civil disobedience. Through executive orders and policy demands, he has pushed to swing higher education to the political right: prioritizing enrolling conservative-leaning students, hiring faculty that support Trump, and demanding they end programs that focus on race and justice. If colleges fail to adhere to the Trump agenda, he threatens them with loss of federal funding. \n\nAgain, it has to some extent worked: This week, Columbia University bent the knee and agreed to a $220 million settlement with the president, even as schools like Harvard have chosen to stick out the fight.\n\nTrump’s war with the press is a holdover from his first administration, and he picked it up almost immediately after returning to the White House. In this administration, he has begun to openly use threats and the power of the federal government to exercise pressure on his critics.\n\n“The tactics that have been used have been ratcheted up from what we saw [during his first term],” Richardson said.\n\nIn February, he signed an executive order that purportedly changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. When The Associated Press declined to follow suit, Trump retaliated by banning the news outlet from sending its reporters to the Oval Office and other presidential events. The AP is currently in a legal fight to restore access. \n\nBut Trump has used the move since. After The Wall Street Journal published its story about the Epstein birthday card, Trump blocked a WSJ reporter from coverage of official events. The White House had also previously blocked a HuffPost reporter from the group of journalists covering the president, although the reporter, S.V. Date, was later reinstated.\n\nIn December, Trump sued Ann Selzer, an Iowa pollster and the Des Moines Register, accusing her of fraud over a poll that had shown him trailing behind his opponent Kamala Harris shortly before Election Day. Trump ultimately won the state.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission announced in February that it was investigating San Francisco-based radio station KCBS after the station reported on immigration raids in the area.\n\nBrendan Carr, the FCC chair, said it was because the station reported on the live location of the vans of federal immigration officers. The radio station, Carr said, needed to “explain how this could possibly be consistent with their public interest obligations.”\n\n“Every elected official complains that the press is unfair,” Loge noted. “The difference with this administration is that Trump is actively trying to threaten and shut down the free press.”\n\nTrump began a feud with CBS when he falsely accused the network of “deceptively” editing a 60 Minutes interview with Harris during the 2024 presidential race to “tip the scales” in her favour. Trump filed a lawsuit against Paramount, which owns CBS. The company said the interview was simply edited for time, which is typical, rather than doctored. Still, Paramount settled for $16 million.\n\nAfter Paramount agreed to the settlement, Stephen Colbert, the host of the Late Show With Stephen Colbert on CBS, lampooned the company’s decision to genuflect before the president, calling the settlement a “big fat bribe.” \n\nParamount was in the middle of an upcoming merger with Skydance Media, for which it needed FCC approval. \n\nColbert, a longtime critic of the right wing in general and Trump in particular, even seemed to acknowledge that the jokes put a target on his back. \n\n“Some of the TV typers out there are blogging that once Skydance gets CBS, the new owners’ desire to please Trump could ‘put pressure on late-night host and frequent Trump critic Stephen Colbert,’” the host said, quoting a Puck News article. “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert… if they can’t find him,” he joked. \n\nThree days after Colbert skewered the settlement, CBS announced it was cancelling his show. Executives stressed that it was a purely financial decision. Trump, however, took a victory lap. \n\n“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” Trump said on Tuesday in a Truth Social post. He also alluded to other late-night hosts who make fun of him. “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!” \n\nParamount’s merger was approved on Thursday. Some elected officials noted that the timing was suspicious. \n\n“Trump’s goal is to have a chilling effect,” Leventoff said. Advocates worry that if he’s able to threaten and punish media outlets, companies and universities with no repercussions, it’ll send a signal to other institutions that fighting back isn’t worth it.\n\nIt’s not just those who examine Trump’s policies who are subject to intimidation.\n\nOn Wednesday’s episode of the daytime talk show “The View,” co-host Joy Behar discussed Trump’s regular attempts to turn criticisms back to former President Barack Obama. “The thing about [Trump] is he’s so jealous of Obama. Because Obama is everything that he is not — trim, smart, handsome, happily married, and can sing Al Green’s song ‘Let’s Stay Together’ better than Al Green,” Behar said. “And Trump cannot stand it. It’s driving him crazy.”\n\nWhen Entertainment Weekly asked the White House to comment, it sent a chilling warning.\n\nBehar “should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air,” the White House statement read.\n\n“This is intimidation,” Richardson said. “The View is not standard news, but it all follows the same line of thinking. If there’s criticism or dissent, he wants to quash it.”\n\nWe don’t have to guess what happens when a political leader tries to clamp down on the free press. Some of the leaders Trump likes to praise are leading authoritarian regimes, like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. \n\nIn both those countries, cracking down on press freedom is routine. In Russia, journalists have been arrested for negative coverage of the government, and dozens of reporters have been killed. Orbán’s far-right party has proposed laws that would penalise groups that receive foreign donations, including journalism outlets. He has been accused of rewarding loyal news outlets with government subsidies.\n\n“These are certainly tactics that have been used in other countries to muzzle the press,” Richardson said.\n\nIn such a quelling environment, even questionable situations can contribute to a sense that dissent runs the risk of punishment. \n\n“People are agreeing with Trump because they’re too afraid to oppose him,” Loge said. \n\nWhen the approval of the Paramount merger was announced, Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC, blasted the decision. \n\n“The Paramount payout and this reckless approval have emboldened those who believe the government can — and should — abuse its power to extract financial and ideological concessions, demand favored treatment, and secure positive media coverage,” she said. \n\n“It is a dark chapter in a long and growing record of abuse that threatens press freedom in this country. But such violations endure only when institutions choose capitulation over courage. It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America.”\n\nMedia capitulations will only further harm free speech rights and embolden Trump. “It’s setting a dangerous precedent,” Richardson said. “And it’s hard to say where this ends.”","summary":"President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 25, 2025.This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.\n\nDonald Trump is aggressively escalating his pressure campaign on media he doesn’t approve of.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal — whose parent company is owned by Rupert Murdoch, a billionaire and powerful Trump ally — published a news story about Trump’s ties to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein last week, the president openly admitted that he had tried to get the story killed.\n\n“I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story,” Trump posted on Truth Social, the social media app he owns. “But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.”\n\n“Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but, obviously, did not have the power to do so,” Trump wrote in another post.\n\nThe story in question repo","url":"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-wants-to-punish-anyone-who-doesnt-like-him_uk_6884886fe4b07c2af0282b3d","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6883e31a190000b2fc6003cf.jpeg?cache=m0HN9OSZcz&ops=1200_630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 07:52:11","author":"Nathalie Baptiste,Rupert Murdoch","authors":["Nathalie Baptiste","Rupert Murdoch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":345384724,"title":"Trump arrives in Scotland for golf and bilateral talks as EU trade deal nears","text":"US President Donald Trump, dogged by questions about his ties to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, arrived in Scotland on Friday for some golf and bilateral talks that could yield a trade deal with the European Union.\n\nTrump told reporters upon his arrival that he will visit his two golf properties in Scotland and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whom he called a “highly respected woman”.\n\nAs hundreds of onlookers cheered his arrival, Trump repeated his earlier comment about a 50-50 chance of securing a deal with the EU, adding it would be his administration’s biggest trade agreement thus far, if it came together.\n\nHowever, he said there were still “sticking points” with Brussels on “maybe 20 different things.”\n\nTrump said his meeting with Starmer would be more of a celebration of the trade deal already reached than continued work on it, adding, “It’s a great deal for both.”\n\nBefore he left Washington, Trump said his administration was working hard on a possible trade deal with the EU, and Brussels was keen to make a deal. Von der Leyen said later she would meet Trump in Scotland on Sunday.\n\nEU diplomats say a deal could result in a 15 per cent tariff on EU goods, mirroring a framework accord with Japan reached this week and half of the 30 per cent Trump is threatening to impose by August 1.\n\nTrump has sought to reorder the global economy after imposing a 10 per cent tariff on nearly all trading partners in April and threatening sharply higher rates for many countries to kick in a week from now. Trump says the moves will reduce the US trade deficit and bring in extra revenue, but economists warn the new trade policies could drive up inflation.\n\n‘DON’T TALK ABOUT TRUMP’\n\nTrump, facing the biggest domestic political crisis of his second term, expressed frustration about ongoing questions about his administration’s handling of investigative files related to Epstein’s criminal charges and his 2019 death in prison.\n\n“You make it a very big thing over something that’s not a big thing,” Trump told reporters in Scotland, urging them to focus on other prominent Americans with ties to Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\n“Talk about Clinton. Talk about the former president of Harvard. Talk about all of his friends. Talk about the hedge fund guys that were with him all the time. Don’t talk about Trump,” he said. “What you should be talking about is the fact that we have the greatest six months in the history of a presidency.”\n\nThe Epstein issue has caused a rare breach with some of Trump’s most loyal Make America Great Again supporters, and majorities of Americans and Trump’s Republicans say they believe the government is hiding details on the case, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.\n\nWhite House officials are hoping the controversy dies down while Trump is abroad, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nDEEPEN TIES\n\nTrump will stay at his Turnberry property on Scotland’s west coast this weekend, before travelling on Monday to a golf property in Aberdeen, where he will open a second 18-hole course named in honour of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod. MacLeod was born and raised on a Scottish island before emigrating to the US.\n\nAs he left the White House, Trump said he looked forward to meeting both Starmer and Scottish leader John Swinney, who had publicly backed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nThe trip gives Trump and Starmer a chance to deepen their already warm ties, with key issues on the agenda to include ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, British and US sources said.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in Gaza is also likely to come up. Starmer on Thursday said he would hold an emergency call with France and Germany over what he called the “unspeakable and indefensible” suffering and starvation being reported there, and called on Israel to allow aid to enter the Palestinian enclave.\n\nGaza health authorities say more than 100 people have died from starvation, most in recent weeks. Human rights groups have said mass starvation is spreading even as tons of food and other supplies sit untouched just outside the territory.\n\nSince being elected last year, Starmer has prioritised good relations with Trump, stressing the importance of Britain’s defence and security alliance with the US, while working to clinch the first tariff-reduction deal with the US in May.\n\nThe framework agreement reaffirmed quotas and tariff rates on British automobiles and eliminated tariffs on the UK’s aerospace sector, but left steel tariffs in place.\n\nStarmer is expected to press for lower steel tariffs, but sources close to the matter said it was unclear if any breakthrough was possible during Trump’s visit.\n\nTrump has described Scotland as a “very special place” and made a similar trip there in 2016 during his earlier run for the presidency, but he will not necessarily get a warm welcome.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of Scots have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, while 18 per cent have a favourable opinion, an Ipsos poll in March found.\n\nScottish police are girding for protests on Saturday in both Aberdeen and in Edinburgh, the country’s capital.\n\nTrump will return to Britain from September 17-19 for a state visit hosted by King Charles. It will make Trump the first world leader in modern times to undertake two state visits to Britain. The late Queen Elizabeth hosted him at Buckingham Palace for a three-day state visit in June 2019.","summary":"US President Donald Trump, dogged by questions about his ties to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, arrived in Scotland on Friday for some golf and bilateral talks that could yield a trade deal with the European Union.

And it's been a long time since it's gotten there. I mean, you're looking at 2.5 percent inflation now.'\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent year-over-year in June.\n\nWhile slightly above Smith's figure, the inflation rate has remained below 3 percent for several consecutive months, reflecting a significant cooldown from its 9.1 percent peak in June 2022 - the highest in four decades, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDespite the data, Nellis insisted that inflation continues to rise. \n\n'Inflation is still going up,' he said. 'And it's rising, according to the latest stats.'\n\n'That's not the case,' Smith countered. 'Inflation has come down. Inflation by nature is growth in prices, but the growth has slowed.'\n\nEarlier in the segment, Nellis blamed Republicans and President Donald Trump for ongoing economic concerns.\n\n'Right now the president of the United States is Donald Trump.

Trump told reporters upon his arrival that he will visit his two golf properties in Scotland and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whom he called a \"highly respected woman.\" As hundreds of onlookers cheered his arrival, Trump repeated his earlier comment about a 50-50 chance of securing a deal with the EU, adding it would be his administration's biggest trade agreement thus far, if it came together. However, he said there were still \"sticking points\" with Brussels on \"maybe 20 different things.\" Trump said his meeting with Starmer would be more of a celebration of the trade deal already reached than continued work on it, adding, \"It's a great deal for both.\" Before he left Washington, Trump said his administration was working hard on a possible trade deal with the EU, and Brussels was keen to make a deal. Von der Leyen said later she would meet Trump in Scotland on Sunday.Live Events EU diplomats say a deal could result in a 15% tariff on EU goods, mirroring a framework accord with Japan reached this week and half of the 30% Trump is threatening to impose by August 1. Trump has sought to reorder the global economy after imposing a 10% tariff on nearly all trading partners in April and threatening sharply higher rates for many countries to kick in a week from now. Trump says the moves will reduce the U.S. trade deficit and bring in extra revenue, but economists warn the new trade policies could drive up inflation. 'DON'T TALK ABOUT TRUMP' Trump, facing the biggest domestic political crisis of his second term, expressed frustration about ongoing questions about his administration's handling of investigative files related to Epstein's criminal charges and his 2019 death in prison. \"You make it a very big thing over something that's not a big thing,\" Trump told reporters in Scotland, urging them to focus on other prominent Americans with ties to Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton. \"Talk about Clinton. Talk about the former president of Harvard. Talk about all of his friends. Talk about the hedge fund guys that were with him all the time. Don't talk about Trump,\" he said. \"What you should be talking about is the fact that we have the greatest six months in the history of a presidency.\" The Epstein issue has caused a rare breach with some of Trump's most loyal Make America Great Again supporters, and majorities of Americans and Trump's Republicans say they believe the government is hiding details on the case, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. White House officials are hoping the controversy dies down while Trump is abroad, two people familiar with the matter said. DEEPEN TIES Trump will stay at his Turnberry property on Scotland's west coast this weekend, before traveling on Monday to a golf property in Aberdeen, where he will open a second 18-hole course named in honor of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod. MacLeod was born and raised on a Scottish island before emigrating to the U.S. As he left the White House, Trump said he looked forward to meeting both Starmer and Scottish leader John Swinney, who had publicly backed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The trip gives Trump and Starmer a chance to deepen their already warm ties, with key issues on the agenda to include ending Russia's war in Ukraine, British and U.S. sources said. The deteriorating situation in Gaza is also likely to come up. Starmer on Thursday said he would hold an emergency call with France and Germany over what he called the \"unspeakable and indefensible\" suffering and starvation being reported there, and called on Israel to allow aid to enter the Palestinian enclave. Gaza health authorities say more than 100 people have died from starvation, most in recent weeks. Human rights groups have said mass starvation is spreading even as tons of food and other supplies sit untouched just outside the territory. Since being elected last year, Starmer has prioritized good relations with Trump, stressing the importance of Britain's defense and security alliance with the U.S., while working to clinch the first tariff-reduction deal with the U.S. in May. The framework agreement reaffirmed quotas and tariff rates on British automobiles and eliminated tariffs on the UK's aerospace sector, but left steel tariffs in place. Starmer is expected to press for lower steel tariffs, but sources close to the matter said it was unclear if any breakthrough was possible during Trump's visit. Trump has described Scotland as a \"very special place\" and made a similar trip there in 2016 during his earlier run for the presidency, but he will not necessarily get a warm welcome. About 70% of Scots have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, while 18% have a favorable opinion, an Ipsos poll in March found. Scottish police are girding for protests on Saturday in both Aberdeen and in Edinburgh, the country's capital. Trump will return to Britain from September 17-19 for a state visit hosted by King Charles. It will make Trump the first world leader in modern times to undertake two state visits to Britain.

Gov. Sara Rodriguez enters 2026 governor's race, calls Trump a 'maniac'","text":"APFILE - Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez speaks at a campaign event for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Friday, Nov. 1, 2024, in Little Chute, Wis. \n\nWisconsin Democratic Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez entered the battleground state's open race for governor Friday by calling President Donald Trump a \"maniac,\" as she attempts to differentiate herself in what is expected to be a crowded primary. A second Democrat, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, said in a statement Friday that in the weeks ahead he \"will be taking steps toward entering the race.\" Wisconsin's 2026 governor's race is open with no incumbent running for the first time since 2010. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers announced Thursday that he will not seek a third term. Both Rodriguez and Crowley would make history if elected. Rodriguez, a former emergency room nurse, would be Wisconsin's first woman governor and Crowley would be the first Black governor. Several other Democrats are expected to join the race. \"We've got a maniac in the White House,\" Rodriguez said in a campaign launch video. \"His tariffs are killing our farmers and his policies are hurting our kids.\"Live Events Evers has not endorsed anyone in the race. His spokesperson had no immediate comment Friday. Rodriguez has been lieutenant governor since 2023, after previously serving one two-year term in the state Assembly representing suburban Milwaukee, where she lives. She won a seat that had been under Republican control for years. Rodriguez emphasized her background working previously as a nurse in a Baltimore emergency room, saying she wanted to continue Evers' emphasis on fighting to protect reproductive freedom, invest in public schools and rebuild the economy. She noted that the state Legislature is within reach of Democratic control, meaning that with a Democratic governor, they could finally enact policies Republicans have blocked for years like expanding Medicaid. A registered nurse, Rodriguez previously worked as a health care executive and an epidemic intelligence service officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She has a master's degree in public health. Rodriguez emphasized the importance of health care, including protecting abortion rights, in a brief speech she delivered on the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last year. Rodriguez, who is married with two children, launched her candidacy on her 50th birthday. In her first run for office in 2020, when she was elected to the Legislature, Rodriguez said she was motivated to get into politics because of how Republicans handled the COVID-19 pandemic. Rodriguez won the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor in 2022 after then-Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who held the office in Evers' first term, decided to run for the Senate. Barnes, who lost that race to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, is among several Democrats considering a run for governor next year. Others include Attorney General Josh Kaul, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson. On the Republican side, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are the only announced candidates. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it. Berrien called Rodriguez \"the very embodiment of Tony Evers' and the Madison Democrats' failed record over the last six years.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onSara RodriguezWisconsin Governor RaceDonald Trump abortion criticDemocratic primary opponentsabortion rightshealth care2026 electionTony Evers\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Simon, who is the daughter of the late CBS News correspondent Bob Simon, has been a veteran of the show for 25 years and is now its fourth executive producer in the show’s decades-long history.\n\n“Tanya Simon understands what makes 60 MINUTES tick. She is an innovative leader, an exceptional producer and someone who knows how to inspire people,” president and executive editor of CBS News Tom Cibrowski said in a press release. “Tanya knows that the success of today’s 60 MINUTES depends on delivering a weekly mix of the most informative, impactful and entertaining stories and investigative journalism from around the world. This is the true essence and foundation of 60 MINUTES.”\n\nHowever, with CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, officially securing its acquisition Thursday and vowing change at the network, Simon appears to be the same kind of leader as those in the past. Registered as a Democrat, Simon’s husband Evan Garfein has also donated a total of $2,320 to Democratic candidates and committees between 2019 to 2024, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to public donation records, Garfein’s latest contribution was made in November 2024 to the major Democrat fundraising platform ActBlue for $100, with his largest donation made in 2019 to former Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper.\n\nThe announcement for Simon comes just months after Owens announced his departure from the show in April, saying that “60 Minutes” had lost journalistic independence. His exit came as Paramount was in acquisition talks with American media production and finance company Skydance, and amid a lawsuit from President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Colbert Fans Seem Unaware How Much CBS Was Losing On ‘Late Show’)\n\nIn October 2024, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS after the network quietly edited an interview with Harris — allegedly to favor the then-vice president — as the campaigns were just a month out from Election Day.\n\nAt the time of the interview’s release, a clip of Harris’ exchange with “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker was posted on a Sunday and made her response appear more concise compared to the full segment released a day later. Notably, also at the time of the interview’s release, Simon had been the show’s executive editor since April 2019, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nAfter Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Bredan Carr opened an investigation into the issue, CBS News released the full, unedited version of Harris’ interview in February. Additionally, vocal callouts of Owens began to circulate after the New York Post’s editorial board said that CBS News could fix its “lefty-propaganda problem” by cutting Owens loose.\n\nOwens reportedly refused to apologize for the editing decisions made, allegedly telling staff that the company knew he wouldn’t be saying sorry for anything the show had done, according to The New York Times. Upon Owen’s departure, the former executive producer sent a memo to his staff, saying that it was “clear” he would “not be allowed to run the show” as he “always” had.\n\n“To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience. So, having defended this show- and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” Owens wrote.\n\n“Look, I have worked at CBS News for 37 years, more than half of that at 60 Minutes, I have been shot at and threatened with jail for protecting a source. I have overseen more than 600 stories as Executive Producer of 60,” Owens added. “I know who I am and what I have don[e] to cover the most important stories of our time under difficult conditions.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced on Truth Social that CBS and its parent company had agreed to pay an additional $20 million on top of the $16 million they had already agreed to contribute toward his presidential library, bringing the total settlement to $36 million.\n\nCBS said it made cuts to shows like late-night host Stephen Colbert’s due to financial concerns. Skydance secured its acquisition of Paramount Global, which includes subsidiaries such as the CBS broadcast network, Paramount Pictures, and Nickelodeon. The official deal was made after Skydance pledged on Tuesday to do away with Paramount’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.\n\nIn a letter sent to Carr, the company vowed to dismantle all DEI initiatives in place, which comes after a slew of private companies have followed Trump’s executive order eliminating DEI policies at the federal level.\n\nUpon the announcement of the acquisition, Carr posted a statement to X, calling out how Americans “no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.”\n\n“It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” Carr wrote. “In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”\n\nIn addition to seeking to eliminate DEI policies, Skydance also committed to “addressing bias & restoring fact-based reporting” and “investing in trusted local news.”\n\n“These changes would represent an important step towards earning back Americans’ trust. Will be watching,” Carr wrote on X.\n\nCBS News and Simon did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In it, a Tennessee Democrat explains why he voted for Donald Trump in 2024, despite voting Democratic downballot. I’m sharing it with commentary because it offers a window into Trump’s enduring—and maddening—appeal.\n\n​​I voted for Trump in 2024, it took a lot in me to do it but I did it. I live in Nashville so I voted Trump up top and actually I voted blue all the way down, I am not a huge fan of Tennessee republicans. I find them too extreme, I would consider myself similar to a northeastern republican, or a 90s democrat.\nI voted the day of, I could’ve early voted but I chose not to because I just couldn’t decide what to do. I didn’t plan to vote for Harris for a variety of reasons that I’ll explain, but it was either Trump or 3rd party. The day of, I chose Trump.\n\nFirst of all, “90s Democrat” is basically code for “not woke.” I’ve written recently about how progressive buzzwords have been an electoral disaster for the left.\n\nI watched the debate between Trump and Harris, and just like most people thought, Trump absolutely got his ass beat by Harris. She came off strong, prepared, looked great up there but I just didn’t hear anything new that she was looking to bring to the table that were fresh ideas and she had been the VP for Joe and I wasn’t very happy with Joe Biden’s presidency in all honesty. Didn’t think it was awful, but it wasn’t great either.\n\nSo Kamala Harris had to bring “something new,” but Trump could recycle his failed first-term talking points? Trump’s always benefited from the bigotry of low expectations—and here it is on full display. Also, Biden wasn’t awful … so bring back the guy whose last presidency was?a\n\nWhen I watched the DNC, I didn’t really see much other than the party turning away from everyday citizens who are looking for a bright future and instead it seemed like DNC was open to big business and corporate donors. I’m all against political parties being bought and paid for so it turned me off to the democrats.\n\nThis sounds like someone getting their political news from Fox News or Facebook memes. The idea that the DNC is in bed with corporate donors—but the Republican convention wasn’t—is fantasy. For the record, the conventions’ fundraising weren’t that far off, with $95 million for Democrats and $85 million for Republicans. And, yes, Republicans took corporate money. Of course they did.\n\nNutirition is a huge thing for me, I felt RFK joining forces with Trump and talking about getting rid of nitrates, phosphates, corn syrups, seed oils…etc, and trying to reduce the cancer rates and going after corporations who are poisoning our foods everyday.\n\nImagine thinking Trump is going to “go after” corporations—unless they’re run by a liberal or said something mean about him. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? He’s a dangerous crank, plain and simple.\n\nI felt Trump would calm down the Ukraine/Russia conflict and Trump would use his relationship to Putin to basically say “stop this shit” and create a calmer world for us. Also would work to fix the debt this country is facing, lower inflation, transparency on Epstein files and bring plenty of jobs back to the US.\n\nTrump’s greatest power is that his followers believe his lies, dismiss his truths, and when there’s neither, they just make things up. He’s a tabula rasa for projection. This is exhibit A.\n\nHere’s where things went south:\nEpstein files, guy thinks we’re stupid. He campaigns on the Epstein files, realizes he’s on there and now is telling us to stop worrying about it and questioning why we’re still talking about it? Now they’re trying to deflect by talking about Obama. This is embarassing.\n\nThis guy isn’t MAGA, and to his credit, he says he’s going back to voting Democratic. But he’s right: the Epstein stuff is a genuine vulnerability for Trump. The more he tries to bury it, the more it feeds the narrative that he’s hiding something.\n\nGetting rid of the Dept of Education, I know he brought this up during his campaign but I thought he’d be sensible enough to work across the aisle with democrats on this matter but this is insane. He wanted to shut down the Dept of Education with no back up plan other than let the states figure it out. I don’t know if I necessarily trust republicans when it comes to education these days.\n\nTrump has never been sensible. He’s never worked with Democrats. Why would anyone think he’d start now?\n\nThis guy knew what Trump was promising. He doesn’t even trust Republicans on education. And yet he voted for Trump anyway. I can’t even.\n\n“The Big, Beautiful, Bill”, an abhorrently terrible bill that only helps people in the top tax brackets to save money on federal taxes that they don’t need. I make between 51k-100k and I would only save $800 on taxes but the highest tax brackets will save thousands. Why? I could use $5,000 back more than someone who owns a home or two. And the bottom bracket will pay more in taxes. This was by far the worst bill and it benefits the rich and not the working class, young people like myself who voted for Trump.\n\nYes, the GOP passed a tax bill for rich people. This is not a twist ending. This is the brand.\n\nTarrifs: wtf is this guy thinking other countries will pay more, we’re the ones having to foot the cost. This is making things more expensive for us and people up top brag the US has brought in higher amounts of revenue but it’s from our own people, not even other countries.\n\nTrump ran on this. He campaigned on it. Again, this guy wasn’t uninformed. So why the shock?\n\nImmigration: I’m a traveler, I’ve been to many countries and when you overstay your welcome, immigration will come to your door and ask you to leave so I get that. If you’re in this country and you’ve overstayed your visa, or are not documented, you have to head back and come back the right way. My dad is an immigrant, did all the right things and he’s here and can vote. It should be the same for everyone. BUT, when immigration is coming and going after citizens and not doing their due diligence and checking backgrounds and citizenship and they’re just assuming their illegal than that’s a massive red flag. Trump is basically telling these guys they have free will to do whatever and it’s messed up. Alligator Alcatraz and the living conditions there is ridiculous.\n\nEven this guy, who’s mostly supportive of immigration enforcement, recognizes how reckless Trump’s approach is. But he misses the core issue: The economy is heavily dependent on immigrant labor like construction, agriculture, and hospitality. Mass deportations are another inflationary time bomb.\n\nPolling shows growing support for immigrants, but much of that is just opposition to Trump’s policies, not a deeper ideological shift. The issue will continue to be a liability for Democrats. \n\nI will absolutely be voting all blue come the midterms and will be voting for a sensible democrat next election. This guy has ruined it for me.\n\nWe’re a 49-48 Democratic country. We don’t need to win over MAGA. But if we can peel off just 5 points—voters like this guy—we’re suddenly a 54-43 country. That flips more House and Senate seats, gives us cushion for midterms, and opens up red-leaning states to real competition.\n\nPeople like this guy—Democrats who flirted with Trump—are the lowest-hanging fruit. If there’s a silver lining to Trump’s disastrous presidency, it’s that some of them are now ready to come home.","summary":"This confessional was posted to Reddit’s r/centrist community.

Kaohly Vang Her, a former policy director for St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, is exploring a run for mayor and asking fellow lawmakers for their “support or neutrality,” according to political organizers with knowledge of her campaign. It’s a decision that would put her on a political collision course with her own former boss, a fellow DFLer.\n\nHer, 52, did not return calls Thursday or Friday, but others at St. Paul City Hall or with connections to state lawmakers said they were confident she was preparing to announce a mayoral run.\n\nGiven growing frustration with the many challenges facing the state’s capital city, Her isn’t the only candidate taking a run at the two-term incumbent mayor, who easily won his first two elections.\n\nThe filing period runs July 29 through Aug. 12, and Carter announced in January every intention of running again, despite some criticism he appears disconnected from City Hall. Carter on Friday evening said he was at City Hall daily and remained committed to his re-election campaign.\n\nDeclared mayoral candidates include Yan Chen, a Democrat and University of Minnesota biophysicist, and Mike Hilborn, a Republican business owner who runs a power-washing, Christmas tree lighting and snowplowing company. The St. Paul DFL, which is in the process of reconstituting itself, has opted not to endorse in the ranked-choice election, which is nonpartisan but typically draws strong party interest.\n\nVoters will rank candidates in order of preference, and there will be no political primary to pare the field.

She holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration and finance, as well as a master’s degree in business administration from Northeastern University.\n\nShe was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives representing District 64A — which spans the Union Park and Summit-University neighborhoods of St. Paul — in 2018 and won a fourth term in 2024. Among her first initiatives in office, she helped launch the first Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus at the state Capitol. She served as Carter’s policy director during his first term in office, from January 2018 through Sept. 10, 2021.\n\n“She does great work for St. Paul up at the statehouse, and Mayor Carter does terrific work for our city in the mayor’s office,” said City Council Member Saura Jost on Friday. “With that being said, I’ve already committed to supporting Mayor Carter for reelection.”\n\nInterim Council Member Matt Privratsky, recently appointed to the council by Carter, said he was “proud to support Melvin in his reelection.”\n\nThe five other council members and representatives for Carter could not be reached for comment Friday.\n\nVulnerable to a challenge\n\nCarter, 46, has said that with a child in kindergarten he has little interest in leaving St. Paul, but the mayor once was seen as a rising star within the Democratic Party and a potential candidate for a Washington appointment. That was before a rise in homelessness, homicides and carjackings early in the coronavirus pandemic, which sent remote workers away from a downtown already short on retail and commerce.\n\nThe mayor noted the city led the nation last year in reducing auto thefts and has kept homicide numbers this year down in the single digits, a major turnaround not seen in every large city.\n\nCarter moved his family a few years ago to a house at the city’s eastern edges, closer to suburban Maplewood and Woodbury than the embattled Midway or the Rondo neighborhood where he grew up.\n\n“I’m on the East Side, not the suburbs,” Carter said Friday. “I’m in my old neighborhood every day visiting my parents.”\n\nWhen former Vice President Kamala Harris lost her presidential bid in November, the chance of Carter being called to Washington fizzled, as did funding and backing for many of the city’s progressive priorities, from social spending to EV charging stations and geothermal heating.\n\nNo matter who is elected mayor, St. Paul will be left with no allies in the White House and a dwindling number at the Minnesota Capitol, where lawmakers declined to fund a new arena at Grand Casino Arena (formerly the Xcel Energy Center) for the Minnesota Wild and offered the city limited other new benefits in the last legislative session.\n\nIf anything, the Carter administration has at times appeared at loggerheads with state Rep. Maria Isa Perez-Vega, chair of St. Paul’s House delegation, who has complained of not having calls returned.\n\n“I’m not voting for him a third time,” said Steve Subera, a product marketer from St. Paul, in response to an inquiry about the mayor on social media. “The downtown (situation) is on his watch. Grand Casino Arena is in limbo and it doesn’t appear he has any influence with (state Sen. Sandy) Pappas or Perez-Vega.”\n\nRelations between Carter’s office and the City Council appear equally up-and-down. The mayor’s office last year spent weeks, if not months, in a budget battle with the council, leading to a series of line-item budget vetoes by the mayor and an attempted last-minute budget override by the council.\n\nWith two 2025 city budgets on the table, it was unclear to many observers which one had legal sticking power through the first months of the year. Following that and other bruising political fights, Council President Mitra Jalali — who was mostly seen as sympathetic to the mayor — resigned in March.\n\nCity struggles\n\nOther problems are mounting in the city.\n\nCarter once spoke glowingly of getting upstream of crime through better street lighting, increased library access and free youth activities through the city’s many recreation centers.\n\nThen the price of metal went up, as did the cost of everything else, and an epidemic in stolen copper wire left sections of the city bathed in darkness as street lights went cold, and repairing them has been a struggle. A new state law has taken a major bite out of wire thefts, the mayor noted.\n\nIn January 2023, a city rec center staffer shot a teen in the head, and the location was closed for weeks.\n\nRun-ins between library workers and aggressive visitors, some of them homeless and on drugs, have forced security changes. The Rondo Community Library on Dale Street now closes at 2 p.m. on Saturdays and entirely on Sundays. Workers and patrons say the library’s proximity to a Green Line light rail station hasn’t helped. The train, once heralded as a potential engine for economic development, now is viewed as a liability even by some fans of public transit.\n\nHomicide and carjacking numbers have fallen considerably since the height of the pandemic. Still, demographic projections forecast sluggish population growth in St. Paul in the years ahead, a trend reflected in lackluster apartment construction over the past few years. Entire office buildings and even some apartment buildings in downtown St. Paul sit vacant, or have fallen into foreclosure, as major tenants such as Wold Architects and the TKDA engineering firm have fled westward to Minneapolis and Bloomington.\n\nProperty tax increases have left many homeowners reeling. The city lost its last downtown grocery store — Lunds & Byerlys — in March, and Cub Foods is leaving Aug. 2 after 30 years in the Midway.\n\nSocial media reaction\n\nFor some voters, enough is enough. When questioned about the mayor’s prospects for reelection, users of the social media platform Bluesky offered a wide range of responses:\n\n“I’m a lifelong Democrat. I’ll never vote for Mayor Carter again,” wrote one Bluesky user. “I’ve sent his office questions about problems in Lowertown and was met with no response. I followed up. No response. Too many Democratic leaders in St Paul feel ‘safe’ so they ignore what they don’t care about. They ignore citizens.”\n\nOthers aren’t so sure. “I have a hard time getting a read on him as a mayor because the city council is comically ineffective, so he spends a good chunk of time/effort dealing with that,” wrote another social media user. “I would like to see him at least challenged, though. Downtown is in terrible shape.”\n\nSome praised the mayor for working with St. Paul police to focus on nonfatal shootings, an approach that appears to have helped St. Paul temper but not entirely eliminate shooting deaths.\n\nCarter “worked WITH police to change tactics and clear more non-murder shootings to reduce the overall number of homicides,” wrote a Carter supporter on the Bluesky platform. The police “chief even credits the progressive Dem. Imagine that!”\n\nOther social media users noted urban areas across the country have suffered in the era of remote work, high housing costs and online retail, and St. Paul’s challenges are not unique or attributable to one person or political party.\n\n“The issues downtown aren’t the mayor’s fault — they’re the result of major shifts beyond the city’s ability to control,” wrote a Bluesky user. “I think he’s done good work so far, and rehabilitating downtown will take decades, not years. I like the way he’s steered policy with a practical but reliably liberal approach.”\n\n“I don’t blame a mayor for condemned buildings and low office occupancy post-Covid,” wrote another user. “But I do like how he explains his fiscal policies and budget, and supports creative solutions to complex community issues.”\n\n“All the problems that St. Paul has will require time, money and effort to fix and I think he’s still the best person for it,” said yet another Bluesky user. “A candidate that promises an overnight solution isn’t serious and he’s never been that guy, in my opinion. He’s got the right focus and values. Let him cook, as they say.”\n\nSaid another user, “I’m alright with the mayor, but I think a good challenger might bring good policy ideas into the foreground. I don’t want an incumbent to ever take things for granted and not try things or play it safe, and a candidate that addresses housing, or downtown, with actual policy ideas would be good.”","summary":"Mayor Melvin Carter's former policy director is gauging support for a run at the two-term incumbent.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/07/25/is-carter-vulnerable-state-rep-kaohly-vang-her-explores-run-for-st-paul-mayor/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-Legislature-007.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 23:49:03","author":"Frederick Melo","authors":["Frederick Melo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.119},{"id":345327208,"title":"Top Democratic leaders encourage young people to engage in politics (Video)","text":"Some top Democratic leaders are encouraging younger generations to get involved in politics.

The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher.\n\nIt has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders.\n\nSkydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president.\n\nCBS News’ trajectory will be scrutinized\n\nAfter the merger’s Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump’s complaint that last fall’s “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal.\n\nThe appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.”\n\nDays before the FCC’s vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.\n\nThe role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet’s work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said.\n\nHaving the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist’s work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said.\n\nCarr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America’s trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists.\n\n“They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don’t want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.”\n\nHow the merger could ripple out across Paramount properties\n\nAccording to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor’s study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday.\n\nColbert’s slow-motion firing — he’ll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television’s collapsing economics.

To be fair, a journalist’s work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said.\n\nCarr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America’s trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists.\n\n“They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don’t want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.”\n\nHow the merger could ripple out across Paramount properties\n\nAccording to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor’s study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday.\n\nColbert’s slow-motion firing — he’ll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television’s collapsing economics. Colbert’s relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives.\n\n“Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. “Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?”\n\nStewart’s profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year.\n\nIn an odd way, Comedy Central’s “South Park” buttresses CBS’ claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert’s show doesn’t do nearly as well.\n\nFiguring out what to do with others at Paramount’s cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\n“There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount’s growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.”\n\nThe merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry’s top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006.\n\nEllison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount’s market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser.\n\nTo revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content.\n\nAP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The nod from the FCC paves the way for the imminent closure of the $8 billion deal. In the past few days, it was revealed that Skydance Media, through its lead attorney, made several concessions to the FCC to obtain the green light for the merger. This includes committing to install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias or other concerns” at CBS News. The company also confirmed that Paramount eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThese concessions follow the $16 million settlement reached by Paramount Global with President Donald Trump over a lawsuit filed in 2024, which accused CBS News of “deceitful” editing during a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President and then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFamine concern: BBC News—alongside other major news agencies including the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse—issued a joint statement addressing a potential famine situation that could impact journalists covering the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).\n\nUnlike the two House Democrats, Harris chose not to give her remarks in person.\n\n“Keep building your political power, keep building community, keep building coalitions, keep challenging the status quo,” she said to the group gathered in the nation’s capital.\n\n“And born out of our love for our country, keep fighting to build a country and a nation. That works for everyone. And I look forward to continuing in the fight alongside you. You take care.”\n\nVoters of Tomorrow senior director Kaya Jones had preceded Harris in the line-up and suggested actions by the Republican-held White House and Congress had taken a toll on youth organizing.\n\n“The last few months have been really rough, and, um, yeah, let’s just pause for that,” she said, leading to a brief moment of silence.\n\nHarris struck a similar tone in her remarks, saying: “Your generation has grown up on the front lines of so many crises — from COVID and the climate crisis to gun violence and mental health.”\n\n“It is critically important that we have organizations such as this who understand that we must be intentional about lifting up our young leaders and encouraging your ambition,” she added.\n\nAfter a landslide loss to Trump in 2024, Harris pledged in her concession speech to “never give up the fight” — but has yet to indicate whether she will enter the California governor’s race next year or the presidential contest in 2028.\n\n“On the campaign, I would often say, ‘When we, fight, we win.’ But here’s the thing: Sometimes the fight takes a while.

Now what?","text":"After finally getting approval from the Federal Communications Commission, Skydance Media is just weeks away from completing its $8-billion merger with Paramount Global, leading to sweeping changes for some of the most iconic media brands. CBS, MTV Networks and Paramount Pictures are all bracing for upheaval when Larry Ellison and his son, David, take the keys from Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. The long-running ownership saga has played out while the rules of the media industry have been upended by streaming and, more recently, a White House unafraid to use its muscle to silence critics. Skydance and its backer, RedBird Capital Partners, have promised investors that it will find $2 billion in cost savings, which means further belt-tightening and layoffs. \"This will be the most dramatic change to the organization since its inception,\" said one longtime CBS insider who was not authorized to comment publicly. Here is what Wall Street and the media industry will be watching for once the deal closes on Aug. 7: Last year, Paramount+ added 10 million new subscribers to reach 77.5 million. Its subscriber count is now 79 million, thanks also to NFL programming, CBS shows such as “NCIS” and original hits including \"1923,\" \"Landman,\" \"Lioness\" and \"Tulsa King.\" Paramount has projected full-year U.S. profitability for Paramount+ this year, making it one of the fastest subscription services to get there. But its relatively scant resources and thinner slate has made it difficult to truly compete with Netflix and the other biggest players. One potential solution: partnering with a rival streamer to increase its reach. \"Questions around the long-term scalability of Parmamount+ continue to loom large,\" analyst firm MoffettNathanson noted in a report Friday. \"Will the new management team pursue external partnerships as a viable path forward?\" Ellison and his team have suggested that they will bring a tech-focused sensibility to Paramount. Technological prowess would help Paramount+ improve its user interface and recommendation process, which insiders acknowledge is currently underwhelming. As expected, the architect of Paramount+ original series strategy, Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy, will leave when the deal closes. Analysts also want to see Skydance will increase investment in film and TV franchises to revive assets that have been constrained by Paramount's debt. While Skydance will get a robust library of films and TV shows, it will also be faced with the slow-melting iceberg that is broadcast and cable TV, which continues to lose viewers. Streaming has surpassed broadcast and cable as the leading source of video consumption just as Skydance takes over CBS and Paramount Global's array of channels that include MTV, BET and Comedy Central. Doug Creutz, an analyst for TD Cowen, believes the merged company should consider spinning off traditional TV businesses, similar to what Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast are doing with their cable channels. Whether that will happen remains to be seen. \"There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,\" Creutz wrote Friday. \"On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.\" A test of Skydance's commitment to broadcast may come if the FCC relaxes TV station ownership rules, which would likely lead to consolidation. CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" received a vote of confidence with the naming of Tanya Simon, a respected veteran insider to take over as executive producer. She was the choice of the program's strong-willed correspondents. Simon's appointment is expected to provide stability following the departure of longtime showrunner Bill Owens, who was forced out amid the push for a $16-million settlement over President Trump's lawsuit claiming the program deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to make her look better to voters. \"60 Minutes\" remained tough in its White House coverage as negotiations went on. The question is whether that approach will continue with new owners. Larry Ellison has a friendly relationship with the president, and the new owners agreed to appoint an ombudsman to oversee news coverage. Getting it right matters from a business perspective too, as \"60 Minutes\" remains the most profitable program on CBS. With Simon in place, new management is expected to address other areas of the news division that can use improvement. The network's revamp of the \"CBS Evening News\" has been a disappointment in the ratings and will likely see some changes. In the longer term, there has been chatter that Skydance may set its sights on acquiring CNN from Warner Bros. Discovery and combining it with the broadcast news operation, an idea that has been considered numerous times over the last few decades. CBS canceled \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" upsetting his fans, progressive Democratic legislators and other late-night hosts who make their living lampooning President Trump. The network said it was strictly a business decision, as the younger viewers who made late-night TV monstrously lucrative for decades are no longer showing up. The timing of the move made the company look as if it were capitulating to Trump, who long had the host on his enemies list. But Colbert will remain on the air through May. The show has already been sold to advertisers for next season. The host has remained unrelenting in his mockery of Trump. The season premiere of \"South Park\" only upped the ante. The animated series made references to the \"60 Minutes\" deal, showed Trump in bed with the devil and aired its own version of a Trump-mandated PSA, showing a naked president with talking genitalia. There is no question both shows will test the patience of the new owners. Pulling Colbert off or censoring the \"South Park\" creators, who just received a $1.5-billion deal to continue their show and move its library to Paramount+, would lead to a far greater backlash than what has been seen so far. Any attempt to curtail their voices will send a negative message to creative types who consider working with the company's movie and TV operations going forward. Over the last few years, Paramount Pictures — home of franchises such as “Transformers” and “Mission: Impossible” — has ranked either fifth or fourth at the domestic box office. So far this year, the lone major movie studio still located in Hollywood proper has accounted for about 7% of ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada, according to box office website the Numbers. Since the pandemic, the company has enjoyed a number of major hits, including “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3.” It has also had some solid singles and doubles, including “Bob Marley: One Love.” But overall, the more-than-century-old studio has struggled from underinvestment in its intellectual property and movie brands. The latest “Mission: Impossible” starring Tom Cruise — the eighth and purportedly last in the series — grossed $589 million globally but cost $300 million to $400 million to make, not including marketing costs. Paramount's latest effort, an animated “Smurfs” reboot, sputtered at the box office. Next up: a reboot of “The Naked Gun.” The unit’s leader, Brian Robbins (also head of Nickelodeon at Paramount Global), is expected to leave the studio, though he has not officially announced his plans. David Ellison is a movie fan and is expected to take a particular interest in the operation, with plans to put Skydance’s chief creative officer, Dana Goldberg, in charge of film at Paramount. Skydance has worked with Paramount on movies before, producing “Maverick” and the “Missions: Impossible” films A transfer of ownership means the NFL can reopen its long-term deal with CBS, which has a Sunday package of games, the AFC Championship Game and two Super Bowls. The NFL is the lifeblood of broadcast television, providing a vast majority of the year's most-watched programs. Without the NFL, CBS would face tremendous challenges in getting fees from pay TV operators who carry its stations. Revenue from affiliates who pay the network for its programming would also dramatically decline. Although the NFL is known for taking a pound of flesh at every opportunity, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has signaled he will give careful consideration before making any changes. \"We've had a long relationship with CBS for decades and we also have a relationship outside of that with Skydance,\" Goodell told CNBC earlier this month. \"We have a two-year period to make that decision. I don't see that happening, but we have the option and it's something we're going to look at.\" The NFL could wait until 2029 when it has the option to open up the contract with all of its media partners. The new media deal for the NBA — $76 billion over 11 years — has the NFL believing its pact is underpriced.

Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, disputed that characterisation.\n\n“There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in,” Cheung wrote on social media. “They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.”\n\nThe back-and-forth escalated when 60 Minutes aired two different cuts from its interview with Harris.\n\nOne version, which aired on a sister programme, Face The Nation, featured more of Harris’s answer about her stance towards Israel. The other version, which aired on the 60 Minutes broadcast, was shorter.\n\nTrump called the different edits evidence of deceptive reporting tactics and filed a lawsuit against Paramount, CBS’s parent company.\n\n“CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” his court filing alleged.\n\n“That is false,” 60 Minutes responded in a statement on its website.\n\n“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”\n\nWhile many media experts expected Paramount to prevail on the merits of the case, the company instead sought to negotiate an end to the matter. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $16m to Trump to go towards his future presidential library.\n\nShortly thereafter, another top CBS show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, revealed it had been cancelled, allegedly for financial reasons.\n\nBut the timing and unexpected nature of the cancellation drew speculation that it might have been an attempt to appease Trump and streamline the merger, given the fact that Colbert frequently lambasted the Republican president on his show.\n\nTrump himself posted on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nThe Late Show was consistently the top-rated late-night comedy show, and it had won a Peabody Award and multiple Emmy nods.\n\nDays later, on July 22, Trump called for more comedians to be ousted, writing, “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”\n\nThat same day, he confirmed he received the $16m for his 60 Minutes settlement, adding that he expected to be receive an additional $20m in free advertising and programming from the “new owners”.\n\nSouth Park TV show takes aim\n\nWithin weeks of both the 60 Minutes lawsuit settlement and the cancellation of The Late Show, the FCC gave its blessing to the merger between Paramount and Skydance.\n\nUnder the merger, Skydance founder David Ellison, the son of Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, is slated to helm operations.\n\nUpon the merger’s approval, Trump’s appointee to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, released a statement echoing some of the president’s criticisms of major news outlets.\n\nHe also hinted that the merger would result in changes to CBS’s news output.\n\n“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcasting network.”\n\n“In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”\n\nTo ensure compliance with that commitment, Carr said an ombudsman would be appointed to the media giant for a period of at least two years.\n\nCarr added that the merger between Skydance and Paramount would also bar the new mega-company from implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, which are designed to create an equal playing field for people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion or ability.\n\nBut the merger did not put an end to the scrutiny of Trump on Paramount platforms.\n\nHours after the FCC granted its approval, the TV channel Comedy Central aired an episode of the animated series South Park that mocked President Trump and satirised its parent company’s $16m settlement.\n\nIn one scene, an animated Jesus attempts to warn the show’s characters about Trump.\n\n“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” the animated Jesus says. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?”\n\nThe Trump administration has since blasted the show as irrelevant.","summary":"The merger has faced scrutiny for what critics view as capitulations to Donald Trump, including a $16m settlement.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/25/with-trump-go-ahead-skydance-and-paramount-to-complete-merger-in-august?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-24T225550Z_724683082_RC27RBACZYM8_RTRMADP_3_PARAMOUNT-GLOBAL-SKYDANCE-FCC-1753477479.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 22:26:36","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.336},{"id":345316966,"title":"FCC chairman assigns 'bias monitor' to CBS — who reports 'directly to the president'","text":"As part of its agreement to allow an $8 billion merger between media conglomerates Skydance and Paramount, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has assigned a government monitor to CBS (which is owned by Paramount) to rein in perceived \"bias\" against President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nTech outlet Gizmodo reported Friday on an interview FCC chairman Brendan Carr gave to far-right, pro-Trump network Newsmax, in which he gave new details on the conditions the administration imposed in its green-lighting of the merger.

While the Trump administration was considering whether to approve the proposed merger, Paramount settled Trump's lawsuit against CBS for $16 million over its \"60 Minutes\" interview with 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nSeveral days after late night host Stephen Colbert criticized the settlement, CBS announced it was cancelling his show in May of 2026, at the conclusion of the current broadcast season.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. I would like to talk a little bit about the strange, bizarre, endless, run-on, crazy interview that Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden’s son, gave with Andrew Callaghan, a so-called Generation Z internet influencer. \n\nIn this long interview, it was a spirited defense of his father, claiming that he was not demented at all, that he was in full control of his faculties, and he had a wonderful administration, and he was unfortunately aborted, kicked out, deposed by a sinister array of characters, whom he accused of being incompetent.\n\nSo he attacked George Clooney, who had written a letter about, in an op-ed about Joe Biden’s cognitive problems. He went after David Axelrod, who was also an advocate of removing Biden and putting in then-Vice President Kamala Harris, said his only claim to fame is he won one election. That’s kind of true, in the case of former President Barack Obama. And as Hunter said, Obama was the reason he was elected, not Axelrod. He went after James Carville. He went after Jake Tapper. He went after the entire Democratic establishment.\n\nBut what was very strange about what he did, he revealed himself. He attacked grifters in the Democratic Party that made a lot of money. That’s what he did. He said, “These people were unethical.” That’s what he was. \n\nRemember, he was a tax cheat. He never reported, fully, the income that he made by trading off his father’s name. He never truly gave us the full account of the Biden consortium—what his uncle, aunt, cousins, what they were actually doing to get such an enormous amount of money. He never explained why he accepted a pardon from his father. He never explained why his father actually signed his pardon, in opposition to what he did with everybody else, almost, with an autopen.\n\nAnd then it got very bizarre. He never mentioned that he had dated his brother’s widow and got her hooked on dangerous drugs. In fact, when he mentioned drugs, I thought he might refer to the cocaine that was found in a mail slot in the West Wing. He didn’t. Instead, he gave a defense of cocaine and suggested it’s not nearly as toxic as alcohol.\n\nWhen he was asked about the laptop—and remember the laptop was in the possession of the FBI for one year and they authenticated it as genuine, and they knew it was genuine. At the same time, they kept silent when “51 intelligence authorities” lied to the American people. And Joe Biden used that lie in the second debate of the 2020 campaign to say that Donald Trump was lying, that this laptop “had all the earmarks of Russian” information efforts—meaning “disinformation.” \n\nHe didn’t mention any of that. In fact, he just said about the laptop—in which he is seen using drugs, he’s in pornographic poses, but most importantly, he references his father as “the big guy” and “the 10% guy,” and he laments that he is the bagman for the family. \n\nIt’s very incriminating. But he doesn’t—as he has before—he has never denied that it was his. He never denies it’s his. He just says, “It’s irrelevant. If anybody had a laptop and you looked into it, all kinds of stuff would come out.”\n\nHe doesn’t talk about his art, that con where he was doodling and blowing paint on through his nose and then hawking that art to buyers, who wanted influence with his father. \n\nHis protestations that his father was heroic, that he was one of the best Democratic senators we’ve had, that his presidency was a smashing success are laughable.\n\nSo what am I getting at? What I’m getting at is this: It’s very dangerous to think that for four years we had a president who was mentally challenged, cognitively disabled, suffering dementia. And the close circle around them—whether they were former Obama operatives or Biden senatorial family, or his own real family—that these people were running the country. \n\nAnd the last year or two, if you look at photographs, videos of Biden giving a speech, Biden traveling, there’s one constant. It’s Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden was his eyes and his ears. And he was a close—and maybe the closest—adviser to his father.\n\nAnd after listening to that video, you can appreciate just how close we came to utter chaos and disruption, that a mentally challenged president and his addicted son had the most power of anybody in the entire world and were running this government with the help of who knows who. We have no idea.\n\nBottom line, if you listen to even a clip of that interview, it’s frightening that this man was anywhere near the presidency. And how he got near the presidency and how the president was the president is a scandal in itself of historical proportions.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see...

No, It’s Not Elon Musk.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis week has demonstrated that the tech “broligarch” who’s most influenced President Donald Trump’s second administration isn’t Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, or Marc Andreessen—it’s Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the 80-year-old software tycoon who recently became the second-richest man in the world.\n\nJust look at everything that’s gone his way. On Thursday evening, the Federal Communications Commission finally voted to approve Paramount’s $8.4 billion merger with fellow entertainment firm Skydance Media. The controversial, long-awaited deal only came about thanks to Paramount’s appeals to this administration: settling a baseless lawsuit that Trump brought against 60 Minutes for “deceptively” editing its Kamala Harris interview, pressuring subsidiary CBS News to shift its “balance” in a right-wing direction, and canceling presidential foe and beloved comedian Stephen Colbert’s highly rated late-night talk show.\n\nOf note: Skydance is owned by Ellison’s son, David, who personally met with both Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr to get the deal done. The elder Ellison is covering most of the cash to close the Skydance-Paramount merger, which will give him significant control over the new company and a chance to carry out, as he detailed in federal filings, a wholesale transformation of CBS in his vision—including broadcasts of complimentary PSAs for Trump administration initiatives.\n\nWhen Carr announced the merger approval, he positively affirmed “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the impending hire of an “ombudsman” who’ll monitor CBS News broadcasts for “bias” as the overall company slashes its diversity, equity, and inclusion guidelines. Said Trump himself of his “friend” Larry Ellison: “I think he’s going to run CBS really well, and I think he’s making a good deal to buy it.”\n\nThrough this brazenly corrupt arrangement, the U.S. president has granted one of his pals uninhibited control over a longtime bastion of mainstream, fact-based news, which he openly intends to bend toward his conservative vision. And that’s just one of the ways Trump is helping Larry Ellison become the most powerful and not-so-secretly influential tech mogul in the country.\n\nOracle, which Larry still runs as chief technology officer and board chairman, is also in talks with David Ellison’s Skydance for a major deal that would see the latter pay the former $100 million a year to run all of Paramount’s tech through Oracle’s valuable cloud-computing software. Skydance already pays Oracle $2.2 million a year for its cloud and platform products, and the FCC explicitly signed off on David Ellison’s plan to run all of Paramount’s and Skydance’s on the same cloud tech, which will happen to be provided by Oracle. In addition, David promised to improve the recommendation algorithms on Paramount+ through artificial intelligence—a type of tech that Oracle specializes in. Larry himself even appeared at the White House in January for Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion A.I.-investment initiative known as Project Stargate, which enlists Oracle to build out masses of data centers across Texas.\n\nThere are other ways Trump is ensuring that Ellison benefits from the A.I. race. The day before the FCC approved Skydance-Paramount, the president hosted a kickoff event at the White House for his AI Action Plan, a new federal framework for tech regulation (or lack thereof). Much of the plan reads like a Christmas gift list for Larry Ellison and Oracle in particular, including overriding environmental protections to construct those Stargate-style A.I. data-center campuses, prioritizing contracts with “free speech”–focused A.I. firms like Elon Musk’s xAI (in which Ellison and Oracle are both invested), integrating A.I. infrastructure into the Pentagon, and centralizing the government’s massive data sets (a special focus of Oracle’s).\n\nFurther, the Trump administration’s plans for undermining China’s A.I. ambitions also involve kowtowing to Ellison—by using him to force some American control over TikTok.\n\nThe megapopular video app has been a motif in the Trump-Ellison relationship for a while now. In 2020, when Trump first demanded that TikTok be banned from American app stores until it found a U.S.-based buyer, Ellison placated the president by fundraising for his reelection campaign. Trump then blessed Oracle as the rightful leader of a new “TikTok Global” entity that, in partnership with Walmart and other American investors, would move the app’s infrastructure stateside and relegate TikTok’s parent company, China’s Bytedance, to minority-owner status. That was all scuttled when Joe Biden won the fall election and took a different approach to the platform.\n\nBut, ever since Trump returned to office, he’s been eager to get a TikTok deal done, even though negotiations have dragged on long past his own self-imposed deadlines. Through it all, Ellison has again remained by his side, with Oracle consistently being named as the owner-in-waiting for a U.S.-controlled TikTok, in spite of Bytedance’s denials. Such a transaction would likely force the app to divest its powerful “secret sauce” algorithm and China-based data servers—meaning that Oracle would gain control over the newly customized A.I. and data systems for American TikTok. Notably, the platform already stores a lot of user data in Oracle’s Texas-based servers, but an out-and-out sale would mean that foreign users’ TikTok data would no longer be housed with Oracle. American TikTok’s American algorithm will be trained by American user data.\n\nFrom that perspective, you can view the AI Action Plan with its emphasis on “American AI” as yet another blessing for Ellison’s TikTok ambitions. Furthermore, you can view all these developments as a direct payoff for Ellison for his longtime investment in Trump. Not least since Ellison remains Oracle’s largest shareholder—and Oracle’s stock value has been popping thanks to the Trump White House’s favorable A.I. regulations and deals. That stock jump is a big factor in why Ellison has become the second-wealthiest person in the world.\n\nIt’s also worth emphasizing that Larry Ellison’s journey to this level of wealth and power—both political and cultural—would not have happened had he not solidified his relationship with Trump long before any of these other tech CEOs came to embrace him. (Peter Thiel is perhaps the sole exception here.) After Donald Trump was first elected president in 2016, Oracle CEO Safra Catz joined the executive committee for Trump’s transition team and occasionally advised him during that first term, while still working with Ellison. In November 2020, after Ellison’s prior fundraisers failed to boost Trump to reelection, the tech titan joined a group call with Sean Hannity and Sen. Lindsey Graham, among others, to discuss how to contest the election results. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, Oracle’s political action committee pledged to no longer back the politicians who’d objected to the Electoral College’s certification of Biden’s victory—only to quickly turn on that promise during the 2022 midterms, when it backed election deniers like Reps. Steve Scalise, Jim Banks, Jim Jordan, Ralph Norman, and Darrell Issa. That same year, Ellison also invested in Musk’s far-right Twitter takeover.\n\nIn addition, the multibillionaire began positioning himself closer to Mar-a-Lago, investing amply in a small island town close to Trump’s Florida residence and transforming it into a hub for the country’s wealthiest to congregate. As such, although he initially backed Sen. Tim Scott for the 2024 GOP nomination, it was easy for Ellison to begin dining with Trump again as the ex-president’s candidacy seemed assured—and for Oracle to begin working with the Heritage Foundation to compile a database of potential Trump appointees who’d be unfailingly loyal. Ellison also joined the Silicon Valley adviser army that descended upon Mar-a-Lago when Trump won reelection, then went on to cheer Musk’s DOGE rampage and propose that all “national data” be put into a singular database that would feed an A.I. model—a vision that may be in reach thanks to the action plan, whose data-concentration goals would build upon DOGE’s addition of A.I. to various government functions.\n\nNow, just six months into Trump’s term, Ellison has procured for himself a sweeping empire, ruling over acres’ worth of A.I. infrastructure, gaining a megasized media arm for himself via Paramount-Skydance, potentially winning another powerful media apparatus with TikTok, and seeing his own ideologies and goals reflected by a friendly White House. The Trump 2.0 era has been spectacular for “one rich asshole called Larry Ellison”—mostly because he’s done so much to shape it.","summary":"With the Paramount-Skydance merger approved by the FCC, Larry Ellison just showed the world who is the real shot caller in the White House.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/07/larry-ellison-donald-trump-paramount-skydance-merger.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/8ae37f84-a7db-494b-b3d0-dbc1f8dfa9ce.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 21:50:03","author":"Nitish Pahwa","authors":["Nitish Pahwa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.196}]}
