Much of that has to do with a struggling economy, he says.\n\n\"A lot of people who supported Trump were not expecting this to happen,\" said Hernandez, 64.\n\nGrocery prices are high, suppliers are charging more and laborers are leaving as the Trump administration intensifies its deportation push.\n\nNow, state Republicans are moving Hernandez's south central Texas community into a new congressional district as part of a controversial mid-decade redistricting effort designed to grow the size of their delegation in the U.S. House. It's a move that became official on Friday, when Gov. Greg Abbott signed the new map into law.\n\nAt the center of the GOP redistricting plan is a high-stakes bet that the new map will boost the party's chances of keeping control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. The effort has triggered a redistricting arms race of sorts, as Democrats in California have moved to redraw their maps, with other states expected to follow.\n\nIn Texas, where Republicans made big inroads with Hispanic voters in last year's election, the party is hoping those gains can be locked in for good. The new Texas map adds five districts that are expected to be safe Republican seats.\n\nFour of those seats are Hispanic-majority, testing the GOP's gains with the state's largest demographic group.\n\nA Democrat, Hernandez questions whether Latinos who voted Republican last year, including his own relatives, will stay loyal to Trump.\n\n\"Hispanics, whether they're my own family, or non-family members that supported Trump, they saw it as good for the economy, but I don't see any benefits,\" he said.\n\nParty leaders are more confident. Longtime Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn likes to brag on his party's gains with Latino voters.\n\n\"President Trump won a substantial increase in the vote of the Hispanic population,\" Cornyn said during a campaign stop at an Abilene, Texas technical school this week, roughly 300 miles from Seguin.\n\nIn last year's election, Trump came within striking distance of winning a majority of Hispanic voters nationwide, taking 48% of the vote to Kamala Harris' 51%. For Trump, it was a sharp uptick from the 36% share he won in 2020.\n\n\"As Democrats at the national level become more and more radical, and more and more extreme, I think more Hispanics are looking to Republican candidates to vote,\" Cornyn said.\n\nBut Texas Democratic congressman Greg Casar disagrees. During his campaign launch this week from a downtown Austin building, he said Republicans will lose Latino voters.\n\nCasar is running to represent a shrinking blue dot in Austin under the new Texas map in a redrawn 37th congressional district. His old 35th congressional district will shift south to a four-county area that includes Seguin. It will be 60% Latino.\n\n\"I've already heard from south Texas Democratic elected officials, who are looking to run in that south Texas District, and I look forward to supporting them,\" he said.\n\nUniversity of Houston politics professor Brandon Rottinghaus says history may not be on Democrats' side, noting the party effectively lost control of the state in the 1990s.\n\n\"The effort here seems to be to make Democrats be exclusively an urban party,\" Rottinghaus said. \"The districts that Republicans are drawing to try to maximize their gains include suburban areas, exurban areas and rural areas,\" he said.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the Republican gerrymander will play out that way, at least in the near term.\n\nPolls show Latinos who voted for the GOP are turning against Trump over the economy and deportations. Roughly a third of Latinos who supported Trump last year \"are not set on voting for a Republican\" during next year's midterms, according to Equis Research, a Latino polling organization.\n\nThat could make the new maps riskier for Republicans than they think.\n\n\"This is what some people call a dummymander,\" Rottinghaus said. You \"inadvertently draw a map that ends up hurting.\"\n\nThe shifting landscape poses a critical test for Republicans. The new GOP map could solidify the party's grip on Texas for years to come, especially if Democrats struggle to win back Latino voters who were once solidly in their camp.\n\nBack in Seguin, Hernandez says Democrats have taken Texas Latino voters for granted. Now, he argues, Republicans have given them a new opening, and his party needs to ramp up their game.\n\n\"If Republicans weren't worried, they wouldn't be doing all this redistricting,\" he said. \"I think Democrats need to wake up and be active and vote.\"","summary":"President Trump and Republicans made big inroads with Hispanic voters in Texas last year.

But then-President Joe Biden quietly signed a directive, at Harris’ request, that had extended protection for her beyond the traditional six months, according to another person familiar with the matter. The people insisted on anonymity to discuss a matter not made public.\n\nTrump, a Republican, defeated Harris, a Democrat, in the presidential election last year.\n\nHis move to drop Harris’ Secret Service protection comes as the former vice president, who became the Democratic nominee last summer after a chaotic series of events that led to Biden dropping out of the contest, is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The tour has 15 stops, including visits abroad to London and Toronto. The book, which refers to the historically short length of her presidential campaign, will be released Sept. 23, and the tour begins the following day.\n\nA recent threat intelligence assessment the Secret Service conducts on those it protects, such as Harris, found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president, said a White House official who also insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration found no reason Harris’ protection should go beyond the standard six-month period for former vice presidents, the official said.\n\nTrump’s vice president from his first term, Mike Pence, did not have extended Secret Service protection beyond the standard six months.\n\nStill, it is not unusual for Secret Service protection to continue well beyond the statutory six-month window, particularly when former officials face credible and ongoing threats. But Trump’s decisions to revoke the protection have stood out both for timing and for targets.\n\nDuring Trump’s second presidency, he repeatedly has cut off security for adversaries and figures who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and members of Biden’s family, including the former president’s adult children. Outgoing presidents can extend protection for those who might otherwise not be eligible; Trump did so for his family after leaving office in 2021.\n\nThe decision to strip Harris of protection is certain to raise alarms among security experts who view continuity of protection as essential in a polarized climate.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said an executive memorandum was issued Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security ending Harris’ security detail and security services. Those had been extended from six to 18 months by the Biden administration, so they would have ended in July 2026, but now they will be terminated on Monday.\n\nHarris lives in the Los Angeles area. The city’s Democratic mayor, Karen Bass, called Trump’s decision “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation” and warned that it would endanger Harris. Bass said she plans to work with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, to ensure the former vice president’s safety, and she and Harris have already been in touch about the issue, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nWhile she lost to Trump last November, Harris is seen as a potential candidate for 2028, and she has already announced she will not run for California governor in 2026. Harris is also a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney.\n\nLast year was a particularly politically charged environment with Trump facing two assassination attempts, and the Secret Service played a crucial role in protecting the now-president. While questions remain about how the agency prepared for a July 2024 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a Secret Service counter sniper shot a gunman dead after he fired eight shots, killing an attendee, wounding two others and grazing Trump’s right ear. Trump chose one of the agents who rushed to the stage to shield him, Sean Curran, to lead the agency earlier this year.\n\nThe news of the security revocation was first reported by CNN.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But then-President Joe Biden quietly signed a directive, at Harris’ request, that had extended protection for her beyond the traditional six months, according to another person familiar with the matter. The people insisted on anonymity to discuss a matter not made public.\n\nTrump, a Republican, defeated Harris, a Democrat, in the presidential election last year.\n\nHis move to drop Harris’ Secret Service protection comes as the former vice president, who became the Democratic nominee last summer after a chaotic series of events that led to Biden dropping out of the contest, is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The tour has 15 stops, including visits abroad to London and Toronto. The book, which refers to the historically short length of her presidential campaign, will be released Sept. 23, and the tour begins the following day.\n\nA recent threat intelligence assessment the Secret Service conducts on those it protects, such as Harris, found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president, said a White House official who also insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration found no reason Harris’ protection should go beyond the standard six-month period for former vice presidents, the official said.\n\nKirsten Allen, a senior adviser to Harris, said in response to the move: “The vice president is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety.”\n\nTrump’s vice president from his first term, Mike Pence, did not have extended Secret Service protection beyond the standard six months.\n\nStill, it is not unusual for Secret Service protection to continue well beyond the statutory six-month window, particularly when former officials face credible and ongoing threats. But Trump’s decisions to revoke the protection have stood out both for timing and for targets.\n\nDuring Trump’s second presidency, he repeatedly has cut off security for adversaries and figures who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and members of Biden’s family, including the former president’s adult children. Outgoing presidents can extend protection for those who might otherwise not be eligible; Trump did so for his family after leaving office in 2021.\n\nThe decision to strip Harris of protection is certain to raise alarms among security experts who view continuity of protection as essential in a polarized climate.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said an executive memorandum was issued Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security ending Harris’ security detail and security services. Those had been extended from six to 18 months by the Biden administration, so they would have ended in July 2026, but now they will be terminated on Monday.\n\nHarris lives in the Los Angeles area. The city’s Democratic mayor, Karen Bass, called Trump’s decision “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation” and warned that it would endanger Harris.\n\nBass said she plans to work with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, to ensure the former vice president’s safety, and she and Harris have already been in touch about the issue, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nWhile she lost to Trump last November, Harris is seen as a potential candidate for 2028, and she has already announced she will not run for California governor in 2026. Harris is also a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney.\n\nLast year was a particularly politically charged environment with Trump facing two assassination attempts, and the Secret Service played a crucial role in protecting the now-president. While questions remain about how the agency prepared for a July 2024 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a Secret Service counter sniper shot a gunman dead after he fired eight shots, killing an attendee, wounding two others and grazing Trump’s right ear.\n\nTrump chose one of the agents who rushed to the stage to shield him, Sean Curran, to lead the agency earlier this year.\n\nThe news of the security revocation was first reported by CNN. Reuters also confirmed the news, citing a senior White House official.\n\n—With additional files from Reuters","summary":"Then-president Joe Biden quietly signed a directive, at Harris' request, that had extended protection for her beyond the traditional six months before leaving office in January.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11356287/trump-harris-secret-service-detail-extension-ends/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/84d037d7b0ac4626345421293dba63814d618b601a62831eef58eee1e5cb0639.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 19:38:04","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.066},{"id":355645866,"title":"Ex-ABC reporter Terry Moran accuses Disney of ‘failing the American people’ by avoiding ‘problem’ Trump coverage","text":"Fired ABC News reporter Terry Moran accused his former network of “failing the American people” by caving to “corporate pressure” to avoid coverage of President Trump that could cause “a problem.” \n\nMoran claimed the Disney-owned network – which paid $16 million in December to settle a defamation suit brought by Trump – is at the mercy of executives who are kowtowing to the administration.\n\n“I think that the business that I was in for all those years — network news, corporate media, legacy media, whatever you want to call it — is failing the American people. And they have corporate pressure on them,” the veteran correspondent said on the “In Good Faith with Philip DeFranco” podcast Thursday. \n\n“The facts in front of them are eluding their coverage. And I think that they are disserving the American people.” \n\nMoran was booted by ABC News in June after the network accused him of having “blatantly breached” its objectivity standards when he called White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller a “world-class hater” in a social media rant.\n\n“Look, Disney is a multi-kabillion dollar business, right?

When I’m in the Senate, I’ll never forget about Iowa.”\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg News, in its coverage of Ernst’s retirement, pointed to reasons for Democratic optimism.\n\n“One thing the national GOP cannot afford to ignore: Recent generic congressional ballots are giving a consistent edge to Democrats. A CNBC poll showed a 5-point lead for Democrats in August that had only widened since spring, something CNN pollster Harry Enten called a ‘big uh-oh’ for Republicans.

But then-President Joe Biden quietly signed a directive, at Harris’ request, that had extended protection for her beyond the traditional six months, according to another person familiar with the matter. The people insisted on anonymity to discuss a matter not made public.\n\nTrump, a Republican, defeated Harris, a Democrat, in the presidential election last year.\n\nHis move to drop Harris’ Secret Service protection comes as the former vice president, who became the Democratic nominee last summer after a chaotic series of events that led to Biden dropping out of the contest, is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The tour has 15 stops, including visits abroad to London and Toronto. The book, which refers to the historically short length of her presidential campaign, will be released Sept. 23, and the tour begins the following day.\n\nA recent threat intelligence assessment the Secret Service conducts on those it protects, such as Harris, found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president, said a White House official who also insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration found no reason Harris’ protection should go beyond the standard six-month period for former vice presidents, the official said.\n\nTrump’s vice president from his first term, Mike Pence, did not have extended Secret Service protection beyond the standard six months.\n\nStill, it is not unusual for Secret Service protection to continue well beyond the statutory six-month window, particularly when former officials face credible and ongoing threats. But Trump’s decisions to revoke the protection have stood out both for timing and for targets.\n\nDuring Trump’s second presidency, he repeatedly has cut off security for adversaries and figures who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and members of Biden’s family, including the former president’s adult children. Outgoing presidents can extend protection for those who might otherwise not be eligible; Trump did so for his family after leaving office in 2021.\n\nThe decision to strip Harris of protection is certain to raise alarms among security experts who view continuity of protection as essential in a polarized climate.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said an executive memorandum was issued Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security ending Harris’ security detail and security services. Those had been extended from six to 18 months by the Biden administration, so they would have ended in July 2026, but now they will be terminated on Monday.\n\nHarris lives in the Los Angeles area. The city’s Democratic mayor, Karen Bass, called Trump’s decision “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation” and warned that it would endanger Harris. Bass said she plans to work with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat, to ensure the former vice president’s safety, and she and Harris have already been in touch about the issue, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nWhile she lost to Trump last November, Harris is seen as a potential candidate for 2028, and she has already announced she will not run for California governor in 2026. Harris is also a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney.\n\nLast year was a particularly politically charged environment with Trump facing two assassination attempts, and the Secret Service played a crucial role in protecting the now-president. While questions remain about how the agency prepared for a July 2024 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a Secret Service counter sniper shot a gunman dead after he fired eight shots, killing an attendee, wounding two others and grazing Trump’s right ear. Trump chose one of the agents who rushed to the stage to shield him, Sean Curran, to lead the agency earlier this year.\n\nThe news of the security revocation was first reported by CNN.","summary":"President Donald Trump has revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection that otherwise would have ended next summer, senior Trump administration officials said Friday.","url":"https://nwasianweekly.com/2025/08/trump-ends-ex-vice-president-harris-secret-service-protection-early-after-biden-had-extended-it/","image":"https://nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kamala-Harris_F.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 18:03:15","author":"Admin,Seung Min Kim","authors":["Admin","Seung Min Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":355637538,"title":"Trump's Bombshell Move Against Harris: The Don Revokes Kamala's Secret Service Protection Weeks Before She Embarks on National Tour to Promote '107 Days' Memoir ","text":"President Trump has cut off Kamala Harris's access to her personal secret service detail just days before the former vice president heads out on a cross-country book tour to promote her new memoir, 107 Days, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nThose close to Harris are worried she is about to lose crucial access to any possible threat warnings just as she is preparing to expose herself to the nation, possibly putting her in danger.Typically, former VPs are given six months of Secret Service protection after leaving office, according to federal law. In Harris's case, that period ended on July 21.\n\nHowever, her detail was extended for an additional year after then-President Joe Biden signed a secret directive just before leaving office. It isn't clear why Biden signed the extension, or if he had any worrying intel, and once Trump was made aware of it, he canceled it.\n\nIn a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday, the president wrote: \"You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris.\"\n\nWhen that date comes, Harris will lose access to her around-the-clock security detail, along with advanced levels of threat analysis surrounding her emails, texts, and social media. Federal agents will also stop protecting her home in Los Angeles.Memoir MockedAs RadarOnline.com reported, Harris was brutally mocked after announcing her memoir, 107 Days, in a video shared to social media.\n\nHer memoir promised to deliver an inside look at her \"intense, high-stakes and deeply personal\" campaign.\n\nHarris' official X account shared the video along with the caption: \"What the world saw on the campaign trail was only part of the story. My new book is a behind-the-scenes look at my experience leading the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. 107 Days is out on September 23. I can't wait for you to read it.\"Kamala's Personal ReflectionThe former vice president added: \"Since leaving office, I've spent a lot of time reflecting on those days. Talking with my team, my family, my friends and pulling my thoughts together. In essence, writing a journal that is this book.\n\n\"With candor and reflection, I've written a behind-the-scenes account of that journey. I believe there's value in sharing what I saw, what I learned, and what I know it will take to move forward.\n\n\"In writing this book, one truth kept coming back to me: Sometimes the fight takes a while.\"\n\nHarris teased she wasn't done with politics yet as she concluded her message: \"But I remain full of hope. And I remain clear-eyed. I will never stop fighting to make our country reflect the very best of its ideals. Always on behalf of the people.\"Joe Nixes His Own TourMeanwhile, her former boss has canceled a nationwide tour of his own. The 82-year-old had several speaking engagements scheduled for the remainder of the year, but now they have all reportedly been axed.\n\nNo specific reason was offered for the cancellation, but Biden is battling an aggressive form of prostate cancer, and has seldom been seen out in public since leaving office. \n\nInstead, has been spending the majority of his post-presidency at his Delaware home as he continues to fight the disease.","summary":"Those close to Harris are worried she is about to lose crucial access to any possible threat warning while on the road.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-revokes-kamala-harris-secret-service-protection-national-book-tour/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/feCLKwFmN/0x0/kamala-harris-donald-trump-1756488238418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 18:00:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.059},{"id":355664412,"title":"Trump ends security protection for former Vice President Harris","text":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump has canceled Secret Service protection for former vice president and 2024 Democratic rival Kamala Harris, a senior White House official said today.\n\nFormer vice presidents typically receive six months of Secret Service protection after they leave office.\n\nHarris’ protection was extended to one year, until January 2026, by then-President Joe Biden before he left office last January, the official said.\n\nHarris in September is to embark on a 15-city book tour for her memoir, “107 Days,” about her unsuccessful presidential run.

That is a key part of their platform and agenda, and right now when we look at the context in which this is all occurring, it is very much anti-immigrant,\" Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the AAPI Equity Alliance and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, told Newsweek.\"The American economy has, really since its founding, benefited from the labor of immigrants particular to the AAPI community.\"Growing Trend of Anti-Indian MessagingThe anti-Indian racism seen against politicians has impacted Indian and South Asian communities across the country.According to the AAPI Equity Alliance's Stop AAPI Hate Report, more than 75 percent of anti-Asian slurs targeted South Asians between December 2024 and January 2025. Moonshot, a group that targets online terrorism, found more than 44,000 slurs targeting South Asians in extremist online spaces during May and June of this year.The recent appointment of Sriram Krishnan as the White House's senior policy adviser on artificial intelligence brought a wave of anti-Indian rhetoric from MAGA supporters, particularly after he voiced his support of H-1B visas and the removal of country-cap quotas on green cards.Although President Donald Trump previously claimed favorable support for visas amid an online battle among his supporters last year, his administration's views have shifted. At the July 2025 AI Summit in Silicon Valley, California, Trump emphasized national loyalty through the \"America First\" mentality.\"Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India, and slashing profits in Ireland....Under President Trump, those days are over,\" Trump said.That message has been backed by Republicans in Congress, including Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who posted on X this month: \"End Indian H1-B visas replacing American jobs.\"\"It's always been a politically volatile issue, but I think more so in the last, I would say, 10 years or so,\" Guarav Khanna, an associate professor of economics at the University of California San Diego, told Newsweek.\"At the start of the current presidency, within the administration, it seemed like there were two factions. So it wasn't even about Democrats versus Republicans.\"How Does H-1B Factor In?According to 2020 research published in the Global Journal of Human-Social Science, Indian immigrants following the Immigration Act of 1965 came from privileged backgrounds: upper-caste people with \"qualifications and skills to meet the needs of the American economy.\"Khanna said that when Indians first started coming to the U.S. on the H-1B, computer scientists were getting a 900 percent wage bump.\"Now, that wage differential has fallen, but it's still I think close to about 300 percent, 400 percent higher wages,\" Khanna said. \"That's very lucrative. It means that you're not only earning that wage increase for six years, but a fair number stay on after and get a green card, so it can be like winning a lottery ticket for life.\"The H-1B visa program, although not directly related to systemic barriers of caste, may be harder to access for people who cannot meet visa requirements because of socioeconomic disadvantages.Sumouni Basu, a licensed immigration attorney at South Asian Network, told Newsweek that she finds the changes in the program to be \"in effect, elitist\" while claiming to be merit-based.\"If that rhetoric wasn't already putting a false monolith on our community, I think this will make it worse because H-1Bs will be limited to more higher-earning workers, but at the same time, that isn't what our community is all made up of,\" she said.Basu also believes that social media has created a dynamic of extremes: Indians are either stereotyped as successful and well-off in their careers or doing low-wage work for a living, such as taxi drivers.\"It impacts our community internalizing that I think South Asians already carry a level of shame and reputation-based identity,\" she said.People may be hesitant to seek public benefits or social support services, even if eligible, because of others operating off stereotypes and social hostility.\"There are people in our community who could use that, but it's not reaching them,\" Basu added.In order to foster solidarity and self-advocacy moving forward, Kulkarni reminds the South Asian community that \"too many people see themselves as immune to it [racial discrimination] because of economical or educational privilege, and that is part of the authoritarian playbook....We have to vote and organize. Democracy is not a spectator sport.\"South Asian and Indian American Impact Foundations Executive Director Chintan Patel echoed the sentiment.\"The America that we believe in that brought so many South Asian Americans to this country is one that doesn't scapegoat vulnerable communities, trample fundamental rights, or pit communities against each other,\" he told Newsweek. \"The reality we are seeing now is so contrary to our experience.\"","summary":"As scrutiny has grown around the H-1B visa program, so have anti-Indian posts online.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/indian-immigrants-us-visas-social-media-hate-racism-2121568","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2712321/us-india-flags.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=0b5536ab5071c7483b26d0b180679b22","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 17:17:12","author":"Dan Gooding,Kaamya Krishnan","authors":["Dan Gooding","Kaamya Krishnan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.152},{"id":355609422,"title":"Vance Unloads on Newsom as Inauthentic, Mamdani as an Ingrate","text":"Vice President JD Vance took aim at likely 2028 Democrat presidential candidate California Gov.

And I think the people would like that a lot more than a cheap imitation of the president of the United States,” Vance told Cain.\n\nNewsom has taken to mimicking President Donald Trump’s social media style, employing all capital letters in X and Truth Social posts, insulting his political opponents, and even signing off an X post with just his initials like Trump. \n\nThe California governor’s polling has risen among potential voters as he has sought to replicate the Trump approach to social media, although only time will tell if those gains hold. An Echelon Insights poll conducted in August found Newsom second in support to former Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical Democrat presidential primary. \n\n“When I see Gavin Newsom trying to act like Donald Trump, that’s the opposite of authenticity. He’s not trying to be Gavin Newsom—whoever that is. He’s trying to be a fake carbon copy of Donald Trump.

Andrew Cuomo; and Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the nonprofit anti-crime group the Guardian Angels. Recent polling has shown Mamdani in the lead ahead of the Nov. 4 election. \n\nMamdani has attracted significant press coverage for his left-wing political views, including dismantling traditional policing and pledging $65 million to transgender treatments for New Yorkers if elected.\n\nWhen asked about Mamdani, the vice president, a Republican, noted his grandmother was a Democrat.\n\n“She was a Democrat who loved this country and felt gratitude for this country. She had multiple relatives who served in World War II, who served in World War I. She remembered that war like it was yesterday. She would tell me about World War I and her brother and her dad going off to fight in the Pacific,” Vance said. \n\n“Does Mamdani. when you hear him speak, is this a man who feels gratitude for the United States of America? Is this a man who feels grateful for all of the opportunities, the incredible bounty in this country?” the vice president asked. \n\n“I don’t know the guy, but my sense is, he’s had a very good life in this country. It would be nice to occasionally show a sense of gratitude, instead of just attacking the United States or all its problems,” he said.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance took aim at likely 2028 Democrat presidential candidate California Gov.

No public events are on his schedule today - again. We wish the President, 79, well. But he's still Truthing away, presumably from his exceptionally large and comfy bed. And the people around him are being as delightful as ever... Republicans have left what they see as the minimum acceptable length of time after a tragedy before they start blaming school shootings on anything but the one consistent factor. Trump has put the squeeze on nearly $5bn of what was left of America's foreign aid budget. And the way he's done it isn't just bad for foreign aid. Meanwhile, in Trump World: Here's all that and more, as we round up everything that happened in the last 24 hours that you need to know about. A coward with three legally purchased military weapons shot a hail of bullets into children through the windows of a church on Wednesday. After former Press Secretary, now MSNBC host Jen Psaki argued \"thoughts and prayers\" were not enough of a response to a tragedy that is all too common, and almost entirely preventable, JD Vance took it as a sign to defend... prayer. House Speaker Mike Johnson went on to accuse Psaki of \"attacking religion\", which she obviously wasn't - when there are \"a lot of common sense solutions\" to mass shootings. You mean gun control, right Mike? Mike? \"...that do not involve taking away the constitutional rights of law abiding American citizens.\" Oh. \"At the end of the day the problem is not guns. Ok, Jen Psaki? The problem is the human heart. It's mental health.\" Right. Meanwhile, brain-wormed bear botherer RFK Jr can't open his mouth without saying something that's patently untrue, and easy to check. And he used it... as far as we can tell...to try and argue vaccinations and psychiatric drugs were responsible for the shooting. Not guns, pills and jabs. Let's take it apart, shall we? \"People have had guns in this country forever,\" he argued. \"When I was a kid, we had shooting clubs at our school. People, kids, my classmates, other people, would bring a .22 rifle with their guns to school and park it in the parking lot.\" Worth noting at this point that a .22 rifle - a long-barrelled, bolt-action hunting rifle - and a military assault rifle, which can fire 150 bullets a minute, are not the same thing. And that's before you get to the pistol and the shotgun. And it's true, people have had guns in the US \"forever\" - just not on anything like the scale that they have now. We'll come to that in a moment. RFK went on: \"There's never been a time in the history of humanity when people walked into a crowd, or a church, or a movie theatre or a school...and just started randomly shooting.\" Also not true. The first widely recorded mass shooting event in the US dates back to 1966, when 25-year-old Charles Whitman killed 15 people and injured 31 more, shooting them indiscriminately from the tower of the University of Texas. Studies show there was a low, but steady stream of what would be considered mass shootings from then until the 80s and 90s, when the figures started to increase dramatically. RFK went on: \"It's happening in our country, not around the world.\" This is true. America accounts for 31% of all mass shooting deaths, despite having 5% of the population. There are three times as many deaths as in France, and 10-20 times as many as in other European countries. Then he said: \"There are other countries that have comparable numbers of guns. Something changed.\" Which is so wildly, ridiculously untrue that it's hard to get over. The most recent Small Arms Survey found there were 120 guns for every 100 people in the US. Yes, that's right. There are more guns than people. That's more than double the next highest per-capita gun ownership - Yemen, where it's 53 per 100. But yes, something has changed over time. Back when RFK was a lad, not only were the guns cumbersome and difficult to use...there were far fewer of them. In 1945, after WWII, there were about 45 million guns in civilian hands - about one for every three people. By 1992 that figure was 192 million. In 2007 it was 290 million - about 97 guns per 100 residents. And you'll remember that it was in the 80s and 90s that's when mass shootings in the US started to rise. Now it's thought around 392 million guns are in circulation in the US. But RFK isn't interested in that data point. He said: \"One of the culprits we have to examine is whether the fact that we are the most over medicated nation in the world…\" OK, Rob. Inevitably, the worst people on the internet have seized upon Minneapolis shooter Robin Westman being trans. Lists started going round, pushed by extremist accounts like Libs of Tiktok, of mass shootings perpetrated by trans people. The lists were all different, but they all ended with something like \"DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM?\" And Tom Emmer, the Republican House Majority Whip, said it out loud, taking aim at Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for, I guess, not being mean enough to trans kids. \"It starts at the top,\" he said. \"If a gun wasn't going to be available, clearly based on what this young man, what little we know of it right now, he would have found another way to commit a heinous act like this,\" Emmer said. \"That wasn't going to stop him, and that's not what caused the problem. What caused the problems is all the transgender confusion that Tim Walz and his Democrat colleagues are causing.\" Donald Trump Jr, on Instagram posted a list of trans-involved shootings, adding: “But Rednecks with AR‑15's are the problem.” He then wrote: “Like what pumping kids full of hormones in an attempt to defy science and nature actually does to them? … it seems to me there is no more violent group in the world per capita than the radical trans community...” RFK said 'SSRIs' - psychiatric meds often taken by trans people - might be the problem. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Walsh, Laura Loomer— all immediately seized on Westman’s trans status. This is, obviously, insane. I did a quick dig on mass shootings in the US since 2018 and found 5 where it had been reported that the perpetrator was trans, including Wednesday's tragedy. But that's 5 out of 4,215 shootings over the same period, so about 0.12%. There are only about 1.6 million trans people in the US, so about 0.6% of the population. About 98% of shooters are cis male, and while we're at it, 52% are white. So in practical terms, school shooters are about 450 times more likely to be a white man than a trans person. Meanwhile, 100% of mass shootings are perpetrated by people with easy, legal access to guns. Shrug. Donald Trump today revoked secret service protection from his opponent in the 2024 election, Kamala Harris. Former vice presidents usually get protected for six months after leaving office. But, understandably given the circumstances, Joe Biden extended that to 18 months for Harris. They will be terminated on Monday. The move to drop Harris’ Secret Service protection comes as the former vice president is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The book is scheduled to be released next month. JD Vance gave a speech in Wisconsin last night. As usual there were protesters there to give him a warm welcome. On his way out, it seems he didn't fancy being confronted by them, so he took his motorcade the wrong way down a one way street to avoid them. Sadly, he was thwarted by their ability to walk without using roads. This happened a few days ago, but it's so baffling that it's worth reporting. Around 30 countries have just stopped sending small parcels to the US because of confusion over Trump's tariffs. Goods under $800 used to be exempt from customs fees, until today - when the so-called \"de minimis exemption\" is scrapped. Purchases that previously entered the US without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country’s applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, carriers handling orders sent through the global mail network also can choose a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package instead of the value-based rate. The United Nations agency that coordinates international mail deliveries says it is working to get small parcels dispatched to the United States - but said they'd not been given enough time or guidance to comply with procedures before the change kicked in. The US government is offering military funeral honours to a January 6th rioter who was killed while trying to violently overthrow them. Ashli Babbit was shot dead while wearing a Trump campaign flag, while attempting to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby inside the Capitol. She was repeatedly warned to stop before a police officer opened fire. Trump, who still denies he lost the 2020 election, has tried to repaint the January 6th insurrection as a \"patriotic stand\", as opposed to what it actually was, a failed attempted coup. President Donald Trump has told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he won't be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch. For the first time in 50 years, he's using a tactic called \"pocket recission\", which is when a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so that Congress cannot act on the request in the 45-day timeframe and the money goes unspent as a result. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September. The last pocket recession was in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues that it's a legally permissible tool. But such a move, if standardised by the White House, could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially wrest some control over spending from the House and the Senate.","summary":"Republicans have left what they see as the minimum acceptable length of time after a tragedy before they start blaming school shootings on anything but the one consistent factor - here's a roundup of everything you need to know","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-8-wild-donald-35816570","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35816566.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_BESTPIX-TOPSHOT-NETHERLANDS-NATO-SUMMIT-DEFENCE-DIPLOMACY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 16:07:56","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.613},{"id":355591590,"title":"Donald Trump revokes Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection","text":"President Donald Trump revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a memorandum reviewed by NOTUS.\n\nA senior White House official also confirmed the revocation to NOTUS.\n\n“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D.

About 92,500 nonfarm jobs are projected to have been added last month, above the 73,000 recorded last month. The BLS will likely face scrutiny after Trump fired commissioner Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused of manipulating jobs data during the 2024 election to benefit Kamala Harris. Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as the next commissioner. Antoni, a public critic of McEntarfer, has been criticized by former Democrat officials as being “completely unqualified” for the role and alleged Antoni may abuse his role as an “extreme partisan.”\n\nKey Background\n\nDeclining optimism among American consumers comes as inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal in July. Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data released earlier Friday found annual inflation hit 2.9% in July, matching economist’s projections and a 0.1% increase from June. Consumer spending increased 0.3% over the month to a four-month high, however, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics rose 0.4%. The PCE data—the central bank’s preferred reading for inflation—and upcoming jobs report will be the last before the Fed considers a possible interest rate cut in September. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who voted in favor of a quarter-point reduction in July, said Thursday he would again support rates falling from a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where they have sat since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates, has argued in favor of a cautious monetary policy, citing potential impacts of Trump’s tariffs on the economy in the near future.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesHigh Inflation Continued In July—But Consumer Spending ImprovedBy Ty Roush\n\nGot a tip?

The latest Emerson survey has the slick-haired California leader boasting 25 percent support.\n\nNewsom's polling surge comes after an intense month-long change to his social media presence that includes mimicking the Truth Social candor of the 47th president.\n\nThe X account for Newsom's press office sends daily posts now mimicking Trump's all-caps posts and rants. Meanwhile, Newsom himself has challenged Trump and GOP states seeking to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterms by launching an effort to redraw California's congressional map.\n\nThe potential 2028 hopeful has also sued the Trump administration after he took over the California National Guard during the Summer to put down anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom's resistance to Trump and his messaging against the White House has helped him gain more favor with Democrats, however, the poll also showed no candidate has reached at least half of the primary electorate.\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg came in second behind Newsom with 16% from the poll's respondents.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who passed on a run for governor in California, came in third with 11 percent support, which is a slight fall from the 13 percent she received back in June.\n\nMeanwhile more than a dozen other potential Democratic candidates, including Michigan Gov.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Mo.), or former Vice President Kamala Harris—he calls them “low IQ,” “deranged,” and “mentally disabled.” \n\nAnd when he and Vice President JD Vance tried to justify the federal takeover of Washington, DC, they claimed it was necessary in order to get mentally ill people off the streets. “Why have we convinced ourselves that it’s compassionate to allow a person who’s obviously a schizophrenic, or suffering from some other mental illness, why is it compassionate to let that person fester in the streets?” Vance said—offering as evidence, CNN reported, an anecdote “about his family being yelled at during a trip to DC.”\n\nThis is what mental health and disability advocates people call “sanist” language—words used to stigmatize mental health conditions in a derogatory way. Trump routinely turns to it to degrade his enemies and justify his actions. A review of his speeches and interviews includes more than 200 uses of the word ‘crazy’ thus far in his second term, and ‘lunatic’ and ‘insane’ more than 60 times each, according to a Roll Call database. \n\nWhile these words can be part of casual vernacular, Trump’s constant use of dismissive and stigmatizing rhetoric matches his actions. His officials have dismantled key parts of the federal workforce dedicated to treatment and prevention and cancelled millions of dollars in research grants focused on mental health. In doing so, experts say, Trump and his cronies are not only undermining support systems for people with mental illness but also worsening some of the same issues they claim to prioritize, including minimizing crime and reducing homelessness. \n\n“When you cut those services, you have a lot of downstream impacts, and that’s going to include upticks in emergency department visits, hospitalization needs, incarceration and in homelessness,” said Hannah Wesolowski, the chief advocacy officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nOne of Trump’s most sweeping attacks on people with mental illness came in late July, when he signed an executive order pushing “long-term” involuntary institutionalization for people with mental illnesses experiencing homelessness, which the order argues the EO argues will “restore public order.” Trump was more blunt about his hopes for what the EO would actually do a few weeks later, when he announced the deployment of National Guard troops to DC: “Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR,” he posted on Truth Social. The White House did not respond to a series of questions. \n\nAdvocacy groups quickly pointed to a plethora of issues in Trump’s order, including that it criminalizes mental illness and tramples the civil rights of unhoused people, particularly those with mental health disabilities. “This executive order diverts resources away from the real solutions we know work and instead embraces coercion over care,” National Disability Rights Network executive director Marlene Sallo said in a press release. As the National Alliance to End Homelessness pointed out, the order does not address who will determine involuntary civil commitment, under what criteria, nor acknowledge the shortage of mental health beds nationwide—an issue the American Psychiatric Association asked Trump to tackle at the start of his second term. \n\nResearch indicates that involuntary commitment can be highly traumatic and lead to people cycling in and out of institutions without getting the support they need. More research is needed on how best to support unhoused people with mental health disabilities and substance abuse issues, but Wesolowski, of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said that Trump’s order is not the way forward. “If we want to both reduce the burden of chronic conditions in this country and reduce homelessness,” she said, “the solution to that is to help people sooner.” \n\nTrump’s cabinet seems to share his disdain for people struggling with mental health. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy oversees the National Institutes of Health, the CDC, and the FDA, among other agencies—and since he was confirmed in February, has shuttered key offices and fired critical staffers throughout the department.\n\nAs our colleague Kiera Butler previously reported, during his doomed presidential campaign, Kennedy floated sending people on antidepressants to “wellness farms…to get reparented, to reconnect with communities.” He also baselessly implied, during a 2023 event with future DOGE head Elon Musk, that antidepressants could be to blame for school shootings. Just last month, the FDA held a misinformation-fest about antidepressants in pregnancy during which panelists argued that perinatal depression does not actually exist and that antidepressants are overprescribed to pregnant women, despite research suggesting that only six to ten percent take them. A leaked strategy document, that Kennedy’s so-called Make America Healthy Again Commission reportedly submitted to the president, obtained by Politico, called for a working group on antidepressant “overprescription trends” among kids. \n\nFederal staffers working on mental health-related issues, meanwhile, have been purged by Trump’s government. NIH has lost 7,000 workers, roughly 16 percent of its workforce, through firings and resignations, according to a ProPublica analysis. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) lost an even higher proportion, at 22 percent.\n\nHHS also plans to cut more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which will be collapsed into a proposed “Administration for a Healthy America,” following cuts of $72 million from March’s continuing appropriations bill; dwarfing an additional $19 million the agency supposedly plans to earmark to support housing for people with severe mental illness.\n\nIn a May letter to Kennedy, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and three Democratic senators said the plans to dissolve SAMHSA appear to violate the federal law that created it. A slew of advocacy organizations also condemned the proposed cuts, calling to preserve the agency and its funding. \n\nNIMH will also be swallowed up into the newly proposed National Institute of Behavioral Health, along with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told Mother Jones that “Secretary Kennedy remains deeply committed to the mental health of all Americans, including our nation’s children” and that “under the Secretary’s leadership, SAMHSA is sustaining and strengthening essential mental health and substance use programs so people can access timely, high-quality care.”\n\nMany NIMH research projects have also been decimated. In March, Michael Bronstein, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota (UMN), received news that he was dreading: He and his colleagues were losing what was left of their four-year, $187,000 research grant from the NIMH to study vaccine hesitancy in people with severe mental illness. (Bronstein spoke to Mother Jones in his personal capacity.) \n\nThe work was important. Research has shown that people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are vaccinated at lower rates. They are also more likely to die of illnesses for which we have vaccines. But under the leadership of RFK Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, the NIH deprioritized research on vaccine hesitancy, according to the grant termination notice Bronstein received—and a Washington Post report published the same day. \n\nThe news was particularly cruel for Bronstein, who with his colleagues had already spent time recruiting about 60 participants who were prepared to open up to researchers about their mental health conditions. “When things get cancelled like this,” Bronstein said, “it’s a betrayal of those individuals’ trust”—and of research that he believed was “going to have a real impact on public health.”\n\nPast NIMH research has, indeed, had major implications for treating mental illness. One 2008 study, for example, investigated treatments for psychosis in young people experiencing an initial schizophrenic episode, and led to the launch of hundreds of treatment programs for schizophrenia nationwide. The research found that wraparound treatment of psychosis after an initial episode led to less severe episodes later in life.\n\nThat study was “a great example of research being put into practice and making a huge impact,” Wesolowski said. “But we need more of that.”\n\nBut mental health research has been a particular focus on the chopping block of DOGE, which terminated hundreds of NIH grants—with NIMH grants accounting for the largest subset, according to a paper published in JAMA in May. Since then, dozens more NIMH grants have been cancelled, although some terminations have been reversed or are likely to be reversed following a slate of legal challenges, according to the database Grant Witness. \n\nThe majority of the cancelled NIMH grants featured in the JAMA study—nearly 75 percent, according to Mother Jones’ analysis—focused on research involving LGBTQ people, who are more than twice as likely as straight, cisgender people to report mental disorders. And with the Trump administration’s additional measures seeking to erase LGBTQ people from public life—by banning trans troops from the military, dismissing discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and purging LGBTQ history from public spaces—these rates could climb even higher. \n\nMany of the NIMH-funded projects specifically aimed to better understand these disparities. One cancelled grant, for example, was intended to study how stigma, including state laws restricting trans health care, shapes the mental health of trans people living in rural areas. The project, part of Kirsten F. Siebach’s doctoral research at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, will continue thanks to an alternative funding source. (Siebach also spoke to Mother Jones in their personal capacity, not on behalf of the university.) \n\nBut Siebach, who hopes to build their career as a public health researcher focusing on how structural stigma affects LGBTQ people, worries that “there’s just no funding to support such work” going forward.\n\nThere is already evidence that Trump’s return to the White House has made things worse for LGBTQ kids’ mental health. The day after Trump’s re-election last November, the Trevor Project, an organization focused on preventing suicide among LGBTQ youth, reported a 700 percent increase in contacts to its crisis lines. On Inauguration Day, when Trump signed an executive order that essentially refused to acknowledge the existence of trans people—the organization saw a more than 30 percent increase in contacts compared to weeks prior. Casey Pick, the organization’s director of law and policy, said those spikes reflect the fact that “LGBTQ youth are well aware that the access to care, to support of adults, to welcoming and affirming schools and medical environments is very much at risk.”\n\nOne of the highest-profile blows for LGBTQ young people came last month, when SAMHSA officially shuttered the National Suicide Hotline’s specialized services for LGBTQ youth. Those services, received more than one million contacts since launching in 2022. In a statement, SAMHSA claimed that access to “culturally competent crisis counselors” would continue, adding, “Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.” \n\nThe administration has also undermined support for LGBTQ youth mental health in less public ways: Seven of the cancelled NIMH grants in the JAMA study, Mother Jones found, were explicitly focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth. (Two were since reinstated, but face cancellation again due to a recent Supreme Court ruling.) Two explicitly focused on suicide prevention among Black LGBTQ youth, who report disproportionate suicide risk; another aimed to implement and measure a pilot program for LGBTQ youth at risk of suicide in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Projects like these, Pick said, helped experts “to see trends, patterns, disparities in the mental health outcomes for our LGBTQ+ young people and to begin to identify solutions.” \n\nExplicit attacks on LGBTQ young people in particular are coupled with indirect impacts on their mental health from other administration actions: Trump’s involuntary commitment order, for example, is likely to have a disproportionate impact on LGBTQ young people, given that they experience homelessness at higher rates than their straight and cis peers. Trump’s executive order seeking to end federal funding for K-12 schools that promote so-called “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology” could penalize teachers and school counselors who seek to support LGBTQ students, which would ultimately harm the students themselves, given that research has shown accepting adults can reduce their risk of suicide. And LGBTQ youth and their families who flee their home states, or even the country, to escape threats to gender-affirming care or outright bans may further struggle after being uprooted and losing support systems.\n\n“What is so important now is that we make sure that young people know that they are not alone, that they still have access to resources,” Pick said, “but the reality is, this is a very challenging time.”","summary":"When President Donald Trump tries to defend his mass deportation agenda, he claims, without evidence, that immigrants are entering the United States from “mental institutions and insane asylums.”&#160; When he wants to insult people—like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Rep.

That power rests solely with parliament.\n\nMcGregor has long claimed he is running for president in this year’s Áras election, despite not being on the ballot.\n\nTo become a candidate, a person must be nominated by either 20 members of the Dáil and Seanad, or four local authorities.\n\nThere is little indication that McGregor, who has a criminal history and who a civil jury found liable for rape, can garner this level of support.\n\nNevertheless, McGregor insists he will be on the ballot and has launched a petition to change the constitution to allow him to run.\n\nHis celebrity platform ensures his posts receive huge numbers of views, and he risks misinforming the public about how the constitution and the presidency of Ireland works.\n\n“We are led to believe the powers of the President are limited,” a 27 August Facebook post by McGregor begins.\n\n“I will use the powers of the Presidency under articles twelve to fourteen of the Irish constitution to return power to its people by calling a referendum to amend our current constitution.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticles 12 to 14 of the constitution outline how the presidency of Ireland works, as well as its powers. Referendums are not mentioned once in those articles.\n\nAfter writing at length about unenacted parts of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State (which was replaced with the current constitution in 1937, following a referendum), McGregor says: “As President, I will hold a public referendum to restore these articles to our Constitution.\n\n“This would return important democratic powers once taken away by the political parties of this current government back to the people of Ireland.\n\n“My first action as President will be to establish a mechanism that allows the Irish people to veto government decisions that have a negative impact on their lives.”\n\nHowever, experts who spoke with The Journal said that this was simply not a power that Irish Presidents have.\n\n“The Irish President has only very limited power, which is exercisable only in a very small number of contexts,” Professor Laura Cahillane at University of Limerick’s School of Law told The Journal. “He does not have the power to ‘hold a public referendum’.”\n\nThe rules around holding referendums are explicit in the constitution, and a cursory reading of the text shows they cannot be initiated by presidents.\n\n“The mechanism for amending the Irish Constitution is set out in clear terms in Articles 46 and 47 of the Constitution,” explained Dr. Tom Hickey, Associate Professor of Constitutional Law at DCU’s School of Law and Government.\n\n“Any proposal to amend the Constitution ‘is to be initiated in Dáil Éireann as a Bill,’ as per the terms of Article 46.2.\n\n“If it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, then it is ‘submitted by Referendum to the decision of the People’.”\n\nWhile McGregor’s promises are unlikely to see him pass the nomination stage, they may still have an effect on the election, by eroding the public’s understanding of what the president’s role is and what they can do.\n\nWant to be your own fact-checker?
