{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":474,"news":[{"id":380693892,"title":"US FCC reviews network-affiliate relationships after Trump attack on ABC","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday it was opening a review of agreements between national networks and local broadcast station owners a day after President Donald Trump suggested the commission should move to revoke the broadcast licenses of Disney-owned ABC stations. FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Republican, said the review will cover when stations can opt not to air programming on public interest grounds. Trump's renewed call to revoke ABC's licenses came after expressing unhappiness with questions from an ABC reporter. The FCC, an independent federal agency, issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations, not networks. The White House on Wednesday issued a statement attacking ABC News asserting it was engaged in an effort \"to wage war on President Trump and the millions of Americans who elected him\" and issued a list of grievances over prior stories. Disney did not immediately comment. In September, Carr praised two major broadcast owners, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group, who briefly opted not to air of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on their 70 ABC-affiliated stations covering nearly a quarter of U.S. households. Nexstar needs FCC approval to acquire Tegna in a $3.54 billion deal and on Tuesday formally submitted an application to the agency. ABC suspended Kimmel's show on September 17 over comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, Carr warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licenses and said \"it's time for them to step up.\" Carr came under bipartisan criticism for those comments and will appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 17. Contracts between the networks and affiliates have penalties for not airing programming for extended periods. The FCC notice asks \"are national programmers able to take actions or threaten to punish local broadcast TV stations that attempt to exercise their lawful right to preempt national programming?\" The agency asked if it should adopt regulations to address \"anticompetitive leverage and behavior by large networks?\" Carr said the FCC had initiated the review because national programmers are \"reportedly preventing those broadcasters from serving their local communities - including by punishing them for exercising their right to preempt national programming.\" Last December, ABC News agreed to give $15 million to the Trump presidential library to resolve a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made on air involving the civil case brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll. Carr has taken a series of steps to investigate media companies. In July, he opened a probe into NBC-parent Comcast's relationships with its local broadcast TV affiliates. The FCC in July approved the $8.4 billion merger between CBS parent Paramount Global and Skydance Media after Skydance agreed to ensure CBS news and entertainment programming is free of bias and end diversity programs. The approval came weeks after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over its editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his Democratic presidential opponent, Kamala Harris.

Eighteen months ago, Scott Walter literally wrote the book on the dark-money organization that sought to remake America into its preferred Marxist image. ARABELLA: The Dark Money Network of Leftist Billionaires Secretly Transforming America explained how billionaires, inside of America and out, supplied massive amounts of financing to supposedly \"grassroots\" organizations on the hard Left, using various issue-related \"storefronts\" to hide the high-level coordination by the oligarchs that the Left supposedly opposes. \n\nAt the time, Arabella Advisors got its financing through names like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Pierre Omidyar, Hans-Jörg Wyss, and more. These billionaire activists needed the complexity of Arabella to hide their political manipulations, Walter explained in our interview, and to make it difficult for critics and opponents to \"follow the money.\"\n\nKeep that point in mind when considering this week's news:\n\nNEW: Stick a fork in Arabella Advisors.The powerful progressive philanthropic consulting firm is no more.Instead, Arabella’s managed funds are investing in a new vehicle that will effectively bring Arabella’s services in house to each of the funds.And Arabella Advisors…— Teddy Schleifer (@teddyschleifer) November 18, 2025\n\n... And Arabella Advisors won’t exist anymore.\n\nIs that true? Literally, at least, the answer is yes:\n\nSunflower Services, a new Public Benefit Corporation financed by lead investor New Venture Fund (NVF) with financial support from the Windward and Hopewell Funds, today announced its acquisition of Arabella Advisors' fiscal sponsorship servicing business. Sunflower Services will acquire the existing infrastructure and the operations team previously housed within Arabella Advisors. Sunflower will now provide operational and administrative services to NVF, Windward Fund, Hopewell Fund, and several other nonprofit projects and organizations. Arabella Advisors will cease operations, and Sunflower Services will ensure continuity for clients and staff. \n\nArabella has already \"ceased operations,\" at least as previously constituted. The question is whether the Arabella project has really ended, or whether this is yet another attempt as Walter warned that creates complexity as a smokescreen.\n\nThere may well be less reason for Arabella in any form. Both Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have publicly renounced their previous political activism and have pledged to focus more on actual philanthropy instead. Both men have expressed regrets over how their money got used to manipulate elections, Zuckerberg in particular. Both, along with non-Arabella figure Jeff Bezos, have reached accommodations with Donald Trump's new administration; for that matter, so has Alphabet's Sundar Pinchai, also not connected to Arabella. The money may be drying up for the organization, and its leadership may have decided to fold its infrastructure into more modest activist models.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller reported today that the House Oversight Committee smells a rat. Chair James Comer has launched a probe of a different entity, partly funded by George Soros, that may have become Arabella under a different shingle:\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund — whose donors include nonprofits tied to billionaire George Soros — is a nonprofit that has been accused of trying to sidestep campaign-finance disclosure rules enforced by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and Justice Department. It also bypasses standard media-ethics practices meant to differentiate real journalism from paid political work that must be disclosed, according to Comer. In letters sent Wednesday to Sixteen Thirty Fund President Amy Kurtz and Sunflower Services CEO Allan Williams, Comer wrote that the Fund’s “Chorus Creator Incubator Program” appears to pay participants to amplify Democratic messaging online through secretive contracts that limit transparency about payments and tightly control the political content they produce.Two days prior, Arabella Advisors announced that Sunflower Services — a new Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) backed by lead investor New Venture Fund (NVF) and supported by the Windward and Hopewell Funds — is acquiring Arabella Advisors’ fiscal-sponsorship business.Arabella oversaw a network of dark money groups that channel hundreds of millions of difficult-to-trace dollars into left-leaning political organizations and advocacy efforts.“The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform works to uphold fundamental American civil liberties and protect the integrity of American elections,” Comer said. “To this end, we are investigating reports of new activities by Sixteen Thirty Fund— an entity with books that have long been in the care of Arabella Advisors.”\n\nIf Sixteen Thirty isn't Arabella under a new shingle, it is still Arabella's sibling. Politico reported this week on its massive outlays, as well as its duplicative roster of funding sources amongst the progressive oligarchy:\n\nAs a 501(c)4 group, Sixteen Thirty Fund is not required to disclose its donors, though past donors have included the nonprofit led by Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss as well as the philanthropic network started by megadonor George Soros. Even though the group has said it supports reforms — backed by many on the left — that would require more transparency into nonprofits, Sixteen Thirty Fund’s fundraising and spending prowess signals that opaque and deep-pocketed left-leaning political funding hubs aren’t going anywhere.More than 60 percent of Sixteen Thirty Fund’s revenues in 2024 came from just five benefactors who cut eight-figure checks to the group, including one who gave $58.9 million and another who gave $51.4 million, according to the filings.The fund reported pouring almost $63 million into super PACs and other groups for political purposes, in addition to dropping more than $15 million on Sixteen Thirty Fund’s own direct political spending. That included $6.7 million to Your Community PAC, a super PAC that became a major last-minute spender in support of former Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic House and Senate candidates in red states.Sixteen Thirty Fund also gave to the main super PACs supporting House and Senate Democrats and the Harris campaign. Roughly another $2 million went to Retire Career Politicians and Civic Truth Action each, super PACs that spent heavily to boost the independent challenger to Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer as well as third party presidential candidates that could’ve eaten into President Donald Trump’s votes.\n\nAll told, Sixteen Thirty poured over $310 million into the 2024 cycle, all on behalf of Democrats or primary challengers to Republicans. The fund also contributed $6.8 million directly to Arabella. Hence the interest by Comer and Republicans on the House Oversight Committee as to the funding of both, and whether either has been used to launder foreign money to directly benefit candidates for office. \n\nAnd hence the need for the \"complexity\" that Scott Walter reported as a key element to the strategy behind Arabella. \n\nArabella Advisors may be technically defunct, but don't think for a minute that its heart is still beating as a transplant into another Frankenstein monster altogether. \n\nIf you missed the April 2024 podcast with Scott Walter, watch it now.

The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday did not respond to a request for comment on why a proclamation was never issued for Cheney, or whether Trump was invited to the funeral. During his reelection campaign last year, Trump regularly criticized Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney, who had become one of Trump’s fiercest critics in the Republican Party after his attempts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The former vice president, a longtime Republican stalwart, said he would vote for Trump’s opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, saying last year that Trump can “never be trusted with power again.”\n\nIn addition to serving as Bush’s vice president, Cheney was also the defense secretary under President George H.W. Bush and chief of staff for President Gerald Ford. He also served as Wyoming’s lone representative to the House, a seat that was occupied by his daughter, Liz, decades later.\n\nOthers delivering tributes at Thursday’s funeral are Cheney’s longtime cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney’s spokesman at the Pentagon; Liz Cheney; and the former vice president’s grandchildren.","summary":"It’s unknown whether President Donald Trump, who has had frosty relations with the former vice president's family, will attend Thursday's funeral, which is by invitation only.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/19/dick-cheney-funeral-george-w-bush-joe-biden-attend/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-CHENEYFUNERAL-1119.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 23:10:36","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":380679686,"title":"Is CA's AG the Next to Fall? Rob Bonta's Campaign Spent $468K on Lawyers During Federal Criminal Probe","text":"For the last two weeks California's political establishment has been caught up in the drama surrounding the indictment of former Newsom Chief of Staff Dana Williamson, former Xavier Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie, and prominent Democrat political consultant Greg Campbell for bilking Becerra's campaign account of $225,000.\n\nDIVE DEEPER: Newsom's Former Chief, Described as 'Mob Boss' by Fellow Dem, Failed to Report $1.7 Million in Income\n\nThis week, however, attention is returning to a long-running bribery scandal involving failed and former Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao and David and Andy Duong, a father-and-son team who operate recycling and pre-fab housing companies, amid new revelations about Attorney General Rob Bonta's involvement.\n\nIn January 2025 Thao, her boyfriend, and the Duongs were indicted and charged with bribery offenses, and Andy Duong was charged with making false statements to investigators. According to the indictment, the Duongs entered into an agreement with then-candidate Thao whereby they'd pay $75,000 for a negative mailer campaign targeting her opponent and pay her boyfriend $95,000/year for a no-show job, and Thao would, once elected, direct lucrative city contracts for homeless housing to the Duongs' housing company.\n\nREAD MORE: Oakland Mayor Claims She's Under Threat From 'Radical Right-Wing Forces,' Including FBI\n\nThat sounds rather vanilla, as these things go, but it's just the latest legal kerfuffle for the Duongs, who have been investigated for making straw contributions to Bay Area politicians and have been known for flaunting their ties to Bonta and his wife, Asm. Mia Bonta, in order to procure government contracts.\n\nDespite these voluminous postings, Rob Bonta's spokesperson claims that the Duongs are simply campaign donors, full stop. Rob Bonta returned about $155,000 in campaign contributions from the family after the federal investigation came to light in 2024, and he and his wife maintain that they've done nothing wrong and were completely unaware of the arrangement between Thao and the Duongs.\n\nWhy is it, then, that just weeks after the indictments dropped Bonta \"made five separate payments to the law firm Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati totaling $468,228\" from his reelection campaign account for \"professional services (legal, accounting)\"? Investigative journalist Ashley Zavala with Sacramento's KCRA made that discovery on Monday, and asked Bonta's campaign that question.\n\nDan Newman, Bonta's spokesman, said the Attorney General was just trying to help federal law enforcement officers bring people to justice.\n\n\"There are of course ongoing legal proceedings in the East Bay in which several people were charged with serious crimes. The AG wants to ensure that anyone who committed a crime is held accountable, so he engaged outside legal counsel to help his law enforcement partners pursue justice.\"\n\nWith his campaign money? When he's the Attorney General? If it was such a priority, perhaps Bonta could have diverted CA Department of Justice monies from suing Trump to this endeavor?\n\nOf course, nobody believes that explanation; it's nonsensical. The two explanations that make sense are that the expenditures were for his and/or his wife's representation during the 18-month FBI investigation, or that he was assisting with Thao's legal fees. Only one of those possibilities, though, is potentially a permissible use of campaign funds (depending on exactly what was being investigated by the feds).\n\nSo, in a follow-up, his campaign went with that possibility.\n\nKCRA 3 followed up on Tuesday, pressing the campaign on whether that was a permissible use of campaign funds and specifics around the legal expenses. Dan Newman, Bonta's reelection campaign adviser, then confirmed Bonta used the money to hire attorneys to help him as he answered questions from federal investigators.Newman said Bonta is not and was never a target of the investigation and said the use of funds was \"absolutely proper.\" He said it was necessary to use campaign funds \"because of the nature of the charges against the people implicated.\"Newman confirmed the money was not used to help his wife, Assemblymember Mia Bonta. He also stated Bonta's involvement in the investigation is over.\n\nIt's not clear that using campaign funds for that expense is permissible, though, but a campaign finance expert said that California's Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) wouldn't make that determination unless a complaint is filed.\n\nNormally California Democrats circle the wagons in these situations, but that might not be the case here:\n\nThe development comes as three sources tell KCRA 3 that Bonta is reconsidering a possible run for governor. The sources who spoke on the condition they remain anonymous said Bonta has been floating the idea in talks with consultants and allies over the past week.Those same sources said Bearstar Strategies, which ran successful statewide campaigns for Gavin Newsom, Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris, is eyeing Bonta as their possible candidate. Bearstar has been struggling to secure a candidate in the race after Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis decided to run for state treasurer instead of governor and after U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla announced he wanted to stay in Congress.\n\nVeteran political operatives in the state, speaking on condition of anonymity, told RedState that Bearstar's Ace Smith was behind the leaks of extremely unflattering videos of gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter over the last few months, so expect things to get spicy if Bonta enters the race.\n\nEditor’s Note: Help us continue to report the truth about corrupt politicians like Rob Bonta and Gavin Newsom. \n\nJoin RedState VIP and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your membership.","url":"https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2025/11/19/is-californias-attorney-general-next-n2196353","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/323/4ae5eec4-a8c8-43e4-9aa4-ee89dbbaf09d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 22:46:02","author":"Jennifer van Laar","authors":["Jennifer van Laar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":380679286,"title":"Biden to attend Cheney's funeral, as Trump remains silent","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former president Joe Biden will attend Thursday’s memorial service for former vice president Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral, which will feature remarks from another former president, George W.

Still, you would think that after being forced to pay out several large settlements over things like the interesting editing of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, or the never-ending splicing and dicing of President Donald Trump's January 6 speech, the mainstream media may begin to think twice before they do it again. But it doesn't seem to be the case. And it doesn't just go on in the U.S. British media has also had its share of fun at Trump's expense. However, that may be changing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr sent out a letter to the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), National Public Radio (NPR), and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), saying that the agency would begin an investigation into the BBC's, well, \"creative\" editing of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech at the Capitol. \n\nCarr's letter went out to the general director of the BBC, Tim Davie, the CEO of NPR, Katherine Maher, and the president and CEO of PBS, Paula Kerger. NPR and PBS were included in Carr's letter because both outlets distribute BBC programming in the U.S.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump Gets Win in BBC Editing Scandal - Then Things Get Even Worse for the Network\n\nIn the letter, Carr stated that the BBC spliced “together one portion of the speech with an entirely separate portion of the speech that came 54 minutes later.” He went on to say that: \n\n“In doing so, the BBC program depicts President Trump voicing a sentence that, in fact, he never uttered. That would appear to meet the very definition of publishing a materially false and damaging statement.”\n\nTrump has said he plans to sue the BBC for up to $5 million over the deceptive edits. The scandal has forced the ousting of several BBC executives, including Davie, and the CEO of News, Deborah Turness. \n\nThe United Kingdom's telecom regulator, Ofcom, has pressed the BBC to do its own investigation into the matter, but thankfully, that wasn't good enough for Brendan Carr. who stated that he would be independently investigating whether the BBC engaged in “misleading and deceptive conduct.”\n\nCarr's letter read in part:\n\n\"The BBC has stated that it has a number of partnerships with U.S. broadcasters, including PBS and NPR, to distribute BBC programming here in America. I am therefore writing to each of you to determine whether the BBC provided either the video or audio of the spliced speech to NPR, PBS, or any other broadcaster regulated by the FCC for airing in the U.S. If so, please provide the FCC with transcripts and video of any such broadcasts of the relevant program. As you may know, broadcasters regulated by the FCC have a legal obligation to operate in the public interest. Those public interest requirements include prohibitions on news distortion and broadcast hoax. After all, the FCC has stated that “rigging or slanting the news is a most heinous act against the public interest.” [Emphasis added]\n\nThe video in question came to light in a whistleblower report authored by former Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) advisor, Michael Prescott. Prescott says he brought it to the governing board of the BBC after numerous warnings about the video clip, included in a Trump documentary, were “dismissed or ignored.\" \n\nThe BBC may find itself the latest in a series of media outlets forced to pay for their Trump-editing shenanigans. In addition to the $16 million settlement from Paramount Global and CBS over the editing in the Harris interview, in December of 2024, ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos reached a $15 million settlement, including $1 million to pay for Trump's legal fees in a libel case, in which Stephanopoulos claimed on air that Trump had been found liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll. \n\nALSO READ: BBC Engaged in Underhanded Edits of Trump's J6 Speech\n\nCarr's letter concluded with this gem, “I am committed to holding broadcasters accountable to their public interest obligations, and your prompt response will help aid me in that effort.” \n\nIt may just take the liberal media on both sides of the pond a few million dollars more to figure out there is a new sheriff in town at the FCC.\n\nThe mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

Another comment on the clip read, “He’s dancing so much. McDonald’s influencer appearance fee must be huge. What a joke of a president.”\n\nSome more memes, posts, and remarks popped up about Trump’s recent appearance. Here’s what a comment on X read, “I hate that the rest of the world has to see how far we’ve fallen.” Inputs from another X user: “It’s nothing more than entertainment and it’s not even good.”\n\nTrump’s cakey makeup in the clip has also drawn widespread attention online. “He’s wearing a pound of makeup,” noted a user. Another one observed, “Look at his pancake make-up.” Another netizen asked, “What’s with the floor stain makeup?”\n\nThis is what another X user thought: “Forgot his makeup blending sponge again.” Another comment on Trump’s make-up followed. It read, “How can you call that dancing when his feet don’t move? Wow his bronzer is working overtime today.”\n\nA quick glance at some more thoughts shared by netizens on X. “Did anyone clap?” read one. “Please, I do not want to see that… Horrible, worst dancer,” read a second. A third one read, “Honestly, I hope he’s on something. If that’s sober behavior… yikes.”\n\nTrump served fries at a McDonald’s drive-thru in Pennsylvania as part of his campaign in October last year.

And the person at McDonald’s that informed us, off the record, that she never worked there, whoever you are, we appreciate that.”\n\nTrump went on to claim that he happens to be one of the “most loyal customers” of McDonald’s. “Well, other politicians fly around on campaign planes stocked with expensive catering, when Trump Force One — prior to ascending to Air Force One, which is quite a nice plane also — we served only McDonald’s almost every time,” Trump added during his speech earlier this week.\n\nTrump went on to suggest some changes in the McDonald’s menu during his long speech at the summit. “I like the fish. I like it. You could do a little bit more tartar sauce, so please,” Trump said.\n\nDuring the McDonald’s Impact Summit, Trump also added in his speech, “I’m fighting every day to support small businesses like yours and the citizens that we all serve… we’re fighting for an economy where everyone can win—from the cashier starting her first job, to the franchisee opening his first location, to the young family in a Drive Thru line.”","summary":"Trump danced at McDonald’s Impact Summit, for which he was trolled","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-trolled-for-cringe-dance-moves-and-his-make-up-made-it-worse","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald_Trump_Dancing_1200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 20:02:27","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.407},{"id":380658210,"title":"Biden to attend Cheney's funeral","text":"Biden will be among a handful of high-profile leaders to attend the funeral at the Washington National Cathedral.

Also, we will always encourage all victims to come forward,\" she shared. \n\nAnother reporter then asked what the next steps will be regarding the release of the Epstein files and if they will be posted on the Department of Justice website. \n\nAgain, Bondi circumvented the question without giving a direct answer, stating, \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims.\"'We Will Follow the Law'The reporters in the room kept probing Bondi, with one directly asking if all of the Epstein files will be provided within 30 days. \n\n\"We will follow the law,\" she reiterated. \"The law passed both chambers last evening. It has not yet been signed. But we will continue to follow the law, again, while protecting victims, but also providing maximum transparency.\"\n\nBondi was also questioned over claims made earlier this year that the files would not be released, as a review of them didn't require any further investigation, and why there was a sudden change of course.\n\n\"Information that has come, information... there's information, new information, additional information, and, again, we will continue to follow the law to investigate any leads,\" she claimed. \"If there are any victims, we encourage all victims to come forward. And we will continue to provide maximum transparency under the law.\"Pam Bondi Told a Reporter They Were 'On Point'Bondi was also asked about if information would be sought from the Epstein estate and whether the new investigation would be limited to people such as Clinton, whom Trump had named, or if it would be a broad, open-ended investigation. \n\n\"I would refer to the Deputy Attorney General’s post that he put out on X,\" she replied. \"We’re not going to say anything else on that because now it is a pending investigation in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"But you’re on point.\"Attorney General Slammed Over Her RemarksAfter Bondi spoke, some took to X to slam the Attorney General for her remarks.\n\n\"I thought Kamala (Harris) had a word salad problem,\" one person wrote. \"It seems to have rubbed off on Pam Bondi.\"\n\nAnother user referred to her reiterated statement of following the law, adding, \"And beat it senseless.\"\n\nStill, one person took her comments to mean that the \"Full and unredacted Epstein files will not be released.\"'Release Everything'As RadarOnline.com reported, Bondi could potentially negatively impact Trump by not releasing all of the Epstein files, as she could stir up more democratic outrage. \n\nJoe Scarborough of Morning Joe voiced his thoughts on this, insisting that not releasing everything could make the \"cover-up\" worse than \"the crime.\"\n\n\"If you’re too clever by half and you try to cherry-pick it, that only keeps this crisis going for the White House and actually makes it even more intense. So, release everything,\" Scarborough insisted.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also thinks Bondi could block the release of certain Epstein-related documents even if Congress votes to have all of the material made public.\n\n\"Yes, that is a very reasonable concern, particularly when we’ve seen this so-called attorney general conduct herself and conduct the department that she runs more like the Department of Injustice,\" Jeffries fumed during his appearance on the show.He added: \"There’s no reason to believe that they’re going to behave in any kind of independent fashion, particularly now that Donald Trump has, once again, charged the Department of Justice with weaponizing the federal government against people he perceives to be his political adversaries.\"","summary":"Pam Bondi refused to reveal if the Epstein files will be released in a heated press conference that received pushback.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/pam-bondi-epstein-files-release-refuses-to-reveal-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/2ux8nSnWb/0x0/pam-bondi-epstein-files-release-refuses-to-reveal-1763577073614.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 19:15:00","author":"Matt Richards","authors":["Matt Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.661},{"id":380637328,"title":"Why a special election in Tennessee is suddenly generating unexpected attention","text":"When then-Rep. Mark Green announced his resignation from Congress in June, his Republican colleagues didn’t seem especially concerned about holding onto his seat in Tennessee. Green represented a district that Donald Trump won by 22 points; it has a partisan voter index score of R+10; and it was widely assumed that neither party would make much effort in the special election, since the outcome seemed a foregone conclusion.\nAt least, that was the conventional wisdom in June. In November, however, those assumptions have been largely usurped. The New York Times reported:\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on Tuesday with the Democratic candidate in a closely watched Tennessee special election for Congress, marking the first time since she left office that she has returned to the campaign trail for another candidate. ... Ms. Harris’s decision to campaign is the latest sign that the Dec. 2 election is being seriously contested. National party leaders now see the contest as an important test of the political environment before next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe race pits Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn against Republican Matt Van Epps, and on paper, the GOP nominee — who won his primary thanks to an endorsement from Donald Trump — looks like a shoo-in.\nBut with the winds at Democrats’ backs, a contest that wasn’t supposed to be competitive has become unexpectedly interesting — to the point that Van Epps’ campaign manager conceded to a local outlet last week that he and his colleagues are “a little” concerned, especially after seeing the Democratic performance on Election Day 2025.\nHarris’ appearance on Behn’s behalf, on the heels of Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin traveling to the local district, reinforced the fact that Democrats see an opportunity.\nRepublicans aren’t panicking, exactly, but they are opening their checkbooks for a race in which the party didn’t expect to break a sweat. The super PAC MAGA Inc., the top outside group aligned with Trump’s political operation, has begun spending money on Van Epps’ behalf, and the Republican National Committee is spending even more money on the race.\nI’m not making any predictions, but the fact that Republicans feel compelled to spend money in a Tennessee district that Trump won by 22 points is the sort of thing that should alarm GOP incumbents everywhere. For that matter, if the results in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District are close, it’s easy to imagine party-wide anxieties will reach new levels.\nEarly voting is already underway and runs through Nov. 26. Election day is Dec. 2.

She also argued that the United States is a racist and sexist nation that doesn’t cater to black women with curly hair. Her remarks sparked a wider discussion about when — or if — a woman will win the presidency, including a debate on \"The View.\" According to Sunny Hostin, it’s unlikely to happen in her lifetime. Her co-host Joy Behar, however, disagrees. Behar believes the first female president will likely be conservative. \"It’s possible that somebody like a Liz Cheney could win if she wasn’t in the doghouse with her own party right now,\" Behar said. \"She could be somebody who could run. I think maybe a conservative woman would win faster than a liberal. It’s possible.\" \"A lot of people think that,\" producer Brian Teta responded. \"A lot of people think a conservative woman might win first.\" \"A white conservative woman,\" Hostin interjected, adding that there’s still \"a lot of misogyny in this country.\" There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s take it step by step: First, Michelle Obama uses the losses of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris as proof that America is \"not ready\" for a female president. That’s nonsense. As OutKick editor Patricia Babcock McGraw argued last November, \"It’s crucial to get it right with the first woman president, and Kamala isn’t right.\" Neither was Hillary. Clinton and Harris were among the least impressive, most unlikable women in American politics. Their losses were a referendum on them, not on the country’s willingness to elect a woman. Moreover, the most recent Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden, were essentially installed by party elites. Sorry, Bernie. Twice. Second, Sunny Hostin is 57. To say a woman won’t win in her lifetime seems like a stretch. Third, Liz Cheney wouldn’t win under any circumstances. She’s a ghoulish neocon who appeals to a sliver of voters and has no real constituency. Fourth, and most importantly, Behar might actually be onto something in suggesting that the first female president will be a Republican. But it’s not because, as Hostin claimed, America is racist or misogynistic. It’s because conservative women are, on balance, normal. Liberal women are often preachy, miserable, entitled — or not actually women at all. Look at the popularity of conservative women in media: Megyn Kelly, Tomi Lahren, Laura Ingraham, Kayleigh McEnany. If the Republican Party can find a female candidate with similar values and presence, she’d have a legitimate chance to win a general election. She'd certainly a better shot than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Jasmine Crockett, the two women Democrats have positioned as their future. \"Because of my lived experience, as an Afro-Latina, I’m able to look at this world with a different prism, and I’m able to tell this country and tell this audience and tell my fellow co-hosts some uncomfortable truths. This is a country based on racism and slavery, and founded in it, there is systemic racism and misogyny,\" Hostin concluded. What a loser statement from someone in a tight race with Michelle Obama in the Victim Olympics.","summary":"The View’s Joy Behar says the first female president will likely be a conservative Republican, responding to Michelle Obama’s claim that America is “not ready&quot; for a female president.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/the-view-right-first-female-president-likely-republican","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-04-at-5.03.55-PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 18:50:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":380641290,"title":"The Don's First Buddy Returns: Trump Rubs Elon Musk's Belly and Reignites Friendship Again...

Later on, the controversial politician, Musk, and Salman shared a moment, with Trump rubbing Musk's arm.\n\nThe interaction spread on X, as one pro-Trump account drooled, \"Trump gave Elon the walk-by pat.

That is the real reason they have not been made public!\"\n\nWeeks later, Musk accused Trump of trying to hide Epstein's criminal acts, and said, \"It’s a cover-up (obviously).

Many American leaders have failed a bar exam or three. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Jerry Brown, and many more have failed the bar the first time around. \n\nKardashian was inspired to become a lawyer by her late father, famous Los Angeles attorney Robert Kardashian, who was one of O.J. Simpson's defense attorneys. He brought the \"Dream Team\" of lawyers together, who convinced a jury that the former USC and professional football player was not guilty of double murder. \n\nThe star of her family's reality TV show, The Kardashians, was also inspired to practice law after dabbling in a few successful public relations efforts to free people from prison. \n\nIn a refreshing move, California allows would-be lawyers to receive legal training at the feet of a master instead of going to law school. Kardashian has been studying this way for years and, as a 1L in 2021, passed the so-called \"baby bar\" after three tries. She also passed the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE) this year. \n\nThe 45-year-old admitted on camera that she placed her faith in soothsayers and card readers who promised that she'd pass. \n\nKim Kardashian shares her frustration in a new TikTok after failing the California bar exam, calling out psychics who told her she’d pass. pic.twitter.com/SfHiwzA2HQ— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) November 11, 2025\n\nWorse, however, Kardashian placed her faith in ChatGPT. Kardashian admitted to using the artificial intelligence program to help her study for the bar. She discovered that ChatGPT, like so many other AI programs, spews a bunch of nonsense, wrong answers, and blather. \n\nNaturally, the interwebs mocked her use of AI to get the right answers. This one is particularly funny. \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAnyone using AI for fact-checking is in for a rude awakening. AI has changed the way many people do their jobs, reporters included. But AI works off probabilities and makes up a lot of stuff called \"hallucinations.\" \n\nI use PerplexityAI and constantly have to correct it because bad info is either fed to it by a far-left whackadoodle or intel that it gleans from the ether. It sounds counterintuitive, but you've got to fact check AI with the citations it provides and that you come up with yourself and keep honing the answers and correcting it o finally achieve an answer you can trust. Grok is better, but hardly flawless. \n\nI'm in the camp that good, well-intentioned people should train AI before the crazies set the fake news narrative. \n\nI had AI make a box graph the other day of states that allow postmarked mail-in ballots to be counted after election day. I wanted the graphic for my interview with J. Christian Adams. Christian fact-checked it on the Adult in the Room Podcast in real time, saying the list left off multiple states he'd known for a fact had extended deadlines because he'd sued them.\n\nThanks, AI. For the record, I did double-check the facts, but only the facts AI had shown me. How hard was it for the AI meta crawler to find hard and fast deadline information, I reckoned. The other states were left off the chart entirely. Another AI lesson learned. \n\nI learned on a law podcast that lazy attorneys or their law clerks have been citing case law and allegedly precedent-setting legal cases that don't exist in their briefs to judges. They exist in AI hallucinations, however. \n\nWe're in dangerous territory, here, folks. \n\nAnd so it was for Kim Kardashian. \n\nKardashian—SKIMS co-founder and aspiring lawyer—revealed in a Vanity Fair interview earlier this month that she used ChatGPT to answer legal questions while preparing for her law school exams. According to Kardashian, the AI chatbot frequently provided incorrect answers, contributing to her failure in multiple legal tests. \"I use [ChatGPT] for legal advice, so when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I will take a picture and snap it and put it in there. They're always wrong. It has made me fail tests,\" the All's Fair actress said, describing how the tool’s confident, yet inaccurate, responses led directly to her setbacks.\n\nNewsweek talked to New York law professor Mark Bartholomew, who said what Kardashian \"is doing is fine,\" but \"the danger is overreliance.\" No question about that. But he cautions that, \"any responsible law student or lawyer needs to double check a chatbot’s responses to their questions.\" \n\nCaveat emptor.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/victoria-taft/2025/11/19/kim-kardashian-used-chatgpt-to-study-for-the-bar-exam-and-lets-just-say-that-ai-law-sucks-n4946111","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/213/6ea917f7-8d59-4f7e-85e6-2e1a201a52b0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 18:39:00","author":"Victoria Taft","authors":["Victoria Taft"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":380633414,"title":"Pearls before swine: Trump pigs out on epithets","text":"TOI correspondent from Washington: Growing tensions between the Trump White House and the largely liberal Washington press corps reached a flashpoint this week after the MAGA boss directed a crude insult toward a female journalist and threatened to revoke the license of a broadcast network whose reporter asked him tough questions.The first episode unfolded on November 14 on Air Force One when Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey, traveling with the President, pressed him on the release of the Epstein files. A clearly irked Trump raised his index finger and snapped: “Quiet! Quiet, piggy!” – a slur that reverberated across the media world.In a subsequent episode at the White House on Tuesday, Trump unloaded on ABC reporter Mary Bruce, who bluntly questioned him about the appropriateness of his family doing business in Saudi Arabia while he is President, and then directed a question to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the U.S. intelligence conclusion that he orchestrated the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.A furious Trump told her not to \"embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,\" as he erupted at her network ABC, calling it \"fake news\" and \"one of the worst in the business.\" When an unflustered Bruce followed up by asking why he should be waiting for Congress to release the Epstein files when he could do it himself, Trump lost his cool, complaining about her “attitude, and calling her a “terrible reporter.” He then wondered if the license of the Bruce’s network ABC should be taken away because “your news is so fake,” going so far as to suggest he would ask the FCC chair to look into it. The latest confrontations and insults fit squarely within Trump’s well-documented playbook of using epithets and bullying to control and dominate media interactions, particularly where it involves women. Since his entry into national politics, he has systematically deployed gendered slurs to undermine female crtiics who challenge his narratives, going back to the \"Nasty Woman\" epithet he deployed against Hillary Clinton during a 2016 debate, calling Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocohontos,” followed by “cackling Kamala” against Kamala Harris. Journalists like Megyn Kelly, Mika Brzezinski, and April Ryan have all been subjected to highly personal, often appearance-based, or vaguely sexualized slurs from the President, demonstrating a consistent tactical choice: when confronted by a woman asking an inconvenient question, pivot immediately to personal humiliation and denigration to deflect from the subject.Although the White House Correspondents’ Association has affirmed the necessity of asking tough questions and condemned the use of \"demeaning and unprofessional language,” most White House reporters, no angels by any account, swallow the slights to remain on the beat and maintain access in a job that has become increasingly challenging. The White House on its part has tried to overcome the liberal mainstream media’s tough posture with a makeover of the press corps, drafting several MAGA influencers whose softball questions and sycophancy would be the envy of the North Korean leader. Since his entry into national politics, Trump has manufactured hundreds of disparaging monikers for his opponents, including men. His political rogues’ gallery includes “Lyin’ Ted Cruz,” “Liddle’ Marco Rubio,” “Pencil Neck Adam Schiff,” and, “Crooked Joe Biden.” More recently critics have tried to respond likewise, for instance, calling him \"Cheeto\" \"Felonious Trump\" and “Dozing Donald” after he was seen napping during a White House event. But none of the nicknames have stuck to Teflon Don.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pearls-before-swine-trump-pigs-out-on-epithets/articleshow/125444481.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125444850/125444850.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 18:24:00","author":"Chidanand Rajghatta","authors":["Chidanand Rajghatta"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":380610552,"title":"Politico Touts Gavin Newsom as 2028 ‘Frontrunner’ but the Data Tells a Different Story","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom is receiving heightened attention as a leading potential Democrat contender for the 2028 presidential race, but emerging party data suggests a disconnect between media enthusiasm and measurable impact on the ground.\n\nA Politico column by senior political writer Jonathan Martin portrayed California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the Democrat Party’s early frontrunner for 2028, pointing to his clashes with President Trump, his use of social media to shape political narratives, and his decision to redraw California’s congressional map as factors boosting his national profile.\n\nMartin’s analysis highlighted Newsom’s appeal across both traditional and modern Democrat coalitions. He drew comparisons to Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama—candidates who rose as younger outsiders capable of running against Washington’s status quo while still reassuring party insiders. Newsom’s long-standing ties to national Democrat figures, including Bill Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, were cited as part of his political foundation, along with his early exposure to high-level networks, such as his participation in the inaugural Clinton Global Initiative.\n\n Martin also emphasized Newsom’s refusal to be boxed into ideological categories, quoting the governor’s description of himself as a “hard-headed pragmatist” who “doesn’t want to be labeled,” and highlighting his stated goal of building a party that ranges “from Manchin to Mamdani.”\n\nYet while the profile emphasizes Newsom’s rising stature, internal party research reveals a gap between perception and performance as a national messenger.\n\nHis political footing grew shakier this week after internal Democrat Party data revealed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), not the governor himself—or even former President Barack Obama—delivered the most effective message in support of Proposition 50, a key campaign Newsom was supposed to lead.\n\nNew research from Future Forward, the Democrat Party’s top super PAC, shows that Ocasio-Cortez’s ad promoting the newly enacted legislative map overhaul was the most effective pro-Prop 50 message tested. The group evaluated 16 different ads, and her direct-to-camera appeal—including a version recorded in Spanish—outperformed all others, increasing support for the measure by more than five percentage points. \n\nThe ad aired primarily on digital platforms and resonated by linking redistricting to everyday issues like health care, wages, and personal freedoms. \n\nApproved by California voters on November 4, Proposition 50 allows the Democrat-controlled legislature to redraw congressional districts mid-decade, overriding the independent redistricting commission established by voters in 2008. The new maps are projected to net Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats.\n\nThe California Republican Party has announced a federal lawsuit against Proposition 50, alleging that the ballot measure violates the 14th and 15th Amendments by unconstitutionally gerrymandering congressional districts. At a press conference, State Assemblyman David Tangipa (R) declared himself the lead plaintiff, joined by California GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin and attorney Mike Columbo of the Dhillon Law Group. Eighteen California voters are also coplaintiffs in the suit.\n\nColumbo argued that the new map favors one racial group over others, thereby violating the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause and the 15th Amendment’s protections against racial disenfranchisement. The lawsuit follows previous unsuccessful legal efforts by Republicans to block Democrat redistricting plans in the state. Newsom’s office has predicted the lawsuit will fail.\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s success in California is already fueling speculation about her future ambitions. According to Axios, her team is positioning her for a potential 2028 presidential or Senate run. Though she ranked behind Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom in a recent Noble Predictive Insights poll, Ocasio-Cortez placed third among Democrat voters with 8 percent support, ahead of other potential candidates, including Pete Buttigieg. An Emerson College poll conducted earlier this year also showed Ocasio-Cortez trailing Vice President JD Vance by just three points in a national matchup, with Gavin Newsom likewise behind Vance by a similar margin, suggesting both remain competitive figures in early testing.","summary":"CA Gov.

Steyer, who previously funneled his own funds into an unsuccessful presidential bid and efforts to impeach former President Donald Trump, is now setting his sights on the governorship.\n\nAt 68, Steyer’s vast financial resources position him as a formidable player in a crowded field. The race features over half a dozen Democrats and two Republicans, all vying in a nonpartisan primary in June. The top two candidates from this round will progress to the November election, aiming to succeed current Governor Gavin Newsom, who is limited by term constraints.\n\nIn launching his campaign, Steyer has committed to fostering economic improvement, emphasizing his track record as an advocate for consumer rights, environmental protection, and the working class.\n\n“Californians deserve a life they can afford,” Steyer declared in a video released Wednesday morning. “But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.”\n\nHis candidacy sets the stage for a showdown with other prominent figures such as progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nOnce considered a leading contender, Porter now faces a more unpredictable race. Steyer’s financial might could prove advantageous, enabling him to reach California’s nearly 40 million residents through extensive television and digital campaigns across the state’s diverse media markets.\n\nSteyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made “billions of dollars.” But he also sounded populist tones.\n\n“The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,” he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. “That’s so ridiculous.”\n\nSteyer said he would “make corporations pay their fair share again,” and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims. Steyer was a leading advocate for a 2012 ballot initiative that made it harder for corporations to avoid certain taxes. The new revenue was steered to energy improvements in the state’s public schools. \n\nIn other referendum work, Steyer helped lead the 2016 campaign that yielded a $2 per-pack tax hike on tobacco products. The money was steered to state health care programs, including tobacco-prevention efforts. And Steyer was a top opponent of a 2010 ballot initiative that would have rolled back California’s clean air and climate law, which has been viewed as a national standard on climate policy. \n\nSteyer spent millions of his own money touring the country and pushing for Trump’s impeachment during the Republican president’s first term. He then ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, spending more than $200 million of his fortune and receiving no pledged delegates. After distant finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Steyer doubled-down with an expensive push in South Carolina, only to finish a distant third behind eventual nominee and President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Steyer then ended his presidential bid, and he financially supported Biden’s reelection in 2024 before the Democrat bowed out in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian. \n\nSteyer’s latest campaign comes amid some Democrats questioning Porter’s candidacy after her combative exchanges with a TV journalist spread online in October. He has long been mentioned, along with Harris, as a potential heavyweight candidate who could join the field.\n\nHarris, who is on a national tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir, has said consistently that she has no plans to run — suggesting instead that any future campaign would be for the presidency. \n\n“I will be voting,” she told The Associated Press on Oct. 17 when asked about entering the governor’s race. Asked whether she was satisfied with the field as Porter faced her most intense criticism, Harris said only that she wanted Democrats to have “the best and the brightest running and winning” and that she was “not actively involved.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire known for his business acumen and activism, has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Billionaire Tom Steyer Announces Gubernatorial Run, Embraces Populist Agenda in California first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/billionaire-tom-steyer-announces-gubernatorial-run-embraces-populist-agenda-in-california/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tom-Steyer-is-running-for-California-governor-as-a-populist.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 17:18:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":380625422,"title":"Biden's decision to run in 2024 'erases virtually everything' he did as president, ABC anchor says","text":"ABC News co-anchor Jonathan Karl told \"The Breakfast Club\" on Monday that then-President Joe Biden's decision to run again in 2024 \"erases\" almost everything he did as president, noting there wasn't any formal meeting about the decision. \"Sometimes the biggest news is what didn't happen.

Billionaire Tom Steyer is now in a crowded field","text":"Billionaire businessman and activist Tom Steyer, who once self-financed an unsuccessful White House campaign and spent his own money advocating for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, has launched his bid for California governor as a Democrat.\n\nThe 68-year-old’s tremendous wealth immediately makes him a notable contender in a free-for-all that includes more than a half-dozen Democrats and two Republicans competing in an all-party June primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to a November general election to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. \n\nSteyer announced his candidacy with a pledge to improve economic conditions and by framing his political record as friendly to consumers, working-class voters and the environment. \n\n“Californians deserve a life they can afford,” he said in a video released Wednesday morning. “But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living.”\n\nThe approach puts Steyer on a collision course with other candidates like progressive Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. \n\nAt one time, Porter was viewed as a top contender but the contest is now seen as wide open. Steyer’s personal fortune could give him an advantage in reaching voters through television and digital advertising in an expansive state with nearly 40 million people and multiple media markets. Still, tremendous wealth has not necessarily translated to statewide electoral success in California: Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, could not unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in their 2010 matchup. Meg Whitman, a onetime CEO of eBay, spent more than $100 million of her own money in a losing governor’s campaign that same year. \n\nSteyer nodded to his wealth Wednesday, noting his business enterprises made “billions of dollars.” But he also sounded populist tones.\n\n“The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,” he said, before dismissing that notion with an expletive for bovine excrement. “That’s so ridiculous.”\n\nSteyer said he would “make corporations pay their fair share again,” and his campaign cited his previous work on ballot initiatives with similar aims.

Fox News confirmed that Harris headlined a canvassing kickoff event for the Tennessee state representative after visiting Fisk University, a historically Black college, and before hosting a book tour event for her memoir \"107 Days\" at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Tuesday's canvass kickoff marked the first time Harris has campaigned for a candidate since losing the White House to President Donald Trump a year ago, and her appearance comes as Democrats are energized from their gubernatorial wins in Virginia and New Jersey earlier this month. While a Democrat hasn't won in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District in decades, Democrats have been all in for the ruby-red district. \"Kamala Harris must’ve fallen out of the coconut tree if she thinks the AOC of Tennessee stands a chance. This is Trump country and Republicans will win Dec. 2,\" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar told Fox News Digital in a statement. SCOOP: TRUMP-ALIGNED MAGA INC. JUMPS INTO HIGH STAKES BALLOT BOX CONGRESSIONAL SHOWDOWN The former vice president told the crowd at Nashville's Hadley Park, \"Why am I in Tennessee? Because I know the power is in the South,\" according to The New York Times. The outlet noted that Harris did not mention Behn by name but urged the crowd to get out the vote. Harris first returned to the campaign trail earlier this month for a rally supporting her home state's redistricting efforts. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a special election this year to level the playing field against Trump-backed efforts to redraw congressional maps in Texas and across the U.S. ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. \"Prop 50\" passed on Election Day, handing Democrats up to five more likely blue congressional districts. DEMOCRAT AFTYN BEHN ADVANCES TO SPECIAL ELECTION IN BATTLE FOR VACANT CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN DEEP-RED DISTRICT Former Democratic National Committee vice chair and progressive firebrand David Hogg also campaigned in Nashville last weekend for Behn, the rising liberal star dubbed the \"AOC of Tennessee.\" \"Hey, young Democrats, I am incredibly excited to be here supporting Aftyn in her run for Congress,\" Hogg said in an Instagram video while flanked by two young Democrats. \"This seat is super, super youth-centric. If young people turn out and vote here, we can flip this seat and send a clear message to Donald Trump and Republicans across the country that we are done with their bulls--- and the rest of the country is.\" On Saturday, Hogg joined Behn in Nashville for a \"Young Gets It Done\" rally and canvass launch at the Metro Courthouse Public Square, encouraging young voters to get out and support Behn. According to her campaign website, Behn is a \"p---ed off social worker\" who decided to run for Congress after Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year — a megabill that included tax cuts and Medicaid reform. Behn described the bill as \"a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history.\" She is a state representative in the Tennessee House and a longtime community organizer and activist. Like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the fellow millennial is active on social media. She also authors a Substack page that is linked to the \"Issues\" tab on her campaign website. DNC Chair Ken Martin also campaigned in Tennessee for Behn last week as early voting kicked off across the state, highlighting her agenda to lower \"healthcare and grocery costs, vote to release the Epstein files, and stand up to Trump and his acolytes like Van Epps.\" Behn is vying to replace former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., in Congress. A Democrat hasn't been elected to represent Tennessee's 7th District in the U.S. House of Representatives in decades. Republican Matt Van Epps, a former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services who has worked for several state agencies, defeated an 11-candidate field to secure the Republican nomination last month. While Behn has the support of both the Democratic establishment and its progressive wing, Van Epps has secured endorsements from President Donald Trump, Republican Gov. Bill Lee and Green, who retired from Congress after the \"big, beautiful bill\" passed this year. Trump held a tele-rally for Van Epps last week in the district the president won by roughly 22 points last year. Tennessee’s 7th District includes parts of Nashville and its large suburban and rural surrounding areas. The top outside political group that supported Trump's successful 2024 run, MAGA Inc., also launched ads to support Van Epps on Wednesday, Fox News Digital was the first to report. The ads, which MAGA Inc. says will run on broadcast TV and digital and are backed by a seven-figure buy that also includes investments in get-out-the-vote efforts, are the first by the group since last year's presidential election.

Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office for a response to the RNC's comment but did not immediately hear back.

This is a moment where we reclaim this, our country.”\n\nDemocrats have been sounding bullish about the Dec. 2 special election to fill Tennessee’s Seventh Congressional District seat, despite the area’s strong tilt toward Republicans. The seat was vacated over the summer by former Rep. Mark Green (R-TN), who retired after winning reelection in 2024 by over 20 percentage points. \n\nThe race is “the most competitive race in America,” Behn said during a speech before Harris arrived. \n\nThere appeared to be a level of unexplained tension at the rally, according to the Nashville Banner, which reported Behn did not reference Harris and left the event before the former vice president arrived. And while she urged attendees to vote Democratic in the special election, Harris also did not mention Behn by name during her speech. \n\nFollowing the event, Van Epps weighed in on Harris showing up to back his rival, saying Behn would lose the race just as the former vice president lost her presidential campaign last year. \n\n“Tennesseans rejected Kamala one year ago, and two weeks from today we’ll reject radical Aftyn Behn,” Van Epps said in a post to X. \n\nThe Seventh Congressional District includes Stewart, Montgomery, and Robertson counties, as well as large chunks of Davidson and Williamson counties.\n\nWhile the district is solidly Republican, Democrats hope to ride the blue wave of victories they saw during the New Jersey and Virginia elections earlier this month.\n\nRecent internal polling from Democrats has Behn within 8 to 10 points of her Republican opponent, which she said places her in “striking distance.”\n\nJUDGE BLOCKS NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO MEMPHIS\n\nHowever, political experts have cast doubt on whether a final victory is within Democrats’ grasp.\n\n“Does that trend continue to eat into some of the lead the Republicans have? Yeah, it almost surely will.

We need to get back to basics, and that means making corporations pay their fair share again.” Steyer, 68, founded Farallon Capital Management in San Francisco and managed it for 26 years before retiring in 2012. He then shifted his focus to political activism, particularly climate change policies and youth engagement, by starting the nonprofit NextGen America. He was also a major financial backer of Proposition 50, California’s redistricting measure, which voters approved in this month’s election. Steyer ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, suspending his campaign in February after a disappointing showing in the South Carolina primary. He joins a field of at least eight candidates vying to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and widely viewed as a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2026. The Democratic field includes former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, and former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter. On the Republican side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and British-born conservative commentator Steve Hilton have launched campaigns. Former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla recently announced they would not enter the race. “Californians deserve a top-ten education state.

But within that system—and certainly the United States is very far from being a free-market economy, more so than Europe, maybe less so than some examples you could point to elsewhere in the world.\n\nAnd when we're writing in defense of it, it's those prudential questions that come in—where we are on that scale. Because we're not going back to the pre-industrial economy, right? But at the same time, you think that—\n\nI live in New York, so we'll see come January.\n\nYeah, I mean, certainly decline is a possibility. And it's often a choice that societies make. Maybe New York is doing that right now. I think we'll see how he governs, right? But what we're writing about every day and we're one as an editorial board writing about these prudential questions. Right?\n\nI know you've written about abolishing the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]. I think that's an interesting question to explore. Or if it's: Does the current configuration of the federal government, these different departments, does make sense? Should air traffic control be privatized—moving that particular service in a free-market direction?\n\nWe're both staking out a position and developing a voice as an editorial board, as our staff writers, but also hosting that debate with people whose North Star is wanting to move toward a more free and open economy. But may have differences of opinion about how far you go in that direction one way or the other.\n\nWhat about personal liberties? You've got a piece that went up a couple of days ago—and we're talking, just for people, because this may change—we're talking on November 6th, a couple of days after, 2 days, after Zohran Mamdani won the mayor race in New York City, etc.\n\nBut personal liberties—you recently had posted a piece by Leana Wen, who is a doctor, one of your contributors, who was saying like, \"Hey, forget Tylenol. Pregnant women shouldn't be smoking weed when they're pregnant,\" right? Personal liberties, how do you define that? That's a big topic.\n\nI think this is less of a textbook definition than I gave you on free markets, but it's doing what you want as long as it doesn't interfere with someone else's personal liberties and their freedom. And the same way of thinking it applies of the United States—it's a quite free country.\n\nI lived in Europe for five years, and there were certain freedoms I didn't have there. One of my parents grew up in an authoritarian country. We're certainly much more free. But you can't do anything you want anytime in the United States, and it's hosting those debates. Sometimes I'll agree with the contributor; sometimes I won't.\n\nBut there's a spectrum, right? You could talk about Tylenol or drug usage, right? Or should heroin be legal? That's one question. Should you be able to smoke heroin on the street in front of a—\n\nYeah, or do direct-to-consumer advertising on television. And the FCC should be abolished. We could go down a whole lot of different mine shafts with all this kind of stuff. What are the personal liberties that you think matter most?\n\nAnd I'm not asking you to kind of read Jeff Bezos' mind, but it's kind of amazing that the owner—since 2013—of one of the very most influential newspapers in America and the world said, \"Hey, we're scrapping the old kind of general, you know, we are a newspaper that's going to talk about a lot of different stuff,\" and \"We're going to focus—not exclusively—but we are going to focus mostly on personal liberties and free markets.\"\n\nWhat are the personal liberties that you think are most under attack in the United States?\n\nI think—well, so that's a different question. What's most important to me and what's most attacked? I'll start with what's important to me, which—I'm a bit biased here because I've spent my career in journalism—but freedom of speech is under attack, I think.\n\nIt certainly perpetuates from the dawn of the country. There've always been questions about how far you go with speech. But I'm always horrified when I see a politician—and I'll see them in the Republican or Democratic Party—it feels like it pops up: \"Hate speech is not free speech.\" That's an easy one, guys. Yes, it is, right? We can dislike it, but that's free speech. And it's remarkably important.\n\nAs someone now in a position of power to welcome voices, give them a boost inside of a major newspaper, it's something I think a lot about, because you want a robust debate. You want an interesting debate. And you want to feel uncomfortable sometimes with positions that people are taking. And it's a matter of finding out where that works.\n\nAnd I think—and I always go back to Europe because I lived there, right? They're a much darker place on free speech than we are. But we'll see flashes of European-style thinking on speech. And that's nothing compared to the Chinese Communist Party or what might be in a country like Iran.\n\nBut we should compare ourselves probably more to England, right—or the U.K.—which is currently arresting tens of thousands of people a year for tweets and things like that. And we had—I mean, I guess, let's sharpen this a little bit, talking about free speech—because we went through an era when Joe Biden was in the White House where, you know, we learned later that Biden administration officials were jawboning all kinds of social media platforms, who oftentimes—I don't want to say in their defense or in Biden's defense—but they were also asking for guidance from the White House: \"Is this hate speech? Is this COVID wrong-thinking?\"—things like that. And working in cahoots to clamp down on stuff.\n\nA lot of—if not legal—actions against speech, then really pushing a social envelope—that is a bad phrase—but pushing people to ostracize anybody who dared think outside of a very narrow range.\n\nNow we have people in office in the Trump administration—including Trump's FCC head, including Trump himself—saying certain late-night comedians, \"who really nobody's watching, should be fired. They're no talent. The FCC should do something about that.\" Pam Bondi, the attorney general, actually recently, in recent memory said, \"Hate speech is not protected speech,\" briefly—things like that.\n\nAre we in a worse place with free speech under the current administration and climate of opinion than we were under Biden? Or is it just, you know, it just keeps getting worse?\n\nI think we're in a spiral, and it's a bad one. I was talking to one of our editorial writers the other day, and he's telling me, \"You know, we're definitely a democracy, but it's like we're becoming a democracy where you vote for which censors you want to be in charge.\" Pick your censor, and those will be the people who bully the big media companies into behaving a certain way, right?\n\nWhether it's one of the streamers on COVID, right, as you said, or a comedian that a lot of people weren't paying a lot of attention to until he was being bullied by the government. And it's one of the things that concerns me.\n\nI think about how we can get out of that spiral. And maybe that takes a politician with a forward-looking view who can kind of declare a truce. But I'm generally very optimistic about America in general, our ability to move on. When you read enough American history, we've been here before. That's certainly something that's happened. But we're clearly in one of those waves—or in one of those spirals; I don't want to mix up my metaphors—where we're escalating.\n\nIt's the censorship questions, but there's also lawfare, right? You don't want to end up in a position where you're a country like Pakistan or South Korea, where there's a very good chance you go to prison after you're done being in charge of the country—and the opposition comes in.\n\nHow we get out of that spiral is something that we're grappling with as a group of journalists working together to come up with a voice.\n\nYeah, do you feel like journalists are part of the problem? And, you know, I guess we always want to be part of the problem, because then at least maybe we won't have our jobs replaced as quickly. \n\nBut I mean, there seem to be so many people in the media who are very quick to be like, \"You've got to shut down this person's speech.\" \"Like, of course, I won't be touched by it.\" Or, \"Now that I'm in power, we're going to go after these people who kind of screwed with me later.\"\n\nI mean, I was just talking with somebody the other day about journalism shield laws. And I can remember when these were a thing—I would talk to kind of student journalism groups, and I'd be like, you know, \"If the government is going to say, ok, if you're an accredited journalist, then you get certain protections, that's a really bad thing.\" Because it means the government gets to say, \"You're a journalist and you're protected. You're not a journalist,\" and somehow you get lesser rights. And I feel like we haven't gotten out of that yet. It seems very strange to me that more journalists are not just rock-solid in favor of massive First Amendment rights all over the place for everybody.\n\nRight. And you get into a lot of gray areas and nuances when it comes to that. And I think that's also where it becomes very dangerous. There's a big controversy this week—I don't know when this airs.\n\nIt'll be like that was a million years ago. Like, \"Oh, woolly mammoths were seen in Bethesda,\" or something, yeah.\n\nRight. And I think you want to be very careful to not be policing the way that people think. Right? At the same time, you also need to recognize the way that William F. Buckley did when he was running National Review. \"You know, we don't want lunatics in our movement.\" And National Review—it's a smaller magazine—but when he stood up to the John Birch Society, I think that's something that decades later… now, there's some debate about how far did he go in standing up to them?\n\nThat's right, yeah.\n\nBut the general concept of: it's ok to say when there's something that's clearly out of bounds that, \"This is not what we're associated with.\" But it shouldn't be that you should go to prison, or you should be fined, or you should be banished from society. It should be: you can go write somewhere else, because this is our movement, and this is what we're trying to do. I think any publication—you have your sets of norms, your boundaries, and what you're advocating for. And that's a separate thing than government coercion.\n\nWhat troubles me is when I see journalists who advocate for government coercion and this sort of thing. People who think…I think it just has to be short-term thinking of: \"My team will always be in charge and will never lose power.\" And it's a nice thing—one of my favorite things about America is that power changes pretty frequently, actually. And sometimes the new team does some things I like, I don't like. But it's a comforting thought—instead of living in an authoritarian state or even a place like Japan, where the LDP is just sort of perpetually in power and different factions trade off.\n\nSo, if we can go to today's page, I think—and this is kind of just to get a sense of your sensibility, because you mentioned National Review and I appreciate you saying there are questions about how far did Bill Buckley go in really reaming out the John Birch Society. I'm with Matthew Dallek, who wrote a great book, a biography of the John Birch Society a couple of years ago, where he says, \"you know, that's more Buckley's version of things than reality.\" But that's neither here nor there, because my point is National Review is a viewpoint magazine, or a viewpoint platform—same as Reason, same as The Nation.\n\nWe have thought about newspapers—with the possible exception of The Wall Street Journal—as kind of being bigger tents than that. Right? So like you are going to be supporting personal liberties or defending personal liberties and free markets every day, but you're not, you know, you're not a movement newsletter, right? So that has got to be challenging for you, right? To figure out what you're going to emphasize.\n\nAnd I just want to point—like you have on today's page, there's a— which I just had up and now I can't find it. You have an editorial up, \"Elizabeth Warren Knows Better,\" and this is where you're attacking—this is from the house editorial of The Washington Post. Where Elizabeth Warren is basically bitching and moaning that YouTube TV did not carry a game on Monday Night Football. Can you explain what your basic case there is, why she's wrong, and how do you decide that's something that we're going to weigh in on?\n\nI'll start by saying the editorial page—the opinion section—I've been here for four months, and we've made tremendous progress, tremendous change. It's still a work in progress. We're still recruiting people. And that's not a caveat to explain what that editorial—I actually quite like the editorial that we ran.\n\nSo Disney and YouTube are in a dispute—YouTube TV—they're in a dispute. Disney would like more money to air ESPN on YouTube TV. YouTube TV does not want to pay that much. And so it's a question about—it's a business dispute between two corporations who are having a negotiation, and things have gotten tough. And so on Monday, when I turned on Monday Night Football to watch, as I usually do—as tens of millions of other Americans—I couldn't find it on my YouTube TV.\n\nAnd the senator from Massachusetts, what she argued was, \"The problem is the companies have gotten too big and they can keep nice things from you because the companies are so big and they're very mean.\" And I don't think that's an unfair interpretation of the tweet.\n\nWe saw this—and we covered the bigger stories: the election results, different foreign policy issues. You can see the mixed ones in the editorials. But we think that when people who should know better, and this is a former law professor and adviser to corporations before she had her pitchfork-populist turn, also a contributor to something, I like to bring this up all the time—a contributor to something called the Pow Wow Chow cookbook, where she offered up her grandmother's variation on some kind of Native American dish. \n\nRight? I think she was 1/64th. Right?\n\nYeah, the troubling part about it was—so it's, you know, you want to beat up on corporations, that's fine. Free speech, go for it, senator. But then she said, \"And Donald Trump is letting them.\" And I'm old enough to remember when Senator Warren was very concerned—maybe I'm sure she was—let me rephrase. I'm old enough to remember when a lot of Democrats, and I think principled Republicans, were worried that Donald Trump was getting too involved in television decisions and saying who should be on air and who shouldn't.\n\nAnd so we just wanted to step out and inform our readers quickly—I just think it was 300, 350 words—and say, \"Look, this is a business dispute. The last thing you need is government getting involved in it.\" And there's a never-ending supply of senators, congressmen, congresswomen, governors who make economically illiterate statements that might stir some populist passion. I don't like the word populist—I shouldn't say populist—because I don't know what populist means. But stir some passion in voters and fire up their base.\n\nAnd I think that one value we can do—and it's not the core product by any means—but one way we can add value is by pointing it out, explaining what's really happening, and suggesting that maybe there's something else going on here. And our readers can be—\n\nAnd you point out in the editorial that Disney, among other things, owns Hulu, which is a direct competitor of YouTube. And like nobody in contemporary America is suffering from a lack of stuff to watch, right?\n\nDo you think that we—so that's one way that the government is kind of getting in people's business where it just doesn't need to be. It doesn't make any sense, almost from any perspective. How will you guys—and I think I know the answer to this, because I've already seen it on the editorial page, both from columnists or opinion guest writers or things—when Donald Trump starts to say, \"OK, the American government needs to own a piece of corporations either as a condition of them getting a merger, or of them exporting things to China, or bringing things into the country with a special exemption.\" Do you see this all as like, if we're in a bad space, a bad time for free speech generally, we're also in a really bad time for free markets, it seems?\n\nAbsolutely. I think one tricky part of all of this is that no party's hands are clean when it comes to this. Now, traditionally the Democrats were the party that could kind of use state power, push the limits. And Republicans were supposed to be the grown-up party that said, \"No, we'll be a little more prudent.\" One is the party of free stuff. One is the party of growth and opportunity. That's sort of the myth that a lot of Republicans tell themselves.\n\nAnd I think there are many times in history where it was actually true. Donald Trump, who is a very talented politician and also not a very ideological person—as we all know—there are certain things he's really felt strongly about for a long time, like tariffs, but not a deeply ideological person. I think when he talked—I think it was about the Intel stake—he was asked about it. And he said, \"Yeah, of course I'm going to try to get what I can get.\" That's how he sees these things.\n\nI won't predict what he's thinking, but the end result of that is, ok, maybe you're able to do that now. And I don't know what benefit the U.S. gets from having a piece of Intel. Certainly it's a problem for Intel in the long run, even if there's some help or preferential treatment now.\n\nBut again, eventually Democrats will be in power again. And a lot of Republicans who are cheering this on are not going to be thrilled with what Democrats do when they take stakes in companies or which companies they're bullying. And that's just a bit of prudence that we're trying to share with our audience. And when they see this, they might think, \"Oh, it's interesting,\" or \"Things are changing. Let's not be free market fundamentalists.\" But there are really good long-run reasons why you want to avoid getting into this business when you're the government.\n\nDo you see that broad kind of province or edict to support personal liberties and free markets—I mean, is it ultimately the bounds of what you're talking about is a kind of basic classical liberalism or libertarianism?\n\nYou know, and I'm thinking of other things that are coming up today where you're starting to see Republicans talk about, \"Oh yeah, it would be great to get rid of the filibuster,\" because we wanna end this government shutdown on our terms—as if earlier this week they didn't get at least a little bit of a wake-up call to say, \"Hey, you may not even be in control of Congress this time next year.\"\n\nOr I saw one of the senators from Alabama—Senator Football from Alabama—talking about why it's great that we're about to go, apparently, gonna go in to teach Nigeria how to defend its people and things like that, In a way that this was the exact opposite of what Donald Trump was running on for a second term. I mean, are you essentially—is the opinion section essentially becoming broadly classical liberal or libertarian?\n\nYeah, I mean, I'd say, right, small-l libertarian, or a classical liberal, right? There's all kinds of nomenclature that you can use. I'd say fundamentally, it's a nonpartisan project. And that's something that's new. That's sort of our very clear attitude.\n\nWhen I'm facilitating conversations with the editorial board, or if I'm meeting with the op-ed editors and we're thinking through stories, it's never about which party will be advantaged or which one we prefer in general. Right? So that's the baseline: it's nonpartisan. And free markets and personal liberties are the North Star.\n\nSo there may be ways that we agree with libertarians. It's funny—I covered the Libertarian Party convention last year, when I was still at The Economist, and I love Libertarian Party activists. I remember there was this table with buttons that you can steal—or not steal. So you could pick up—\n\n…you could liberate. \n\nAnd there were just like different libertarian slogans. It was like, \"Sell the Grand Canyon,\" \"Legalize buying AR-15s from vending machines.\" It was just the most libertarian stuff possible.\n\nSo yeah, you know, I'm probably not that far. Like, I think the federal government probably has some role to play in preservation—things like the national parks. I'm not pure libertarian in the way that some of my friends I made at—\n\nSome of the people on this interview may be, yes.\n\nYeah, so I would shy away from that particular label, but there are plenty of times where I'll agree a lot more with the libertarians than I do with the Republicans. I say \"I,\" you know, but also institutionally in our room, it's a wide range. And I think of myself as facilitating a conversation and getting us to the best answers institutionally—and also the most interesting debate.\n\nBut yeah, classical liberal—I think that's a huge tent, by the way, under classical liberalism.\n\nOh, absolutely. And you know, it's interesting. In my experience over the years—and particularly over the past three or four years—the ranks of classical liberal people, which basically means people who believe in, you know, kind of most personal liberties and mostly free markets, that's starting to get filled up from a lot of people who would have, maybe a decade ago, would have considered themselves liberal or progressive.\n\nAnd then, particularly after the reaction in America to October 7, a lot of free speech–kind of liberals started moving toward the center. Which they are not social conservatives; they're very libertarian—and all small-ls and things like that. So I think you're on to something with the idea that being classically liberal, or small very, very small-l libertarian, contains multitudes in a way that it didn't really 15 years ago.\n\nHow is the audience responding to this? \n\nI've read over the past couple of years there were various reports claiming that The Washington Post, between 2020 and the end of 2023, lost half of its readership. It went from 100 million unique visitors online in a given month or given day to 50. Part of that was seen across the news industry broadly—just that when Trump was kicked out of office after 2020, it's like ok nobody was interested in reading about politics anymore.\n\nBut I also—supposedly, and this was in The Washington Post—when The Washington Post refused to endorse a candidate—and obviously by that, meaning that it was expected to endorse Kamala Harris in 2024—it lost 250,000 subscribers.\n\nI know part of what you have to do is build a new section that is pointed in this particular direction, but also you have to win over a new readership or win over the existing one. How are people responding to the changes since you've been at the helm of the opinion section?\n\nWe still have quite a lot of readers and subscribers. I'll say, I've worked at smaller places, and it's a robust audience. And you know, when you write something in The Post, someone notices it.\n\nThat said, it needs to get bigger. And the audience now is overwhelmingly left-leaning. Everybody knows that as the data is available.\n\nAnd that's for the whole paper, not…\n\nYeah the entire paper. Probably the opinion section. I don't have the breakdowns in front of me. And we value those subscribers. A lot of them have been loyal subscribers for decades.\n\nAnd we're not trying to push them away and make this a MAGA project where they'll be deeply offended by everything we write. At the same time, I don't think it's a great business model to have one sort of mono—it's not entirely monolithic—but one very similar audience. And so we're trying to continue to serve our existing subscribers, who we value, while also looking at people—I don't know, like my dad—who frankly never would have subscribed to The Washington Post, who just wouldn't have trusted it, and say, \"Look, we're doing things different at the opinion section. There's going to be a lot of stuff you disagree with, but you ought to find it interesting. We'll challenge you and educate you. And there may be things that you find that you're agreeing with that you wouldn't have seen before. Or you might've seen here or there, but not as frequently.\"\n\nAnd one thing I've noticed that's been very encouraging, when I break down the data, is that a lot of stories are doing particularly well with non-subscribers. There are people who were kind of looking past The Post in the past and now are giving it another look.\n\nAnd this is a long process, right? It takes years. You're going to have to write editorials hundreds of times on different subjects where people start to realize, \"Oh, this is interesting. This is something I'd actually pay for.\"\n\nSo we're not taking anything for granted—whether it's the people we need to win over or the people we want to keep and remain happy subscribers. And it's a tough balancing act. Where do you fit in? And some folks simply will see stuff that we're publishing now that I think is interesting and engaging, and they'll disagree with me, and they wanna leave.\n\nBut I think overwhelmingly, by having this big tent, hosting this robust debate, we're building a stronger audience. And some of the early returns—things I'm seeing in the data—leave me very optimistic. In the long run, that's a good move for us. I think for the country, for society, it's helpful to have an opinion section like this—but also for the business.\n\nYeah, well, you know, it's interesting because basically, there's The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. If we were talking 20 years ago, you might throw in the L.A. Times and the Chicago Tribune, but newspapers as places that everybody gathers are fading.\n\nAnd in a way, you've got The Wall Street Journal is conservative—it's good for free markets—and they've been strongly critical of Trump. The New York Times editorial page has its token conservatives, occasional libertarians, but it's reliably liberal.\n\nDo you think The Washington Post will kind of square that difference? You've been critical of Trump. If you look at the page today—and again it's November 6 as we're talking—there's a lot of criticism of MAGA. The leading piece is by Jeff Flake, the former senator who got chased out of office. I interviewed him only a couple of weeks ago; I was visiting his Institute of Politics at Arizona State. He got chased out of office by Donald Trump.\n\nDo you think you will be the kind of libertarian place—and again, not in a doctrinaire way—that will, not split the difference between The Times and The Journal, but will offer up real, hardcore defense of personal liberties and free markets?\n\nYou could pick the precise language, but I do see an opportunity there. And we should separate out the philosophical and then also just a regional and sort of cultural space.\n\nSo philosophically, I think we can be genuinely nonpartisan. I think both The Times and The Journal do good—like you said, they'll run a mixture of voices—but I think we can really own that space in a way no one else does.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm not looking to just try to steal market share from other papers. I think that there are a lot of people in America—some of my colleagues joke, there's one example I always go to, I don't know where it came to me—I say \"a dentist in Tucson.\" It's kind of a particular individual. I have some family in Tucson—they're not dentists—but you know—\n\nAnd you've got to be careful, because a dentist from Arizona is Paul Gosar, the congressman who was MAGA before MAGA. I don't think you're ever going to win him over.\n\nDoes he represent Tucson though? \n\nI don't know if it's Tucson. It's somewhere close around, but…\n\nOk, well, a variety of professions, a variety of places that aren't on the coast. Folks who wouldn't necessarily be subscribing to a big newspaper. And part of that is just writing in plain language. When we write—let's call it lifestyle content, or more or less focused on politics or policy—but the other offerings that you can have in an opinion section, things that appeal to them, that they don't just think, \"That's really weird,\" or \"What is that?\"\n\nReaching folks like that, who either are kind of turned off by news or maybe get some news from Instagram here or there, and finding ways to meet people where they are. I think that's our bigger opportunity. Rather than thinking, \"Oh, where do we sort of triangulate ourselves between the other similar institutions?\" \"Where can we go that they're not going as aggressively as we are? And how can we serve that audience?\" I think that's a big part of it.\n\nAnd the nonpartisanship and the sort of general American values of, \"Hey, leave me alone. I like free enterprise.\" A normal person doesn't wake up and say, \"I support free enterprise,\" but they have that instinct of like, \"No, I'd like to start a business and be left to my own devices.\"\n\nAppealing to that kind of American instinct and that American tradition. That I think is a huge opportunity for us. And that's one place where we're looking and where we're pushing hard.\n\nYou know, that's a good segue. I like to talk to people about where they're from and how they kind of came to their beliefs. So I think that's a natural segue.\n\nSo you're from Pomona, California—famously smoggy Pomona. Or it used to be. Nothing is smoggy really in the way it used to be because of progress and whatnot. But you're from Pomona? What was it like growing up in Pomona, and how does being from California—which, you know, until Texas started eating its lunch, was the definition of the American dream… You went to U.C. Irvine as well, a great university in the premier state university system in America. The U.C. system was part of the postwar American dream that California represented. How does where you're from inform who you are today?\n\nWell, it's funny you mention smog, because my father—he actually wrote about this once for a newspaper—he was an air quality regulator.\n\nAnd he's an engineer, and that's what he did for, I think, a little less than 30 years. He worked at the air quality regulator.\n\nSo being in Pomona would be like being an actor on Broadway, right? It's like where you want to be.\n\nAnd my parents moved there to be closer to his work, actually. Yeah, indeed. And I'd say, one, we had a middle-class upbringing. My parents were engineers. And it was a nice, pleasant place to grow up in Southern California.\n\nYou weren't totally shielded from life in the way that I think maybe Irvine is, where you'd have—there was crime and violence in Pomona. You know, not unimaginable…\n\nSo my father, in his career working at a regulator, it kind of made me skeptical of state power pretty early on. And I think it also made him skeptical of state power. From a young age, he was kind of teaching me the ways of classical liberalism. I don't think he would call it that, but there was a lot of reading in our house.\n\nWe subscribed to The L.A. Times when it was a really significant, meaty print product that you'd get, and you could spend hours reading it. And we also had a lot of magazines in the house. It was just a lot of print products—reading. And also things like National Review, right? Things like The Wall Street Journal. I'm not sure if The Post came across our direction very much back then, just being on the West Coast. And The Post was a very different paper in the '90s than it was now and in recent years.\n\nBut certainly had some interaction with columnists, right? Like George Will—still writing for us. Real gem. But that was kind of the intellectual and cultural ferment that I grew up in.\n\nDid you go to—were you part of any kind of student networks or anything as you were moving through Irvine?\n\nYeah. So in Irvine—I mean, I barely attended Irvine. I went to classes, I almost flunked out because I got a job at a radio station. And you can imagine how my engineer parents felt when I was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to switch out of biology and do something else.\" And, \"Don't worry, I'll go into this radio station to make, you know, eight bucks an hour, nine bucks\"—whatever it was. I don't remember exactly.\n\nBut that was the start of my journalism career—it when I was 19. I worked at KFI AM 640—\"More Stimulating Talk Radio.\" And actually, there's a Reason connection there because Lisa Kennedy—who we all of course just call Kennedy, she was at KFI at the time. We overlapped and I got to know her a little bit when I was just a fill-in producer on different talk shows at KFI.\n\nYeah, I did that. But as a student, I did policy debate. I was in this Junior State of America, which was part Model U.N., part student government, part debate society. And I got to meet a lot of really interesting students—some of whom I'm still friends with to this day.\n\nAnd that really shaped a lot of the kind of debate. And I don't want, \"intellectual\" is too generous to describe, you know, 15 year old me—but the kind of mental exercises I was engaging in, that started early with activities like that.\n\nYou, early on, you worked at RealClearPolitics, which is an interesting site—it's coded right, and I think for some legitimate reasons, but it does fantastic work across the board. And you were the Vatican correspondent for Rome Reports. You had mentioned living in Europe. You did that for The Wall Street Journal as well, right?\n\nBut what was Rome Reports and what was it like covering the Vatican?\n\nRight. Well, I was working at RealClear, and I really liked it. Carl Cannon was a great mentor and editor and boss. He gave me my first shot in D.C.\n\nBut I started—I don't know, \"wanderlust,\" I don't really like that word—but I knew I wanted to go out and like see the world. And so I found Rome Reports, a job posting for them on journalismjobs.com. I'd never heard of it. It's actually a Spanish news agency. They use it in English, but it's run by Spaniards based in Rome.\n\nAnd so I had the great experience of learning how to speak Spanish while I was living in Italy—which is just endlessly confusing. Because in the office we would speak Spanish, and then I'd go out and try to… they're different languages. People always say, \"Oh, they're very similar.\" They're different languages.\n\nBut covering the Vatican was a real…it was a real blessing.\n\nWhat year? What was the range of time?\n\nMost of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. It was a one-year contract. So Francis was established—he came in in March '13. So at that point, I think I covered his second-year anniversary. He'd kind of gotten comfortable as a pope, people were getting to know who he was.\n\nAnd look, I was not like interviewing the pope or, you know, deep in Vatican intrigue. I was—\n\nYeah, you weren't during the—\n\nYou weren't doing the Dan Brown, the Da Vinci Code, Skullduggery. Are you Catholic, and does that inform what you do or what you think?\n\nYeah, I'm a Catholic. It's not a huge part of what I talk about, but of course, I was raised Catholic, confirmed Catholic, and I still identify as such.\n\nI have five of seven Catholic sacraments, so I am lapsed, and so my education bears no responsibility for my failure to remain Catholic.\n\nSomebody like Francis strikes me as an interesting figure, right, from this question of personal liberties and free markets. Because he was critical of personal liberties and free markets, but he was also deeply Christian in a way that it seems like he presented a challenge to a lot of, I think, really devout American Catholics.\n\nAnd Catholicism is a weird thing to think about because traditionally it's not the American faith. The American faith, if anything, was kind of anti-Catholic. But now Catholics comprise the single largest religious group in America.\n\nIs that—I'm not sure where I'm going with this—but like is that part of what makes America interesting but also complicated? Where your faith kind of dictates one thing, your ideology kind of dictates something else. And then it's kind of like, how do you sort these things out?\n\nThis is something that I've thought about since I was a Vatican reporter, really. And Francis is a particularly interesting case, because in addition to having covered the Vatican, I've spent a decent amount of time in Argentina. And I know you all are very interested in [Javier] Milei, and so am I.\n\nWho's very Catholic—well, now is supposedly converting to Judaism—but has been quite Catholic.\n\nI think he said—I can't remember the exact translation, so I might be getting it wrong—he said something like, \"Well, I'm a Catholic, but sometimes I do Jewish things.\" Only the way Milei could say it, right?\n\nSo that means he would never be hired by the Heritage Foundation now, right?\n\nWell, with Francis, I think his interpretation of what Catholicism is, is the kind of state capitalism or the very corrupt version of capitalism that defined Argentina for decades. And it's one way that the Peronists were able to have such political success.\n\nHe sort of equates capitalism with greed and theft and corruption in a way that—it's… I don't want to sound like a socialist saying, \"Well, true capitalism hasn't really been tried.\" But it has been tried in a lot of very vibrant and successful societies—but not so much in Argentina, or at least not for a long time. And I think that distorted Francis' worldview a bit.\n\nIf you look at other popes, like Leo—who I find incredibly impressive—and I should say Francis, I didn't know him personally. I met him once, shook his hand, and we took a photo together. But they're all—like, to become pope, it's sort of de facto, you're an incredibly impressive and interesting person. A few centuries back, there were some really bad ones. But we've been on a good run for a while now.\n\nBut someone like JP2 or even Benedict were just such worldly…they were real, true scholars. And Francis very much was—you know, he studied in Germany briefly, didn't like it, got homesick, went back to Argentina. And he was very much in that world. And I think that limited his worldview in some ways, and it made him a more vociferous critic of capitalism than he ought to have been.\n\nNow, that said, there can be complicated questions for politicians when it comes to their faith and exercise in public office. That's not a new debate. And if you're a Catholic, that should be the most important thing to you, and it should come before anything else. But that's not a politically viable thing to say, as JFK learned—and everyone else, every other Catholic we've had in office eventually encounters.\n\nAnd you saw this when Francis came to the U.S., a lot of politicians didn't quite know what to do. I think that was about 10 years ago—I think it was November—it was in the fall or the winter of '15. And that's something that there are no firm or concrete or easy ways out of it. People will make judgments about how to reconcile those two.\n\nBut I think in some ways, Catholicism, sort of like classical liberalism, doesn't neatly imprint onto the American political spectrum. And that is something that frustrates people endlessly, especially politicians. Whoever.\n\nAnd ideally—I think I believe this about libertarianism or classical liberalism, probably also about religion—it doesn't dictate your partisan, certainly not your partisan affiliations. It might inform them, but these are things that come before those things, which are worldly and crass and vulgar and maybe necessary.\n\nYou also worked at The Wall Street Journal, The Dispatch, which is—what was it like working at The Dispatch? And I know…\n\n[Audio Cuts out]\n\n…twin sides of The Weekly Standard. It's kind of like The Weekly Standard broke up into two bands that don't like each other very much anymore.\n\nWhat was it like? Because The Dispatch is—they're anti-Trump, but they're maybe anti–anti-Trump at the same time. I don't know. What was your experience at The Dispatch like?\n\nYeah, these sort of anthropological dissections of conservatism—I certainly engage in them from time to time because I think it's interesting. When I talk to people who aren't in politics or journalism, sometimes they're sort of baffled at the level of detail we can go into.\n\nBut I would just say I have nothing but good things to say about The Dispatch. I was there for a year, before I went to The Economist. Steve Hayes and Jonah Goldberg—I have tremendous respect for. They treated me very well and gave me opportunities to be a manager.\n\nBut what I really admired about those two, and the general ethos of The Dispatch, was that they didn't let Trump change their policy views. Right?\n\nThere's a range of views about how—if you're a conservative—how do you treat Donald Trump, right? And how do you interact with him? I think a lot of people over the past decade have just changed their policy views and their view of the world—whether that was more to the left or more to the right—in response to Trump. And also, Trump has sort of scrambled left-right distinctions.\n\nTotally, yeah. \n\nThat gets more complicated. But I think Steve and Jonah—their views on policy, and the people who were working there, including me—we tried to keep them the same, regardless of what the president was saying on any given day.\n\nSo I had a great year there. I was the executive editor—so helping them—the boring stuff like workflow and editing process. I was helping them implement things like that.\n\nBut the broader project—I was very proud to be part of. And I should say, Jonah, Steve, and I—other folks who were working there, David French—we overlapped for a few months. There are times where I have disagreements with them on policy or on what exactly you'll make, but we're in the same galaxy in a helpful way.\n\nAnd the person who succeeded me as executive editor, Declan Garvey—I think really highly of Declan. And I continue to read The Dispatch, and I think they're a real net positive contributor in a time when there's a lot of toxicity or unhelpful contributions to the discourse. \n\nThe Dispatch still does a great job.\n\nThe Economist, how did you like working there? This is a publication which my colleague at Reason, Matt Welch, when he first came over to join Reason and I asked him, you know, \"How do you define yourself?\" He wouldn't call himself a libertarian—I think he does now—this was in the early 2000s. He called himself an Economist-style liberal, meaning a European liberal or a kind of classical liberal.\n\nA lot of people think that The Economist has really kind of gone left over the past 20 years or so. What was your experience working there, and how does that inform what you're doing at The Washington Post?\n\nSo there's one thing I learned from The Economist…I learned a lot. I was there a little under two years, and I had no plans to leave. Then I came to this job because it was such an amazing opportunity.\n\nBut one thing I really liked about The Economist—and this is kind of a little more in the weeds, but it's something that I really took—is they do a great job. Zanny, the editor, and my boss came, John Prideaux, who I also really loved working for and respect. They do a great job of spotting talent—not just those two, but management in general.\n\n\"Oh, you're working at a think tank,\" or \"Maybe you're an English teacher,\" or \"You're a trader,\" \"You work in an investment bank,\" and \"You've got a little bit of talent for writing—we can train you up and teach you how to do journalism. But what we want is your understanding of the world and your knowledge.\" And there are no taboos about hiring people who didn't work in journalism and bringing them to this very prestigious publication with 182 years of history.\n\nI think they and—yeah, it's like them and The Spectator, the British Spectator, maybe Scientific American—these are like the oldest magazines around.\n\nYeah. So that's just one thing now that I'm in a place where I'm thinking about: how do we build out our team? The Economist really had a great model for: Can you write well? And now I'm thinking, can you do a podcast well in addition to writing well? But what do you know about the world? What can I learn from you?\n\nThat's what I'm always thinking about when I'm seeking out talent to bring to The Post.\n\nBut The Economist, more broadly, and that as a project…The Economist has changed over the decades, right? It's still, I think, true to classical liberalism. It was founded in opposition to the Corn Laws in the 19th century. It's still very much opposed to protectionism.\n\nBut it goes up and down exactly on the details and the nuances of different economic policy. They'll endorse Democrats sometimes, sometimes they'll oppose Republicans.\n\nBut what I really also appreciated about working there was—people knew I came from The Journal and The Dispatch, which were traditionally viewed as center-right—and they valued the perspective that I had.\n\nAs a journalist, I was trying to write objectively with The Economist, with a little bit of flavor. Like when I covered the Libertarian convention for The Economist, getting those great details. It was a really fun piece.\n\nThey also had a really robust internal debate. When they'd go on editorial calls—I won't get into the details of any of them, because those are all off the record—but I could tell that the leaders there were trying to facilitate a conversation with this immense amount of expertise that was assembled at a really remarkable publication like that.\n\nAnd at The Post, that's another lesson—when I'm leading the editorial board calls or meetings, sometimes I'll stake out a position that I don't really have, just to stress test it.\n\nYou know, we'll see what happens in the next two weeks, but it looks like al Qaeda might take over Mali. So I said, \"You know guys, do we care if al Qaeda takes over Mali? Do the Malians want that?\" And I'm pretty sure they don't. And I'm pretty sure it would be bad. But let's actually not take anything for granted.\n\nRight. And that's also a separate question from what does that entail for America.\n\nExactly, exactly. And trying to bring out those conversations—And that was a skill in all the places I had sort of picked up, but The Economist really brought it into focus. And it's something that I think The Post can do very well. So we can learn from that particular publication.\n\nYou've hired a bunch of people—many of them will be known to readers of Reason, like Dominic Pino and Kate Andrews recently. You've shed people—Washington Post stalwarts left before you were announced or anything, including the editor of the section when Jeff Bezos publicly said he offered him to continue, David Shipley.\n\nKaren Attiah, who was a columnist for The Washington Post, left not too long ago, basically saying that she got fired.\n\nAre you firing people because they don't fit into the new framework or they don't go along with it?\n\nI can't get into individual personnel matters, right? So I can't speak about any particular case.\n\nI can say in general, when I look at the team that we have today, I'm very confident we're aligned. We're rowing in the same direction, and I'm quite happy. Every day I come into work, and I think we have a collegial atmosphere. We have rich debate, but also intellectual cohesion within that debate.\n\nWe hired Dominic, who I think—for my money—is the best writer on free markets under 30 in the country. We hired Kate Andrews from The Spectator in the U.K. Later this month—maybe by the time this comes out—Kareen Hattar from The Boston Globe is coming. There are more conversations.\n\nSo we're building out people who we think fit the culture that we're trying to build. Collegiality is hugely important to me as an editor.\n\nAnd that, you don't mean just that they're not jerks in meetings—but also that they're interested in intellectual kind of debate and give and take to get to a better understanding of an issue.\n\nYeah, absolutely. I want this to be a place where people are excited about the direction—not resigned to it, but excited. And I think that's the team that we have now and the team that we're building. That's where we're at. And it makes coming into work every day an absolute joy.\n\nThere's a lot of laughter in our meetings, I'll say. Because people can have a very healthy push and pull. For more out libertarian people, it's like, \"Oh, are we going to get rid of the FDA now?\" You know? And it's like, not enough. You can kind of joke about that.\n\nAnd it's just a great team, and it's going to be continuing to grow in the coming months.\n\nTwo quick things to finish up with. One, how old are you?\n\nOk, so you are young. Thirty-three, it's a bad year for people. It's a tough year for people. Well, it was a good year for the country, because that's when Prohibition was repealed—1933.\n\nDo you see a significant generational shift? I mean, I am—God, almost—I'm 29 years older than you. So, you know, I mean I know the boomers and the Xers are done. We're going to be around forever, but the sun is setting on our careers.\n\nHow does generational change fit into what you see happening in politics and culture in America?\n\nIt's an interesting question. I'll say first—you know, I suspect in the coming months, we'll be hiring some Gen Xers, and maybe a boomer or two, or maybe seven, right? Age is not something I think about when hiring. It's more about background, journalistic ability—that sort of thing.\n\nBut certainly, the millennials now are kind of coming into positions, of management positions. And it's interesting to see friends around my age now in Senate-confirmed positions—friends and acquaintances. \n\nI think it's a healthy thing.\n\nIf you look at the past 5 years, clearly there's an issue—particularly with elected officials—of hanging on too long. And I have a lot of admiration for the knowledge and expertise that people can bring with experience. Everybody ages differently. But also, I think that you get fresh perspectives.\n\nAnd it's not just, \"Oh, you need to get someone who's younger,\" right? But it's, what particularly about that experience do they bring in? And it's beyond age—it's regional, it's previous occupation, it's education or lack thereof that brings it in.\n\nBut I wouldn't say—it would be very shortsighted to just say, \"Great, we're never going to hire someone over 30.\" Obviously, that wouldn't be the case. Because really, I want that mixture of ages and generational experience.\n\nYou want someone whose first formative experience was 9/11, and someone whose first formative experience was COVID. And another person's was the downfall of the Berlin Wall. Because they're going to think about government, about foreign policy, about the world in general in a very different way.\n\nAnd I'm not sure that any generation has the right answer. So to the extent that we can bring those conversations together, I get very excited.\n\nI mean, it's kind of amazing—George Will is like the Benjamin Button of journalists. He is getting younger and sprier in his mind, I think. When he was 33, he was talking about how blue jeans were a curse upon the land, and now he's pretty out there. It's wonderful to see that happening.\n\nAnd then people like Elizabeth Warren—I don't think she was ever young. So yeah, age comes and goes in different ways.\n\nFinal thing. You mentioned it just in passing—The Washington Post chose not to endorse anybody in the 2024 election. And that was kind of seen, or it was widely read as, you know, that Jeff Bezos didn't want to piss off Donald Trump. I don't know that that entered into it at all.\n\nI mean, it's fascinating—many newspapers have stopped endorsing candidates. Does anybody actually vote because the editorial board of the Huntsville Item, or the Car Recycler, or The Washington Post says to? No. But do you think you'll ever go back to that? And if not, make the positive case for why it's better that we live in a world where newspapers don't pretend to tell you who to vote for.\n\nI can't predict the future, but I would be genuinely shocked if we ever made an endorsement again. Endorsements are a bizarre tradition, and I think a bit of an anachronism.\n\nThey made sense when you had partisan papers, right? Literal, explicit partisan papers.\n\nYeah, papers called The Democrat or The Republican.\n\nThe New Democrat, or what. But when you have papers like that, ok, maybe I can understand—especially if it's a party primary…\n\nThen you don't even need to do the editorial, right? Like we know—if it's The Waterbury Republican, yeah, vote for the Republican.\n\nRight. And so I think they were sort of an anachronism to begin with. That decision was made before I came here, but I would say, from my perch, when I was at The Economist and I saw that news, I said, \"Well, that's smart.\"\n\nSo I don't have any interest in formally aligning a newspaper with a particular party or a politician. I think it's a fool's errand to hope that one politician will fulfill all of your wishes and everything will work out perfectly—and to line up with them.\n\nExcept for Gary Johnson in 2016. That was our one opportunity, and we'll never see it again.\n\nYou're more of a 2016 Johnson guy than a 2012. I'm a bit of a Gary Johnson hipster. You know, when I was in college, I interviewed him in 2012. And I had a voicemail on my phone—at the college radio station, the call didn't go through. And he's like, \"Oh hey Adam, it's Gary Johnson.\" And I lost that voicemail. But it was like when I was 19, I was very proud of that.\n\nOh, that's a very good party trick, yeah.\n\nDo you think you'll ever get rid of house editorials? Why not take it a step further? Because don't we want to know—it's a forceful editorial saying, \"Hey, you know what? Today, we don't need the government telling YouTube TV that they have to cover Monday Night Football.\" Why not have the person who principally wrote that be responsible for it?\n\nI'm a bit biased here because I spent most of my career without a byline. But I came to—whether it was at The Economist or…there's not a byline, and that's another fun party trick: being on a flight, and someone's reading it, and you're not going to believe who wrote that article.\"\n\nBut I do think that there's something to be said for the power that an institutional voice can have—not to endorse a politician, which I think is a foolish idea—but to…\n\nYou could put a byline in, I guess, but they're the product of a long conversation. A lot of eyes touch an editorial before it goes out. And it really is a group project—but unlike in college, everyone's actually contributing. Now, maybe one person writes the draft and has a heavier lift, but I do think there's something to be said for that.\n\nWe're still—it's a work in progress—and we're going to develop a distinct voice. And it's getting there. I can already kind of feel our voice coming together. But it'll be built up as we hire more interesting people.\n\nI'm hoping a year from now, you'll read an editorial without even looking at the byline or seeing that it's labeled an editorial. You'll say, \"Oh, this is a Post editorial.\" And if whoever wrote it also has a column, you'll be able to tell there's a real distinct style between when she writes a column and when she's writing the editorial.\n\nI will admit that I used ChatGPT to help prepare for this. I'm a big fan of AI. ChatGPT has a lot to say about you, which should make you feel either worried or good—but it's always nice to be noticed.\n\nOne of the things it said was—it characterized your work, and I don't know the black box that goes on there—but it said that you were an institutionalist. And in our conversation, that seems to fit kind of right.\n\nI'm not saying that you are talking about being a slave—you are not trying to just maintain whatever was because that's the way it is—but it seems like you have an interest not simply in, \"OK, on this one issue, I'll just do this.\" It seems you keep coming back to certain kind of basic ideas, certain institutions, certain formulas or principles that are supposed to stay relatively constant.\n\nDo you think that's a fair kind of description of how you think, and the editorial kind of acumen that you'll bring to The Washington Post opinion section?\n\nYeah, I think—I mean, great job, ChatGPT, saying nice things about me. Because I was worried a little bit before. It actually said, \"You're more of a Mussolini type.\"\n\nMight not have agreed with….\n\nSo I read a lot of institutional history of The Post before I came here. And you find out things like, you know, in the 19th century, The Post editorial board endorsed annexing Canada. Endorsements were really not something that The Post always did—that's relatively new. That started happening, I think, in the '70s.\n\nYeah, which is amazing that more people didn't take note of that. And the publisher's note about why they weren't endorsing somebody—he kind of mentioned in passing like, \"Yeah, we only started doing this, I think in '76 or something.\" And it's like, yeah, why not get rid of it?\n\nSorry, I only bring up that history just to say—I do think that The Post is a valuable institution. I respect its history. And a big part of that history—like the United States more broadly—is reinvention, trying new things, challenging them, and also evolving with the time.\n\nAnd in 50 years, will there be unsigned editorials? Maybe not. Maybe they'll just be unsigned TikToks, right? Or unsigned Instagrams, or whatever the social media technology is that doesn't exist yet. Maybe we'll be writing in that form.\n\nIt's something I spend a lot of time thinking about. I'm a writer—that's how I came up. But part of it's multimedia. Where do we reach people who prefer to watch videos, right?\n\nAnd now there's the philosophical change, there's the actual product change—but you have to stay true to the North Star, which is good journalism, context and understanding, bringing people new information, making it reliable, knowing what they're getting.\n\nI think those are things that have been true about The Post. That's something they've aspired to throughout its history. And that's something I think it's important we stay true to.\n\nAs part of that, yes, we'll continue to evolve, and yes, we'll change, like we always have. But it's a big job, and I take it very seriously. I want The Post to succeed, and I want it to last.\n\nI mean, it's coming up on 150 years. And I'd like it to last well into the future beyond that. So in that sense, I'm certainly an institutionalist. But not one who thinks that you should just kind of rest on your laurels or the past glory or past history. \n\nYou respect it, but you think about how you change for the future.\n\nAll right. Thank you. That's a great note to end on.\n\nAdam O'Neal, the head of The Washington Post opinion section, which is going to be writing every day in support of personal liberties and free markets. Thanks so much for talking to Reason.\n\nHey, thanks for having me on.

Donald Trump is back in the White House, and his job approval rating is mediocre. And under those conditions, House Democrats are better positioned to win the majority in the midterm elections. \n\nYes, Democrats won Democratic areas in the biggest races earlier this month, but the margins were important to evaluate whether Republican candidates could maintain the coalition that Trump assembled to get elected in 2024. \n\nThe results show that experiment didn’t go well for Republicans. \n\nWhile Trump pulled within 6 points of Kamala Harris in New Jersey in 2024, Republican Jack Ciatterelli lost to Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill by 14 points in this year’s race for governor. That was closer to Trump’s 16-point loss to Joe Biden in the Garden State in 2020. \n\nTrump lost Virginia by 6 points in 2024, but Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears lost the commonwealth’s gubernatorial contest to Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger by 15 points. That was worse than Trump’s 10-point loss in 2020.\n\nAnd in California, Trump pulled to within 20 points of Harris in 2024 and yet Proposition 50, the Democratic redistricting effort, passed statewide by 29 points, a near-identical margin to Biden’s in the Golden State in 2020.\n\nAssuming Trump’s standing doesn’t dramatically improve, how would the House battlefield change if the political environment was closer to 2020 than to 2024?\n\nAccording to Inside Elections, there are currently 192 races rated Solid Republican and 180 rated Solid Democratic. When the 63 seats rated competitive are allotted to each party based on how they voted in the 2024 presidential elections, Republicans finish with a 228-207 majority. When those same competitive seats are allotted based on 2020 presidential results, Democrats finish with 223 seats to Republicans’ 212. The magic number for a majority is 218. \n\nIt’s an admittedly crude tabulation considering there are a handful of members, such as GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania’s 1st District and Mike Lawler of New York’s 17th and Democratic Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez of Washington’s 3rd and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio’s 9th, who have demonstrated the ability to win in districts where their party otherwise doesn’t do well. But they are exceptions rather than the rule.\n\nThe difference between the 2020 and 2024 scenarios is fueled by 16 districts where Trump finished ahead of Harris in 2024, but where Biden finished ahead of Trump in 2020. \n\nThose 16 seats are split down the middle, with each party holding eight of them. \n\nThe Republican seats are Arizona’s 1st (currently represented by Rep. David Schweikert) and 6th (Juan Ciscomani), California’s 22nd (David Valadao), Colorado’s 8th (Gabe Evans), Michigan’s 7th (Tom Barrett), New Jersey’s 7th (Thomas H. Kean Jr.), Pennsylvania’s 7th (Ryan Mackenzie) and Virginia’s 2nd (Jen Kiggans).\n\nThe Democratic-held seats include Michigan’s 8th (Kristen McDonald Rivet), Nevada’s 3rd (Susie Lee), New Jersey’s 9th (Nellie Pou), New Mexico’s 2nd (Gabe Vasquez), New York’s 3rd (Tom Suozzi), Ohio’s 1st (Greg Landsman) and Texas’ 28th (Henry Cuellar) and 34th (Vicente Gonzalez).\n\nAnd those aren’t the only seats to watch.\n\nIf the 2020 presidential results are indeed a more appropriate baseline, then another set of GOP-held districts could push closer to the core of the battlefield. Trump carried eight districts with 51 percent or less in 2020, including Iowa’s 1st (Mariannette Miller-Meeks), 2nd (Ashley Hinson) and 3rd (Zach Nunn); Michigan’s 4th (Bill Huizenga) and 10th (John James); Pennsylvania’s 8th (Rob Bresnahan Jr.) and 10th (Scott Perry); and Wisconsin’s 1st (Bryan Steil).\n\nTrump would have also carried Texas’ 15th (Monica De La Cruz) with just 51 percent in 2020 under the map state Republicans drew earlier this summer, but that map is on hold following a court order Tuesday. Republicans are appealing the decision. \n\nAnd still another batch of six seats could make their way from the fringe of the battlefield to truly competitive in 2026. Trump finished with just 52 percent or 53 percent in Alaska’s At-Large District (Nick Begich), Arizona’s 2nd (Eli Crane), Colorado’s 5th (Jeff Crank), Florida’s 13th (Anna Paulina Luna), Virginia’s 1st (Rob Wittman) and Wisconsin’s 3rd (Derrick Van Orden).\n\nWhen Democratic candidates and proposals are consistently outperforming the 2024 presidential performance by at least 6 to 9 points, we could be seeing an overall shift in the House battlefield, rather than incremental changes by district.\n\nOverall, if Republican redistricting efforts continue to stall and the fall of 2026 looks anything like the fall of 2025 or 2020, House Democrats will likely gain the three seats they need for a majority, and it may not be close.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/11/19/house-battleground-midterm-elections-2026/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/meeks-ciscomani_BC_025_0703251.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 15:43:12","author":"Posted November 19, 2025 At 3:43pm","authors":["Posted November 19, 2025 At 3:43pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":380589194,"title":"Jack Smith’s Assistant Referred to DOJ for Prosecution","text":"The House Judiciary Committee has referred a close associate of disgraced Biden administration attack dog Jack Smith for criminal prosecution.\n\nUnconstitutionally appointed DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team conducted one of the most politically charged legal campaigns in history against Donald Trump. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued a press release on Nov. 19 announcing he referred Thomas Windom, the former Senior Assistant Special Counsel to Jack Smith, to the Trump-Bondi Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal prosecution. Windom refused to answer almost every question during a deposition.\n\nThe referral urges Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate potential violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1505, which involves illegal actions obstructing a congressional investigation. Windom did obstruct the investigation into Smith and his weaponization of justice in more than one way, the committee accuses.\n\nWindom, the Judiciary Committee believes, has important firsthand information about Smith, which he refuses to disclose, an “intentional, corrupt effort to thwart the Committee's inquiry.”\n\nFor Our VIPs: ‘Now We Are Engaged in a Great Civil War’\n\nJordan’s press release provided some details on the topics where Windom obstructed the inquiry:\n\n • Knowledge of a February 2021 proposal that J.P. Cooney brought to the FBI to investigate President Trump and the individuals within his orbit; • Interactions with and materials obtained from the January 6th Select Committee; • Information related to the surveillance of Representative Scott Perry and the seizure of his cell phone; • Information related to how many other Members of Congress were investigated as part of the Arctic Frost investigation and the Jack Smith investigation; and • Communications with FBI officials related to potential evidence in the possession of the Willard Hotel. \n\nLast month, an investigation uncovered how Smith not only aggressively targeted Trump, but he also spied on eight Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). His spying later turned out to be much more comprehensive even than that, as Smith had actually targeted the entirety of Republican leadership. This included more than 430 individuals and organizations, such as the Republican Attorneys General Association, Trump White House advisers, and Turning Point USA. The Biden administration also gave Trump‘s government phone to Smith.\n\nInterestingly, former Rep. Rick Renzi (R-Ariz.) — a previous target of Jack Smith — gave an exclusive interview to PJ Media in which he said that he brought evidence of Smith’s prosecutorial misconduct to Graham’s attention back in 2019. Renzi accused then-Senate Judiciary Chair Graham of ignoring the allegations, as multiple of his interns at the time were on loan from the DOJ and worked with Smith.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee continues to investigate Arctic Frost and the scandalous political co-opting of our justice system under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Merrick Garland, and Jack Smith.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of breaking news and federal investigations.

Historically, places with Indian indentured labour like Mauritius, the Seychelles, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobacco, etc, or even the subsequent migrations to the United Kingdom and Canada have always had politicians with Indian ethnicity. It was the arrival of the likes of Antonio Costa (Portuguese PM with Goan ancestry) or Leo Varadkar (former Taoiseach, or Prime Minister of Ireland) that signalled that leaders of Indian heritage had arrived. The phenomenon of Rishi Sunak (Britain’s former Prime Minister) was literally the cherry on the desi cake.However, the epicentre of global politics, the United States, has had a more complex tryst with leaders of Indian parentage. There has been an undeniable surge of politicians with Indian roots and that has often led to premature appropriation and celebration of their advent on the centre stage -- even though almost all of them have tried to downplay their Indianness.The first prominent US politician of this lot was Piyush Jindal, who later gained prominence as “Bobby Jindal”. He was to insist that he was totally assimilated in America and therefore kept a distance from his “Indianness”. He naturally did not reach out to Indian-American organisations and his infamous quote -- “We came to this country to be Americans -- not Indian-Americans, not hyphenated Americans” – exemplified these efforts. He made it well-known that he had converted to Christianity and rhetorically focused on “faith, family, freedom” to ingratiate himself to White evangelical codes. But his infamy peaked with the “whitewashing” of his official portrait as governor when it was noticed to be significantly lighter skin tone, sparking memes like “Bobby Jindal, now in HD: High Definition or Higher Definition?”. But India made light of Piyush Jindal’s obvious attempts to disassociate, smug in the assumption that one of its own was rising.Later, the likes of Nikki Haley (Nimarata Randahawa; born to Sikh parents) was to convert to Christianity and make a failed bid for the presidency. She too downplayed her Indianness to ingratiate herself as a true-blue Republican who made common cause with Donald Trump. Recently her son, Nalin, proved to be a chip of the old block when he insisted Indians ought to be out of America and “absolutely ban H-1B” to show his “loyalty is to the US”. Similarly, another hardcore Republican who made a pitch for the presidency in 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy, distanced himself from identity politics and laid selective emphasis on his heritage and his faith. He too refrained from the hyphenation of “Indian-American” and tailored his spiel to appeal to the largely White-Christian Republicans with extremely “red-neck” positions. Even the less railing persona of Kamala Harris was predicated on emphasising her Black identity more assertively, given the much larger Black voter base. Her comment, “My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters”, was telling of the narrative that she sought to stitch in the public imagination. Others like Kash Patel (Kashyap Pramod Patel), the current FBI director, have shown little or no pride in their Indianness and their policy positions are openly anti-immigration and overtly Trumpian. The curious case of Indians readily warming up to a Tulsi Gabbard due to her Hindu faith is yet another case of unwarranted appropriation even though she is a White Caucasian individual with nobiological roots in India.Perhaps the only prominent politician in recent times who has unapologetically owned and taken pride in his Indian roots has been Zohran Mamdani. Personifying the secular spirit of the “Idea of India”, he has openly claimed: “I’m proud of my Hindu heritage … and proud to be someone who will be the first Muslim mayor of this city, and … hold all of those things together”. Even his acceptance speech was laced with a quote from Jawaharlal Nehru’s historic “Tryst with Destiny” speech, and the surreal “Dhoom Machaley” soundtrack that was played at his victory celebration cocked a snook at all those who thought that the Indian identity wasn’t enough “it” for New York! Even his interpretation of his personal faith wasn’t puritanical or regressive, but decidedly “Indian” in that his campaign saw him hopping into gay bars, dancing in night clubs, differentiating a New York Jew from an Israeli, and basically celebrating multi-culturalism as a strength and not as majoritarian politics.However,...","summary":"Perhaps the only prominent politician in recent times who has unapologetically owned and taken pride in his Indian roots has been Zohran Mamdani","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/columnists/bhopinder-singh-why-for-many-in-bharat-zohran-mamdani-fails-the-indianness-test-1918189","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/11/1977150-mamdani.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 14:18:49","author":"Bhopinder Singh","authors":["Bhopinder Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.247},{"id":380533992,"title":"Tom Steyer enters California governor's race","text":"Steyer’s late entrance reflects a widespread sense that the contest remains wide open after two heavyweights, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen.

Bulls—, man. That’s so ridiculous,\" Steyer said in an online video announcing his campaign. \"We have a broken government. It’s been bought by corporations and my question is: Who do you think is going to change that? Sacramento politicians are afraid to change up this system. I’m not. They’re going to hate this. Bring it on.\" Steyer, 68, founded Farallon Capital Management, one of the nation's largest hedge funds, and left it in 2012 after 26 years. Since his departure, he has become a global environmental activist and a major donor to Democratic candidates and causes. But the hedge firm's investments — notably a giant coal mine in Australia that cleared 3,700 acres of koala habitat and a company that runs migrant detention centers on the U.S.-Mexico border for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — will make him susceptible to political attack by his gubernatorial rivals. Steyer has expressed regret for his involvement in such projects, saying it was why he left Farallon and started focusing his energy on fighting climate change. Steyer previously flirted with running for governor and the U.S. Senate but decided against it, instead opting to run for president in 2020. He dropped out after spending nearly $342 million on his campaign, which gained little traction before he ended his run after the South Carolina primary. Next year's gubernatorial race is in flux, after former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla decided not to run and Proposition 50, the successful Democratic effort to redraw congressional districts, consumed all of the political oxygen during an off-year election. Most voters are undecided about who they would like to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cannot run for reelection because of term limits, according to a poll released this month by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times. Steyer had the support of 1% of voters in the survey. In recent years, Steyer has been a longtime benefactor of progressive causes, most recently spending $12 million to support the redistricting ballot measure. But when he was the focus of one of the ads, rumors spiraled that he was considering a run for governor. In prior California ballot initiatives, Steyer successfully supported efforts to close a corporate tax loophole and to raise tobacco taxes, and fought oil-industry-backed efforts to roll back environmental law. His campaign platform is to build 1 million homes in four years, lower energy costs by ending monopolies, make preschool and community college free and ban corporate contributions to political action committees in California elections. Steyer's brother Jim, the leader of Common Sense Media, and former Biden administration U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy are aiming to put an initiative on next year's ballot to protect children from social media, specifically the chatbots that have been accused of prompting young people to kill themselves. Newsom recently vetoed a bill aimed at addressing this artificial intelligence issue.","summary":"Billionaire hedge fund founder, climate change warrior and major Democratic donor Tom Steyer is running for governor.

Why it is women leading the charge to bring Trump down","text":"“I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the p***y. You can do anything.\" It’s been 20 years since Donald Trump was recorded talking openly about the way he treats women in 2005, on the set of Days of Our Lives. Fast forward to this week – in 2025 – and what has changed? Nothing. If anything, his war on women just keeps getting worse. \n\n“Quiet piggy” is the latest insight into the mind of the US president and what he really thinks of women (as if we were in any doubt). His attack on a female reporter onboard Air Force One, when she asked him a question about the Epstein files – accompanied by a patronising finger waggle – joins a litany of sexist threats, insults and diminishing comments which go back as far as his hairline. \n\nThe real problem now, though, isn’t what he says, but that it’s so achingly dull, predictable and routine. It’s not funny or clever – if you’re going to roast us, at least be biting and smart. This sexist shtick is getting tiring – isn’t it time for old men like Trump to give it up altogether?\n\n“That is one dumb woman,” he said of ABC’s \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin in 2024. The same year, he raged about Whoopi Goldberg, saying: “She was so filthy, dirty, disgusting. She was so dirty. Every word was filthy, dirty. What a loser she is.” About Nancy Pelosi, also in 2024: \"She's a bad, sick woman. She's as crazy as a bed bug.\" At the same rally, Trump talked about being advised not to clap back at Michelle Obama: “She hit me the other day,” Trump said. “I was gonna say to my people, ‘Am I allowed to hit her now?’ They said, ‘Take it easy, sir, sir.’” \n\nThe list goes on and on: when quizzed last year about businesswoman Jessica Leeds, who alleged he assaulted her during a flight to New York in the late 1970s, Trump gave this answer: “Frankly,” he said, “I know you’re going to say it’s a terrible thing to say – but it couldn’t have happened, it didn’t happen, and she would not have been the chosen one. She would not have been the chosen one.” And, on Stormy Daniels in 2023 after their alleged affair: \"I never liked horseface. That wouldn't be the one.” \n\nTrump has used words like “nasty woman” to describe his opponent Hillary Clinton and the New York Times suggested last year that he called Kamala Harris a “bitch” in two separate private conversations (though his campaign denied it). He also said of Carly Fiorina – his only female rival for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016: \"Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?\" Just this week, he lashed out at his former ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene, after she criticised the handling of the Epstein fiasco, saying: “I don't know what happened to Marjorie. She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.”\n\nAnd when he’s not being insulting, he’s lascivious: Trump referred to his own daughter Ivanka Trump’s looks in 2004, saying: “She does have a very nice figure ... if [she] weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her”. The president has been accused by at least 26 women of rape and sexual assault since the 1970s – allegations all of which he denies – and was found liable by a jury for sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in a department store in the 1990s, though he dismissed her last year with the comments: “I never met her. I have never touched her. I would have no interest in meeting her in any shape or form.”\n\nTrump doesn’t hide who he is – in my opinion an overt misogynist, a woman-hater – and he doesn’t say sorry for it, either. He does it in plain sight. His track record speaks for itself – his Supreme Court selections are mainly anti-abortion, and therefore unarguably anti-women, he’s taken credit for overturning Roe v Wade and he’s also mates with people like white supremacist Nick Fuentes, who took to X on election night to declare an unfettered war on abortion, saying: “Your body, my choice. Forever.” “Quiet piggy” is only the icing on a very thick, very layered, very out of date sexist cake. \n\nYawn. Haven’t women suffered enough without having to listen to such sexist nonsense? Yet Trump has so far always been frustratingly impervious at the ballot box to all this. His opponents during his first presidential campaign made efforts to discredit him over his relations with women and the language he used, but they made little progress, with some of his older female supporters arguing that this was just how men at a certain time, or a certain age, behave. \n\nWomen are tired of this nonsense, now. Maga, reportedly, is getting tired too – of Trump and his silly, schoolboy insults and “weak and rudderless” leadership. It makes me want to put my finger to my lips and sshhh the US president (if not every single man in politics). But listen. After all the slurs, all the insults, all the ways he has got away with the things he has said – and, allegedly, done – to women, wouldn’t it be a great twist in the tale if it is, finally, the women who bring him down?","summary":"The US president’s ‘war on women’ continues – but these silly schoolboy insults aren’t big and they certainly aren’t clever, says Victoria Richards.

Gavin Newsom. \n\nCasting himself as an outsider in the race, Steyer added: “Sacramento politicians are afraid to change up this system. I’m not.” \n\nWhile he’s never held elected office, Steyer, 68, is no stranger to Democratic Party politics. Over the years, he’s steered millions of his own dollars toward various state and national campaigns around issues ranging from environmental protection to gun control and cigarette taxes. \n\nMore recently, he spent over $12 million on ads boosting support for California’s redistricting ballot initiative, known as Proposition 50. Golden State voters overwhelmingly approved the measure earlier this month, green-lighting a new congressional map in response to mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas. \n\nSteyer self-financed a long-shot bid for his party’s presidential nomination in 2020 but ultimately dropped out after finishing third in the South Carolina primary. \n\nThe busy race to succeed Newsom remains wide open, with polls showing no candidate breaking out some seven months before the 2026 primary. Under California law, all candidates run on the same primary ballot, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election.\n\nTwo high-profile Democrats took their names out of gubernatorial consideration this year: former Vice President Kamala Harris and the state’s senior senator, Alex Padilla. \n\nProminent Democrats already in the race include former Rep. Katie Porter; former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who also served as state attorney general and a congressman; former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; former state Controller Betty Yee; and state school superintendent Tony Thurmond.\n\nSteyer won’t be the only billionaire Democrat looking to become the state’s next governor, with former timeshare mogul Stephen Cloobeck also in the race. And he may not be the only unsuccessful 2020 presidential contender in the primary, with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell reportedly eyeing a bid. \n\nNotable Republicans running for governor include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton. While the GOP hasn’t won a gubernatorial race in California since 2006, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected to a final term, a crowded primary with no Democratic front-runner increases the chances of two Republicans advancing to the general election. \n\nPorter had been seen as the leading Democrat in the race, especially after Harris said she wouldn’t run. But negative headlines over a handful of viral videos may have taken a toll on that status – a UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this month showed her dropping 6 points from August to 11 percent, trailing Bianco, who had 13 percent. No other candidate polled in the double digits. \n\nSteyer, a former hedge fund manager, could opt to self-finance his campaign, giving him a financial edge in the race. But the same UC Berkeley poll, conducted by the university’s Institute of Governmental Studies before he entered the race, showed him at just 1 percent.\n\nSteyer signaled in his kickoff announcement that the central focus of his campaign will be affordability, an issue that boosted Democrats across the country in the Nov. 4 elections. \n\nHe vowed to “launch the largest drive to build homes that you can afford in the history of California” and to “break up the monopolistic power of utilities … and drop our sky-high energy prices.”","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/11/19/tom-steyer-california-governor-election/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/NVPOL20_024_02152020.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 12:56:08","author":"Posted November 19, 2025 At 12:56pm","authors":["Posted November 19, 2025 At 12:56pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":380504954,"title":"FIRST READING: The most conservative young people in the West","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks at a youth event in Toronto, on Thursday, Oct. 30, 2025.

The opposition parties all openly opposed the budget, slammed it in public at every available opportunity and told their supporters that they were voting against it. Nevertheless, the budget passed anyway thanks to the sudden abstention of two NDP MPs and two Conservative ones.Article contentSaid MPs had reasons for why they didn’t come to work that day (one of the Conservatives cited “medical leave”), but the end result is that Carney got his budget with the apparently tacit participation of the opposition.\n\nArticle contentAs to why this happened, the best explanation is that triggering a Christmas election would likely have resulted in a Liberal victory; either a return to the status quo, or Carney being able to clinch a majority. By accidentally-on-purpose allowing the budget to pass, however, the opposition grants the Liberals at least six more months of life, during which Carney’s now-favourable poll numbers could start to fall.Article contentArticle content Alberta has a new licence plate design, which carries the province’s new slogan, Strong and Free.

Imagine, for one second, President Donald Trump lecturing the “black people” about being unreasonable. You only need one second to imagine the reaction.\n\nMichelle Obama sat down in front of an audience in Brooklyn recently with actress Tracee Ellis Ross — whose ABC sitcom “Black-ish” had a mushy Michelle Obama cameo in 2022 — and launched into a tirade on black hair.\n\n“Let me explain something to white people,” Michelle lectured the crowd. “Our hair comes out of our head naturally, in a curly pattern. So when we’re straightening it to follow your beauty standards, we are trapped! By the straightness.” White people are hair oppressors.\n\nThen she made jokes that blacks can’t swim because they’re trying to keep their hair straight — for white people. She called it exhausting and expensive. Braids are also for white people, “so we can focus on the work.”\n\nBlack activists have pushed legislation to prevent hair discrimination, which Michelle also lamented: “Why do we need an act — an act of law — to tell white folks to get outta our hair? Don’t tell me how to wear my hair, don’t wonder about it, don’t touch it. Just don’t!” The audience cheered.\n\nIf you took a poll, most Americans would say they don’t really care about black hair, they don’t object to it, they don’t need to touch it. But they certainly don’t need a lecture from a mega-wealthy former First Lady about how their curiosity and expectations are “exhausting.”\n\nThen Ross wondered about how our expectations for first ladies are hampering the notion of a female president. Michelle lectured the white people again: “As we saw in this last election, sadly, we ain’t ready! That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, ‘cuz you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. You know? So don’t waste my time. You know? We got a lot of growing up to do.”\n\nThere she goes again. If you don’t vote for Democrats like Kamala Harris, you need to “grow up.” You can’t complain about open borders, hyperinflation or actual issues. You’re supposed to vote defensively, to prove you’re not racist and sexist.\n\nAnyone who voted for Obama-Biden in 2008 voted against a female vice president, but if it’s Republicans, it doesn’t count. If Democrats didn’t just vote for the first black female governor in Virginia, it wasn’t racism. It’s against the icky Republicans.\n\nMrs. Obama underlined her point: “There’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman. And we saw it.”\n\nAll the Democrats grouse that Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris were oodles more qualified than Trump “the reality TV host.” They say that even after Trump had been president for four years. It’s not just about qualifications; it’s about issue positions.\n\nThe Obama-loving media haven’t exactly pushed these remarks, these fancy fingernails on a chalkboard. CNN’s Jake Tapper put Michelle’s sexism lament up on Nov. 17, and his Republican and Democrat analysts agreed with her. “That’s so depressing,” he replied.\n\nMrs. Obama complained in an interview with Stephen Colbert that the country carried this false impression that she was an “angry, bitter black woman.” Fact check: She often sounds angry and bitter, and like she’s making a face at the white people. We are always disappointing her by not worshiping her, like her carefully selected interviewers do.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/122861-michelle-obama-like-fancy-fingernails-on-a-chalkboard-2025-11-19","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 12:21:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":380473114,"title":"The Blogs: 'The Tortoise and the Hare': Toledot 5786","text":"“The Tortoise and the Hare” is one of the most well-known of Aesop’s fables. It is a timeless tale of arrogance versus endurance: the cocky Hare, all speed and swagger, mocks the plodding Tortoise and bolts ahead, only to nap mid-race in overconfidence, while the humble Tortoise keeps marching – slow, steady, relentless – crossing the finish line first. It is a lesson in human nature: talent gets you far, but ego buries you; flash fails when resilience prevails. Be the Tortoise and remember that the race belongs not to the swift, but to those who never stop.\n\nI am not a fan of this particular fable, never have been. Perhaps it is because I am more Hare than Tortoise, other than the stopping-in-the-middle part. That said, one episode in the Portion of Toledot makes a compelling case for the Tortoise.\n\nA famine forces Isaac and Rebecca to move to Gerar, a Philistine town identified as Tel Haror, near modern-day Netivot. Isaac introduces Rebecca to the locals as his sister and she is kidnapped by King Abimelech. Abimelech discovers that she is Isaac’s wife and he returns her with great contrition and consternation. He commands his citizens [Bereishit 26:9]: “Anyone who touches this man or his wife shall be put to death.” Isaac prospers in Gerar and becomes extremely wealthy. In response, the Philistines stop up wells that were dug by Abraham and then summarily evict Isaac from Gerar, telling him [Bereishit 26:13]: “Go away from us, for you have become far too big for us!”\n\nThey do what to the wells? Fresh water is a rare commodity in the Middle East. Over the years, countless wars have been fought over local water rights. Rabbi Nir Weinberg, the Rabbi of Moshav Hazorim, proposes that Amalek attacked the Jewish People immediately after the crossing of the Reed Sea because they claimed the water that came from the rock that Moshe struck. In 1964, Syria attempted to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River (the Hasbani and Banias rivers) into the Yarmouk River, impacting Israel’s water supply. Israel viewed this as a major strategic threat, leading to escalating tensions and skirmishes along the border, and serving as a key precursor to the Six-Day War. Iran’s current drought is emboldening thirsty Iranians to vocally come out against the rule of the Mullahs, threatening the regime. Why in the world would the Philistines stop up the wells instead of appropriating them for their own flocks[1]?\n\nThe Radak[2] suggests that the Philistines were afraid that Isaac would someday become as powerful a figure as his father, Abraham, and he would eventually take back the wells. They reasoned that the only way to deny him these wells was by also denying them to themselves. Therefore, they closed them up so that no one would be able to locate them. I would like to propose an alternate solution, one which, while no less nefarious than that of the Radak, is more cerebral than visceral. The Torah describes Isaac’s financial success with the following words [Bereishit 26:13]: “The man became great, and he grew constantly greater (haloch v’gadel) until he had grown very great.” With all due respect, this sounds like something a toddler might say: “Mommy, I saw a big dog!”. “Well how big was it?” “It was really, really, really big!”. Was it a metre tall? Two metres? Ten metres? Who knows? Who cares? It was just really big. Why does the Torah use such fuzzy descriptors?\n\nI suggest that more important than how great Isaac had become was the way – the vector – in which he had grown “constantly greater”. Rabbi Baruch Halevi Epstein[3], writing in “Tosefet Bracha”, quotes a verse in Parables [20:21] that states “An estate acquired in haste will not be blessed in the end”, meaning that windfalls are usually squandered. Rabbi Epstein suggests that Isaac implemented this strategy and grew his wealth gradually. Rabbi Epstein offers a number of prooftexts, the most compelling of which is the description of Mordechai in the book of Esther [9:2]: “The man, Mordechai, became progressively great (holech v’gadol)”. King Achashverosh handed Mordechai his ring. With this ring, Mordechai could have had anything his heart desired. Rabbi Epstein asserts that Mordechai resisted this urge and planned his political rise to proceed gradually, so that it would last[4].\n\nPeople like to believe that life comes with a shortcut key. Just press “Win Lottery,” and everything instantly reorganizes itself into a beautifully optimized configuration. No more mortgage, no more bills, no more budgeting. Just bliss, a Tesla Cyerbertruck, and maybe a villa on a sun-kissed Greek Island. But real life, as every engineer knows, rarely behaves according to the glossy brochure. Systems exposed to sudden loads – mechanical, electrical, or emotional – tend to fail in non-linear, often catastrophic, ways. Pull too hard on a cable all at once and it snaps. Hit a circuit with a voltage spike and it smokes. Wealth works on the same principles. Slow, steady accumulation integrates naturally into a person’s life. A sudden windfall often detonates.\n\nThe empirical data make this painfully clear. In a detailed study, researchers linked lottery payouts to public bankruptcy filings. The finding was astonishing in its simplicity: about 5.5% of winners filed for bankruptcy within five years. Even more striking, that number was virtually identical to the bankruptcy rate of people who didn’t win at all. The windfall didn’t eliminate financial instability; it merely postponed it. In the first two years after winning, bankruptcy risk drops – winners pay off debts, breathe easier. But by years three to five, the rate climbs significantly, often overshooting the baseline. The underlying structural issues simply find their way back once the temporary pressure release fades. Gradual wealth builders operate under completely different laws of physics. They learn financial discipline long before the dollars become large enough to cause real damage: budgeting, investing, risk management, and, perhaps the most difficult human skill, saying “no.” These behaviours keep the system stable as more income flows through it. They build not just wealth, but the capacity to retain wealth. Sudden winners, by contrast, often face psychological overload. There is even a term for this: “Sudden Wealth Syndrome”, which describes the stress, impulsivity, and decision fatigue that accompany an abrupt financial spike. People imagine that more money reduces complexity while in practice it increases the number of available (and risky) choices. Without the habits to navigate them, the system destabilizes.\n\nThe Philistines recognize exactly what Isaac was doing: He is slowly building himself up in a way that would make him resilient to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. The Philistines panic and they steal his water sources. Isaac is unfazed. He has a diversified portfolio [Bereishit 26:11]: “He acquired flocks and herds, and a large household”. More importantly, his assets are mobile. When the Philistines take his water, he relocates and digs new wells. King Abimelech, impressed by Isaac’s staying power, travels to Isaac and signs a treaty of non-belligerence, vindicating Isaac’s strategy.\n\nGreatness is not a lottery ticket; it is a path. The Torah’s language is not childish repetition but engineering precision: growth is a continuous function, not a step input. Systems that ramp slowly remain stable; those hit with a spike collapse. In a world obsessed with shortcuts, Isaac reminds us that resilience is built incrementally: one well, one flock, one decision at a time. The Philistines saw a threat; Abimelech saw a truth: enduring strength comes from process, not event. Be the tortoise. Build slowly. And when the famine comes, you will endure.\n\nAri Sacher, Moreshet, 5786\n\nPlease daven for a Refu’a Shelema for Rachel bat Malka, Iris bat Chana, Shlomo ben Esther, Sheindel Devora bat Rina, Esther Sharon bat Chana Raizel, Meir ben Drora, and Hodayah Emunah bat Shoshana Rachel.\n\n[1] Perhaps we have become so inured to antisemitism that cutting off one’s antisemitic nose to spite one’s antisemitic face no longer seems odd to us.

What signal it sent","text":"Chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" rang out throughout a packed Mesa City Council chambers as Dorean Taylor was sworn in as the newest council member on Nov. 17.\n\nTaylor won a recall election weeks earlier that forced former Councilmember Julie Spilsbury out of her seat.\n\nShe won the seat by 762 votes, according to the final tally. The special recall election had exceptional turnout for an off-cycle year, with nearly 40% of registered voters in the district casting a ballot. It had a larger turnout than when Spilsbury was elected to her second term in July 2024.\n\nTaylor will represent District 2, which covers the central-east areas of the city, for the remaining term. That term will end in 2029.\n\nMesa's first recall election marked a shift in city politics. Mesa has never been immune from controversy, but its leaders traditionally deal with it in measured, understated ways, rather than publicly visible showdowns, as is more common these days in neighboring Gilbert or Scottsdale. But Taylor's election signaled a swing toward more combative and blatantly partisan politics, many longtime local political operators said during the campaign.\n\nAbout 200 Mesa residents attended the ceremony, many of whom donned Make America Great Again hats, to support Taylor.\n\nIn her first remarks from the dais, Taylor thanked God and recited a Bible Scripture.\n\n“I stand here deeply humble and profoundly grateful. This moment is not mine alone. It belongs to an extraordinary community of people who believed in a vision for Mesa and chose to step forward with conviction and courage,” she said.\n\nShe also thanked the conservative political organization Turning Point Action for its help in her campaign. The organization helped bankroll the recall election by paying for campaign signs and flyers.\n\nWhen asked what her relationship with Turning Point going forward would be like, she stated she did not know what it would look like.\n\n“I don’t have an answer for you,” she said.\n\nA main talking point throughout her campaign included criticism of the city’s nondiscrimination policy, which her campaign flyers called “radical transgender policies.”\n\nShe said that was a “talking point that I definitely will adhere to.”\n\nIt’s something she will want to look at again and share with the full council her district’s desire and get feedback on how to move forward with it, she said.\n\nShe said communication will be key for her to better understand what her future votes as a council member should look like to represent her district residents.\n\n“I’m anxious to get started, anxious to do the job,” Taylor said.\n\nMayor Mark Freeman welcomed Taylor and thanked District 2 voters for their participation in the special recall election in a statement released later.\n\n“I look forward to continuing to elevate Mesa with our City Council and the support of city leadership as we focus on the priorities that matter to our community: public safety, strong neighborhoods, economic opportunity, education and workforce development,” he said in the statement.\n\nWho is Dorean Taylor?\n\nTaylor is originally from Florida and moved to Mesa in 2008. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from the University of Phoenix. Taylor previously worked as a business analyst and training coordinator for an East Coast-based school and later a local automotive company.\n\nWhy is there a new Mesa City Council member?\n\nIn January, a group of residents launched a petition to recall Spilsbury from her seat, citing a trio of yes votes, including raising utility rates, approving the transition of a hotel into a homeless housing program and increasing council salaries.\n\nTwo of those votes took place before Spilsbury's reelection in August, which she won with 65% of the vote in her district.\n\nThe real crux of the outrage against Spilsbury was her endorsement of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election last November. Spilsbury is a registered Republican.\n\nIn June, the group had retained sufficient signatures required to get the measure on the ballot. In July, the Mesa City Council was obligated to call the special election.\n\nLike this story?

Just after 9:30 p.m., screens above the main stage lit up with a recorded message. “This amazing crowd here today must be the most patriotic group in rock music history,” President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office. “We love you all, and Kid Rock is as good as they get. Enjoy the concert.” The audience erupted in applause. \n\nA moment later, Kid Rock, in sunglasses, black T-shirt and camouflage shorts, walked onstage and started in on his first song. For the next hour and a half, the countrified rocker bounced around, singing and dancing with a manic energy far beyond the recommended daily allowance for the knees and vertebrae of a 54-year-old grandfather.\n\nThe set list leaned heavily on Kid Rock’s greatest hits, including a couple of classics from his first big album in the 1990s. If the musical vibe harked back to the days of Bill Clinton, the moment itself felt like a distillation of something very Trumpy. This was the “Rock the Country” tour, orchestrated by Kid Rock and unofficially promoted by the president to the duo’s overlapping fan bases. The result was a lively mashup of identity politics and beer-battered revelry that billed itself as “a gathering for the true heart of America,” where “hardworking, God-fearing patriots unite under the open sky.” \n\nThis event, in a bucolic patch not far from the town of Anderson and its prominent Confederate war monument, marked the final stop of the tour. Over the course of two days, sunbaked fans tossed beach balls and posed for photos in front of 20-foot-tall cowboy boots. Women in cutoff jeans and tank tops mingled with men in red, white and blue overall shorts. At one point, everyone removed their headwear, gazed at a giant American flag dangling from a crane and recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Off to one side, people lined up to take turns bucking on a mechanical bull. Between sets, a DJ fired up the audience: “Give it up for No. 47!” \n\nNearly a year into Trump’s second term, the American music industry remains something of an emotionally triggering unsafe space for his diehard supporters. Recent headlines have been particularly unwelcoming. In early October, well-known Kamala Harris abettor Taylor Swift released an album that quickly broke sales records. A few days later, the NFL announced that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny—a major critic of Trump and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement—would headline the next Super Bowl halftime show. Conservatives raged on social media. Why was the NFL picking an artist who sings in Spanish instead of, say, tapping a famous performer from the heartland of America? In short, why not Kid Rock? \n\nTo be clear, Kid Rock’s fans are nowhere as numerous as Bad Bunny’s. This year, as of Oct. 9, Kid Rock has generated 409 million audio and video streams across all platforms, according to Luminate, a data company focused on the entertainment industry. Over the same period, Bad Bunny had 4.7 billion. But if Kid Rock is no longer a Billboard-topper, he does embody a certain type of artist who no longer seeks a middle-of-the road audience to find success. Over the past decade, various entrepreneurs and Trump himself have capitalized on the political polarization of American consumers by rolling out conservative-branded products aimed at the president’s supporters: There are not only cable TV channels, social media networks and podcasts catering to the MAGA demographic but also cryptocurrencies, sneakers, mobile phones, bottled water, coffee, kitchen appliances—and, thanks to Kid Rock, summer music festivals. \n\nFor those who don’t want their concertgoing experience tarnished by anti-Trump outbursts from the likes of Bruce Springsteen (or Green Day, Pearl Jam, Eminem, etc.), Kid Rock has created a haven, positioning himself as kingmaker. He’s breathed new life into his music career at a time when many 1990s rap-rock acts have long since shuffled off into cultural obsolescence. \n\nOver the summer, dozens of acts performed at the various “Rock the Country” stops, including Gavin Adcock, Kentucky Headhunters, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Little Texas, Nickelback, Travis Tritt and Kid Rock’s favorite hunting buddy, Hank Williams Jr. At one point during the South Carolina stop, Aaron Lewis, the heavily tattooed lead singer of the alt-metal group Staind, took the microphone. There were two things, he said, that liberals will never take away from Americans: “our God and our guns.” Addressing the crowd of an estimated 20,000, he said: “Look around you. We need to stand up for our children and grandchildren, who are gonna inherit this country.” \n\nEven by the rococo standards of American second acts, Kid Rock’s path to musical adoration among Christian conservative audiences has been a strange trip. \n\nNearly 30 years ago, Bob Ritchie, who declined to be interviewed for this article, first strutted into the national spotlight as Kid Rock, a cocky singer/rapper with a love of middle-finger salutes. He joyfully spun out sybaritic rhymes about chasing babes and getting wasted. He was like some sort of mythical party creature—part man, part beer funnel. \n\nMTV played his music videos relentlessly. Kid Rock’s 1998 album Devil Without a Cause sold more than 14 million copies, making him a certifiable American pop star. He bought mansions in Florida and California, was briefly married to former Playboy Playmate Pamela Anderson, got a year’s probation after a scuffle at a Waffle House and released a string of albums, largely devoted to unfettered hell-raising as a near heavenly mission. His fans loved it. \n\nBut every party eventually ends. And by the mid-2010s, the Kid Rock bender was winding down. Many parts of the music industry that had bolstered his ascent in the 1990s—CDs, MTV, the rock-rap genre—were fading fast. In 2015, when Rolling Stone caught up with him at his estate in Alabama, he was showing off his extensive gun collection, shooting wild hogs and bemoaning the performance of his previous album. “It f---ing flopped,” he said. At the time, the “Kid” was well into his mid-40s.\n\nKid Rock grew up in exurban Michigan. His dad, who ran a thriving Lincoln-Mercury dealership, was a staunch Republican. It was the heyday of Motor City “Buy American,” and the adolescent Kid Rock caught the fervor. As he accumulated musical accomplishments, he also began seeking out political validation. It took a while: At one point in 2005, Kid Rock was booked to play at George W. Bush’s inaugural celebration, at the behest of the president’s daughters. But not everyone in the family-values-branded GOP felt at ease rubbing elbows with the devil-may-care musician. His appearance at the bash never took place.\n\nUndeterred, Kid Rock kept politicking. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate and fellow Michigander Mitt Romney adopted one of Kid Rock’s songs, Born Free, as a theme song. On the campaign trail, the teetoling do-gooder and the bacchanalian stage beast became friendly. \n\nTrump proved to be a more natural fit. While large chunks of the US entertainment industry lined up behind Hillary Clinton, Kid Rock dove headlong into MAGA, selling Trump-branded merch on tour and performing at his rallies. He embodied Trump’s GOP, which positioned Democrats as the party of finger-wagging, killjoy scolds and Republicans as the champions of freewheeling, anything-goes individualists. Before long, Kid Rock had golfed and trolled his way into the inner circle. \n\nSince hooking up with Trump, Kid Rock has released multiple songs decrying woke culture, posed for photos with the president in the Oval Office and praised his policies while attacking liberals during frequent guest spots on Fox News. (In an October interview with the network’s Jesse Watters, Kid Rock was asked about his Halloween costume. Putting on a Covid-style mask, he answered Watters with what critics called an ableist slur. The Special Olympics called on him to “acknowledge the hurt caused”; he has yet to do so.) Along the way, Kid Rock nosed ahead of the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, Kanye West and Chuck Norris as the declassé celebrity entertainer most closely associated with Trump’s presidency. \n\nTellingly, of all the performers in Trump’s orbit, it’s Kid Rock whom California Governor Gavin Newsom has chosen to poke fun of relentlessly in recent months. “BECAUSE OF HIS HORRIFIC MUSIC, CALIFORNIA WILL INDEFINITELY SUSPEND KID ROCK FROM PERFORMING IN THE GOLDEN STATE,” Newsom joked on X. “YOU’RE WELCOME!”\n\nIn early summer, with federal troops patrolling the streets of Los Angeles, JD Vance arrived in Nashville for the grand opening of Kid Rock’s second restaurant, the Detroit Cowboy. \n\nFor the occasion, Kid Rock played host to the vice president and other luminaries at the intersection of conservative politics and music: guitarist Ted Nugent, comedian Theo Von, podcaster Benny Johnson, Fox News host Steve Doocy and Redneck Woman singer Gretchen Wilson, according to social media posts. Amid the patriotic, rock-’n’-roll-themed decor, diners ripped into teetering seafood towers, steaming piles of lobster mac and cheese and hulking tomahawk steaks. At one point, country crooner Lee Greenwood sat at a piano and belted out the Trump-world anthem, God Bless the USA. \n\nThroughout his career, Kid Rock has festooned himself in all things Detroit, from championing the Made in Detroit apparel brand to hosting a 40th birthday celebration concert at Ford Field. But as his status in Trump’s cultural cabinet has soared, Mr. Motor City has established a second geographical beachhead several hundred miles closer to the heart of the GOP’s base. \n\nOn a hill overlooking Nashville, Kid Rock completed work recently on a massive residence that looks like the White House. The interior is tricked out in Trump-esque splendor, including a golden elevator and a golden bathroom complete with a golden toilet. \n\nLong the heart of America’s country music scene, Nashville has emerged in recent years as a powerful vortex of conservative media, the home of Ben Shapiro’s company, the Daily Wire, and various Republican podcasters, including Brett Cooper. It’s the perfect place, in other words, to fuse music with MAGA politics. \n\nFrom his hillside perch, Kid Rock acts as a key player in the scene. When the Ultimate Fighting Championship traveled to Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena in July, the company’s chief executive officer, Dana White, also a close ally of Trump’s, spent a Sunday morning with Kid Rock, hosting a brunch at his restaurant. This was not unusual. These days, whenever a business or cultural rainmaker comes to town—FBI Director Kash Patel, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders—there’s a good chance they’ll wind up breaking bread with Kid Rock and touring his nutty house. “It’s about 27,000 square feet and has two bedrooms,” Joe Rogan said on his podcast. “The rest of the house is just—party!” \n\nLately, while Newsom is busy fake-banning him from California, Kid Rock has been forging inroads in the rest of the country. Executives who routinely sell boatloads of tickets to audiences south of the Mason-Dixon Line have been eager to partner with him. In May, Kid Rock hosted his second “Rock N Rodeo” at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. The extravaganza features top competitors from the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) league squaring off in events such as steer wrestling and bareback riding. And, of course, a performance by Kid Rock. \n\n“Bob is one of the most insightful and inventive marketers that I’ve ever met,” says Sean Gleason, CEO of PBR. “He’s got a very unique eye for what will be entertaining for the audience. You match that up with the creative talent on the music side, and you’ve got a force that lasts for decades.”\n\nKid Rock’s prodigious connections are also a tremendous asset, Gleason says. This year, Rock N Rodeo received generous coverage on Fox News and was carried live on Fox Nation, the network’s streaming service. Afterward, Fox Nation reached a deal with PBR to air its regular Friday night events. “Bob’s relationships with Fox News and the Fox family helped us get that deal done,” Gleason says. \n\nIn 2023 country singer Jason Aldean released a video for Try That in a Small Town. The video’s central backdrop for celebrating salt-of-the-earth patriotism—the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee—was the site of an infamous 1927 lynching of a Black man as well as subsequent race riots in the 1940s. Soon, progressives were decrying his song as racist. Aldean responded on social media that the accusation was “meritless”; conservative pundits knocked the liberal complaints as yet another instance of cosmopolitan groupthink. \n\nWitnessing this, Kid Rock saw a business opportunity. He teamed up with Peachtree Entertainment, a Nashville-based promotion business, to create a new country music festival. The following year, “Rock the Country” made its debut with the initial tagline “7 small towns, 7 massive shows.” At the first stop in Louisiana, Aldean was a headliner. \n\n“I see a huge void for—you can call them right-wingers, MAGA, you can call them whatever you want—I call them hard-working people that love this country,” Kid Rock explained in a recent marketing video for the festival. “I think it’s the greatest movement ever created.” Shane Quick, an executive at Peachtree, said in the same video: “I feel like a lot of festivals are being built for one side of this country. We wanted to build a festival for the other side.” \n\nSince the festival kicked off last year, several conservative bigwigs have graced the stage, from podcaster Tucker Carlson to Larry Rhoden, the Republican governor of South Dakota. On this year’s tour, amid a surfeit of pro-Trump signs and apparel, there was a cultural interloper not always welcome of late among red-state rollickers: Bud Light. \n\nA few years ago, Kid Rock donned a MAGA hat, stacked up several cases of Bud Light and opened fire. The resulting beer-snuff video—a reflection of the singer’s outrage over the beverage’s marketing collaboration with a transgender influencer—helped fuel a conservative backlash that wound up successfully tanking Bud Light sales and temporarily driving down the share price of its parent company. \n\nDuring the subsequent PR crisis for Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, Kid Rock happened to cross paths with the company’s CEO at a UFC match and hit it off. Afterward, Kid Rock went on Rogan’s podcast and urged conservatives to forgive the wayward beer brand for what he characterized as its brief and misguided bout of wokeness. The ceasefire paid off handsomely. Bud Light was a fixture on the “Rock the Country” circuit, trying to win back conservatives one frosty lager at a time. Naturally, there were freebies too. Throughout the weekend in South Carolina, any fan who successfully tossed a lasso around the head of a plastic bull walked away with Bud Light swag. \n\n“Since Bud Light’s sales were hit really hard, they’ve been trying to reconnect with the core customer, which is that Kid Rock, unapologetic rebel type of personality,” says Anson Frericks, a former executive for Anheuser-Busch InBev. “The Kid Rock crowd, they drink a lot of beer.”\n\nWhile the Super Bowl halftime show might be beyond Kid Rock’s reach at this point in his career, the singer is focused on another prized venue. In the October appearance with Watters on Fox News, amid a broad uproar over Trump’s demolition of the East Wing of the White House, the host asked Kid Rock about rumors that he’d be the first act to perform inside the planned “big beautiful ballroom.” \n\n“I hope so,” the singer answered. “Ball till you fall, that’s what I say.”","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-kid-rock-maga/?srnd=homepage-asia","image":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iW8DBkihdTqM/v1/-1x-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 12:00:40","author":"Ashley Carman,Felix Gillette","authors":["Ashley Carman","Felix Gillette"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":380607062,"title":"Kid Rock Is a Pro-Trump, Anti-Woke Rock Star for the MAGA Era","text":"On a sweltering summer night in South Carolina, sweaty concertgoers milled about in a field, awaiting the day’s headliner. Just after 9:30 p.m., screens above the main stage lit up with a recorded message. “This amazing crowd here today must be the most patriotic group in rock music history,” President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office. “We love you all, and Kid Rock is as good as they get. Enjoy the concert.” The audience erupted in applause. \n\nA moment later, Kid Rock, in sunglasses, black T-shirt and camouflage shorts, walked onstage and started in on his first song. For the next hour and a half, the countrified rocker bounced around, singing and dancing with a manic energy far beyond the recommended daily allowance for the knees and vertebrae of a 54-year-old grandfather.\n\nThe set list leaned heavily on Kid Rock’s greatest hits, including a couple of classics from his first big album in the 1990s. If the musical vibe harked back to the days of Bill Clinton, the moment itself felt like a distillation of something very Trumpy. This was the “Rock the Country” tour, orchestrated by Kid Rock and unofficially promoted by the president to the duo’s overlapping fan bases. The result was a lively mashup of identity politics and beer-battered revelry that billed itself as “a gathering for the true heart of America,” where “hardworking, God-fearing patriots unite under the open sky.” \n\nThis event, in a bucolic patch not far from the town of Anderson and its prominent Confederate war monument, marked the final stop of the tour. Over the course of two days, sunbaked fans tossed beach balls and posed for photos in front of 20-foot-tall cowboy boots. Women in cutoff jeans and tank tops mingled with men in red, white and blue overall shorts. At one point, everyone removed their headwear, gazed at a giant American flag dangling from a crane and recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Off to one side, people lined up to take turns bucking on a mechanical bull. Between sets, a DJ fired up the audience: “Give it up for No. 47!” \n\nNearly a year into Trump’s second term, the American music industry remains something of an emotionally triggering unsafe space for his diehard supporters. Recent headlines have been particularly unwelcoming. In early October, well-known Kamala Harris abettor Taylor Swift released an album that quickly broke sales records. A few days later, the NFL announced that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny—a major critic of Trump and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement—would headline the next Super Bowl halftime show. Conservatives raged on social media. Why was the NFL picking an artist who sings in Spanish instead of, say, tapping a famous performer from the heartland of America? In short, why not Kid Rock? \n\nTo be clear, Kid Rock’s fans are nowhere as numerous as Bad Bunny’s. This year, as of Oct. 9, Kid Rock has generated 409 million audio and video streams across all platforms, according to Luminate, a data company focused on the entertainment industry. Over the same period, Bad Bunny had 4.7 billion. But if Kid Rock is no longer a Billboard-topper, he does embody a certain type of artist who no longer seeks a middle-of-the road audience to find success. Over the past decade, various entrepreneurs and Trump himself have capitalized on the political polarization of American consumers by rolling out conservative-branded products aimed at the president’s supporters: There are not only cable TV channels, social media networks and podcasts catering to the MAGA demographic but also cryptocurrencies, sneakers, mobile phones, bottled water, coffee, kitchen appliances—and, thanks to Kid Rock, summer music festivals. \n\nFor those who don’t want their concertgoing experience tarnished by anti-Trump outbursts from the likes of Bruce Springsteen (or Green Day, Pearl Jam, Eminem, etc.), Kid Rock has created a haven, positioning himself as kingmaker. He’s breathed new life into his music career at a time when many 1990s rap-rock acts have long since shuffled off into cultural obsolescence. \n\nOver the summer, dozens of acts performed at the various “Rock the Country” stops, including Gavin Adcock, Kentucky Headhunters, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Little Texas, Nickelback, Travis Tritt and Kid Rock’s favorite hunting buddy, Hank Williams Jr. At one point during the South Carolina stop, Aaron Lewis, the heavily tattooed lead singer of the alt-metal group Staind, took the microphone. There were two things, he said, that liberals will never take away from Americans: “our God and our guns.” Addressing the crowd of an estimated 20,000, he said: “Look around you. We need to stand up for our children and grandchildren, who are gonna inherit this country.” \n\nEven by the rococo standards of American second acts, Kid Rock’s path to musical adoration among Christian conservative audiences has been a strange trip. \n\nNearly 30 years ago, Bob Ritchie, who declined to be interviewed for this article, first strutted into the national spotlight as Kid Rock, a cocky singer/rapper with a love of middle-finger salutes. He joyfully spun out sybaritic rhymes about chasing babes and getting wasted. He was like some sort of mythical party creature—part man, part beer funnel. \n\nMTV played his music videos relentlessly. Kid Rock’s 1998 album Devil Without a Cause sold more than 14 million copies, making him a certifiable American pop star. He bought mansions in Florida and California, was briefly married to former Playboy Playmate Pamela Anderson, got a year’s probation after a scuffle at a Waffle House and released a string of albums, largely devoted to unfettered hell-raising as a near heavenly mission. His fans loved it. \n\nBut every party eventually ends. And by the mid-2010s, the Kid Rock bender was winding down. Many parts of the music industry that had bolstered his ascent in the 1990s—CDs, MTV, the rock-rap genre—were fading fast. In 2015, when Rolling Stone caught up with him at his estate in Alabama, he was showing off his extensive gun collection, shooting wild hogs and bemoaning the performance of his previous album. “It f---ing flopped,” he said. At the time, the “Kid” was well into his mid-40s.\n\nKid Rock grew up in exurban Michigan. His dad, who ran a thriving Lincoln-Mercury dealership, was a staunch Republican. It was the heyday of Motor City “Buy American,” and the adolescent Kid Rock caught the fervor. As he accumulated musical accomplishments, he also began seeking out political validation. It took a while: At one point in 2005, Kid Rock was booked to play at George W. Bush’s inaugural celebration, at the behest of the president’s daughters.

Bread prices are down, dairy prices are down, and the price of eggs has declined 86% since March.\"\n\nHe credited McDonald's for helping cut costs on popular items, calling the company a partner in improving affordability.\n\nTrump said the economy was rebounding, claiming the stock market reached all-time highs 48 times in nine months.\n\n\"The American people are seeing that the country is doing better,\" he said, predicting that \"new heights of prosperity\" were ahead.\n\nHe closed his speech by praising McDonald's workers and leaders. \"You're respected all over the world, and it's an honor to be with McDonald's,\" he said, telling the audience that the company plays an important role in the country's recovery.\n\nOriginally published on vcpost.com","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/mcdonalds-receives-unexpected-menu-advice-president-trump-summit-3790754","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4634513/florida-mcdonalds-employee-arrested-shooting-drive-through-customers-after-dispute.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-19 11:22:33","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":380517076,"title":"Scoop: Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. jumps into high stakes ballot box congressional showdown","text":"FIRST ON FOX: The top outside political group that supported President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign is jumping into a hotly contested special election for a Republican-controlled vacant House seat in a solidly red congressional district in Tennessee. MAGA Inc. is launching ads to support Trump-endorsed Republican nominee Matt Van Epps in his showdown against Democratic nominee Aftyn Behn in the race to succeed former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from office in June to take a private sector job. The spots were shared first with Fox News Digital on Wednesday. The ads, which MAGA Inc. says will run on broadcast TV and digital and are backed by a seven-figure buy that also includes investments in get-out-the-vote efforts, are the first by the group since last year's presidential election. Republican groups are pouring plenty of resources into the special election to avoid the possibility of a major upset and protect the GOP's current razor-thin 219-214 majority in the House. TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATE WINS CROWDED GOP PRIMARY IN BATTLE FOR VACANT HOUSE SEAT Trump carried the district — which is located in central and western Tennessee, stretches from Kentucky to Alabama, and includes parts of Nashville — by 22 points in last year's presidential election. But Democrats, energized after their sweeping victories earlier this month in the 2025 elections, are optimistic about their chances in the Dec. 2 special election. Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin, who campaigned with Behn last weekend, argued that she has \"an excellent shot to win.\" DEMOCRAT AFTYN BEHN ADVANCES TO SPECIAL ELECTION IN BATTLE FOR VACANT CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN DEEP-RED DISTRICT The spots by MAGA Inc. target Behn, a state representative, former healthcare community organizer, and rising progressive star who some have dubbed the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" over her vote last year in the legislature against what Republicans tout as the state's largest tax cut ever. \"Politician Aftyn Behn voted against the largest tax cut in state history,\" the narrator in the spot said. And the narrator claimed that \"this year, Aftyn Behn backed more tax hikes that would cost Tennessee families thousands more,\" which points to Behn's opposition to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed the Republican-controlled Congress along partisan lines and extended the Trump tax cuts from the president's first term. \"We can't afford radical liberal Aftyn Behn,\" the narrator argued. The ad also includes a clip, used twice, of Behn saying, \"I'm a very radical person.\" TRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER SPECIAL ELECTION PRIMARY IN DEEP-RED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT Trump's endorsement of Van Epps helped boost the former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services to primary victory last month in an 11-candidate race for the Republican congressional nomination. Last week, Trump hosted a tele-rally for Van Epps in which he claimed Behn was a \"Marxist\" and linked her to Zohran Mamdani, the socialist mayor-elect of New York City, whom Republicans are aiming to make the new face of the Democratic Party. The Van Epps campaign is asking the president to campaign in person in the district ahead of the special election. On Tuesday, former Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in last year's presidential election, campaigned with Behn. \"Kamala Harris’ visit to Tennessee says it all — Aftyn Behn is a typical radical liberal. Behn supports higher taxes and open borders. Tennessee is going to reject her agenda and elect Matt Van Epps to Congress,\" MAGA Inc. spokesman Alex Pfeiffer told Fox News Digital. MAGA Inc. was not a major player in the 2022 midterms, as the group saved much of its resources for Trump's 2024 campaign to win back the White House. MAGA Inc. ended up spending $456-million to support Trump's campaign, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign finance data. But with Trump aiming to help Republicans protect their House and Senate majorities in next year's midterm elections — \"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote in a social media post on Monday — MAGA Inc. is expected to play a much larger role than they did during the 2022 cycle. \"This spend in an off-year special election shows how committed MAGA Inc will be to ensuring the House and Senate remain in Republican control,\" a source familiar told Fox News Digital. And MAGA Inc. has the war chest to deliver on that commitment. The group raised nearly $177 million through June, according to the most recent fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Other conservative groups that are pouring big bucks into the special election in Tennessee include the Club for Growth Action and Conservatives for American Excellence PAC, which have both launched six-figure ad buys.

He can see the GOP ads from 1,000 miles away, because they’re going to write themselves. The mayor-elect of New York City is going to destroy the Big Apple. Why? We’ve been here before with democratic socialism. It’s still economic misery, death, and abject mayhem, but with extra steps. You still get the failures of communism, but you can vote for it, and there’s no secret police. \n\nThe comedian noted the collapse of similar experiments on his recent episode of Real Time last Friday. Vermont tried single-payer—it failed because it was too expensive. The 2025 elections saw Democrats win in Trump districts, and they were supposedly moderate. Sorry, a party base that still thinks men should be in women’s bathrooms remains suspect in my eyes. But it’s true their candidates, for the most part, did not go full Lenin like Mamdani. He took off his nice-guy mask when he won. For the rest of the 2025 crop, it’ll take time, but their true colors will be revealed. Democrats are the party that endorses political violence, censorship, and the weaponization of our justice system. They can’t keep this charade up for long. So, on that end, Maher is off-base, but not with Mamdani (via NY Post): \n\n.@TheDemocrats must recognize that Zohran Mamdani is the party's future, but unfortunately, it's the Republican Party. pic.twitter.com/XTgr0YNULa— Bill Maher (@billmaher) November 15, 2025\n\n“Democrats must recognize that Zohran Mamdani is the future of the party. Unfortunately, it’s the Republican Party. Get it?” Maher joked. “And if you missed his victory speech in last week’s mayoral election in New York, don’t worry. You’ll see it in every attack ad for the next two years.”While Maher admitted that Mamdani “seems like a nice guy,” he offered a warning about the Democratic Party’s increasing appetite for democratic socialist candidates. Maher urged that before the “whole left side of the country catches socialism fever,” to take some advice from another “big winner” from last week’s special elections. […] As the Democratic Party appears to be divided between its moderate and progressive wings, Maher asked, “How do we decide who’s right?” “It turns out we don’t really have to flip a coin. We have the evidence. In 2024, 13 Democrats won in districts Trump also won, all moderates. This isn’t rocket science. All the left-leaning think tanks have done autopsies on 2024, and they all came up with the same message. Move to the center,” he asserted. Maher pointed to Vermont’s “collapsed” single-payer healthcare system as further evidence against the effectiveness of democratic socialism. “Democratic socialism is like a dating profile. Things look great until you meet up in the real world. For example, Bernie Sanders. His big thing was always bringing single-payer health care to our country of 340 million. But when liberal, tie-dyed Vermont tried to do it for a population of 626,000, it collapsed,” he railed.\n\nYeah, he took some shots at the GOP, but nothing you haven’t heard already. But he is right about the current state of the Democratic Party, who, no doubt, will take a mayoral elections a sign that Mamdanism can be a nationwide brand.\n\nEarlier this month, Maher also sided against his side by not caring that Trump was doing some construction work at the White House:\n\n🚨NEW: Bill Maher *TORCHES* media over its MELTDOWN about Trump's ballroom🚨\"When he first mentioned it, it was all about, 'Oh my god, he’s desecrating the White House!'
