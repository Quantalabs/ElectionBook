Discovery: report","text":"Paramount Skydance is preparing a bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, according to The Wall Street Journal. A report published Thursday cited sources who told the Journal that Paramount Skydance, which went through its own merger last month and is now being led by David Ellison, is seeking to acquire the movie studio and cable networks run by one of the company&apos;s top rivals. If completed, the deal would mark the largest merger of two legacy Hollywood studios under one corporate umbrella. NEW PARAMOUNT CEO ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE FULL-TIME OR LEAVE Warner Bros. Discovery announced in June that the company was splitting the studio from its cable networks. The spinoff company, dubbed Discovery Global Networks, included CNN, TBS and TNT. It is unclear whether the corporate split would be halted as a result of a Paramount Skydance bid. Paramount&apos;s potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery would put HBO and CNN in the same corporate umbrella as CBS, Showtime, and several other cable networks, including Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central. PARAMOUNT, SKYDANCE COMPLETE $8 BILLION MERGER AS FCC CONTINUES CBS PROBE The Journal noted that \"a bid hasn’t yet been submitted and the plans could still fall apart.\" Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, Paramount merged with Skydance in an $8 billion transaction, which was ultimately approved by the FCC following Paramount&apos;s months-long legal battle with President Donald Trump. Trump had sued Paramount and CBS News over election interference in the network&apos;s handling of its \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in the weeks leading up to the November election. Paramount settled Trump&apos;s lawsuit in July. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP Warner Bros. Discovery isn&apos;t the only media asset Ellison reportedly has his eyes set on. Ellison is also seeking to buy The Free Press for $100-200 million and reportedly plans to give its founder, independent journalist Bari Weiss, a leading editorial role at CBS News.

This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition.”\n\nHarris’ detached tone is something to behold.\n\nHer complicity in Joe Biden’s selfish — and indeed, reckless — decision to seek a second term in the Oval Office can’t be waved away.\n\nShe was not some liberal pundit or low-level staffer observing the president from afar, convinced that some vast, right-wing conspiracy could “cheapfake” its way to victory.\n\nNo, Kamala Harris was at Biden’s right hand throughout — and she did much more than repeat a brain-dead mantra, as she claims.\n\nWhen Special Counsel Robert Hur revealed that the sitting commander-in-chief could no longer remember when his son Beau had died, or even the timeframe in which he had served as vice president, Harris was the administration’s attack dog.\n\n“As a former prosecutor, the comments that were made by that prosecutor [were] gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate,” she railed.\n\n“The way that the president’s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous,” she continued — then, of all things, called Hur’s “integrity” into question.\n\nMonths later, the audio of Hur’s interview proved his description accurate.\n\nNow, despite using her power and influence to smear Hur, she seeks credit for acknowledging the folly of Biden’s 2024 campaign.\n\nBut not her complicity in it, because doing so would sign her political death warrant.\n\nShe could perhaps be forgiven for backing the wrong horse in 2024, but not the unpatriotic moral error of putting her personal career ahead of the country’s well-being.\n\nAnd so she insists that, while “many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity,” the “truth” is “Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president.”\n\nOf the “debate debacle” that drove Biden from the race, “I don’t believe it was incapacity,” Harris offers.\n\n“If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”\n\nIf only saying it made it so.\n\nIt’s now not a matter of debate, but a matter of record that Biden was unable to discharge his duties during his last year in office.\n\nHis inner circle concealed his condition from other members of his staff, and the president didn’t recognize George Clooney at a fundraiser the Hollywood A-lister threw for him.\n\nWorst of all, the released excerpt from “107 Days” reveals Harris as a shameless whiner, blaming her electoral defeat on the White House for failing to boost and praise her.\n\n“Getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible,” moaned the failed candidate.\n\n“I often learned that the president’s staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me,” she complained.\n\n“Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more.”\n\nHere’s yet another truth known to nearly everyone but her: Kamala Harris is a career mediocrity who fell backward into the vice presidency after an embarrassing 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nHer dismal performance in that office, and the Electoral College blowout she suffered at the hands of Donald Trump, came as no surprise to anyone with knowledge of her record — including the skeptical Biden team that had, if anything, overestimated her abilities.\n\nHarris seeks plaudits for her loyalty to Joe Biden, even as she blames him for her own shortcomings.\n\nShe touts her patriotism even as she continues to lie to the American people.\n\nAnd she remains, six decades into her life, hopelessly unaware of who she is.\n\nHarris is pitching “107 Days” as a book about a plucky underdog who embarked upon an admirable, if quixotic, quest to save her country.\n\nIn truth, it’s the story of a deluded liar whose country, now more than ever, sees right through her pitiful posturing.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Kamala Harris in her new book seeks plaudits for her loyalty to Joe Biden, while blaming him for her own shortcomings — and remains hopelessly unaware of who she is.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/11/opinion/kamala-harris-stumbles-onto-the-truth-shes-a-whiny-liar/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/2024-former-us-vice-president-111089030.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 22:18:43","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.551},{"id":359702580,"title":"Fox News Poll: Trump’s ratings are strong on border security, weak on the economy","text":"While President Donald Trump receives positive reviews on border security and public safety, the economy remains a weakness. Prices are a problem for most voters, as only a small number feel they are getting ahead financially, and more than half think things are worse under the new White House. By a 22-point margin, a Fox News national survey finds that more voters say the Trump administration has made the economy worse (52%) rather than better (30%). Those sentiments are almost identical to how they felt about the Biden administration – and are the reverse of how voters felt eight years ago during Trump’s first term. FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SUPPORT A THIRD POLITICAL PARTY, BUT NOT IF IT’S ELON MUSK’S The survey was completed before Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk’s assassination Wednesday. Ratings of the economy continue to be negative by more than 2-to-1 (71% negative vs. 29% positive). That’s roughly where things stood when Trump took office. And as has been the case for more than four years, fewer than 15% say they are getting ahead financially, while at least three times that number say they are falling behind. FOX NEWS POLL: SUPPORT FOR DEPORTATION DEPENDS ON WHO IS BEING TARGETED Yet in some areas, voters say things are not as bad. A year ago, 48% said gas prices were a \"major\" problem for their family. Now 33% feel that way, down 15 points. Likewise, a smaller share says housing costs (by 11 points) and grocery prices (by 8 points) are a major problem. It’s the opposite on utility (+2 points) and healthcare costs (+7), as more people call those a major problem. Still, large majorities describe each of these costs as either a minor or major problem. \"The question former President Biden's team was asking a year ago was whether voters would get used to an $8 dollar box of cereal, and the answer was no,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with his Democratic counterpart, Chris Anderson. \"I think the Trump team is finding this dynamic still holds. It's not enough that prices aren't rising, they need to come down. If not, 2026 will be a bad year for the GOP.\" Voters’ persistent negativity about the economy was at least somewhat validated by a recent Labor Department report that showed the 2024 employment estimates were much weaker than initially thought. The economy remains by far the most important issue to voters (37%). That’s followed by immigration and border security (13%), healthcare (11%), and political division (11%). All other issues are in single digits, including crime and guns. Notably, Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree the economy is the top issue facing the country. Looking ahead, voters are pessimistic: 62% think life will be worse for the next generation of Americans. That’s up from 53% who felt that way a year ago – and is the second highest in Fox News surveys going back to 2002. By a 10-point margin, optimism is higher among parents (44%) than non-parents (34%), and by a 13-point margin, more dads (50%) than moms (37%) think life will be better for their kids. Eight in 10 Democrats and independents think life will be worse, while 6 in 10 Republicans think it will be better. A year ago, nearly 6 in 10 Democrats said life would be better for the next generation, while 7 in 10 Republicans and 6 in 10 independents said worse. Approval of Trump on the economy stands at 39%, only one tick higher than his record low, and even fewer voters approve of his handling of tariffs (36%) and the cost of living (32%). While Trump’s ratings are better on immigration (47% approve) and crime (50%), his best marks are on border security, as 57% approve. That’s not only a record on border security, but it’s also his second-highest approval ever on any issue in a Fox News survey (the highest was 60% for \"recent hurricanes\" in 2017). In addition, 49% approve of ICE, up from 46% in June. Fewer are concerned about crime in their neighborhood: 32% are extremely or very concerned, down from 48% in 2021. Over half approve of the federal government generally playing a role in policing crime in large cities (53%) and specifically of Trump sending National Guard troops to help the police in Washington, D.C. (51%). Currently, 46% like the job Trump is doing overall, while 54% disapprove. His highest approval this term was 49% in March, soon after taking office. Fully 88% of Republicans approve, as do 55% of men under age 45 and 48% of Hispanics. Among all voters, a larger number strongly disapproves of Trump (45%) than strongly approves (25%). That 20-point intensity gap is mostly unchanged since March and is comparable with Biden’s ratings for most of his term. Some 46% of voters also approve of the job Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is doing as secretary of Health and Human Services. His ratings are higher among parents (53%) and dads (57%) than non-parents (43%) and moms (49%). Forty-nine percent approve of Jerome Powell’s performance as chair of the Federal Reserve. About half of those approving of Trump also approve of Powell, and vice versa. Poll-pourri Two-thirds of voters think the country has become less united since Trump took office. That’s double the number who feel he has brought people together, and worse than the 54% who felt Biden was dividing the country four years ago. Trump’s personal favorable rating is in line with his job approval: 43% view him favorably and 57% unfavorably, for a net negative by 14 points. Vice President JD Vance (-12), former Vice President Kamala Harris (-13), Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (-12), and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (-11) all have about the same net negative favorability as Trump. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s marks are underwater by 13 points, yet he is unknown to nearly half of voters. Three quarters think the president should \"always\" follow the law, while one quarter say the U.S. is so far off track it needs a president who will \"break some laws\" to set things right. Those sentiments have remained unchanged since December 2023. Three times as many Republicans as Democrats think the U.S. needs a president willing to break some laws to set things right. More voters have confidence in their local courts (66%) than in federal courts (58%) or the Supreme Court (55%). Far more Republicans (78%) have faith in the Supreme Court than independents (47%) and Democrats (34%), while majorities of all three groups have confidence in their local courts. Conducted Sept. 6-9, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,004 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (119) and cellphones (638) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (247). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data.

In the aftermath of the horrific assassination of MAGA champion Charlie Kirk, a husband and father of two, it was natural that his allies, including President Trump, lionized him as a patriot, free-speech advocate, and activist. And political opponents somberly denounced the terrible killing, as they should, with some hailing Kirk’s devotion to public debate. There’s a tendency in such a moment to look for the best in people or, at least, to not dwell on the negatives. That can be a good thing. Yet as Kirk is quickly canonized by Trump and his movement—on Thursday Trump announced he would bestow upon Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom—a full depiction of his impact on American politics is largely being sidestepped.\n\nIn promoting a story on the murder of Kirk—headlined “Charlie Kirk killing deepens America’s violent spiral”—Axios described him as a “fierce champion of the right to free expression” whose “voice was silenced by an assassin’s bullet.” New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein, wrote, “You can dislike much of what Kirk believed and the following statement is still true: Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way. He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.” Klein added that he “envied” the political movement Kirk built and praised “his moxie and fearlessness.”\n\nHere’s the problem: Kirk built that movement with falsehoods. And his advocacy was laced with racist and bigoted statements. Recognizing this does not diminish the awfulness of this act of violence. Nor does it lessen our outrage or diminish our sympathy for his family, friends, and colleagues. Yet if this is an appropriate moment to assess Kirk and issue bold statements about his participation in America’s political life, there ought to be room for a true discussion.\n\nKirk, a right-wing provocateur who founded and led Turning Point USA, an organization of young conservatives, was a promoter of Trump’s destructive and baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Two days before the January 6 riot, Kirk boasted in a tweet that Students for Trump and Turning Point Action were “Sending 80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.”\n\nAfter the attack, Kirk deleted the tweet, and he claimed that the people his group transported to DC participated only in the rally that occurred before the assault on Congress—where Trump whipped up the crowd and encouraged it to march on the Capitol. The New York Times subsequently reported that Turning Point Action sent only seven buses to the event. Turning Point also paid the $60,000 speaking fee to Kimberly Guilfoyle, a MAGA personality, for the brief remarks she made at the rally. “We will not allow the liberals and the Democrats to steal our dream or steal our elections,” Guilfoyle told the crowd. (Kirk took the Fifth when he was deposed by the House January 6 committee.)\n\nEven prior to the election, Kirk helped set the stage for Trump’s attempt to subvert the republic. In September 2020, the Washington Post reported that Turning Point Action was running a “sprawling yet secretive campaign” to disseminate pro-Trump propaganda “that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.” The messages Turning Point generated spread the charge that Democrats were using mail balloting to steal the election and downplayed the threat from Covid. (Kirk’s group called the story a “gross mischaracterization.”)\n\nWhatever Kirk’s group and supporters did on January 6, he was part of the MAGA crusade that largely broke US politics. Trump’s refusal to accept his 2020 loss, his conniving to stay in power, and his encouragement of a lie that led to massive political violence greatly undermined American democracy and exacerbated the already deep divide in the nation. Kirk was a part of that. Yet Klein overlooks that in praising Kirk. And a New York Times piece on Kirk’s political career made no mention of this, though it did report that he had been “accused” of “antisemitism, homophobia and racism, having blamed Jewish communities for fomenting hatred against white people, criticized gay rights on religious grounds and questioned the qualifications of Black airline pilots.” \n\nKirk’s advocacy of vigorous debate ought not be separated from what he said while jousting in the public square. He hosted white nationalists on his podcast. He posted racist comments on his X account, including this remark: “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, ‘Boy, I hope he’s qualified.'” He endorsed the white “replacement” conspiracy theory. After the October 7 attack on Israel, he compared Black Lives Matter to Hamas. He called for preserving “white demographics in America.” He asserted that Islam was not compatible with Western culture. He derided women who supported Kamala Harris 2024 for wanting “careerism, consumerism, and loneliness.” Or, as he also put it, “Democratic women want to die alone without children.” When Paul Pelosi, the husband of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, was brutally attacked in 2022, Kirk spread a conspiracy theory about the crime and called for an “amazing patriot” to bail out the assailant. He routinely deployed extreme rhetoric to demonize his political foes.\n\nKirk did enjoy debating others. He visited campuses and held events in which he took on all comers, arguing over a variety of contentious issues. He was a showman, and his commitment to verbal duking was admirable.

He was eager to charm and please while feeding on backlash and conflict, omnipresent and omnivorous about politics and pop culture, and pithy enough to get his message across in the short-video format that has increasingly come to define media consumption. After Kirk was killed on Wednesday by an assassin who remains at large, he was instantly mourned by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, but also by a loosely affiliated set of social media personalities who have likewise achieved a foothold in a slippery streamer-YouTube-podcast space: Theo Von, Russell Brand, Jake Paul, and Dave Portnoy.\nBy accounts from across the political spectrum, Kirk and the original organization he founded, Turning Point USA, were prescient in understanding that fluency in this ecosystem would become table stakes for public life. “I came on board with Turning Point when social media was just being looked at to spread influence and message,” Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna said in an interview on Thursday. “And so I was one of the OG politicos on Instagram, and that’s kind of where I got my start.”\nAt the time, Luna was an influencer and model debating whether to pursue medicine or politics. “Charlie had the Trump skill in being able to recognize people’s skills, both their strengths and their weaknesses, early on,” Luna said. She became Turning Point’s director of Hispanic engagement in 2018 and went on to join Candace Owens as one of the organization’s breakthrough alumni.\nLuna was able to reach federal office on account of her social media presence, she told me, “not just with fundraising, but messaging, taking on legacy media. And so I’d say that me, JD Vance, other people who have been able to target this and use it in the way that Charlie taught me how to do it early on, have been some of the more influential and effective people in US politics.”\nKirk’s trademark event—and source for his unflagging streams of content—was the college campus drop-in, during which he’d debate students about politics and his intense Christian faith. The genre was time-honored (Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D’Souza), but Kirk achieved new heights of saturation due to the serial consistency of his online output. In his depictions, the young left was rootless, flimsy, decadent, and miserable, in contrast to his smirking command. That ease delivered even his most provocative positions and rhetoric: that rape could not justify an abortion; that Kamala Harris was a “DEI candidate”; that the idea of Muslim mayors leading both London and New York didn’t “feel right.”\n“If you really do want to run for office,” Luna said, “I would say that you should probably get on the college campus and debate random college kids.”\nAfter Trump’s election victory, Newsom was among the throng of Democrats seeking to reinvent themselves for the media era Kirk so readily embodied. In the postmortems, there emerged a sense that they had failed to not only capture a broad vein of influence, but also identify it in the first place.\n“There are some really, really intelligent, well-speaking, well-intentioned creators on the left who have tremendous impact, tremendous reach as well, and they do a really good job,” the 22-year-old liberal influencer Harry Sisson told me. “But the difference between the left and the right is that the Republicans have groups like Turning Point USA who embrace their creators.”\n“I have a philosophy that I take into content creation and just life,” Sisson added, “which is if you see your enemies doing something, don’t be afraid to use their tactics if it’s working.”\nBefore he reached his ultimate level of cultural saturation, Kirk, like most of his peers on the young online right, started from a place of virtual anonymity. The 28-year-old social media operative and political adviser Alex Bruesewitz, often credited for the Trump campaign’s facility with podcasters, mourned Kirk on X on Wednesday evening. They first connected on the same platform, he wrote, when he was 17 and Kirk was 19, “both of us with just a few thousand followers.” Just this month, they had both spoken at a conference held by Build Up Korea, a conservative youth movement in the image of Kirk’s.\n“I’ve traveled all over the world,” Bruesewitz added later, “and in every country, people have approached me with the same question: ‘Alex, how can we find our own Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk?’”\nIn a February New York Times Magazine profile, Kirk grew nostalgic while discussing how he started listening to Rush Limbaugh in high school. “I was like, This guy is unbelievable!” he recalled. “Because you’re looking for someone in high school to affirm your beliefs. I would never forget: on my lunch break, from like 12:17 to 12:55, I’d listen. Just me. I went all in on Rush.” The network of conservative media personalities has grown far more scattered in the time since, but Kirk ultimately cultivated a similar degree of sway and personal connection.\n“I think Charlie Kirk has the ability to be Billy Graham meets Rush Limbaugh,” the Fort Lauderdale entrepreneur and podcaster Patrick Bet-David said in a clip he resurfaced in the aftermath of the shooting, following up the comment with another bite-size claim about Kirk’s impact: “I have him as top five on getting Trump elected.”\nWhen I reached Bet-David on Thursday to expand on the comparison, he noted that Kirk’s use of online levers wasn’t, on its own, the source of his power. “There’s a lot of guys that know that as well,” Bet-David said. “The second part is he actually believes in what he’s talking about.”\nThe full upshot of Kirk’s work, he figured, wouldn’t materialize until years into the future. Turning Point “just woke up a lot of kids who have been listening to his content for the last few years,” Bet-David said, “and there may be hundreds of Charlie Kirks that may be rising up the next 5, 10, 15 years.”","summary":"With his relentless approach and online inescapability, the young conservative movement leader built a culture-war behemoth.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-new-media-ecosystem","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68c331add5c692c73c4dc2de/16:9/w_5552,h_3123,c_limit/2190485837","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 20:55:22","author":"Dan Adler","authors":["Dan Adler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.315},{"id":359684242,"title":"Paramount Skydance is preparing a bid for Warner Bros.

Its Warner Bros. film studio also has a historic track record, and owns the intellectual property to franchises like \"Harry Potter,\" DC Comics and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nBoth companies have a long list of major sports rights, too, the marquee content for all traditional TV and streaming platforms. A merger would put the likes of the NFL, MLB, an array of college football and basketball, and other major sports under one roof.\n\nMedia executives and experts have expected consolidation could be coming to the industry.\n\nZaslav has said publicly for some time that media companies need to consolidate. During an earnings call in November, shortly after Donald Trump was elected as president, Zaslav said a new administration could usher in more dealmaking.\n\nHowever, in recent months, some media companies have moved toward separation. Late last year, Comcast announced that its NBCUniversal would spin off its pay TV networks, which includes CNBC and MSNBC, into a separate, publicly traded entity. Months later, WBD announced it would make the same move.\n\nParamount Skydance is the result of an $8 billion merger that was announced last year and received regulatory approval in August to move forward after a lengthy delay.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission cleared the way for the merger weeks after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit he filed against the company over the editing of an interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAt the time of deal's approval, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement that he welcomed \"Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"\n\nThe company is looking to cut more than $2 billion in costs, and layoffs are expected to continue.

Discovery: Report","text":"Last month, Skydance Media, the entertainment giant, completed an $8 billion acquisition of one of Hollywood’s most prestigious studios, Paramount. Skydance, owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, now reportedly has its eyes set on another historic movie studio: Warner Bros.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Paramount Skydance is currently preparing a majority cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. If completed, the son of one of Donald Trump’s most powerful supporters (and, as of this week, the tech billionaire to unseat Elon Musk as the world’s richest person) would own a gargantuan portion of America’s entertainment industry.\n\nNot a whole lot of information has been released yet about the reported deal. The Journal notes that the bid would be for “the entire company, including its cable networks and movie studio.” Gizmodo reached out to Paramount and Warner Bros. for more information.\n\nThe Ellison elder has been described as a personal “friend” of Trump, and the New York Times reports that, not long after Trump’s presidential victory, Ellison “appeared at Mar-a-Lago to sit in on a transition meeting.” He also visited the White House earlier this year to take part in the launch of the Stargate Project, an AI infrastructure initiative that will be a boon for the data center industry.\n\nEllison Sr. has also floated the idea of buying TikTok, which would put the family in control of yet another massive media acquisition, albeit of a slightly different kind. Last August, the New York Times reported that Oracle was helping the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing org behind Project 2025, to identify a list of Trump loyalists for the new administration.\n\nThere appears to be an Ellison family interest in propping up conservative voices. A report published earlier this month by Puck stated that Ellison Jr. was looking to buy Bari Weiss’s The Free Press for somewhere between $100 and $200 million. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Ellison is considering giving Weiss a top editorial position at CBS, which is owned by Paramount.\n\nAt the same time, Ellison Jr. has also been accused of engaging in a “side deal” with President Trump as part of CBS’s $16 million settlement with the president over what he said was an unfairly edited interview with Kamala Harris from last year. That alleged side deal supposedly “up to $20 million of programming in support of conservative causes,” although Paramount immediately clarified “that it wasn’t aware of such terms,” the Hollywood Reporter reported in August. Nevertheless, House Democrats have announced their intentions to look into the matter.","summary":"After bending the knee to Trump, David Ellison is getting greedy and gunning for the crown jewel of American movie studios.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/after-buying-paramount-maga-billionaire-larry-ellisons-son-now-wants-warner-bros-discovery-report-2000657749","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Larry-and-David-Ellison-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 20:15:45","author":"Lucas Ropek","authors":["Lucas Ropek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":359696710,"title":"Kamala Harris’ book rips open Democratic wounds, and does her no favors","text":"If Democrats hoped that their wounds from the 2024 election would soon begin healing, former Vice President Kamala Harris just ripped open the scab. \n\nHarris’ book, “107 Days,” is due to be released on September 23rd, but an excerpt was published by The Atlantic. In it, the former VP holds little back, risking renewed infighting among a Democratic party struggling to find its way.\n\nUnfortunately, based on the excerpt, Harris’ book will do nothing to help the larger party, nor herself. Despite ostensibly her best efforts, it is remarkably self-serving.\n\nIn just a few words, Harris criticized Biden’s decision to run for a second term, claimed that his administration undercut her from the start, and revealed significant frustrations towards the former President and those around him. \n\nIndeed, Harris slammed certain decisions Biden made, but none more than his most fateful: seeking a second term when so many Americans felt he was too old, a recognition that the issue will still be critical in 2028.\n\nAcknowledging that “At 81, Joe got tired,” Harris describes a reluctant acceptance of “Joe and Jill’s decision” to run again. \n\nAnd, despite recognizing that “this wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition,” Harris says that she and others were “hypnotized” into acquiescence, which she describes as “recklessness.”\n\nHarris’ harshest criticism, however, was reserved for Biden’s advisors. \n\nAs she describes it, Biden’s team either stuck her with unsolvable policy issues – the border – or totally sidelined her. \n\nShe went further, accusing the Biden White House of “showing little interest in defending her against attacks from Republicans.”\n\nOn the contrary, Harris believes that “the president’s staff was adding fuel to the negative narratives around me” and left her to “shoulder the blame for a porous border.”\n\nFor issues where Harris polled better than Biden, such as abortion, Harris writes that Biden’s advisors refused to give her credit out of what she said was their belief that “if she’s shining, he’s dimmed.” \n\nHarris’ anger at the Biden White House is clear. What is less evident is any sense of responsibility or agency on her part.\n\nNor, for a vice president who consistently touted her loyalty to Biden on the campaign trail, is there any evidence of that same loyalty now. \n\nHarris ran a campaign centered on, by her own admission, an inability to find anything on which she disagreed with Biden, yet now, has a book full of places where she found daylight between the two.\n\nIn fact, in this excerpt, there’s little on the myriad of Biden decisions which actually helped her. Specifically, tapping her for VP, giving her a platform bigger than most VPs get, or, most importantly, almost immediately backing her for president when he withdrew from the race.\n\nTaken together, while Harris’ frustration with – and attempt to distance herself from – the Biden White House is obvious, the timing is wrong, the degree of disloyalty is great, and her lack of political judgement is more than apparent.\n\nOf course, this is only one excerpt of a larger book. But still, the Harris camp chose this excerpt for a reason, indicating their belief that the information it contained is critical.\n\nTo that end, the excerpt has already begun ripping open old wounds, prompting rebuttals and personal attacks on Harris from Biden staffers. \n\nAccording to Politico, one former Biden White House official pushed back on Harris’ characterization of the administration, saying, “No one wants to hear your pity party.”\n\nA national Democratic strategist was even harsher, saying that Harris’ “criticisms weren’t on the substance…but it was on them not doing enough to promote her and have her back in the press…it speaks to why she lost.”\n\nWhen the full book is published, it’s possible that these wounds will deepen, infecting the entire Democratic Party at an incredibly vulnerable time.\n\nSince the 2024 election, Democrats have been embroiled in intra-party finger pointing, trying to figure out who is responsible for all of the things that went wrong. \n\nBy dint of her position in the administration, Harris’ book is certain to reignite that debate. Even more so as it comes at a time when Democrats have been virtually unable to mount any form of effective opposition to the Trump administration.\n\nIn that same vein, the popularity of Harris’ book will draw renewed attention to the Biden administration’s issues when Democrats should be looking towards the 2026 midterms and then to the 2028 primary.\n\nAnd yet, for Harris, the book will likely be the starting point for her own presidential campaign. \n\nIn taking pains to highlight her own successes in office while blaming any and all stumbles on Team Biden, Harris is clearly hoping that voters will not associate her with a Biden administration that was deeply unpopular.\n\nOr, in Harris’ own words, “When polls indicated that I was getting more popular, the people around him (Biden) didn’t like the contrast that was emerging.”\n\nMoreover, by stressing that there was never a cover up of Biden’s infirmities, and attributing Biden’s candidacy to “Joe and Jill” – as well as “an individual’s ego” – Harris appears to be trying to acknowledge the problem without taking full responsibility.\n\nThe issue over who in the administration knew what about Biden’s age will almost certainly be an issue in the 2028 primary, and attempting to get her side of the story out there is critical. \n\nAs such, laying the fault at Biden’s advisors – who she describes as freezing her out from the beginning – appears to be her “out.”\n\nNevertheless, Harris’ book threatens to drive a wedge among the Democratic base between those who backed Biden throughout 2024, and younger, progressives who did not.\n\nPut another way, Democrats may experience another fight like 2016, when the establishment and grassroots activists split over Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, respectively. \n\nRipping off the scab, as Harris appears to be doing, may help her get out from the 2024 shadow. \n\nIt could also consume the Democratic Party and distract from their actual task – winning at least one chamber of Congress so they remain politically relevant.\n\nUltimately, the political impact of Harris no longer holding back remains to be seen, both on her and on the wider Democratic Party. \n\nAt this point, however, we can be reasonably certain that the ramifications will be significant for both. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Ripping off the scab, as Harris appears to be doing, may help her get out from the 2024 shadow. ","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/11/kamala-harris-book-rips-open-democratic-wounds-and-does-her-no-favors/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Election_2024_How_We_Got_Here_64999.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 20:01:06","author":"Douglas Schoen,Gqlshare","authors":["Douglas Schoen","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":359723008,"title":"If You're Wondering What Charlie Kirk Believed In, Here Are 14 Real Quotes","text":"Yesterday, conservative personality Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at a Utah Valley University event.\n\nKirk was a controversial figure, and in light of his passing, many of his most talked-about quotes and beliefs are being resurfaced online. Here are 14 moments of Kirk's that are going viral once again:\n\n1.At a Turning Point USA event in 2023, Kirk said he thinks gun deaths are \"worth it\" to have a Second Amendment.\n\n\"We must also be real. We must be honest with the population. Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty... We need to be very clear that you're not going to get gun deaths to zero.

It was bad. It was evil. But what happened? Something changed. They committed less crimes.\"\n\nThe person he debated responded, \"4,000 Black men, women, and children were killed in violent lynch mobs. Racial terror permeated American culture for hundreds of years. You don't think that affected the generational psyche of an entire group of people?\"\n\n\"Black America is worse than it has been in the last 80 years,\" he interrupted.\n\n4.During this same Jubilee episode, Kirk was asked what he would want his daughter to do if she were 10 years old and pregnant following rape.\n\nAfter calling the scenario graphic, he responds, \"The answer is yes. The baby would be delivered.\"\n\nRelated: \"Wake Up America\": 28 Of The Very, Very Best Political Tweets Of The Week\n\n5.At a Turning Point USA event, Kirk suggested trans people are wearing the gender equivalent of \"Black face.\"\n\nHe said, \"A man who calls himself trans is wearing 'woman face,' no different than I would wear Black face trying to be a Black person. It's assuming an identity that isn't yours.\"\n\n6.

You had to go steal a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.\"\n\n8.After Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement, Kirk fantasized about Kelce making Swift \"more conservative\" and begged the pop star to \"submit to her husband.\"\n\n“This is something that I hope will make Taylor Swift more conservative,\" he said. \"Engage in reality more… Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You're not in charge.”\n\n9. On X, Kirk insisted, \"Gun control, like vaccines and masks, is focused on making people feel 'safe' by taking freedoms away from others. Don't fall for it.\"\n\nTwitter: @charliekirk11\n\n10.Following the tragic January collision between an American Airlines plane and a Black Hawk Army helicopter, Donald Trump suggested diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts were at fault. Kirk added to this, saying:\n\n\"If I see a Black pilot, I'm going to be like, 'Boy, I hope he's qualified.'\"\n\nRelated: Gavin Newsom Brought The Receipts After Trump Claimed He \"Never Wrote A Picture\" In Response To The Epstein Files, And It's Sooo Good\n\n11.

Kirk repeatedly spread misinformation surrounding the death of George Floyd, who experts say died from an officer applying their knee to his neck. Instead, Kirk, who is not a medical examiner and did not examine Floyd's body, said his death was caused by \"overdose.\"\n\nTwitter: @charliekirk11\n\n13.Kirk wanted to raise the age of retirement, and didn't think people should retire at all.\n\n\"Now, I will say that for future retirees, people under the age of 45, we should absolutely raise the retirement age. I'm going to say something very provocative. I'm not a fan of retirement. I don't think retirement is biblical,\" he said. \"You say, 'Charlie, I'm just gonna retire and I'm just gonna go golf.' I think, what a waste of the gifts that God has given you.\"\n\n14.And finally, but certainly not last:\n\nDuring Pride Month, children's show host Ms. Rachel, aka Rachel Griffin-Accurso, wished followers a happy Pride and responded to subsequent backlash by quoting the Bible and expressing the importance of \"[loving] every neighbor.\" \n\nIn response, Kirk attempted to cite the Bible to prove a point about his anti-gay views, but he ultimately misquoted a mixture of passages from Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13. He said, \"Thou shall lay with another man, shall be stoned to death. Just saying... The chapter...affirms God's perfect law when it comes to sexual matter.\"\n\nThoughts?

Will the Trump Administration Listen?","text":"Earlier this week, Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) said he planned on introducing a bill requiring that autonomous vehicles always have a human operator in them, a measure the senator says is necessary to protect the jobs of truck drivers.\n\nDriverless cars are \"not safe\" and \"would be terrible, terrible for working people,\" said Hawley to Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nA draft of his proposed legislation would require a \"human safety operator\" behind the wheel at all times.\n\nSimilar bills pushed by the Teamsters union at the state level have been unsuccessful, even in liberal states where unions hold more influence over policymakers.\n\nAs it stands, Hawley and the Teamsters don't need to proactively pass any new policies to stop autonomous trucks.\n\nFederal regulations requiring that warning devices, like flares or safety cones, be placed around disabled commercial trucks on public roads already act as a de facto ban on fully autonomous trucking.\n\nThe Biden administration refused autonomous vehicle companies' request for a waiver of those regulations in December 2024.\n\nThose hoping the new administration might take a more hands-off approach to autonomous vehicle regulations have meanwhile received mixed signals from the White House.\n\nLast week, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Sean Duffy announced that highway safety regulators would begin the process of updating federal rules to enable the growth of the autonomous vehicle industry.\n\n\"The rules of the road need to be updated to fit the realities of the 21st century. Our changes will eliminate redundant requirements and bring us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety,\" said Duffy.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration's DOT has continued its predecessor's policy of refusing to grant waivers of the warning device rule and has continued to fight a lawsuit from autonomous trucking companies challenging the denial of their requested waiver to that rule.\n\nBack in 2023, driverless truck operator Aurora and Waymo's driverless truck division jointly petitioned the Biden administration for an exemption to the warning device rule. The companies proposed an alternative standard that would allow them to use cab-mounted warning lights instead of road-placed warning devices.\n\nIn support of their waiver request, the two companies submitted their own studies showing that drivers reacted similarly to currently required road-placed warning devices and their proposed flashing warning beacons.\n\nThe Waymo study also found that drivers subjectively preferred the cab-mounted warning beacons.\n\nA collection of trade associations, trucking companies, and equipment manufacturers submitted comments in support of Waymo and Aurora's waiver request.\n\nOpposing the companies' request were mostly trade unions representing transportation workers, who uniformly argued that warning beacons were an inferior alternative to the current requirements.\n\nIn its last month in office, the Biden administration sided with the unions and denied Aurora and Waymo's waiver request.\n\nTheir request \"does not demonstrate how Applicants or other proposed exempted parties would ensure an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved absent the exemption,\" said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in its waiver denial.\n\nIronically enough, a few weeks after the FMCSA denied that waiver, the agency announced it would perform its own study to evaluate \"whether warning devices meaningfully influence crash-relevant aspects of human performance in the presence of a parked or disabled commercial motor vehicle.\"\n\n\"The reason for denying Aurora and Waymo's petition was that they didn't have any evidence that it would be an equivalent level of safety or better. But then they say the existing standard doesn't have any evidence to support it,\" says Marc Scribner, a transportation policy researcher at the Reason Foundation (which publishes this magazine).\n\nScribner suggests that the warning device rule might even reduce safety over warning beacons, given that it can potentially require truck drivers to be in moving traffic when placing warning devices on the road.\n\nAurora has made this same argument in the lawsuit it filed against the DOT in January 2025.\n\n\"When the applicable regulations were promulgated over 50 years ago, no actual safety data was presented to support the safety benefit of the specified human-placed warning devices,\" reads the petition. \"In assessing whether [cab-mounted warning beacons] are at least 'equivalent' to the driver-placed warnings, the actual data provided by the Applicants far exceeds what FMCSA has admitted about the agency's existing requirements.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's waiver denial was widely seen as a favor to the drivers' unions, most prominently the Teamsters. It was one of many decisions the last White House made rejecting any regulatory changes that might allow the deployment of labor-saving technology in the transportation sector.\n\nOne might assume a Republican administration would look more favorably on such technology. The second Trump administration is a little more complicated.\n\nTeamsters' head Sean O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024, and the union famously did not endorse Kamala Harris—a break from its traditional practice of stumping for Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nLobbying disclosures show that the Teamsters have also been lobbying the Trump administration's DOT on \"commercial motor vehicle automation\" issues.\n\nIt's possible then that their influence has pushed the administration, which has otherwise been supportive of new technologies like artificial intelligence and automation, to stick by the warning device rule.\n\nWhile Aurora's lawsuit was filed against the Biden administration, the Trump administration has notably continued to litigate it in court.\n\nThere are some signs that a settlement agreement in that case is in the offing. Aurora and the administration have repeatedly asked the court to delay filing deadlines, which could indicate they're trying to work out a deal.\n\nAutonomous vehicle industry advocates are optimistic that the current administration will ultimately come down on the side of encouraging the new industry.\n\n\"We're very hopeful that the Department of Transportation, under the leadership of Secretary Duffy, is going to make the right decision here,\" says Jeff Farrah, CEO of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association. \"We need to make sure the regulatory structure is in place so that these companies can pour investment into the economy.\"\n\nIn addition to the rule making that Duffy announced last week, the latest \"unified agenda of regulatory and deregulatory actions\" says the administration will seek to amend motor carrier safety regulations to \"ensure the safe introduction of automated driving systems\" on commercial vehicles.\n\nThe notice does not list specific rules that it would amend. There's a long list of regulations that reference human drivers that could trip up autonomous vehicles.\n\nFixing all of them will take a long time, however. Updating federal regulations to accommodate driverless commercial vehicles was a process that started in the first Trump administration. The DOT doesn't anticipate even releasing proposed new regulations until May 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, autonomous vehicle technology has progressed rapidly.\n\nWhile a more comprehensive rule change is in the making, Scribner says the administration could take immediate action to grant waivers to the warning device rule, which he says is the most immediate barrier to commercial autonomous vehicles.\n\nA settlement agreement that grants Aurora and other companies a waiver from the warning device rule in exchange for collecting data on the efficacy of warning beacons would be a meaningful step toward encouraging the safe rollout of new technology, he says.","summary":"A fight over an arcane trucking safety rule reveals the White House's split position on autonomous vehicle regulations.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/11/maga-conservatives-unions-want-to-crush-driverless-trucks-will-the-trump-administration-listen/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/dreamstime_xl_201452320-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 19:45:00","author":"Christian Britschgi","authors":["Christian Britschgi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":359703406,"title":"Kamala Harris' memoir is a cautionary tale for future presidents","text":"For years it was an open secret in Washington that former Vice President Kamala Harris had amassed powerful critics among the advisers closest to President Joe Biden. As a Democratic strategist and columnist during the Biden presidency, I received my fair share of insider pitches from Harris skeptics in the West Wing. This week’s much-hyped preview of Harris’ upcoming memoir, \"107 Days,\" reveals a politician finally ready to reclaim ownership of her own political and personal narrative. “I often learned that the president’s staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me,” Harris writes. “One narrative that took a stubborn hold was that I had a ‘chaotic’ office and unusually high staff turnover during my first year.” The gossip wasn’t subtle. Within months of Biden’s inauguration, Beltway gossip columns openly discussed the tension between Harris and first lady Jill Biden. White House staffers did little to rebut (and often quietly supported) stories of Harris’ staff dysfunction that later made their way into prominent political tell-all books. I even wrote about Biden’s bizarre decision to sideline Harris despite her significant achievements in a 2023 column for this website. Harris, according to her book, took Team Biden’s barbs in stride because she understood how critical it was for Democrats to telegraph unity and shared purpose after four divisive years of Donald Trump. She might have hoped that her willingness to overlook all that political backbiting would be repaid with respect and support from Biden’s team after taking over Biden’s spot on the Democratic ticket in August 2024. That respect never came. Instead, Biden loyalists piled blame onto Harris for the party’s 2024 losses just days after the election. They could have — would have — done it better, they recounted to journalist Franklin Foer. Whatever dignity Harris expected to earn from her grace, it’s clear she wildly misunderstood the intensity of political tribalism in Biden’s inner circle. Now, freed from her connection to her former colleague, Harris and her team are finally venting their frustrations. Democrats should listen closely, because Harris is articulating a key problem that still plagues the party even after Biden’s departure. Anyone who doubts Harris’ claims need only look at the bitter response from Biden world. On Thursday, anonymous former Biden advisers dismissed Harris as playing “zero substantive role” in the administration, and instead focusing on “stilted photo ops.” That those advisers refused to put their names behind such nasty accusations speaks volumes about the toxicity that still dominates Biden’s inner circle. Rhonda Elaine Foxx, former Biden campaign director of women’s engagement, was among the first to validate Harris’ account of her treatment on the campaign trail. In a post on X, Foxx recounted emailing Biden staffers about the dismissive way women of color were treated on the campaign, specifically around the uphill battle to give Harris any visible presence at major Black cultural events — the same Black voters who played a pivotal role in Biden’s 2020 victory, and who Biden personally pledged to represent in his inaugural remarks. “The fight just to have a campaign presence at the Zeta convention referenced in her excerpt was insane,” Foxx wrote. “Black spaces that should’ve been obvious priorities for coalition-building were dismissed. The expertise of Black staffers was constantly dismissed. What the VP says in 107 Days is right: our biggest challenge isn’t just Trump, it’s us.” Lest anyone think Foxx is just a disgruntled former staffer, her post received public support in a post from former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, one of Biden’s most visible backers during the campaign. Harris’ book and the testimonials of former staffers paint a picture of a vice president willing to suffer petty humiliations in order to maximize Democrats’ chances of beating Trump in 2024. Instead of embracing Harris’ proposals to increase the campaign’s engagement with Black communities, the Biden team egotistically dismissed them as efforts to promote her own brand over and above the boss. “Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well,” Harris wrote. “It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him. His team didn’t get it.” The Biden team’s growing insecurity about Harris’ publicity would have disastrous consequences on Election Day, when Black voters bolted from a Democratic Party they felt took them for granted. Democrats won 87% of Black men and 95% of Black women in 2020. Four years later, they won just three-quarters of Black men and 89% of Black women. Harris’ memoir is a cautionary tale about what happens when a president allows his senior staff to amass too much decision-making power. Time and again, Harris describes her personal relationship with Biden in positive terms, yet key campaign decisions seemed to be made by staffers who rarely or never consulted Biden directly. Perhaps had the former president been informed, he would have made different decisions. Unfortunately for the American people, the extreme control Biden’s team had over his day-to-day decisions means we will likely never know. What is clear is that Harris doesn’t deserve the venom heaped upon her in the wake of Democrats’ 2024 losses, and she’s no longer willing to take incoming fire for a White House team that apparently showed little loyalty or decency to her. As someone who has spent nearly two decades fighting to build a Democratic Party that lives up to its moral promise both internally and externally, I say it’s about time.","summary":"Kamala Harris is finally ready to reclaim ownership of her own political and personal narrative in her new memoir, \"107 Days.\"","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-book-107-days-biden-election-democrats-rcna230450","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250911-3x2-joe-biden-kamala-harris-vl-201p-0d3edd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 19:44:43","author":"Max Burns","authors":["Max Burns"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":359693330,"title":"Politicians, Faith Leaders Condemn Political Violence After Charlie Kirk Assassination","text":"Faith leaders and political leaders are uniting their voices to condemn politically motivated violence following the assassination of Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of Kirk’s death by President Donald Trump, some hours after the TPUSA founder was shot at a Utah Valley University event on Wednesday afternoon, Sept. 10, countless faith and political leaders began to speak out against the scourge of political violence.\n\nIn a statement, Bishop Michael Burbidge of the Diocese of Arlington, Virginia, railed against the “vicious pattern of political and social disorder” of the past several weeks, citing the Annunciation Catholic school shooting, the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, “and now the political assassination of Charlie Kirk, known for his commitment to civil and rational discourse.” \n\nAs Americans, we are witnesses in just the past few weeks to a vicious pattern of political and social disorder.

Unfortunately, the fact that authorities have yet to confirm the killer's identity, means, and motivations has not prevented countless pundits from issuing sweeping condemnations of various forces to which they are assigning blame for Kirk's demise: rival political tribes, so-called violent rhetoric, guns, and even (why not) the state of Israel.\n\nIt bears repeating that this shocking murder occurred about 24 hours ago. Kirk's family and friends are probably still in shock, and the millions of people who agreed with Kirk's views, admired his accomplishments, listened to his shows, attended his conferences, or otherwise regarded him as a fellow traveler—in truth, he was one of the most important conservative media figures in history—are just beginning to grieve. It is far, far too early to start pointing fingers, particularly when the individual (or individuals) directly at fault has not yet been apprehended.\n\nThankfully, there has also been an outpouring of renunciations of violence from many people who were at odds with Kirk politically: mainstream media commentators, Democratic political figures, etc. These expressions of moral and human solidarity are refreshing. The New York Times' Ezra Klein, for instance, praised him for \"practicing politics the right way.\" Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and other prominent Democrats issued statements of unqualified support for Kirk's family. That's all good and can help to de-escalate tensions.\n\nBut many others are going off the deep end—and some are even making a mockery of the very ideas that Kirk stood for. They ought to know better.\n\nI wanted to highlight a few of the unhinged responses, because it will be useful to explain why they are wrong, harmful, and sadly indicative of various strains of incorrect thinking.\n\n1. Various left-wing people are suggesting that Kirk in effect brought this on himself because he employed, in their view, hateful rhetoric, and supported political causes that they believe are dangerous. Here was Andrea Junker, for instance.\n\nLet's make one thing clear from the start: Charlie Kirk was the victim of a shooting in a country where he, along with other right-wing extremist influencers, have been inciting violence for years. — Kirk is neither a martyr nor a hero, he is a cause.\n— Andrea Junker (@Strandjunker) September 10, 2025\n\nIn particular, some have singled out a statement he made in 2023: \"It's worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment.\"\n\nIt's pathologically cruel and unfair to suggest that this is some kind of gotcha along the lines of Ha, bet you never would have guessed the gun death would be you! This becomes obvious if one substitutes gun deaths for any other kind of death. For instance, as Kirk noted in the 2023 video, there are around 40,000 motor vehicle deaths in the U.S. every year, but no one thinks cars should be banned outright. \"[The country] has decided that the benefit of driving…is worth the cost\" of these deaths, Kirk said. No one would consider this a particularly provocative observation. If Kirk had subsequently perished in a car accident, this would not change the situation. Americans broadly accept that there are tradeoffs between security and liberty; we want some level of liberty—generally more of it, if you're a libertarian—even at the cost of some otherwise preventable deaths.\n\nMoreover, the general outlook shared by some in progressive circles—and one ex-MSNBC contributor—that Kirk espoused hateful views and thus had it coming, in some sense, is repugnant. The First Amendment right to express opinions deemed hateful by others should be cherished by all American political traditions, and if you feel inclined to say a victim of violence was essentially asking for it—you should probably stop talking. (Though you are by no means required to do so, thanks to the First Amendment.)\n\n2. Speaking of the First Amendment, at least one Republican legislator is proposing sweeping legislation in response to Kirk's death that not only violates the Constitution, it undermines the very principles that Kirk stood for. Rep. Clay Higgins (R–La.), for example, is calling for sweeping legislation to effectively criminalize any mocking of Kirk's death.\n\nI'm going to use Congressional authority and every influence with big tech platforms to mandate immediate ban for life of every post or commenter that belittled the assassination of Charlie Kirk. If they ran their mouth with their smartass hatred celebrating the heinous murder of…\n— Rep. Clay Higgins (@RepClayHiggins) September 11, 2025\n\n\"I'm also going after their business licenses and permitting, their businesses will be blacklisted aggressively, they should be kicked from every school, and their drivers licenses should be revoked,\" wrote Higgins. \"I'm basically going to cancel with extreme prejudice these evil, sick animals who celebrated Charlie Kirk's assassination.\"\n\nAnybody celebrating Kirk's assassination should be roundly mocked and criticized, and can suffer whatever professional consequences are appropriate. But the government must not pressure private organizations, large tech companies, and schools to \"cancel with extreme prejudice.\" The First Amendment prohibits the government from censoring speech; moreover, when government figures attempt to pressure private actors into self-silencing, we generally recognize this \"jawboning\" as a violation of the ethos of the First Amendment, whether or not it is literally prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, it's pretty clear that Kirk would not be in favor of this. Kirk decried cancel culture and enjoyed arguing with people who disagreed passionately with him, even if he found their views outrageous and wrong. Kirk did not want to cancel people with extreme prejudice: He wanted to debate them. He loved debating them. Watch any of those videos where he battled a bunch of leftists at once; it's obvious how much he's enjoying himself.\n\nWhat Higgins is proposing would dishonor Kirk's memory.\n\n3. On a related note, there is absolutely no reason for Comedy Central to rid itself of the recent episode of South Park that made fun of Kirk.\n\nSo far, the television network has merely pulled a rerun of the episode, \"Got a Nut,\" from its lineup; it did not air on Wednesday. That's an understandable move. What Comedy Central should not do is refuse to air the episode ever again, or remove it from whatever streaming platforms carry the full season.\n\nThe New York Post reported that so far, \"it remains available to stream on Paramount+ with a subscription,\" but South Park's creators are facing considerable backlash from Kirk fans. This is misguided, not least of all because Kirk himself was a fan of South Park. In fact, he was honored by the show making fun of him and considered it a \"badge of honor.\"\n\n4. Perhaps sensing that many on the right are going to cite Kirk's death as evidence that left-wing political violence is out of control, some progressive media figures are insisting that right-wing political violence is still a much bigger issue. This contention, though, relies on specious tallies of hate crime—and overlooks the more compelling point, which is that political violence remains fairly rare (for now).\n\nVox's Eric Levitz, for example, wrote on X that \"right-wingers committed the vast majority of political murders\" over the past decade.\n\nA conservative murdered a Democratic lawmaker -- and wounded another -- three months ago.\nBetween 2013 and 2022, right-wingers committed the vast majority of political murders.\nIf you actually care about political violence, you should not spread wild lies about it. https://t.co/e2DnvIyv2S pic.twitter.com/NcywAmPLBp\n— Eric Levitz (@EricLevitz) September 11, 2025\n\nTo be fair to Levitz, he was responding to a specific, incorrect claim from a conservative social media account that political violence is entirely a left-wing problem. It is not. A closer look at the very data Levitz is citing, however, provides a useful illustration of why various assumptions about escalating right-wing political violence are not so compelling.\n\nLevitz referenced the Anti-Defamation League's 2024 report on murder and extremism, which does find that right-wing extremists committed not just most, but all of the ideologically motivated killings that year. That's because the grand total number of deaths was just 13. (It was a bad year for extremist killers.) Yet on New Year's Day, just a few hours outside the scope of the report, an Islamic extremist killed 14 people in New Orleans. Shifting the time frame ever so slightly would have reduced the percentage of right-wing extremist murders from 100 percent to about 50 percent, which goes to show how arbitrary some of these statistics can be.\n\nMoreover, the ADL's report includes some very important clarifications: Namely, the majority of the right-wing extremist murders involved white supremacist prison gangs. \"White supremacist prison gangs are particularly violent, committing hate-related murders, murders of members of other gangs, murders related to criminal enterprises such as illegal narcotics and murders of their own gang members and associates for reasons that may include such perceived offenses as breaking rules, attempting to leave a gang or being a suspected informant,\" notes the ADL.\n\nOther organizations that tabulate right-wing extremism, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, use creative and arguably misleading means to manufacture evidence that the number of hate groups in the U.S. is always increasing.\n\nNone of this means that rightwing extremists are harmless. White supremacist prison gangs are definitely a problem, even if they don't pose much of a threat to nonincarcerated Americans. But attempts to paint right-wing extremism as more threatening or prone to violence than left-wing extremism—or vice versa—often rely on sloppy and incomplete data. And importantly, nonideological violence—domestic violence, workplace violence, violence related to robberies and carjackings—is far, far more common. This is like arguing whether a penny weighs more than a nickel when there's also a gold bar weighing down the scales.\n\n5. Ian Carroll, an independent podcaster who has appeared on Joe Rogan's show and seems generally well-liked by contrarian, anti-establishment audiences, is convinced he already knows who killed Kirk: the state of Israel.\n\nYesterday was a turning point for Israel US relations.\nLes than 24 hours and the internet already figured out who the most likely culprit was.\nHe was their friend. He basically dedicated his life to them. And they murdered him in front of his family. \nIsrael just shot…\n— Ian Carroll (@IanCarrollShow) September 11, 2025\n\nCarroll has not cited any evidence in favor of this theory, because there is none. This is a good reminder that while expertise is occasionally overvalued—and is used by mainstream folks as an excuse to shut down worthwhile conversations with less-credentialed individuals—there are also a bunch of morons spouting off nonsense on podcasts.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI'm joined by Amber Duke and Niall Stanage in separate segments to discuss the latest news regarding Kamala Harris finally turning on Team Biden, the Charlotte train murder, and other subjects. We finished filming just as the news about Kirk was breaking, so you'll have to wait until next week to see us address it. (Today's episode of Rising dedicated significant airtime to the subject, however.)\n\nWorth Watching\n\nI finally started the second season of Wednesday, which is pretty good and opens with an extended segment making fun of the TSA. Just my cup of tea!","summary":"We should welcome renunciations of violence from those who disagree with Kirk, and dispute nonsense across the political spectrum.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/11/the-killing-of-charlie-kirk-5-idiotic-responses-on-social-media/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/zumaglobalsixteen601330-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 19:15:20","author":"Robby Soave","authors":["Robby Soave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":359680300,"title":"Kamala Harris moves to shift the blame in new book","text":"In the Atlantic’s excerpt from her book, Harris writes of the decision to have Biden run in 2024, “Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition.” Certainly, ego played a huge part in Biden’s decision to run. First lady Jill Biden was a huge part of that as well. But the ego Harris speaks of so clearly when looking at Biden was just as evident in her abbreviated run.\n\nThe idea that a black woman should be supported simply because of the historical nature of her run is absurd. And despite claims to the contrary, both the media and the Harris-Walz campaign ran with that as a major theme: “I thought, as I often did, of Shirley Chisholm, and I know they did, too. The first black woman elected to the U.S. Congress and the first woman to run for our party’s nomination. She had blazed the path, and now I was standing on it.”\n\nThere is nothing wrong with looking at who came before. But being the first to do something does not mean said person should be rewarded with the ultimate prize. In this case, that prize would have been the presidency. Neither Harris’s sex nor race meant she deserved a single vote. But given her opponent’s major win over Clinton, there was pressure directed at female voters, especially, to support her without question. Because somehow, it was time.\n\nIt is ironic that Biden was floated as the nominee in 2020 to put a stop to Trump. He did, at least for four years. But Biden’s blindness to his own mental state and his terrible choice for vice president meant that the Democratic Party’s worst nightmare, a second Trump term, eventually came true.\n\nPerhaps that would not have come true if Biden and the Democratic Party as a whole were not so concerned with appearances. Harris has trouble clearly communicating policy objectives or details. This was evident in interviews and even debate settings. She shrugged off the designation of “border czar” as though it were someone else’s duty. She ran interference for Biden for years, even though in her book, she writes, “On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired. That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles. I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”\n\nWould she have said so? Given how much we know now about the media and party cover-up of his true condition, it seems clear Harris said nothing on purpose.\n\nCHARLIE KIRK SHOT DEAD: TURNING POINT USA FOUNDER FUELED TRUMP’S RISE THROUGH ‘COMMON SENSE’ MESSAGING\n\nIf anything, this book seems like an attempt by Harris to explain herself in a way that shifts most of the blame for a second Trump term to Biden. Just the short excerpt makes that clear. \n\nStill missing is a Harris who takes responsibility for her silence while her addled boss got worse. And an acknowledgment that her run for the White House crashed and burned because enthusiasm and urgency couldn’t make a dreadful candidate great.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s new book, 107 Days, about her short time as the Democratic Party nominee for president, is, by all accounts, illuminating.

It followed the president's disastrous performance against Trump, 79, in a nationally televised debate three weeks prior.'In the Worst Position'Harris noted in an excerpt from her book, due for release on September 23, that she found herself in an uncomfortable position when it came to expressing her thoughts.\n\n\"And of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: Don’t let the other guy win,\" the former Veep wrote.'It Was Recklessness'Harris then dropped a bombshell of an observation, revealing how much former First Lady Jill Biden played a part in her husband's decision to run again.\n\n“'It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness?\" she wondered. \n\nHarris continued, \"In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"'Joe Got Tired'Harris, however, pivoted to the Democratic talking point that Biden was simply getting more tired with age, while refusing to refute published reports that he was suffering from severe cognitive decline. \n\n\"Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity. Here is the truth as I lived it. Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president,\" the former U.S. senator explained.\n\n\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best.

As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country,\" she declared.Passing the TorchCalls for Biden to stop seeking reelection began to grow following his debate with Trump on June 27, 2024, where he made confusing statements, stumbled over words, and had enough nonsensical lines that even the tycoon at one point remarked, I really don't know what he said at the end of this, and I don't think he knows what he said either.\"\n\nBy July 10, major Democratic donor George Clooney penned an op-ed in The New York Times, calling for Biden to step down, writing, \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\n\nThe following week, prominent U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff called on Biden to step aside, as the chorus among fellow lawmakers grew. \n\nOn July 21, Biden announced that he would not be seeking a second term, while revealing that he wanted Harris to run in his place. \n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I made,\" the president said in the statement.\n\n\"Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee for our party this year. Democrats − it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this,\" he added.","summary":"In a stunning move, Kamala Harris called out Joe Biden as 'reckless' to seek re-election as president while slamming his 'ego.'","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-turns-on-joe-biden-reckless-seek-second-term/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/L8MmOFVuo/0x0/kamala-harris-turns-on-joe-biden-reckless-1757610570553.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 18:42:18","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":359668254,"title":"Warner Bros.

The deal was greenlit by the Trump administration in July, after Skydance said it would end some diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in hiring, promotions, development and compensation. Critics speculated approval from the Federal Communications Commission was delayed until Paramount settled a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump, who alleged former Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview with “60 Minutes” was deceptively edited to boost Harris’ chances ahead of the 2024 election. Approval also followed Paramount’s CBS opting to cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” whose host was a longtime critic of Trump, though CBS said the cancellation was based on finances.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesSkydance Closes $8 Billion Merger With ParamountBy Zachary Folk\n\nForbesFCC Greenlights $8 Billion Paramount-Skydance Merger After Skydance Vows To End DEI ProgramsBy Antonio Pequeño IV\n\nGot a tip?

Everyone should be angered and terrified by it,\" the Barbie and Ugly Betty performer said. \"If any American can get pulled over because of the language they speak or the color of their skin or because they work in a low-wage job, who's safe? So, as an American, I'm pissed off.\"\n\n Ferrera then related the current climate to feelings she felt \"as a daughter of immigrants who grew up in California,\" with both her parents moving to the United States from Honduras.\n\n The actress said that she and her family often found themselves \"at the center of conversations about immigration — nothing close to what we're living in now. I remember what it felt like to be a child in elementary school, going to school hearing whisperings and not know what it meant.\"\n\n She added, \"What I know right now is there are children that are terrified. There are children that are terrified of their lives being destroyed in a moment.

Become informed citizens and not just reactive, because people will say things that are simply not there, or say things and misconstrue them,\" Sotomayor advised the public. \"The price we pay is whatever is happening today, as I indicated, is going to affect a lot of people, but it affects your future and it affects the conduct of leaders in the future, because what we permit today is not going to be duplicated exactly tomorrow, it's going to be something different.\"\n\n Days into its season 29 premiere, The View has already weathered a wave of headlines related to current affairs and politics — from a passage in Kamala Harris' new book alleging that some Democrats mounted a smear campaign against her during the 2024 election cycle, to reacting to Wednesday's assassination of conservative TV personality and commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n \"All the things we've seen — the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the aggressiveness when they went after Paul Pelosi, the couple in Minnesota — this is not the way we do it,\" EGOT-winning Ghost actress Whoopi Goldberg said of Kirk's death at the start of Thursday's episode. \"We say this every time, but, somehow, it's not resonating, and I hope that young Republicans never forget that they have a voice.\"\n\n The View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on ABC.

In May of this year, it seemed to become fixated on a conspiracy theory claiming there had been a \"white genocide\" in South Africa. xAI, the company behind Grok, later attributed it to an \"unauthorized modification\" but didn't fully explain how that happened. Earlier this summer, Grok repeatedly posted antisemitic tropes, praised Hitler and referred to itself as \"MechaHitler.\" xAI apologized and blamed a faulty update.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed along with their dog, and State Sen.

Tim Walz, a Democrat, and did not call him.\n\n\"I think he's a terrible governor. I think he's a grossly incompetent person. But I may, I may call him, I may call other people too,\" he told ABC News' Rachel Scott on June 15.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Walz's vice presidential opponent during the 2024 election, did contact the governor the day of the shooting, according to sources.\n\nHowever, Trump continued to lambast the governor to the press.\n\n\"Why would I call him?

Josh Shapiro and his family were celebrating Passover, police said.\n\nNo one was seriously hurt and the suspect, Cody Allen Balmer, turned himself in, according to the police.\n\nBalmer allegedly told police he would have attacked Shapiro with the hammer if he happened upon the governor inside the residence, according to investigators.\n\nBalmer has pleaded not guilty to his charges, which include terrorism.\n\nTrump was asked about the attack a day after and said the suspect was \"just a whack job.\"\n\n\"The attacker was not a fan of Trump. I understand just from what I've read and from what I've been told,\" said Trump, adding that he was not informed of the motive in the incident.\n\n\"The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody. Probably just a whack job. And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen,\" he added.\n\nShapiro told reporters that Trump called him six days after the incident, and that he appreciated the call.\n\n\"He was very gracious,\" Shapiro said.\n\nDespite Trump's lack of acknowledgment of these incidents, other Republicans have mentioned the Democratic targeting in their responses to Kirk's shooting.\n\nUtah Gov.

We've had political assassinations recently in Minnesota. We had an attempted assassination of the governor of Pennsylvania. And we had an attempted assassination on a presidential candidate and former president of the United States, and now current president of the United States.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has been waging a media war against President Donald Trump — particularly with uber-snarky social media posts — while promoting a ballot measure aimed at increasing Democrats’ congressional seats, portraying it as a way to blunt Trump’s lust for power.\n\nNewsom clearly seeks recognition as Trump’s most effective political foe, political pundits of all flavors believe, thus positioning himself as the Democratic Party’s leading presidential hopeful in 2028.\n\nIs it working? In purely political terms, yes. In polling and other tests of political sentiment, Newsom appears to have become the unofficial frontrunner, three years before voters will be electing the next president.\n\n“California Gov. Gavin Newsom has seized attention like no other Democrat in President Donald Trump’s second term as he works to position himself as a de facto head of the resistance in a leaderless party,” a recent Washington Post article declared.\n\n“Influencers on both the left and the right have discussed Newsom online more than any other potential 2028 presidential contender since Trump’s inauguration … The attention has been driven by his response to immigration raids in Los Angeles, his efforts to counter a Republican redistricting push and, most recently, his mocking impersonations of Trump’s social media style.”\n\nAlex Hoffman, a Democratic strategist and donor adviser, told the Post: “Democrats are so desperate for leadership right now that they’ll take anything they can get. Gavin is filling a void.”\n\nThis week, Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini published a simulated Democratic primary, placing Newsom in first place in a seven-candidate field with “a 29.7% chance of winning across 10,000 simulations.” He’s followed by progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a 19.5% chance, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 13.4%, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at 12.2%, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at 11.3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 9.0%, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear at 5.1%. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was not included in the list.\n\nRuffini cites Newsom’s “best polling at the moment, the second-best fundraising, and ideological positioning in the middle of the party” as his strongest attributes.\n\nIf, indeed, Newsom is laying the groundwork for a 2028 White House bid, he would have to maintain momentum while continuing to govern the state for the next 16 months and move beyond just portraying Trump as the devil incarnate.\n\nIn the meantime, his constituents will feel the impact of Newsom’s feud with Trump. For one thing, those who lost homes and loved ones in the deadly firestorms that swept through Los Angeles neighborhoods this year will probably never see a dime of the $40 billion in federal relief funds Newsom and other officials have sought.\n\nNewsom also faces blowback from the universe of right-leaning podcasts, YouTube channels and social media postings. Video clips from some less savory chapters of Newsom’s personal life and political career are already surfacing, such as his infamously unmasked appearance at a birthday party during the COVID-19 pandemic, his affair with the wife of a close friend while mayor of San Francisco and revelations about his drinking habits.\n\nOne clip shows Newsom in 2007 criticizing and walking away from a reporter who asked him about the drinking. It’s an example of Newsom’s thin skin, which could be a liability if and when he becomes a presidential candidate.\n\nFinally, Newsom’s record as governor will be an issue, with critics citing California’s many unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, cost of living and poverty. Just this week, the Census Bureau revealed that when the state’s high living costs are factored in, California continues to have the nation’s highest poverty rate at 17.7%, tied with Louisiana.\n\nNewsom will learn that being an early frontrunner pins a target on his back.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

As could have been predicted, Harris’s claim has now set off an angry reaction from Bidenworld. Together, it is turning into just one more bad scene for Democrats in the aftermath of the 2024 election.\n\nHarris writes that the Biden team was suspicious of her. Why shouldn’t it be? After all, in her short and failed 2019 presidential campaign, Harris attacked then-candidate Joe Biden and strongly implied he was a racist. Political loyalists don’t forget things like that. So Harris often found that the president’s circle was not including her in the issues of the day. “They had a huge comms team,” she writes of the White House. “But getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible.”\n\nAnd what about her performance? Harris writes that she was assigned to work on the massive influx of illegal crossers at the U.S.-Mexico border, a phenomenon she refers to as “irregular immigration.” She was mad when Republicans called her the “border czar,” but “no one in the White House comms team helped me to effectively push back.”\n\nHarris wanted Bidenworld to explain that what she had actually been asked to do was “attack the root causes of the misery that was driving people from their homes and villages in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.” She claims her work was a big success. She “won commitments of $5.2 billion in new investments by private companies in the region.” She “held numerous bilateral meetings with leaders throughout the region.” She “met with activist groups fighting against corruption and for human rights.” \n\n“In the locations where I was able to bring new enterprises and greater stability, data showed it was working,” Harris writes. “Our investments had created 70,000 new jobs, reached more than a million people with training programs, and connected 2.5 million previously unbanked people with banking services and access to credit.”\n\nHarris was eager for the White House to highlight her accomplishments. “I wanted to get that good news out,” she writes. But the White House wouldn’t do it. “Instead,” Harris writes, “I shouldered the blame for the porous border, an issue that had proved intractable for Democratic and Republican administrations alike. … It was an issue that absolutely demanded bipartisan cooperation at an impossibly partisan, most uncooperative time.”\n\nHere’s another way to look at it. Whether she realized it or not, Harris’s real assignment was to reduce the number of illegal crossers at the border. And her plan did not work. Under Biden — and the border mess was Biden’s fault, not Harris’s, although it is unlikely she would have handled it any better — the number of migrants crossing illegally into the United States rose and rose and rose. Harris wanted credit for solving a problem she did not solve. Americans could see the border incursion continuing unabated, and they would have scoffed at Harris’s claims of progress.\n\nFinally, Harris dances around the most damaging issue for the Democratic ticket in 2024, which was Biden’s infirmity. It was clear to millions of people that the president did not have the mental and physical ability to serve four more years. But Harris says the 81-year-old Biden just got tired occasionally.\n\n“Here is the truth as I lived it,” Harris writes. “Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president. … But at 81, Joe got tired. That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.”\n\nIn the most dramatic part of the excerpt, Harris describes her party panicking about Biden’s condition. She questions how she handled it: “Should I have told Joe to consider not running?” Maybe, she writes, while saying that at the time she thought Biden might be right to run again. And in any event, she thought she couldn’t intervene because it would seem too self-serving, given that she would benefit most from a Biden withdrawal.\n\nSo Harris and everyone else in the White House said the decision had to be left up to the president and the first lady. “We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” she writes. “Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nIn the end, Harris dismisses the idea, the fact, that Biden was not “able to discharge the duties of president” for four more years while at the same time saying “we all” were reckless in not pushing Biden to step down. \n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that former Biden White House insiders are not taking Harris’s criticisms well. “Vice President Harris was simply not good at the job,” one told Axios. “She had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration’s key work streams, and instead would just dive bomb in for stilted photo ops that exposed how out of depth she was.” And more, from Axios: “[Biden is] not the reason she struggled in office or tanked her 2019 [presidential] campaign. Or lost the 2024 campaign, for that matter. The independent variable is the vice president, not Biden or his aides.”\n\nAnd on and on. These two sides are not going to reconcile.

After Kash Patel Fumbles Investigation","text":"The investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination now has a major update, as the FBI has released images of a \"person of interest,\" RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nKash Patel, the FBI director, previously claimed they had a person in custody, before doing a 180 and revealing they had released the person.What Did The Images Reveal?On Thursday, September 11, the FBI told the public: \"We are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.\"\n\nThe snaps show a skinny male dressed in dark clothing and wearing wraparound sunglasses. The unknown man is also seen wearing a dark-colored hat and a long-sleeve shirt that seems to have an American flag on it.\n\nThe weapon used in the deadly shooting that rocked the country has also been recovered, according to the agency. It was discovered in a wooded area near the Utah Valley University courtyard, where the shooting took place. \n\nThe rifle, an older model imported Mauser .30-06 caliber bolt action rifle, was found wrapped in a towel, according to reports.What Happened After Kirk Was Shot?Authorities also revealed a spent cartridge was still chambered in the rifle, and three unspent cartridges contained wording on them, according to sources, expressing \"transgender and anti-fascist ideology.\"\n\nBoth the weapon and the ammunition have been taken by the FBI for DNA analysis and fingerprint impressions.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the mysterious man's identification.\n\nKirk, 31, was shot while hosting an event in Utah on Wednesday, September 10. Horrifying footage showed the conservative personality being hit with a single shot, as blood gushed from his body as he fell from his chair and onto the floor.\n\nHe was rushed to a hospital in Orem, Utah, where he was pronounced dead.Patel Fumbles InvestigationFollowing his passing, President Trump took to Truth Social to confirm the news: \"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.\n\n\"He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife, Erika and family. Charlie, we love you!\"\n\nAfter a brief manhunt, Patel said on X, \"The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\" However, he spoke too soon, as less than two hours after his announcement, Patel walked by his post.\n\nHe said in another tweet: \"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues, and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.\"The Country Reacts To Kirk's MurderSocial media users and viewers on television also saw another individual, an older man, apprehended for a while, and at one point appeared to have Patel claiming they had the shooter. \n\nBut Patel once again was wrong, as local law enforcement officials pushed back, and Gov. Spencer Cox the manhunt was still underway, and also labeled the shooting \"a political assassination.\"\n\nMany notable political figures were quick to react to Kirk's death, as former vice president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris said: \"I am deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah. Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family. Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.\"Trump's rival, Gavin Newsom, also raged: \"The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form.\"","summary":"The FBI have released images of a person of interest in Charlie Kirk's assassination.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/charlie-kirk-update-fbi-releases-first-images-of-person-of-interest-assassination/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/GxUHWSaMS/0x0/charlie-kirk-suspect-images-2-1757609504470.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 16:30:56","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":359661082,"title":"Biden insiders spew venom on Kamala Harris claiming her scathing critique of the former president is a 'sloppy attempt at deflecting blame' for her failure","text":"The gloves are off in Biden world after former Vice President Kamala Harris released an excerpt from her new memoir, calling it 'recklessness' to let the octogenarian decide for himself whether to run for re-election.\n\n'The stakes were simply too high,' Harris writes in her forthcoming memoir, in an excerpt published by The Atlantic on Wednesday morning. \n\n'This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.'\n\nHer critique has infuriated at least some Biden insiders, one of whom called it a 'sloppy, sort of craven, relatively unsophisticated attempt at deflecting blame' for her loss.\n\nAnother who shared their unfiltered thoughts with the Daily Mail after reading the excerpt, unloaded on Harris for her 'whining' rewrite of her failed presidential bid. \n\nThe source took shots at not only her but the staff she surrounded herself with as vice president and in her abbreviated run for the White House in 2024.\n\n'Blaming the good (president's) team because your team was s****y at getting you good press, or positioning you to succeed, doesn't feel like a winning strategy or an effective comeback narrative, if you're the former vice president,' the insider said. \n\n'You had a team. It was their job to do the thing that you're blaming the Biden team for. That's crazy.'\n\nIn Harris's 107 Days, which goes on sale on September 23, she revealed she regretted not pushing Biden to abandon his 2024 campaign sooner.\n\n'During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps,' Harris admits.\n\n'Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty.'\n\nShe says that going into the 2024 campaign, she automatically followed the 'mantra' set by the White House that it was Biden's decision to make with his family if he wanted to run for re-election. \n\n'Was it grace, or was it recklessness?' Harris asked. 'In retrospect, I think it was recklessness.'\n\nShe complained that during the president's speech announcing his decision to abandon his reelection campaign, he did not mention her name until 'almost nine minutes into the 11-minute address.'\n\nHer remarks were fighting words for those who fought for Biden.\n\nA Biden White House official balked at her claim that the White House press team was weak in defending her when she faced criticism as vice president, including reports of high staff turnover in her office.\n\nThe official also took issue with Harris' claim that she became more popular than the president, stating that polling showed Biden's approval ratings were higher even during low points of his presidency, when he struggled with the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, COVID response and rising inflation. \n\n The former vice president also revealed a list of grievances with Biden and his staff.\n\nThe source countered that the Biden administration spent a great deal of time and effort defending and advocating for her, on the record, in briefings and press interviews.\n\nHowever, the White House source said there was no disputing the fact that there was exceptionally high turnover under Harris when she was vice president, during her 2020 campaign and her time as attorney general in California.\n\n'Vice President Biden didn't seem to have any trouble positioning himself well, having a high approval rating, getting good press when he was vice president, surrounded by a good team,' the source continued. \n\n'So her writing a book whining that the talented people in the building didn't help her enough because she hired not-talented people seems as out of touch as one can get.'\n\nThe insider said they're not certain whether Biden has read the manuscript, but said he and Jill Biden would recognize the politics involved.\n\n'I'd expect if you asked him today, he would sort of shake his head and say she's doing what she feels she has to do to keep herself politically viable,' the insider said.\n\nBut the source questioned the stance Biden's number 2 has taken, calling it insane for her to suggest she could have won if Biden bowed out sooner.\n\n'The sort of irony in that is the assumption that she thinks she would have won a democratic primary had President Biden not anointed her the nominee,' the source told the Daily Mail. \n\n'She wouldn't have. She would have lost. Someone more talented than her would have beat her in the democratic primary.\n\n'The only reason she was the nominee in the first place is because of the guy that she's out there attacking today,' the insider continued.\n\nThe source also said Harris has only herself and her self-selected team to blame for the loss, pointing to such political malfeasance as to advocate gender-affirming care for prisoners, then failing to address it when Trump predictably attacked her for the position. \n\n'The ad that permeated the most for Trump, which was the most effective piece of paid media, it was that,' the source said. \n\n'It was her on tape advocating for gender-affirming care for prisoners. And somehow the new people in charge, like David Plouffe and Stephanie Cutter, never did anything about it.\n\n'Head that s**t off,' the insider continued. 'It wasn't Joe Biden who advocated for gender-affirming care for prisoners and then failed to address it on the campaign trail. That's on her.'\n\nThe source also didn't mince words when asked for a reaction by others in Biden's orbit.\n\n'People sort of see it as a sloppy, sort of craven, relatively unsophisticated attempt at trying to deflect blame and start whatever political comeback she thinks she has,' the insider told the Daily Mail. \n\n'But if she was serious about it, she should be running for governor of California.\n\n'You know what's not going to happen?' the source continued. 'You're not going to write a book, go on The View and Seth Myers (talk show), blame the only guy that elevated you to the national level when he chose you as his running mate in August 2020, and think that's going to position you to go beat (Illinois governor) J.D. Pritzker and (Senator) Raphael Warnock and (Biden transportation secretary) Pete Buttigieg in a primary. \n\n'That's f***ing fantasy s**t.'\n\nBut the source said Harris obviously is trying to position herself for another act in politics.\n\n'Why would you go after the guy that was nothing but loyal to you and stood by your side and has a lot of personal affection for you?' the insider said. 'Why would you do that if you didn't have some ultimate political objective in mind?''\n\nAt the same time, the insider said that in retrospect, Biden's run for re-election might have been a mistake, while also defending the decision.\n\n'I think a lot of people have forgotten the complex political dynamics of the time,' the source told the Daily Mail. \n\n'You just had the best midterm election for a sitting president in a generation, and he was passing wildly popular legislation and governing the country better than anyone had in decades and decades.\n\n'So there were lots of reasons to run, and it was a tough call, though everyone pretends like it wasn't,' the insider said. \n\n'Hindsight being 20-20, I think a lot of people, including President Biden, would probably say I probably shouldn't have done it. But it's bull**** for people to try to second-guess the decision in the moment given the factors we knew.","summary":"Insiders from Biden's camp have revealed how they really feel about Kamala Harris' new tell-all book as some of its contents contain scathing critiques on the former president's actions.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15085455/biden-insiders-reveal-kamala-harris-107-days-book.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/10/18/102014571-0-image-m-31_1757527060876.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/31/2835954436771264493/1024x576_MP4_2835954436771264493.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 16:28:54","author":"Editor,Shawn Cohen","authors":["Editor","Shawn Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":359663666,"title":"Biden Team Flips Out Over Kamala Harris’s New Book","text":"“The entire Right has to band together.

Unpacking Charlie Kirk’s media empire","text":"Turning Point USA, the grassroots right-wing political organization founded by Charlie Kirk, has been left reeling after its leader was shot dead during a campus event in Utah on Wednesday.\n\nKirk, 31, was speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem when a sniper’s bullet hit him during a discussion about gun violence. He was rushed to the hospital but died soon afterwards. He leaves behind a wife and two young children. A manhunt for the gunman is currently ongoing.\n\n“May he be received into the merciful arms of our loving Savior, who suffered and died for Charlie,” TPUSA said in a statement posted on its official website and on X. “We ask that everyone keep his family and loved ones in your prayers.” \n\nKirk was an 18-year-old Chicago college dropout and Ronald Reagan admirer when he founded the organization in 2012 with the support and encouragement of Bill Montgomery, 71, a Tea Party-backed legislative candidate and marketing entrepreneur.\n\nWhile still in high school, Kirk \n\n“We are committed to identifying, educating, training, and organizing students to promote freedom,” TPUSA states on its website. What that amounts to in practice is promoting conservative values in America’s schools, colleges, and universities on the assumption that such institutions naturally tend to be left-leaning spaces that scorn Republican talking points in favor of progressivism. \n\nComing to fruition as Barack Obama’s second term drew to a close, TPUSA was ideally poised to latch onto the ascent of Donald Trump, seeing him as a champion who could re-energize right-leaning politics and shake up the establishment. However, Kirk initially appeared to favor Texas Sen. Ted Cruz before switching his support.\n\nLike Trump, Kirk proved himself a happy culture warrior, regularly appearing on conservative media to take Democrats to task over a vast array of issues, from trans rights and gay marriage to abortion and gun control, frequently attracting controversy.\n\nHe used his celebrity among Republicans to help grow TPUSA, and it now has a presence at 3,500 institutions, more than 850 campus chapters, and “field representatives” in all 50 states. Its activists spend their days sending right-wing speakers to college campuses and staging conferences at which their young audiences can discuss contemporary social issues like race and immigration through a MAGA lens.\n\nTPUSA is particularly known for its Professor Watchlist (launched in 2016) and School Board Watchlist (2021), which it uses to name and shame teachers and boards whom it accuses of “discriminating” against Republican students.\n\nStill funded by conservative private donors, TPUSA has six national summits and hosts eight regional conferences per year. \n\nIt also has several spinoff ventures, including Turning Point Action, tasked with engaging voters specifically; Turning Point Faith, for religious advocacy; Turning Point Endowment, which handles its charitable endeavors; and Turning Point U.K., its British arm (Kirk addressed the Oxford Union in May).\n\nIn June this year, it organized its biggest ever Young Women’s Leadership Summit in Grapevine, Texas, at which the speakers, including Kirk and his wife Erika, both of whom are evangelical Christians, urged the 3,000 young women present to consider putting marriage before their careers. \n\nTPUSA is also behind several popular podcasts, including the late activist’s own Charlie Kirk Show and Culture Apothecary, which is fronted by Alex Clark and focuses on wellness, lifestyle, and Robert F Kennedy Jr’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement.\n\nAppealing to young men through podcasts and new media was seen as a key strategy behind Trump’s election victory over Kamala Harris last year, and TPUSA has been widely credited with helping to drive turnout for the Republican ticket. \n\nThe president has never overlooked the significance of Kirk’s influence over that demographic and made sure to speak at a TPUSA gathering in Arizona last September.\n\nHe has since paid tribute to Kirk and said he will posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor.","summary":"Conservative activist shot dead on Utah campus was an 18-year-old college dropout when he founded grassroots political movement that embraced Trumpism and developed into sprawling

campus of Utah Valley University.\n\nDressed in a white t-shirt with the word “Freedom” across the front, Kirk sat in a chair under a tent as he answered questions from the large audience gathered around him.\n\nThe event was the first of about 15 scheduled across the country through the end of October.\n\n– A Gunshot, Then Screams –\n\nFormer Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was at the event, told Fox News that Kirk was responding to a question about “transgender shooters, mass shooters, and in the midst of that, the shot rang out.”\n\nThe 31-year-old collapsed, and blood spurted from his neck, according to a video clip shot from a nearby location.\n\nKirk was then rushed away on a stretcher by his security detail.\n\n“As soon as that shot went out, he fell back,” Chaffetz said. “Everybody hit the deck… a lot of people started screaming, and then everybody started running.”\n\n– Manhunt For Killer Ongoing –\n\nAuthorities have not arrested a suspect in Kirk’s shooting, described as a “targeted attack” in a statement from Utah’s Department of Public Safety.\n\n“The shooter is believed to have fired from the roof of a building down to the location of the public event in the student courtyard,” it said.\n\nTwo men were briefly detained and released after being questioned by law enforcement officials as the manhunt continued.\n\nOne man, George Zinn, was charged with obstruction.\n\nNeither man has “current ties to the shooting,” authorities said.\n\n– Trump Announces Kirk’s Death –\n\nTrump announced Kirk’s death, writing on his Truth Social platform: “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead.”\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, Democratic figures also condemned the shooting, including Kamala Harris, who said that “political violence has no place in America.”\n\n– Trump Vows Crackdown –\n\nAlthough a suspect has not yet been identified, Trump linked rhetoric from the “radical left” to Kirk’s killing and vowed to carry out a crackdown.\n\n“This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today,” he said in a somber four-minute video, seated at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n\n“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it,” the US

The shooter's motivation is not yet known, but Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA), an organization focused on younger voters and spreading conservative ideas, was a prominent figure in Trump world.\n\nHis death is again spurring conversation around political violence in America – and what can be done about it. It's a complicated question without simple solutions.\n\nAnyone with a heightened profile in this political climate – politicians, judges or otherwise – are facing increasing threats.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., noted earlier this month that Capitol Police have seen the number of incidents they consider threatening and concerning behavior up significantly – about 14,000 recorded so far this year, up from 9,000 in all of 2024.\n\nJohnson said on CNN Wednesday night following Kirk's death that many members of Congress are \"nervous\" and want more security.\n\n\"They're exposed, all the time, everywhere,\" said Johnson, who considered Kirk a friend.\n\nKirk's prominent role\n\nKirk was close to Trump and his family, particularly his son, Donald Trump Jr. Kirk had been an aide to Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential campaign before branching out and creating a brand in his own name to complement TPUSA, which he started in 2012 at the age of 18.\n\nHe was ubiquitous on social media. On Instagram and TikTok, for example, he and his podcast had more than 8 million followers on each platform. TPUSA had a popular annual conference attended by lots of young conservatives, who viewed him as something of a folk hero.\n\nAnd he was responsible for turning a lot of younger voters, especially young men, into Trump voters.\n\nWednesday at Utah Valley University was supposed to be the start of what Kirk was calling, \"The American Comeback Tour.\" It was slated to take him to nearly a dozen colleges, from Utah to Virginia, Minnesota to Louisiana.\n\nThis is what Kirk did often – he went to colleges across the country, holding court, casting doubt on liberalism and challenging anyone within shouting distance of a microphone to take to it and argue with him.\n\nHis conservative friends and followers describe Kirk as a Christian, a father and the nicest person they knew – someone who engaged in the \"free marketplace of ideas,\" as Johnson put it on CNN.\n\nKirk was provocative and often clips of his talks and arguments on campus or what he said on his podcast went viral, often stoking controversy.\n\nFor example, here is just a selection of some of those things Kirk said:\n\n–\"White, college indoctrinated women will ruin America if we let them.\"\n\n–\"I'm sorry, if I see a Black pilot, I'm going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified.\"\n\n–\"We should bring back the celebration of the M.R.S. degree.\"\n\n–\"Maybe one of the reasons that Taylor Swift has been so annoyingly liberal over the last couple of years is that she's not yet married, and she doesn't have children. … Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You're not in charge.\"\n\n–\"It is so materially insane to think that 1 in 5 American women will be raped in their life … meaning that they're lying about being raped, that they're lying about being sexually assaulted. Like a fraternity guy and a sorority girl at age 19 hooking up, both five drinks in at 2 a.m. and all of a sudden, like, she removes consent. Yeah, like, that's a murky, middle gray area.\"\n\n–Of former TV personality Joy Reid, former first lady Michelle Obama, late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: \"They're coming out, and they're saying, 'I'm only here because of affirmative action.' Yeah, we know. You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person's slot to be taken somewhat seriously.\"\n\nSome conservatives argue those statements are either, in their view, not controversial or that taking them out of context distorted his meaning. But the comments show why he was a lightning rod to liberals.\n\nSome on social media reacted gleefully to Kirk's death, and some on the right described this as \"war.\"\n\nPolitical leaders who disagreed with Kirk, though, are emphasizing that violence is never justified or acceptable.\n\n\"We don't yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,\" former President Barack Obama said on social media. \"Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie's family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children.\"\n\nFormer President Joe Biden similarly said, \"There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now. Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk's family and loved ones.\"\n\nPublic opinion, threats and mixed messages\n\nIn this period of provocation and confrontation, a lot of Americans see threats to their ways of life.\n\nConservatives chafed under what they saw as a liberal lurch in the country during Obama's presidency. They saw the culture, the media — news, TV, movies – as too liberal, weak and enabling. And they feel too many talk down the good qualities of the country.\n\nFor those left of center, it's very different. They see threats to the marginalized – women, immigrants, minorities – because of leaders who they see as having given license to meanness, intolerance and conspiracy. And they see democracy itself under threat with Trump's strongman tendencies.\n\nThere's a lot of hopelessness that many people feel for different reasons about this political time, and that can lead to violence – even if it's a small few who might go that far.\n\nPolling has shown that people have mixed feelings about polarization, civility and compromise.\n\nA Georgetown University poll from 2023, for example, found overwhelming numbers of people said they want civility and compromise and believe respect for each other is the first step in having a government that works. More than 8 in 10 said so on each of those. More than 9 in 10 said respect was essential.\n\nBut the same respondents were also very dug in on their beliefs and not wanting to compromise them. More than 8 in 10 said they're tired of leaders compromising their values and ideals; more than 7 in 10 said those personal values are under attack.\n\nWhen it comes to violence, 73% in an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll from July described political violence as a \"major problem.\"\n\nOn acceptance of it, a University of Chicago survey from September of last year found 6% supported the use of force to restore Trump to the presidency. Another 8% supported it to prevent Trump from getting back to the White House.\n\nThose are very small numbers — and there are margins of error to consider there, too – but the figures represent millions of people. And when there is that kind of political environment, plus a mistrust of the system and institutions, increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, all it takes is a few radicalized people in either direction to cause a violent event like the assassination Kirk.\n\nMany leaders, like Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, are calling for calm and asking people to examine themselves.\n\n\"Our nation is broken,\" Cox said Wednesday. \"We've had political assassinations recently in Minnesota. We had an attempted assassination on the governor of Pennsylvania, and we had an attempted assassination on a presidential candidate and former President of the United States and now current President of the United States. We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be, to ask ourselves, 'Is this– is this it? Is this what 250 years has wrought on us?' I pray that that's not the case. I pray that those who hated what Charlie Kirk stood for will put down their social media, and their pens, and pray for his family. And that all of us, all of us will try to find a way to stop hating our fellow Americans.\"\n\nExperts say there needs to be a unified message from political leaders and influencers on social media to set examples of civility — and to stop demonizing and dehumanizing others who disagree, but often the opposite takes place.\n\nPresident Trump was close to Kirk and said he was like a son to him. Trump, though, who himself has been prone to base name-calling and political retribution, struck a different tone than Cox in his address to the country Wednesday night.\n\n\"It's long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible,\" Trump said.\n\nBut in the next sentence, he took a turn.\n\n\"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"\n\nTrump himself was called \"Hitler\" by those upset with his presidency during a night out for dinner in Washington on Tuesday. He added in Wednesday's video message: \"Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives. Tonight, I ask all Americans to commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died.\"\n\nThere was no mention of the other examples where Democrats were the subject of violence or a call for those who agree with him to also take the temperature down. That's important because the country is not only in a time of political polarization, but people are also getting their information often only from partisan outlets.\n\nAnd they'll hear and see only what their leaders and trusted sources tell them, worrying experts that not much will change any time soon.","summary":"The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk Wednesday at a college in Utah is the latest in a series of politically motivated violent acts just in recent months.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537908/political-violence-charlie-kirk","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/6000x4000!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Fd2%2F9a8f3d584237bd21b52d07f52171%2Fgettyimages-2234136690.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 15:32:30","author":"Domenico Montanaro","authors":["Domenico Montanaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.022},{"id":359654374,"title":"'Attack On Free Speech': Elon Musk Blasts 'The Left Is A Party Of Murder' After Charlie Kirk Assassination As Democrats Call For Gun Reform","text":"Elon Musk has led the fury surrounding Charlie Kirk's assassination branding the killing an \"attack on free speech.\"\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the tech tycoon spearheaded the outcry on social media by blaming the Democrats for the brutal shooting on Wednesday, when the tragic 31-year-old political commentator was shot dead hosting a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University in Orem.'The Left Is A Party Of Murder'He said on X: “The Left is the party of murder.\"\n\nThe Tesla boss added that the far-left were \"celebrating cold-blooded murder.\"\n\nFurious Republicans joined the uproar, with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene saying: \"This is the result of years of leftist indoctrination and hatred.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz also expressed outrage, saying: \"The intolerant left has taken their hatred to a violent extreme.

The Atlantic published an excerpt from the book this week.\n\nA former Biden official brushed off her criticism and told Axios that she was not an impressive vice president.\n\n\"Vice President Harris was simply not good at the job,\" the official, speaking anonymously, said. \"She had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration's key work streams, and instead would just dive bomb in for stilted photo ops that exposed how out of depth she was.\"\n\nThe official insisted that Biden is \"not the reason she struggled in office or tanked her 2019 [presidential] campaign.\" \n\n\"Or lost the 2024 campaign, for that matter,\" the official said. \"The independent variable there is the vice president, not Biden or his aides.\" \n\nIn the excerpt, Harris recounts her perception of some of the thought process among Biden's team and his allies ahead of the 2024 election, and accuses some of undermining her while she was vice president. \n\n\"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,\" Harris wrote.\n\nIn another section, Harris writes that the stakes for the election were \"simply too high\" to let \"an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\" determine who should run against then-former President Donald Trump in 2024. \n\nShe did accept some responsibility, noting that she should have \"perhaps\" voiced her concerns then, but didn't want to look like she was making a grab for power. \n\n\"I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,\" she wrote.\n\nA former Biden aide told Axios Harris's mea culpa wasn't exactly inspiring. \n\n\"I'm not sure the very robust defense of not having the courage to speak up in the moment about Biden running is quite as persuasive as she thinks it is. If this is her attempt at political absolution: Lots of luck in your senior year,\" the aide said. \n\nHarris also accused Biden's camp of trying to undermine and minimize her while she served as vice president. \n\n\"Their thinking was zero-sum: If she's shining, he's dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well,\" Harris wrote. \"His team didn't get it.\"\n\nShe further accused them of being silently accepting of negative news stories about her. \n\n\"When the stories [about Harris] were unfair or inaccurate, the president's inner circle seemed fine with it. Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,\" she said. \n\nDespite some of the aides' comments, Harris had some sympathetic voices in the former Biden camp. \n\nRon Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, said he thought that Harris \"did a good job\" in her role as vice president and said he felt \"badly that she found the experience negative.\" \n\nAnother former aide told Axios that \"we all know that Biden folks treated her and her team like s***.\" \n\n\"We never thought she would actually say anything,\" they aide said. \"The staffers across a range of ages and positions that I'm talking to are proud of her.\"","summary":"The unsuccessful 2024 Democratic presidential candidate had accused the former president’s team of undermining her","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-criticism-biden-book-b2824778.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/10/12/10/GettyImages-2166913421.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/m5cQlC9J-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 15:02:15","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":359610798,"title":"'Captured the youth': How Charlie Kirk helped fuel Donald Trump's return to the White House","text":"It's no overstatement to say that Charlie Kirk's powerful reach and influence among conservatives helped put President Donald Trump back in the White House. Kirk, the MAGA world rock star and ally of Trump and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., turned the extremely influential Turning Point USA youth organization that he co-founded at age 18 into a voter turnout machine for Trump in last year's presidential election. \"His mission was to bring young people into the political process, which he did better than anybody ever,\" the president said of his close friend and ally, in a video posted to social media hours after Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday. Vice President JD Vance, who was also very close to Kirk, highlighted his friend's efforts in the 2024 campaign and in advising the Trump-Vance administration this year. CLICK HERE FOR LIVE FOX NEWS UPDATES ON THE CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government,\" Vance wrote in a statement on social media. Turning Point Action, the political arm of Kirk's conservative youth organization, was instrumental in boosting younger voter turnout for Trump in last year's White House race. \"Charlie was such an amazing guy. He really captured the youth, the imagination of the youth,\" the president told Fox News' chief political anchor Bret Baier in a conversation on Wednesday. \"He really convinced millions and millions of young people that MAGA was the way to go.\" CHARLIE KIRK ROSE TO BECOME A CONSERVATIVE POWERHOUSE Kirk, who grew up in suburban Chicago, got his start in politics while in high school as a volunteer in the 2010 campaign of former Republican Sen. Mark Kirk (no relation) of Illinois. In the 13 years since he co-founded Turning Point USA, he turned it into one of the most prominent and influential conservative groups in the nation. Turning Point Action dished out millions of dollars into get-out-the-vote efforts in the key presidential battleground states that Trump ended up sweeping in his 2024 victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who last summer replaced then-President Joe Biden as the Democrats' national nominee. And Turning Point's \"Chase the Vote\" initiative, where staffers built bonds with low propensity voters during the 2024 cycle, helped bank votes by ensuring those people would cast ballots in the presidential election. Turning Point also helped run the Trump team's grassroots organizing and canvassing efforts, following a decision last year by federal election regulators that allowed candidates' campaigns to work directly with outside political groups. DEMS, GOP LAWMAKERS JOIN FORCES TO CONDEMN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK SHOT \"This is one where the statistics don't lie. There were seven battleground states and in six of the seven, there were dramatic gains among younger voters,\" longtime Republican strategist John Brabender told Fox News. \"It would be hard-pressed for anyone to not understand that Charlie Kirk was a major reason that happened.\" Brabender, who served as a media consultant for Trump's 2024 campaign, said \"You could easily make the argument that Charlie Kirk had not only an important effort for the election but ultimately the effort that put President Trump over the top.\" A Democratic strategist who served on the Biden and Harris campaigns, pointed to Kirk's large following and acknowledged that his efforts helped boost crucial youth turnout for Trump.

In front of an audience of thousands, the 31-year-old was shot in the neck and immediately rushed to the hospital, declared dead soon after. Political circles have shared their reactions to the harrowing incident online, with President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, and more sharing public tributes to the late Kirk and condemning the killing.\n\nThe dad-of-two was addressing an audience at Otem, Utah, part of a campaign tour organized by Turning Point USA under \"American Comeback,\" and was answering a question on gun violence and the trans rights before he was suddenly shot, throwing the audience into a panic. Approximately 3000 people were in attendance, including six police officers and Kirk's own security personnel.\n\nAs the manhunt for the shooter remains ongoing, here's all we know about the information released about the person of interest, the arrests that were made immediately after the incident, and other reactions that have come in since his death…\n\nWhat do we know of the shooter?\n\nIn their statement, the Utah Department of Public Safety shared: \"The shooting is believed to be a targeted attack. The shooter is believed to have fired from the roof of a building down to the location of the public event in the student courtyard. Any additional clarifications cannot be provided to protect the integrity of our investigation.\"\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, FBI officials, who are handling the case, declined to comment on whether they were aware of the identity of the shooter. However, they stated they'd recovered a weapon they heavily believe to be the one used to shoot Kirk. Special agent Robert Bohls, when asked about any fingerprints or DNA evidence collected in connection with the case, he responded: \"We are exhausting all of our resources to be able to collect those, but that's, again, part of the investigation.\"\n\nUtah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason confirmed they'd made several \"breakthroughs\" in their investigation and had received several tips as well. At the news conference, he shared that the shooter appeared to be \"of college age\" and blended in with the other students in attendance at the event. They also suspect the shooter to be male.\n\nCharlie Kirk's family response\n\nWhile there has been no direct statement from Kirk's family, including widow Erika Lane Frantzve, Beau Mason added during the conference that he'd been in communication with his family, who are \"devastated\" by the event. \"As commissioner of public safety, as a father, as a husband, I can only imagine what that family is going through.\"\n\n\"The heinous event that happened yesterday is not Utah, this is not what we're known for,\" he continued. \"We will not stand for what happened yesterday. We are exhausting every lead, we have every officer invested in this, every investigator, every local agency.\" Kirk shared two kids with his wife, a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son.\n\nPrevious arrests\n\nPer the Utah DPS' statement, it was confirmed that two previous suspects were taken into custody for questioning in connection with the investigation, but were soon released when it was revealed they had no \"current ties\" to the shooter or the incident itself. \"We initially took in George Zinn as a suspect. He was later released and charged with obstruction by UVU police.\" \n\n\"A second suspect, Zachariah Qureshi, was taken into custody and released after interrogation with law enforcement,\" the statement added. There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals. There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.\" Commissioner Mason stated during the press conference that they were appealing to the public not to \"harass\" the previous persons of interest.\n\n\"During the investigative process, we located a couple of persons of interest. We interviewed those individuals, and after releasing them and after clearing them with being suspects, they faced scrutiny, they faced threats,\" he shared. \"These individuals were not suspects.

In response to a question about what public officials should prioritize to make life better for American workers, the overwhelming response was \"reduce the cost of everyday essentials.\" When combined with their second choice—making housing more affordable—a full 65 percent of the American electorate wants to see politicians tackle rising costs. That's true across the political spectrum, with nearly identical numbers from those who voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 and those who voted for Kamala Harris.\n\nBut you can't always get what you want—and in politics that is even more true than in most parts of life.\n\nInflation hit its highest annualized level since January by rising to 2.9 percent in August, according to consumer price data released Thursday by the Department of Labor. In the past month, prices climbed by 0.4 percent, the highest month-over-month increase since December 2024.\n\nThe increase was an expected one—and had been foreshadowed by sharply rising prices in the wholesale market last month. Even so, it is not a welcome signal alongside a labor market that's struggling and amid Trump's pressure campaign aimed at getting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates (which could push inflation higher still, or trigger so-called \"stagflation\").\n\nThe consumer price index showed that rising prices in August hit all levels of what voters might consider \"everyday essentials.\" Food prices climbed by 0.5 percent, while energy prices shot up by 0.7 percent. Clothing (up 0.5 percent), new and used vehicles (up 0.3 percent and 1 percent, respectively), and shelter (up 0.4 percent) all climbed as well.\n\nIt's impossible to ignore the fact that those price increases coincided with the month that many of Trump's long-threatened \"reciprocal\" tariffs finally took effect after long delays.\n\n\"Recent months making clear that tariffs are materially weighing on consumer prices,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics for the Yale Budget Lab, posted on Twitter.\n\nThe middle-class squeeze from tariffs is here. Inflation hit 2.9% in August, the highest since January and up from 2.3% in April. It's troubling that so many basic necessities are rising in price again: Food, gas, clothing and shelter all had big cost jumps in August. And this is… pic.twitter.com/uJrSb8jx2z\n— Heather Long (@byHeatherLong) September 11, 2025\n\nDefenders of Trump's tariff policies have argued that they won't show up as inflation, since tariffs increase prices via fiscal policy (that is, as tax increases) rather than as monetary policy (which is what inflation tracks).\n\nThat may not be much of a defense at this point. Indeed, if that's true, then things look worse for Trump, who is now presiding over increasing inflation and tariff-related price increases that go above and beyond what's seen in the latest consumer price data.\n\nRegardless of which perspective you believe on the economic side of things, it is now obvious that rising prices are a political problem for the Trump administration—and that Trump's favorite policy is making that problem worse.\n\nGo back to that survey from the Economic Innovation Group that found a clear majority of Americans asking their political leaders to lower the cost of living. In a follow-up question, respondents were asked what they thought politicians should do to accomplish that goal. One of the offered responses was \"raising tariffs on imported goods.\" It polled dead last among both the Trump-voting cohort and the Harris-voting one.\n\nThe question that remains: Is the White House listening?","summary":"Inflation hit its highest level since January, with prices rising 0.4 percent in August.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/11/americans-want-lower-costs-but-inflation-just-hit-its-highest-mark-since-january/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/frankie-cordoba-2f5QSK4j8J4-unsplash-scaled-e1757597285949.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 14:30:21","author":"Eric Boehm","authors":["Eric Boehm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":359625042,"title":"How Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA helped Trump and MAGA win","text":"Conservative American activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday at a university event in Utah.\n\nKirk, 31, was a close ally of United States President Donald Trump and was widely credited for helping galvanise support for the Republican Party and Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement among American youth, including through regular engagements with university students.\n\nHe was the cofounder of the conservative youth organisation Turning Point USA. Here is a closer look at Kirk’s influence on young people and how it bolstered support for Trump and the MAGA movement:\n\nWho was Charlie Kirk?\n\nThe conservative media personality grew up in Chicago and attended a community college there before dropping out to pursue political activism.\n\nHe became friends with Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, and the pair travelled together to Greenland in January. President Trump had made clear by then that he wanted to absorb the Danish territory into the US even though Denmark and Greenland had both pushed back.\n\nKirk was an early supporter of Vice President JD Vance while Trump was deciding on his running mate for the 2024 election.\n\nA vocal critic of mainstream media, Kirk engaged in culture-war debates surrounding race, gender and immigration. He amplified and backed Trump’s unfounded claim that the 2020 election was stolen after Joe Biden won the vote.\n\nKirk has also been accused of holding racist, Islamophobic and misogynistic positions.\n\nKirk wrote a post on his X account on Tuesday in response to the fatal, unprovoked stabbing of a white woman by a Black man. He said: “The numbers tell the truth. Black attacks on white people happen 3X more often than white on black crime, despite blacks being only 13 percent of the population.”\n\nOn September 1, he wrote on his X account that “America does not need more visas for people from India. Perhaps no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India.”\n\nAfter the current war in Gaza broke out on October 7, 2023, after a Hamas-led attack on Israel, Kirk spoke at an event expressing solidarity with Israel. “The Muslims’ playbook is: surprise attack, use children and women as human shields, build international support that can then build consensus against Israel, and people will forget that Israel was attacked in the first place.”\n\nIn August, musician Taylor Swift got engaged to American football player Travis Kelce. During one of his events, Kirk said getting married might make Swift more conservative, urging her to have children. Kirk said: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.”\n\nKirk was a firm supporter of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants Americans the right to bear arms. In an interview this year, he said that “it’s worth it” to have “some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment”.\n\nHis death prompted condolence messages from Trump, his MAGA base, former US presidents, politicians from both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, other public figures and world leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nKirk’s shooter is still at large, and a manhunt for his killer continues.\n\nWhat is Turning Point USA?\n\nKirk cofounded the nonprofit conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA in 2012 when he was 18 years old. He started it with Bill Montgomery, an American conservative activist who died aged 80 in 2020.\n\nTurning Point has more than 850 chapters on US college campuses, where the organisation conducts discussions and conferences over issues such as immigration, abortion rights – Kirk was against them – and race.\n\nThe group also hosts several podcasts, including The Charlie Kirk Show, which reached more than 500,000 listeners each month.\n\nWhen Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University, he was on the first visit of his multicampus Turning Point tour.\n\nIn 2019, a British offshoot of the group called Turning Point UK was formed. There is also an Australian offshoot, called Turning Point Australia.\n\nDid Kirk help MAGA?\n\nWhile the extent of his influence is hard to measure definitively, the MAGA movement, Trump and independent experts all believe he played a crucial role in building support for the president and his political campaign.\n\n“Charlie Kirk had a significant political and mobilising influence among the Trumpist youth,” Ico Maly, an associate professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera. Maly teaches courses about digital media and has written about far-right activism.\n\nMaly explained that Kirk’s impact was the result of how he used digital culture in his ideological struggle.\n\n“It was his embrace of digital culture that laid the foundation for his mobilisation power in support of the Trump agenda. His campus rallies were not merely offline performances. They reproduced a familiar digital format: ‘Ask me anything,'” Maly said.\n\nTurning Point USA invested millions of dollars in a “chase the vote” initiative, building relationships with Republican voters in battleground states, registering these voters and assisting them with voting.\n\nWhat the numbers show\n\nBefore the 2024 US presidential election, Kirk visited 25 college campuses on a tour called You’re Being Brainwashed to mobilise young voters. This tour was “hailed by some as the single most important reason for a surge in Trump’s support among the youngest voters”, Australia-based writer Daryl McCann told Al Jazeera. McCann writes about conservative US politics for the Quadrant, Spectator Australia and Salisbury Review publications.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know how much Kirk’s efforts contributed, Trump benefitted from a clear bump in support among young voters in 2024.\n\nHe won 49 percent of the votes of men aged 18 to 49 nationally, up from 43 percent in 2020 and 46 percent in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn 2024, Trump’s Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, won 48 percent of the votes of young men. In 2020, Biden won 53 percent of the vote share for this group, and in 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton won 43 percent of this vote share.\n\nIn 2024, Trump won a 42 percent vote share of women aged 18 to 49. While Harris won 56 percent of the votes of this group, his vote share among young women was up from 38 percent in 2020 and 27 percent in 2016.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Trump won all seven key battleground states, including Arizona, where he defeated Harris by 187,000 votes. Last year, CNN reported an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter as saying Turning Point USA’s efforts helped bring 125,000 irregular voters in Arizona to the polls. According to CNN, Turning Point drove voters to polling places and helped them with mail-in ballots.\n\nIn May, Trump lauded Kirk’s contributions, saying they helped him win the vote of young people in 2024.\n\n“And Charlie Kirk will tell you, TikTok helped, but Charlie Kirk helped also,” Trump said during an Oval Office ceremony.\n\nHow did Kirk manage to do this?\n\nThe very positions that turned him into a hate figure for some people helped him draw supporters to the MAGA movement too, experts said.\n\n“His mobilisation power was fundamentally rooted in controversy. It is precisely this controversy that made him highly visible online, allowing him to exert significant ideological influence,” Maly said.\n\nMcCann added: “Kirk succeeded because he was charismatic, funny and tore apart wokeist ideology. Turning Point USA’s insurgent outreach to Gen Z perfectly complemented Trump’s populist pitch to the entire nation, which asserted that a coterie of insiders – the ‘enemy within’ – were betraying ordinary Americans.”\n\n“People might disagree with Kirk’s populist politics, but it is hard to deny that the Brainwashed tour, magnified by its access to TikTok, addressed matters of substance” in the minds of many American voters, McCann said.","summary":"He combined social media-era lingo, campus activism and a readiness to embrace controversies to drive young conservatism","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/11/how-charlie-kirk-and-turning-point-usa-helped-trump-and-maga-win?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/afp_68c2a997b715-1757587863.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 13:52:10","author":"Apps Support,Sarah Shamim","authors":["Apps Support","Sarah Shamim"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.003},{"id":359589258,"title":"OPINION - Charlie Kirk’s tragic death demands a reckoning on free speech","text":"Charlie Kirk is dead. He was a champion of free speech and he died speaking freely. He had an extraordinary reach for the young of his generation – my son, a student, and my daughter, a teenager, knew all about him. I knew next to nothing until he was shot last night. \n\n“It’s happening”, said my daughter darkly. “This is going to be meltdown.” What she meant was that this could be the trigger for violence, at least in the US, a breakdown of the consensus that accepted that you may disagree with people but your disagreement would be confined to argument and debate, and not murder. Assassination is the end of free speech, not only because it silences the man who makes arguments but because it makes a civilised exchange of opinion less likely in the future. \n\nKirk was only 31, and young people were his main audience. Although he didn’t go to university himself, he made a point of engaging with with students in universities here as well as in the US, that is, he went straight to the audiences that were most likely to disagree with him as a Trumpian conservative. That was brave, even without a gunman at large.\n\nNow he is dead and silenced for ever. In a poignant picture taken just before the speech he’s seen in front of a stand saying, Prove Me Wrong. The gunman didn’t prove him wrong. Rather, he made clear his importance. In a remarkably prescient piece written for The Spectator about his visit to the UK in May to speak at the Oxford and Cambridge Unions, Kirk wrote:\n\n“…at Oxbridge I found the dominant outlook to be a depressed and depressing near-nihilism. They were students who hardly cared their country has less free speech than 50 or 100 years ago. They were appalled that a person might think life begins at conception. They loved the abstract fight for ‘democracy’ in Ukraine, but find the actual outcome of democracy in America very icky.”\n\nAnd he was right; free speech here is under threat. But it is in America that the threat takes the most concrete form: it was in New York that Salman Rushdie was stabbed – at an event to highlight persecuted writers – by 25 year-old Hadi Matar, who disagreed with his views on Islam; it was in Utah that Charlie Kirk was shot. At least Salman Rushdie had the last word on his assailant with his coruscating book about the attack, Knife. And this summer he presciently observed that “people are too eager to prohibit speech they disapprove of”.\n\nDonald Trump in his anger and grief after Kirk’s death has apportioned blame: “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.”\n\nHe has a point. We may not agree with Kirk – I would have taken issue with many of his views – but there is a mindset in liberal circles that does not hesitate to demonise those on what it designates the far right without foreseeing where this will lead. One fatuous columnist observed after Kamala Harris was nominated as a presidential candidate that she and her friends were really worried that some right-wing lunatic would try to assassinate her; but there wasn’t a peep from that quarter after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. \n\nThe conservative journalist Paul Johnson once observed that liberals felt free to be disagreeable because they feel they have already proved their moral worth through their opinions, which means they had less incentive to behave well. The flip side is that the same people are likely to feel that conservatives, with their ghastly views about Islam/immigration/trans issues, aren’t moral people and are probably a danger to society. It’s a short step to the view that removing the menace is a service to society. Let me give a real example: Ricky Jones, a Walthamstow former Labour councillor, roused a crowd in Walthamstow in August last year by referring to anti-immigration activists as “disgusting Nazi fascists” and suggesting their throats should be cut – drawing a finger across his throat in case anyone didn’t comprehend his point. He was, remarkably, cleared of encouraging violent disorder after saying his remarks were directed towards far-right activists who he claimed had left stickers on a train with razor blades hidden behind them, and telling police they were never intended to be \"taken literally by anyone\". \n\nWe shall have the opportunity this weekend of seeing how the Kirk assassination this plays out when the march organised by Tommy Robinson, a hate-figure if ever there were one, takes place. Lots of people loathe him, but it is a test of a free society as to whether he and his followers can say what they think in public – so long as they don’t incite others to violence. Mind you, I keenly resent the money spent on police overtime that this will entail, but if there are to be highly-policed Palestine demonstrations (I saw a notably peaceable one yesterday) then those with other views – on immigration, say - should have their turn. \n\nBut already the killing has had its effect. In the US, Peter Sessions, the conservative politician, observed that although Republicans had tended to hold meetings in the open air, “this will change us and the way we express ourselves”. There’s a sense of apprehension among combative conservatives: Jeremy Clarkson has said that: “For the first time in my life, I’m genuinely frightened about being a newspaper columnist”. That suggests that violent intimidation works, that murder succeeds. And it mustn’t be allowed to. The best response to the killing is to assert all over again that in a civilised society we are entitled to express our opinion and to have that opinion heard. We advance towards the truth through debate and argument and the free expression of contrary views. And if a man is cut down, like Charlie Kirk was, then, as was the case with Martin Luther King Jr (a much greater man), a dozen others must step forward to take his place. This has been a terrible time for free speech.

Currently, McEnany serves as an on-air pundit for Fox and one of the co-hosts of the panel discussion program “Outnumbered.”\n\nAn example of McEnany’s blatant lies is her 2012 tweet saying, “How I Met Your Brother — Never mind, forgot he’s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows”\n\nThe comment came at the same time that President Donald Trump was pushing the discredited, racist “birther” conspiracy falsely alleging that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not the United States.\n\nAnd during a 2019 appearance on CNN, McEnany previewed her time in the spotlight by saying of Trump, “I don’t believe the president has lied.” \n\nAt that point in his presidency, Trump already made 16,241 false or misleading claims, as catalogued by the Washington Post. \n\n“He doesn’t lie. The press lies,” she said in 2020. “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism come here, and isn’t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama.” \n\nOf course, the first COVID-19 cases had already been confirmed a month earlier.\n\nAfter promising journalists at her first press briefing that she wouldn’t lie, McEnany spent almost her entire time in Trump’s administration spreading misinformation.\n\nMcEnany asserted in September 2020 that Trump “never downplayed the virus,” despite his repeated false assertions that COVID-19 had been contained, even bragging to Fox that his administration had “shut it down.” Tens of thousands of deaths followed.\n\nHer claim was so removed from reality that the fact checking site PolitiFact rated her defense of Trump as “pants on fire.” In fact, in 10 fact checks rating her statements, the service only rated three as “mostly true” or “half true.” The remainder were categorized as “mostly false,” “false,” and “pants on fire.”\n\nAnother fact checking site, FactCheck.org, noted in May 2020 that McEnany had repeated a Russian talking point when discussing the Mueller investigation, which she claimed was a “complete and total exoneration of President Trump.” \n\nThe report, which specifically said that the investigation “does not exonerate him,” later formed the basis for many of the charges in Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nDuring the 2020 election season, McEnany carried water for Trump by regurgitating his false attacks on mail-in voting, but it was later revealed that McEnany—like Trump—had voted by mail multiple times since 2010.\n\nAs results came in showing that Trump was losing the election to President Joe Biden, McEnany pushed false narratives, prematurely claiming that Trump won Pennsylvania, which he ultimately lost. She also falsely argued that there were “very real claims” of voter fraud being pursued by the Trump campaign and even promoted a bogus analysis alleging that it was improbable that Biden won four of the swing states that he did in fact win.\n\nAnd McEnany continued her deception at Fox, where she claimed that nobody in Trump’s orbit brought up Vice President Kamala Harris’ race—something that Trump himself did. She also said that Trump didn’t put in place a Muslim ban during his presidency—which he infamously did. She even claimed that “you didn’t see crisis after crisis” during Trump’s presidency.\n\nIn May, as part of her pro-Trump advocacy McEnany said that CBS reporter Scott Pelley should have been arrested after criticizing Trump’s authoritarian stances during a commencement speech.\n\nFox has long positioned itself as a primary source of lies and dishonesty within the conservative movement. With the elevation of a serial liar like McEnany, the network continues to cement its reputation of spreading falsehoods.","summary":"Fox News announced Wednesday that former Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will be hosting her own weekend show, “Saturday In America.” The decision comes after years of McEnany prominently lying about a dizzying array of issues, further cementing Fox’s key role as a source of disinformation and falsehoods.\n\n\n\nMcEnany has worked at the network since 2021, following her stint in the Trump administration and at the Republican National Committee.

Here we look at the runners and riders.\n\nJames Roscoe has taken over from Lord Mandelson as interim ambassador while Downing Street begins the process of finding a permanent replacement. \n\nWhile there is no suggestion yet that Mr Roscoe will hold the position permanently, the career diplomat has a strong CV. He is currently the embassy’s head of mission, a role which sees him take over in the absence of the ambassador. He was previously deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Washington in July 2022.\n\nBefore moving to Washington, he was the UK ambassador to the UN General Assembly from 2019. Prior to this, from 2016 to 2019, he held the roles of director for communication at the Cabinet Office, and subsequently the Department for Exiting the European Union.\n\nGeorge Osborne is said to have been on Downing Street’s shortlist to be the next UK ambassador to Washington, despite the former Tory chancellor being disliked by many in the Labour Party for his role as the architect of austerity in Britain. \n\nTom Baldwin, in his biography of the prime minister, wrote that senior No 10 aides “invested considerable effort” in unsuccessfully pushing for Mr Osborne to be considered. \n\nJulia Longbottom is currently Britain’s ambassador to Japan – a position she has held since 2021. Before her move to Tokyo, she served in the Foreign Office in the Covid taskforce. Like Mr Roscoe, she is a career diplomat who is widely respected in her current role. \n\nMs Longbottom played a significant part in negotiations to get the CPTPP agreement over the line, making her well placed to support any further talks with the US on tariffs and trade. However, she could be hampered by Donald Trump’s aversion to career diplomats. \n\nDavid Miliband, who was a frontrunner in the initial contest when Lord Mandelson was selected, is a veteran Labour politician rather than a career diplomat, meaning his appointment would show Downing Street is wary of Mr Trump’s disdain for bureaucrats. \n\nAfter standing down as an MP, the former foreign secretary has been president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, based in the US, since 2013. He took that job three years after losing the Labour leadership contest to his brother Ed, now a minister in Sir Keir’s cabinet.\n\nMade a peer by Tony Blair, she replaced Lord Mandelson as EU trade commissioner. She was then chosen, despite her low profile, for the new post of EU high representative for foreign affairs, dubbed the EU’s first “foreign minister”.\n\nThe job, created under the Lisbon Treaty, had the aim of making the EU speak “with one voice” internationally. She reportedly made “quiet diplomacy” her hallmark, but was praised for what she achieved in the role. She is credited with representing the EU in a longstanding beef dispute with the US and with helping broker an agreement with South Korea that removed most tariffs between the two economies.\n\nBut she faces the challenge that she is seen as perhaps better suited to the role had Kamala Harris won.","summary":"Our next man – or woman – in Washington will need all the political and diplomatic nous they can muster.

Plenty of eyewitnesses recalled the incident as well.\n\nEmma Pitts, a reporter from Deseret News, who was in attendance at the debate in Utah, told the BBC: \"We all dropped to the ground, and I want to say we sat like that for about 30 to 45 seconds, and then everyone around us got up and started running.\"\n\nAmid the horrific tragedy, a tweet by Kirk from 2014 has resurfaced which read: \"Did I just get shot by an AR-15?
