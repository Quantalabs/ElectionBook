John Fetterman after he slammed his own party for backing – or at least refusing to call out – the violent and destructive LA rioters.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Senator has more recently broken with Democrats on some major hot button issues – including condemning the swath of anti-ICE protesters who last week began rioting in the streets while waving Mexican flags, raiding stores and clashing with law enforcement officers in southern California.\n\nFetterman demanded his caucus colleagues join him in denouncing rioters who are wreaking havoc on downtown Los Angeles.\n\n‘I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that,’ Fetterman wrote on X with an image of cars on fire with a masked rioter waving a Mexican flag.\n\nHe continued: ‘This is anarchy and true chaos. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement.’\n\nMusk replied to Fetterman’s post with an emoji of an American flag.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk and President Donald Trump got into a very public spat after the billionaire broke with his former best friend over his massive spending proposal – the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\nThis caused a civil war within the MAGAverse.\n\nAnd now, the billionaire CEO is using his social media platform to side with a Democratic Senator.\n\nBut Musk wasn’t the only one who praised and amplified Fetterman’s condemnation of his own party.\n\nOhio gubernatorial candidate and former 2024 presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy reposted Fetterman and noted on X: ‘It’s hard to preach hard truths to your own side. I respect this.’\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Taylor Budowich called Fetterman’s post a ‘wake up call for many Democrats.’\n\n‘[T]here is no room for you in the party of Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris,’ he continued. ‘Their self-obsessed pursuits of power are blind to you and your concerns. They defend chaos, reject biology, and are unbothered by the invasion of our nation.’\n\nNotorious pro-Second Amendment activist Dana Loesch posted: ‘Well said, Senator.’\n\nFetterman was the first, and so far only, Democratic senator to condemn the riots.\n\nThough Sen. Bernie Sanders – a progressive Vermont independent who caucasus with Democrats – spoke out against violence and called it ‘counterproductive’ to creating real change.\n\n‘Dr. King defeated racist government officials & ended segregation through disciplined non-violent resistance,’ Sanders declared in a post on X.\n\n‘Defeating Trumpism, oligarchy & authoritarianism requires that same level of discipline,’ he continued. ‘Violent protests are counterproductive and play right into Trump’s playbook.’\n\nTrump deployed 2,100 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to the unrest.\n\nAdditionally, on June 9 he mobilized a battalion of 700 active duty Marines in southern California and justified it by claiming he was preventing a ‘disaster’ and restoring ‘law and order.’\n\nPresident Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act so far, which would allow broader military activity.\n\nThe federal response came after peaceful protests began to devolve this week with demonstrators throwing objects at law enforcement, burning vehicles and looting stores.\n\n‘We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California,’ Trump wrote on Monday in a post to Truth Social. ‘If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated.’ \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deployment an ‘illegal and immoral’ overreach and said it represents an ‘unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk bolstered Democratic Sen.

He is still at large.\n\nAuthorities do not know how many people are involved.\n\nMinnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said: “We still don’t know if additional people are involved, but this individual is the one that we’re looking as a person of interest right now, but there may be other people with him.”\n\nBoelter is a former appointee of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nMr Walz, who was Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 federal election, described the shootings as “an unspeakable tragedy,” and said the incident “appears to be a politically motivated assassination”.\n\nBoelter allegedly posed as a police officer when he shot Senator John Hoffman and his wife in their Champlin home early Saturday local time, leaving them seriously injured before moving on to the Hortmans’ house — where he is believed to have murdered her and her husband, sources told The NY Post.\n\nBoelter was appointed by Walz in 2019 to serve a four-year stint on the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, documents show.\n\nHe previously served on the Governor’s Workforce Development Council in 2016 under then Governor Mark Dayton.\n\nThe suspect reportedly had flyers with the words “No Kings” in his car, a reference to Saturday’s planned protests against the Trump Administration, as well as a “manifesto” and a list of other politicians’ names, said police, who briefly cornered the shooter at the Hortmans’ home before the suspect fled.\n\nThe anti-Trump rally in Minneapolis — part of the national wave of “No Kings” protests planned for Saturday — has since been cancelled after police issued a shelter-in-place order in response to the shootings.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and US Attorney-General Pam Bondi decried what they called “horrific violence” and said perpetrators would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law”. \n\nThe shootings came at a moment of deep political divisions in the US, as thousands prepared to take to the streets in protest at the policies of Mr Trump.\n\nThe Republican president has drawn criticism from Democrats over his harsh deportation policy, his assault on universities and the media and a perceived flouting of limits on executive power as he pushes his agenda.\n\n“At this precipice moment we’re on, this tragic act here in Minnesota should serve as a reminder to all of us,” Mr Walz said.\n\n“The democracy and the debates in the halls of Congress, in state houses, in school boards, is a way to settle our differences peacefully and move society to a better place.”\n\nMatt Oleg, a relative of the Hoffmans, told KARE 11 that “a bullet just very nearly missed Senator Hoffman’s heart, that his wife Yvette is in better condition, she had no organs pierced, and that she saved the couple’s daughter’s life.”\n\n“The daughter Hope, who I believe is in her mid-twenties, was at home with her parents, and Yvette threw herself on top of her daughter,” Mr Lagoe continued, recalling the information shared with him by Oleg. He added that Hope “was not hit” by gunfire.\n\nMr Oleg said that John and Yvette Hoffman “are both out of surgery, they’re stable,” and “minutes ago had been trying to bring the senator out from under anaesthesia.”\n\nSuspect on-the-run\n\nThe suspect is still on the run, despite making contact with police in the aftermath of the Hortman double homicide, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.\n\nOfficers dispatched to the Hortmans’ home as other units investigated the Hoffman shooting discovered a car outfitted with flashing lights to look like an SUV squad car.\n\n“When they arrived at Melissa’s house, they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house,” Mr Bruley said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest, a badge and other equipment, such as a Taser, “very similar to mine.”\n\n“When our officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home,” he continued.\n\n“It was not a real police officer. This is someone that clearly had been impersonating a police officer who uses the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.”\n\nGunfire was exchanged, but the suspect escaped on foot.\n\nMark Hortman was alive when Brooklyn Park police entered the home, but he died as they attempted to deliver lifesaving measures.\n\nMelissa Hortman was declared dead at the scene.\n\nAs the mayhem unfolded, first responders rushed the Hoffmans to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe couple had each been pumped with multiple bullets, but survived the attack.\n\nCops initially ordered a shelter-in-place for the 4km radius surrounding the Edinburgh Golf Course near the Hortman home, which was lifted Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Police are looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,” Brooklyn Park Police said in an emergency alert sent to residents at 5:30am.\n\n“Suspect is white male, brown hair, wearing black body armour over blue shirt and blue pants and may misrepresent himself as law enforcement.”\n\nThey city later said they had reason to believe the suspect was no longer in the area.","summary":"Two US politicians and their spouses have been gunned down in a “politically motivated attack” at their homes by a shooter who posed as a cop.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/us-politician-and-husband-killed-others-injured-after-madman-posing-as-cop-shoots-them/news-story/0c5f02740233a7d88307522189896ba9?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f9b428fa215efaf2355c62a6bae3b622","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 21:35:10","author":"Chantelle Francis","authors":["Chantelle Francis"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":331459540,"title":"CBS News hammered on social media for promoting 'No Kings Day' anti-Trump protest merchandise","text":"CBS News is currently facing backlash on social media after they posted what appeared to be an advertisement for \"No Kings Day\" protest merchandise to X on Friday, with users slamming the outlet for pushing the anti-Trump goods on the eve of a large-scale political protest.

The two events are culminating in the “Grand Military Parade” in Washington, D.C., featuring more than 6,700 soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles parading through the city.\n\nOpponents of the parade — the nation’s first since 1991’s National Victory Celebration, which was timed to welcome returning veterans of the 100- day Persian Gulf War — say it is a vanity project of a nascent dictator.\n\n“This administration is sending National Guard troops and active duty military against American citizens protesting this administration’s illegal and unconstitutional actions,” said Richard Cannon, an organizer with 50501 Escondido. “This is exactly the type of tyrannical behavior that our founding fathers feared, one that many thought “could never happen in this country.”\n\nThe group 50501 is a national organization that stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.\n\nTwo major rallies for No Kings Day will kick off at 10 a.m. in Downtown San Diego, one at Civic Center Plaza, 1200 Third Ave., the other at Waterfront Park, 1600 Pacific Highway. Both will conclude at Waterfront Park.\n\nOrganizers encourage protesters to carry signs and make their voices heard, but not to engage in violent confrontation with supporters of the president and law enforcement.\n\n“A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action,” a statement from No Kings organizers read. “We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.”\n\nTrained peace-keepers in yellow vests will be scattered throughout the protests. Participants can seek them out with concerns.\n\nAn April 5 protest, “Hands Off Our Rights,” drew thousands to Waterfront Park without violence.\n\n“This is not a political issue, this is about real people and the real impact that these policies are having on them,” Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-San Diego, said of the April rally. “This kind of mass mobilization that we’re seeing here today of every day people — I don’t even know if all of these people voted for Kamala Harris, or voted for me — but showing that these policies have real impacts on real people and continuing to speak up and making our voices heard is the most important thing we can be doing right now.”\n\nThe military parade — which is subject to cancellation due to possible thunderstorms Saturday — will feature 28 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armored vehicles, four Paladin howitzers, towed artillery, and multiple infantry squad vehicles. Army officials estimate the parade will cost taxpayers between $25 million and $45 million. Metal plates will be laid down on the street to prevent damage from the 68-ton machines, an army statement reads.\n\n“For two and a half centuries the men and women of America’s army have dominated our enemies and protected our freedom at home,” Trump said. “This parade salutes our soldiers’ remarkable strength and unbeatable spirit. You won’t want to miss it. Thundering tanks and breathtaking flyovers will roar through our capital city.”\n\nBut opponents disagree.\n\n“This is the kind of vanity parade we would expect to see in Russia or North Korea, not in a democracy,” said Allison Gill, podcaster of the Mueller She Wrote podcast, who will speak at the San Diego rallies.\n\nThe timing of the parade seems auspicious, as the Trump administration has recently ramped up Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions throughout the country, but notably in San Diego and Los Angeles, leading to ongoing civil unrest.\n\n“American immigrants built this country. From railroads, to farms, from factory workers, to building the homes we live in, they’ve been the backbone of the working class,” said Robin, an organizer with Indivisible North County San Diego. “So, we march on June 14 to remind the leaders of our country — there are no kings in the USA and immigrants will always be a part of this diverse nation.”\n\nTwo protests groups have merged in front of the county building at Waterfront Park to an estimated 20,000 demonstrators, with some traffic control along Harbor Drive while rolling road closures were put in place as the group moves, according to the San Diego Police Department.\n\n“No issues or arrests, everyone is being peaceful, and no enforcement action has been taken, but we are prepared if any crime occurs,” Officer Anthony Carrasco told City News Service. “We are very pleased about how things are going so far.”\n\nBeyond the two large rallies and marches in Downtown San Diego, other events will occur throughout the county:\n\n— Carlsbad, 10 a.m., Carlsbad Boulevard and Pine Avenue;\n\n— Del Mar, 10 a.m., Intersection of Del Mar Heights and Carmel Country roads;\n\n— Chula Vista, 10 a.m., Birch Road and Millenia Avenue;\n\n— Escondido, 10 a.m., Grape Day Park, 321 N Broadway;\n\n— El Cajon, 10 a.m., Magnolia Avenue and Fletcher Parkway;\n\n— Mira Mesa, 11 a.m., 10782 Westview Parkway;\n\n— Rancho Bernardo, 11 a.m., Bernardo Center Drive and Rancho Bernardo Road;\n\n— A kid-friendly rally at 11:15 a.m. at Civita Park in San Diego, 7897 Altana Way;\n\n— Ramona, 3:30 p.m., 1000 Main St.; and\n\n— San Marcos, 4:15 p.m., corner of Grand and West San Marcos Boulevard.\n\n“I am protesting because I am scared about what’s happening in our country,” said Michele Cyr, organizer of the Carlsbad protest. “It’s not a democracy anymore when workers are afraid to go to work, have no job to go to anymore, and our civil liberties are under attack.”\n\nFaith leaders gathered Friday to encourage nonviolent protest.\n\n“People are concerned about immigration in this country and rightfully so,” said Rev. Shane Harris, founder of People’s Association of Justice Advocates. “We believe that people should have the right to express their first amendment perspective but they must do so without violence and in peace, and that’s the message we want to get out to folks.\n\n“The traditions of both Cesar Chavez and Dr. Martin Luther King taught us that non violent movements eventually bring the country together. We don’t want folks to be arrested and prosecuted for violent actions, but instead we want people to express themselves in the streets in a peaceful and anti- violent way. Anarchists are hijackers of a movement and we should all call them out as such.”\n\n“Trump and U.S. Homeland Security officials have defended the immigration raids. The president won election in 2016 and 2024 on a platform of securing the southern border and deporting those in the United States illegally, and officials have said many of those targeted in the raids have long criminal histories.\n\n“The Biden Administration and Governor Newscum flooded America with 21 Million Illegal Aliens, destroying Schools, Hospitals and Communities, and consuming untold Billions of Dollars in Free Welfare. All of them have to go home, as do countless other Illegals and Criminals, who will turn us into a bankrupt Third World Nation,” Trump posted Friday on Truth Social.\n\n“America was invaded and occupied. I am reversing the Invasion. It’s called Remigration. Our courageous ICE Officers, who are daily being subjected to doxxing and murder threats, are HEROES. We will always have their back as they carry out this noble mission. America will be for Americans again!”\n\n— City News Service","summary":"Tens of thousands of San Diego County residents took to the streets Saturday for \"No Kings\" Day, a nationwide protest against the policies of President Donald Trump coinciding with a military parade in the nation's capital.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/06/14/estimated-20000-demonstrators-gather-for-no-kings-protests-in-downtown-sd/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/8B7A6127-scaled.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 18:41:39","author":"City News Service","authors":["City News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.211},{"id":331429966,"title":"Democratic politician assassinated, another wounded in targeted overnight shootings","text":"Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said investigators found a “manifesto” in a vehicle used by the suspect that “identified many lawmakers and other officials”.

But in a political system that remains democratic and is increasingly demotic, that which sounds coarse to you (and me) is apparently acceptable to most people.\n\nAs for his, um, unusual appointments, they may make sense for a president who is less interested in fine-tuning organizations than in affecting the behaviors of mass publics.\n\nCandidate Trump in 2024 promised that he would eliminate shortfalls in military recruitment, which he attributed to the Joe Biden Pentagon’s “woke” policies. He pointed out accurately that the Army and Navy fell short of recruitment goals by as much as 25% in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\n\nHe named Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, saying he’d promote a warfighting ethos that would attract un-woke young men and women to join up. The Army raised its recruiting goal from 55,000 to 61,000 and reached it in May, four months early.\n\nMaybe that’s a coincidence or a response to other factors. But it looks like Trump’s rhetoric made a big difference.\n\nOr look at trade. Trump has made no secret of his love for tariffs and his desire to reduce trade with China. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that China’s exports to the U.S. in May were the lowest since COVID-19-wracked February 2020. It looks like thousands of American and Chinese market participants have made new decisions in response to Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nMeanwhile, the May job numbers in the U.S. increased by a more-than-expected 139,000, despite a 60,000 reduction in federal jobs since January. And despite a drop of foreign-born workers in the labor market estimated between 773,000 and 1 million since March.\n\nThree-quarters of a million to a million—those numbers dwarf the number of annual deportations from the interior of the U.S. as compiled by my Washington Examiner colleague Conn Carroll.\n\nThose range from 65,000 in the last year of the Obama administration and from 28,000 to 47,000 in the four Biden years. They were higher—81,000 to 95,000—in the first three years of Trump I and then fell to 62,000 in COVID-19 year 2020.\n\nThese numbers put in perspective the drama that has been playing out in Los Angeles this past week. The Trump administration cannot expect that it can, logistically, remove all the untold millions of illegal immigrants that whoever was running the Biden administration (no one, including the authors of “Original Sin,” has disclosed just who that was) allowed into the U.S. But splashy raids and deportations can get hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of illegal immigrants thinking about what Mitt Romney in 2012 called “self-deportation.”\n\nWhich is probably happening thanks to what has been happening in Los Angeles these past five days. Demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation activity resulted in the arrest of the head of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nWhen “sanctuary city” Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., let the rioting go on, Trump nationalized the California National Guard and dispatched Marines.\n\nHe plainly had the authority to do so when federal law enforcement is blocked, and as my Washington Examiner colleague Byron York recounts. And the Supreme Court in 2012 made it clear that federal immigration law prevails over countervailing state law.\n\nThere’s no question whose side the public is on. A pre-riot CBS poll showed 54% approving of Trump’s deportation program, and two polls taken this week showed approval: Insider Advantage by 59% to 39%, and the Napolitan News poll by 58% to 36%.\n\nAfter eight years of stark contrast between Trump and Democrats’ policies, as CNN poll analyst Harry Enten points out, most voters give Trump high marks and “believe that Democrats don’t have a clue on the issue of immigration.”\n\nSimilarly, voters who remember Democrats’ insistence and journalists’ assurances that Joe Biden was fully functional are skeptical that the L.A. rioters were “overwhelmingly peaceful” (Kamala Harris) or “largely peaceful” (The New York Times).\n\nThere’s ample historic precedent for Trump’s action as well. Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 and Lyndon Johnson in 1965 sent in federal troops to uphold federal law over the opposition of Democrat governors in Arkansas and Alabama.\n\nThose governors were defying federal law for a cause—preservation of racial segregation—that the vast majority of voters, after a decade of reflection, were determined to reject. Today’s California Democrats are defying federal law for a cause—permanent amnesty for illegal immigrants—which it appears that voters, after a decade of reflection, are bent on rejecting as well.\n\nAs for the illegal immigrants themselves, I’m not aware that anyone has conducted a poll of them, or could, since people in their situation are wary of being interviewed. But as the workforce numbers suggest, for many, self-deportation, together perhaps with the Department of Homeland Security’s $1,000 travel stipend, is looking like a good option. One that may be taken up by many more than are legally deported.\n\nSo how’s Trump doin’?

The surprisingly warm exchange between two longtime political rivals seemed to reflect a new reality: with a vengeful Trump back in the White House, fire-ravaged California – and its Democratic governor – had a great deal at stake.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Newsom met with Trump at the White House to lobby for federal disaster relief, then approved funding to strengthen the state’s legal defenses against challenges from the Trump administration. He invited Maga-world fixtures on to his podcast, including Steve Bannon, and infuriated progressives, and even some allies, when he said that it was “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports – a wedge issue central to Trump’s conservative agenda. All the while, his state was suing the Trump administration – over executive actions on immigration, federal funding and tariffs – at a rate of more than one lawsuit a week.\n\nTheir fragile detente, already showing cracks, shattered spectacularly last week, when the president mobilized thousands of national guard troops and 700 marines – over the governor’s objections – to quell protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration raids across the region.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of deliberately injecting chaos into a situation that local authorities had under control. Trump’s actions, he declared, were “madness” and marked an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism”. Trump, in turn, called Newsom, whom he refers to as “Newscum”, grossly incompetent and suggested the governor should be arrested. “Gavin likes the publicity,” the president mused, though he later played down the threat.\n\nWith guards troops deployed in the streets of Los Angeles, the 57-year-old governor of the country’s most populous state delivered a formal, state-of-the-union-style address warning that the president was taking a “wrecking ball” to American democracy.\n\n“Look, this isn’t just about protests in LA,” Newsom said on Tuesday. “This is about all of us. This is about you.”\n\n“California may be first – but it clearly won’t end here. Other states are next,” he said. “Democracy is next.”\n\nFor months, Democrats, anti-Trump Republicans and a growing number of alarmed Americans had been clamoring for leaders who grasp what they say is the urgency of Trump’s assault on democratic norms and American institutions. When Trump activated California’s national guard troops, Newsom stepped into the ring – and hasn’t stopped swinging since.\n\n“This moment was thrust upon him,” said Mike Madrid, a sharp critic of Trump and former political director of the California Republican party, “and whether it was a battlefield conversion or a genuine moment, Gavin Newsom realized that the only way out of this was to fight.”\n\nIn the week since the national guard’s deployment to Los Angeles, Newsom has mounted an all-out offensive – battling Trump in the courts and in the court of public opinion. He has made himself ubiquitous: sitting for interviews with podcasters and YouTubers, national media and local media. On social media, he and his team are running a rapid response blitz – a stream of taunts, Star Wars memes and factchecks.\n\nNewsom sued to block the guard’s deployment without his consent. California later filed an emergency order asking a judge to bar the guard from assisting with immigration enforcement. On Thursday, a federal judge sided with the state, finding that Trump’s deployment of the guard was unlawful – though the victory was short-lived. Two hours later, the ninth US circuit court of appeals temporarily blocked the order.\n\n“He is not a king and he should stop acting like one,” Newsom said on Thursday, at a press conference before the ruling was paused.\n\nThe White House has responded in kind, with Trump hurling insults back at Newsom. When asked what crime Newsom might be charged with, Trump sniped: “His primary crime is running for governor, because he’s done such a bad job.”\n\nTrump, thanking the appeals court on Friday, said: “If I didn’t send the military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now” – a claim Newsom, city officials and local law enforcement strongly dispute.\n\nTensions escalated further on Thursday, when a senator from California, Alex Padilla, was forcibly removed and handcuffed after trying to ask a question at a press conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, amid the ongoing protests in Los Angeles. Newsom called the episode “outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful”.\n\n“This is a moment that tests the mettle of leaders,” said Brian Brokaw, a longtime political adviser to Newsom. He noted that Newsom’s tenure was defined by crisis from the very start.\n\nThe day after he was elected in 2018, a gunman killed 12 people at a country music bar in Thousand Oaks and as the Camp fire – the deadliest wildfire in state history – raged toward the town of Paradise. Since then, Newsom has faced a near-constant onslaught: more fires, more mass shootings, floods, mudslides, drought, a global pandemic, mass protests after the murder of George Floyd, and the wildfires that swept Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\n“Newsom has pretty good instincts,” Brokaw said. “He knows what a moment like this requires – and that’s what you’re seeing from him now.”\n\nThe rapidly intensifying standoff between Trump and Newsom has rallied Democrats. Twenty-two Democratic governors signed a joint statement in support of California, calling Trump’s troop deployment “ineffective and dangerous”. The signatories spanned the ideological spectrum of the party and included several governors who are potential 2028 presidential contenders, such as JB Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\n\n“He has shown he’s not going to be intimidated, and we’re all for that,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said earlier this week.\n\nEven some of his critics have been impressed. Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, one of the groups behind Saturday’s “day of defiance” protests against Trump, said Newsom’s pugilistic response to the president’s “bullying” has been “spot on”.\n\n“I think he’s been one of the leading members of the ‘roll over and play dead’ faction, one of these dead-dog Democrats,” Levin said. “But maybe – maybe – he is shifting sides, and I think it is very important that we welcome people and leaders when they do that.”\n\nThe White House believes its maximalist response to unrest in California plays to its political advantage. Trump, who campaigned on a promise of mass deportations, has framed California’s resistance as an obstruction to what he says is a popular mandate. Images of protesters waving Mexican flags near burning robotaxis feed the rightwing narrative of disorder in Democratic-run cities such as Los Angeles.\n\n“To be very cynical about this, you can argue that this benefits both principals,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University. “Donald Trump gets to swing at his favorite piñata, California, but Gavin Newsom doesn’t mind taking the whacks because it plays pretty well with the Democratic base.”\n\nAccording to a YouGov flash poll, 45% of Americans disapprove of the Los Angeles protests, while 36% approve. Similar shares disapprove of Trump’s deployment of the marines – 47% to 34% – and the national guard – 45% to 38%.\n\nSince Trump’s 2024 victory, many Democrats have taken pains to show support for law enforcement and border security.\n\nSome say Newsom’s approach offers a clear path forward. He has been unequivocal in condemning sporadic violence, vowing “zero tolerance” for bad actors. At the same time, he has offered a full-throated defense of the city’s immigrant communities, accusing Trump of tearing apart families and “disappearing” neighbors.\n\n“What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before,” Newsom said in his Tuesday address, accusing federal agents of indiscriminately targeting Latino neighborhoods. “Trump is pulling a military dragnet across LA, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent and serious criminals.”\n\nConservatives say Newsom’s posture is precisely what helped Trump make inroads in some of the bluest corners of the country last year. Steve Hilton, a former top adviser to former UK prime minister David Cameron now running for governor of California, accused Newsom of trying to “gaslight us”.\n\n“Do your job,” he said on Fox News, “instead of pretending this is fine.”\n\nNewsom rose to prominence as the mayor of San Francisco, defying state law to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He served as the state’s lieutenant governor for eight years before being elected governor in the middle of Trump’s first term, riding a wave of progressive anger. He survived a 2021 recall attempt, fueled in part by backlash to his handling of the pandemic, and was easily re-elected in 2022. He campaigned aggressively for Biden in 2024, even as some in the party hoped he’d run himself. When Biden dropped out, Newsom quickly endorsed his fellow Californian, “fearless” Kamala Harris.\n\nDemocrats’ staggering losses in November left the party leaderless and without power in Washington. As Democrats grasped for answers – how to oppose an emboldened president whom voters chose over them – Newsom launched a podcast. Some speculated Newsom’s moves – interviewing far-right figures on his podcast, cracking down on homeless encampments and moving to scale back health coverage for immigrants without legal status – were part of a calculated pivot toward the political center, in preparation for a 2028 presidential run.\n\nAsked recently at a press conference if he was trying to shed his liberal persona, Newsom said he had always been a “hard-headed pragmatist”. “I’m not an ideologue,” he added.\n\nCalifornia – the biggest blue state in the country – has long served as Trump’s favorite foil. From homelessness and crime to immigration and climate policy, Trump has painted the state as a cautionary tale – a failed experiment in liberal governance now a “symbol of our nation’s decline”.\n\nThis week, amid his clash with Newsom, Trump signed into law a measure blocking California’s vehicle emissions rules and his administration announced plans to abolish two of the state’s newest national monuments.\n\n“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California,” the governor’s office tweeted.\n\nSteve Maviglio, a Democratic political consultant, said Newsom’s “guerrilla warfare” tactics may raise the governor’s national profile – but at a cost.\n\n“We know that the president doesn’t respond well to being attacked,” Maviglio said, adding: “It’s likely going to result in a lot less federal dollars coming our way – which is about the last thing we need right now with a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.”\n\nYet Newsom’s attempt at conciliation yielded little protection. Earlier this month, the Trump administration warned it may pull billions in funding from California’s long-delayed high-speed rail project. Trump has threatened to “maybe permanently” strip federal funding if the state continues to allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. And California is still waiting for the disaster aid Newsom sought after the fires.\n\nNewsom has argued in recent interviews that Trump can’t be placated. The governor suggested the state had leverage: it could withhold the billions in taxes its residents pay the federal government. (He has since tempered the idea, but said he urged his team to get “creative” on how the state might push back on Trump’s threats.)\n\nNewsom also suggested that growing public opposition to the immigration crackdown was working, after Trump conceded that his immigration tactics were hurting agriculture and hospitality. “Turns out, chasing hardworking people through ranches and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,” Newsom shot back.\n\nThough protests have calmed, the situation remains volatile. With the appeals court decision, Trump remains in command of the national guard through at least next week. On Friday, US marines temporarily detained a man outside the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles – the first known detention of a civilian by active-duty troops deployed there by Trump.\n\nSpeaking in Los Angeles, Noem pledged to “liberate” Los Angeles and vowed that the Trump administration would continue its immigration operations across the region.\n\nAhead of planned protests on Saturday, Newsom ordered the state to “pre-deploy” additional resources to support law enforcement throughout the state. Organized as a show of defiance against Trump’s military parade staged in the streets of Washington DC on Saturday to celebrate the US army’s 250th anniversary and the president’s 79th birthday, the events have multiplied since Trump deployed guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nFor Newsom, the stakes are bigger than California. He has framed this moment as a test of democratic resilience in the face of creeping authoritarianism. And for those who have long sounded the alarm, the governor is meeting it.\n\n“He’s become what Democrats nationally have been waiting for since the election,” Madrid said. “He’s the tip of the spear – the more strenuously he fights, the more aggressive he is, the more he uses Trump’s tactics against him, the more he’s going to be rewarded.”\n\nDavid Smith in Washington and Rachel Leingang contributed reporting","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/moment-thrust-upon-him-gavin-153437821.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/0ef951a150197198b72467ad25548e38","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 15:34:37","author":"Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles","authors":["Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":331409860,"title":"Breaking: US politician dead, another wounded in 'politically motivated' shootings","text":"A US state politician and her husband have been killed, and a state senator and his wife have been wounded, after they were allegedly attacked in their homes by a gunman posing as a police officer.\n\nMelissa Hortman, a member of Minnesota's House of Representatives, and her husband were both killed, state governor Tim Walz said.

But they’ve never faced such a ferocious offensive as they did this week.\n\nBetween the deployment of federal agents to Los Angeles, the gutting of climate standards and the manhandling of the state’s senior U.S. senator, the state absorbed one show of force after another from the president. And in the balance of power between the Trump administration and the nation’s most populous state, California was on the losing end.\n\n“We’re at DEFCON 1 in the conflict between California and the Trump administration,” said Democratic strategist Katie Merrill. “It’s orders of magnitude more than what we’ve seen, ever.”\n\nDemocrats in this deep-blue state have spent years working to shield California from a hostile White House, dating back to his first term. But for them, the week’s events registered a new low — a multifront assault that not only threatened the state’s liberal values, but exposed the limits of California’s ability to control its destiny when the federal government has other ideas.\n\n“The moment we’ve feared,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a Tuesday night address, “has arrived.”\n\nTrump’s focus on California is predictable. The state was a perennial first-term target term that Republicans and conservative media allies have relentlessly portrayed as dysfunctional and lawless. It has produced national Democratic figures, like Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who have eagerly hoisted the anti-Trump banner.\n\nElected officials spent months preparing for a second Trump administration. They studied Project 2025 and set aside money to contest Trump’s agenda in court.\n\nBut the scale and aggressiveness of the onslaught has still stunned them.\n\nThe harrowing stretch for California Democrats began with immigration raids across the Los Angeles area. Then, when protests sprang up, Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the region over Newsom’s objections. He then moved to eliminate California’s vehicle emissions standards as his administration contemplated withholding education dollars over California’s policies on transgender athletes.\n\nBy Thursday, Democrats were watching with outrage a video clip of Padilla being forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security news conference, pulled to the ground and handcuffed. And that night, just hours after a federal judge ordered the president to end his unilateral deployment of the state’s National Guard, an appeals court preserved his ability to do so, at least temporarily.\n\nIt marked a major escalation of the Democratic state’s long-running feud with the president to a new, existential echelon of antagonism.\n\n“Federalizing the National Guard was in the 2025 plan, but we hoped he wouldn’t do something so drastic and dramatic,” said Dana Williamson, who was Newsom’s chief of staff until earlier this year. “He’s pulling the trigger on everything all at once.”\n\nTrump’s decision to enlist the National Guard and Marines in his immigration agenda — and in Los Angeles, a bastion of Latino political power — has made California a globally watched test case for the limits of federal power.\n\nHours before Judge Charles Breyer issued his decision ordering Trump to end his deployment of the Guard, Padilla strode into a press conference to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and was forcibly restrained. Images of a supine Padilla surrounded by federal agents ignited universal Democratic condemnation and came to symbolize the stakes of California’s fight with the federal government.\n\nMany Democrats argued the White House had pushed California to the precipice of authoritarianism. Federal pressure on California’s political luminaries extended beyond Padilla’s confrontation with Noem: Officials detained prominent union leader David Huerta; Sen. Josh Hawley launched an investigation into a Los Angeles-based immigrant advocacy group; and Border czar Tom Homan threatened to arrest anyone, including Newsom, who interfered with federal enforcement.\n\n“This is about an abuse of power. This is about a desire to cross red lines time and time again,” said California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks.\n\n“We see that in other parts of the world,” Hicks added about Padilla. “We don't see that here. If there weren’t enough wakeup calls over the last week, that sure is one.”\n\nPadilla’s treatment drew wall-to-wall coverage. But it was only one squall in the storm engulfing California.\n\nWhile the immigration raids plunged California into a political maelstrom, Newsom and other officials were also bracing against the threat of the Trump administration slashing funding as the president and education Secretary Linda McMahon assailed the state’s policies on trans students. Then there was Trump’s move to override some of California’s signature climate change policies.\n\n“They’re looking to make California the punching bag,” said California Environmental Voters Executive Director Mike Young. “We’re flabbergasted and really disgusted by what’s happening.”\n\nAs a pillar of Democratic politics and the world’s fourth-largest economy, California has long sought to mold a broader economic and political agenda. During Trump’s first term, California passed a “sanctuary” law shielding immigrants and struck an auto emissions deal that Newsom proclaimed as “checkmate” over Trump.\n\nBut it turned out to be just one move in a larger chess match. And Trump is demonstrating that he holds the most powerful pieces: a compliant Republican Congress, a conservative Supreme Court, and above all, federal supremacy over even large, wealthy states.\n\n“The idea that the federal government can bigfoot the state government is coming to the fore,” said Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson. “We are experiencing that, if you have a power struggle between the federal government and the states, chances are pretty high that the federal government wins.”\n\nWhile Newsom notched a victory on Thursday when a judge ordered Trump to relinquish control of the National Guard, it proved short-lived when an appeals court blocked the order for at least a few days, setting a hearing on the matter for Tuesday. The governor has walked back his threat to retaliate against withheld funding by blocking the flow of tax dollars from California to Washington.\n\nRepublicans say the Constitution is squarely on their side, arguing they are rescuing California’s citizens from ruinous immigration and climate policies.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Trump “rightfully stepped in to protect federal law enforcement officers” when Newsom would not. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Trump acted to squelch California’s “costly, unrealistic, and tyrannical” climate policies.\n\n“The goal is to help California,” said GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley, who spearheaded the push to reverse Newsom’s gas car phaseout, “and unfortunately helping California means all too often fighting against or counteracting the politicians who hold power in our state.”\n\nDemocrats say Trump is pushing limits of the law and regularly violating it.\n\n“The lying has become more brazen. The overreach has become more evident,” said Xavier Becerra, the former state attorney general and former health secretary under President Joe Biden. “They've dialed up the severity, the volatility of their actions, they’ve dialed up the intensity of their misrepresentations, but it’s still at the end of the day the same unlawful actions the courts rejected the first time Donald Trump was president.\"\n\nHe said, “This president won’t take no for an answer. He’ll continue to try to do it his way even if it runs counter to the Constitution.”\n\nCalifornia’s current attorney general, Rob Bonta — whose office on Thursday sued to block the environmental rollback and then squared off with Department of Justice attorneys over the National Guard deployment — told reporters he was on pace to bring twice as many legal actions as during the first Trump administration.\n\nThat reaction is of a newly urgent necessity, he suggested.\n\n“The speed and the volume in Trump 2.0 is materially different,” Bonta said. “The shamelessness and brazenness of the violations — they seem more severe.”","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/week-trump-rocked-california-pulling-150000334.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RGy4Pzm_nrCzKfOtJkzY.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/9240ea645529d4d0e3e3e0e60c1301ad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 15:00:00","author":"Jeremy B.

Because that’s why Kamala lost—Republicans have a podcast!” Maher said sarcastically.\n\n“Or you could consider this: Instead of conjuring up a new Joe Rogan, ask yourself why you lost the old one,” Maher said of Rogan, a marijuana-legalization advocate who endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president in 2020.\n\nComedian Tim Dillon, in a recently released CNN interview, also ridiculed the notion that podcasters and comedians had killed the Democrats‘ campaign.\n\n“It’s the craziest narrative ever, and it came off the heels of running one of the most unpopular candidates with a platform that the American people largely rejected,” he said. \n\n“And then everybody got together and said it’s actually these five guys who have podcasts. They’re the most powerful people in the world … and they’re the reason for this electoral defeat, not our unpopular candidate and our candidate who ran on a platform of ‘joy.’”\n\nThe battle for online connection is not likely to end any time soon.\n\nVice President JD Vance made his second appearance on Theo Von’s podcast recently, where he discussed Elon Musk and the “big, beautiful” budget bill under consideration in Congress in a medium that is accessible to average viewers.\n\nDemocrats have also stepped up their online presence during the second Trump administration, with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., being seen as a leader in this effort.\n\nDemocrats are “engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said in March.\n\nSome Democrats’ attempts to gain viral fame have backfired, however, as a “choose your fighter” skit featuring Reps.

The Democratic Minnesota governor made no exception during a Center for American Progress (CAP) event on Friday morning called, \"What’s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward.\" Walz said China might be the voice of \"moral authority\" following Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders. \"Now, who is the voice in the world that can negotiate some type of agreement in this? Who holds the moral authority? Who holds the ability to do that? Because we are not seen as a neutral actor, and we maybe never were,\" Walz said of the U.S.' role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle East. TIM WALZ HOPES IT RAINS ON TRUMP'S MILITARY PARADE: 'I'M JUST GOING TO CONFESS' According to Walz, the U.S. once attempted \"to be somewhat of the arbitrator\" in those negotiations during the Iran Nuclear Deal, but he said Americans must face the reality that the \"neutral actor\" with the \"moral authority\" to lead negotiations in the Middle East \"might be the Chinese.\" TIM WALZ FLOATS CHINA AS 'NEUTRAL ACTOR' WITH 'MORAL AUTHORITY' TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE Walz didn't elaborate on why China would be that world leader. The Minnesota Democrat also admitted he is hoping for rain during President Donald Trump's military parade. \"I have never so hoped for rain in my life,\" Walz said. Trump is hosting a massive Flag Day military parade on Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in the nation’s capital to witness the historic parade, which also coincides with the president's 79th birthday. \"This is not Pyongyang on a Saturday,\" Walz said, referring to the capital of North Korea, which is a communist, totalitarian dictatorship. Walz has joined many Democrats, including those planning to protest on Saturday, in criticizing Trump's military parade by drawing comparisons to China and North Korea's military parades. Trump's military parade on Saturday comes amid escalated conflict in the Middle East, after Israel launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders, and Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory. Walz was ridiculed earlier this year for celebrating Tesla's stock drop as protests raged on, rejecting Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \"On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day — $225 and dropping,\" Walz said at the time. Walz on Friday said that speaking out against Musk and Tesla \"worked\" because it started to hurt the billionaire personally. The Democrat, who rose to the national stage as former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her brief 2024 presidential campaign, criticized Trump along his usual attack lines on Friday. Walz said Trump is \"incompetent at governing,\" and America is in a \"dangerous time\" under Trump's leadership, which he said is \"marching towards authoritarianism\" following the chaotic incident in which authorities forcibly removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., at a Department of Homeland Security press conference on Thursday. The former vice presidential candidate also said he was successful in labeling Trump \"weird\" during the 2024 presidential campaign. \"I thought instead of making him a scary authoritarian wannabe who is incredibly dangerous, which I believe he is, I just thought, what a weird dude doing some of this stuff,\" Walz said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Walz added he \"got a bunch of heat\" for \"inciting violence because I said we should bully the c--- out of Donald Trump.\" Earlier this year, the Minnesota governor said Harris chose him as her running mate, in part, because, \"I could code talk to White guys watching football, fixing their truck\" and \"put them at ease,\" describing himself as the \"permission structure\" for White men from rural America to vote for Democrats. \"I think I'll give you pretty good stuff, but I'll also give you 10% problematic,\" he added. Walz laughed off criticism over inconsistencies in his background on the 2024 campaign trail, describing himself as a \"knucklehead.\"","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Progressives on the ground were voicing concerns about Black male voter turnout long before the 2022 midterms. But because the overturning of Roe vs. Wade enabled Democrats to avoid a “red wave” then, the urgency regarding Black men was muted. That quickly changed once former Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee and media personalities such as Stephen A. Smith and Charlamagne tha God began questioning her qualifications without a hint of irony. In the end, nearly 75% of Black men voted for Harris, and all of those cable news segments about the concerns of that voting bloc went away. That’s unfortunate because in many ways the question at the center of it all — “What will Black men do?” — is more relevant today than it was seven months ago. Since President Trump has retaken office, federal civil rights offices have been gutted, grants for minority business programs canceled and the names of enslavers are making a comeback on military bases. Cable news may be waiting until the next election to talk about the concerns of Black men, but the Black community can’t wait that long. Khalil Thompson and Bakari Sellers agree. The pair are part of the leadership team for Win With Black Men, a political advocacy group that began in 2022. Thompson said he was inspired to start the group by Win With Black Women, which started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Both organizations were key to jump-starting the enthusiasm for Harris, especially financially, with each raising millions of dollars within days of her campaign’s launch. Now, with the election behind us and three years of a hostile White House administration ahead of us, Thompson’s group has announced an 18-city listening tour starting in July to strategize about ways to help the community outside of the political system. The goal is to reach 3,500 Black men in person and another 25,000 through a national survey in hopes of building a database to better serve the community. Thompson said it’s particularly important to keep people engaged now that the election is over because of how the White House continues to test the limits of both presidential power and the support from his party. “There has to be a moment where right is right,” said Thompson, a former operative for President Obama. “We raise our children to understand the basic tenets of being a good person. ... We need to build a system that can adequately accommodate and support the vast majority of people in this country who just want to enjoy this small amount of time we have on this planet. I see the protests happening and the raids and I’m reminded of Ruby Bridges or the lunch counter in Greensboro. What is happening now in our cities — ripping parents away from their children — doesn’t speak to our better angels.” Sellers added: “Democracy is participatory, and a lot of time people forget that. The choices are to be on the sideline or get engaged — either way, you are involved.” He made that choice at a young age, becoming the youngest Black person in elected state office across the country in 2006, as a 22-year-old state representative in South Carolina. His early social justice work echoes that of his father, Cleveland Sellers, who was part of the leadership for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement. “I’d rather get in the fight, be knocked around a little bit, face terror head on, knowing I’m doing it for a just and righteous cause,” Sellers said. Thompson said that in addition to engagement, Win With Black Men is looking to be a vessel for helping people financially with their utility and grocery bills, as the steep federal cuts and job losses threaten to send millions of Americans into poverty. The current fundraising goal is $2.5 million. And while the organization is nonpartisan, Sellers said a prominent Democrat is the unofficial North Star: “We need to get back to the politics of Jesse Jackson. Meet people where they are, focus on the working class and facilitate conversations that uplift people, not demean them.” Few things are more demeaning than feeling like your voice matters only once every four years. If nothing else, this upcoming listening tour is a reminder to Democrats that Black men are more than a vote. @LZGranderson","summary":"The advocacy group Win With Black Men is starting an 18-city listening tour to strategize ways to help the community outside of the political system.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-06-14/win-with-black-men-listening-tour","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b59818/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5410x2840+0+383/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8b%2Ffc%2F7c18111142fbb4e1f40ca0eee635%2Fhttps-delivery-getty","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 10:06:00","author":"Lz Granderson","authors":["Lz Granderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.267},{"id":331303572,"title":"Little boy in this picture became the most famous person on earth","text":"This picture shows a blonde-haired little boy who grew up to become one of the most famous - and divisive - political figures in history, and shows a side to him that the world has rarely ever seen.\n\nWith his golden hair, twinkling eyes and angelic expression, this toddler looks like a regular, unassuming child. \n\nBut in a twist that stunned the internet, this innocent young boy turned out to be none other than US President Donald Trump. \n\nAnd while Trump has been at the forefront of worldwide fame for several years, the rare image of the US leader sparked a storm of reactions from social media users when it first emerged.\n\nWhile some were quick to gush over how 'wonderful' and 'sweet' he was as a toddler, others branded him 'the worst monster there could ever be'. \n\nOne internet user also questioned why he had to 'grow up' when he was an 'innocent little kid'. \n\nAs Trump celebrates his 79th birthday today, the president's baby photo has taken a new meaning. \n\nThe millionaire-turned politician has spent the majority of his life under the spotlight, reinventing himself from real estate mogul to reality TV star, and finally, the president of the United States.\n\nBorn on June 14, 1946 in the New York borough of Queens, Trump was the fourth of five children to property tycoon Fred Trump and wife Mary Anne. \n\nHis mother was Scottish and his father the son of German immigrants. \n\nAfter joining the family business in 1968, the ambitious young Trump quickly made a name for himself and invested in several big real estate projects in New York, including the iconic Trump Tower. \n\nHaving transformed Manhattan's skyline with glitzy skyscrapers, opulent hotels and flashy casinos, his lavish lifestyle and dynamic character turned him into a tabloid sensation throughout the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nAs his real estate empire grew, so did his celebrity status. Trump wrote bestselling book The Art of The Deal in 1987 and became the host for TV show The Apprentice in 2004, which cemented him as a household name. \n\nIn 1988, Forbes estimated his net worth to be around $1billion. \n\nAnd throughout the years, his personal life has been just as headline-grabbing as his business ventures.\n\nTrump married his first wife Ivana in 1977. A glamorous Czech model, she played a significant role in the family business and helped build the Trump brand while the couple raised their three children children together. \n\nBut their 13-year marriage came to an end after it emerged that Trump had been having an affair with model Marla Maples.\n\nAfter Trump's very public split from Ivana, he and Marla welcomed daughter Tiffany in 1993 before going their separate ways. \n\nHe married his third wife, Melania, in 2005, and together the couple had son Barron. \n\nBetter known as a celebrity and businessman, Trump stunned the world when he first won the presidency in 2016, as many did not take his bid for presidency seriously. \n\nBut against all odds, Trump managed to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton and was sworn in as US president. \n\nHe introduced major change during his first term as America's leader. \n\nTightening on immigration, Trump cracked down on travel from Muslim-majority countries and strengthened part of the southern border with Mexico. \n\nHis first term in office ended with bitterness after he made unfounded claims that he lost the election unfairly, which consequently prompted his supporters to violently storm the US capitol. \n\nJust months before the 2024 elections, Trump was convicted in a New York trial for falsifying business records in a case about hush-money payments to silence a porn star before the 2016 election. \n\nBut a judge gave him an unconditional discharge, sparing him jail time or a fine. \n\nTrump also became the subject of a historic assassination attempt after a gunman fired shots at him during a Pennsylvania rally in July 2024. \n\nOne of the bullets grazed his right ear and the shooter was killed by secret service snipers. \n\nImages documented the famed moment, with one photograph showing Trump placing his hand over his bloodied ear. \n\nAnother snap showed him with a raised fist and blood on his face - a moment that was widely shared on social media and praised by his supporters. \n\nFollowing a lengthy and unpredictable election period, Trump was sworn in as America's 47th president in January after he beat his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. \n\nIn his inauguration speech, he promised a new 'golden age' of America and began his second term with a rush of executive orders which included cracking down on immigration.\n\nThis week, Trump has been the subject of widespread protests across the US after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles as part of his crackdown on migrants. \n\nBut as he celebrates his 79th birthday this weekend, there is no denying the little boy in the photograph has left a mark. \n\nFrom building a real estate empire to two stints in the White House, Trump has challenged political norms and defied expectations, making him to many a symbol of reinvention.","summary":"This picture shows a blonde-haired little boy who grew up to become one of the most famous -

It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases. But not with America’s backing,” the Tucker Carlson Network morning newsletter read on Friday.\n\nIt added that a war with Iran could “fuel the next generation of terrorism” or lead to the killing of thousands of Americans in the name of a foreign agenda.\n\n“It goes without saying that neither of those possibilities would be beneficial for the United States,” the newsletter said. “But there is another option: drop Israel. Let them fight their own wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul also cautioned against war with Iran and slammed hawkish neoconservatives in Washington.\n\n“The American people overwhelming[ly] oppose our endless wars, and they voted that way when they voted for Donald Trump in 2024,” Paul wrote in a social media post.\n\n“I urge President Trump to stay the course, keep putting America first, and to not join in any war between other countries.”\n\nRight-wing Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also sent a message suggesting that she opposes the strikes. She has previously cautioned Trump against attacking Iran based on Israeli assertions that Tehran is about to acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\n“I’m praying for peace. Peace,” she wrote on X. “That’s my official position.”\n\nWhile many of Israel’s supporters have cited the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, the government in Tehran has long denied pursuing a nuclear weapon. Trump’s own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, testified in March that the US “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon”.\n\nCharlie Kirk, a key Republican activist and commentator who is a staunch Israel supporter, also voiced scepticism about engaging in a war with Iran.\n\n“I can tell you right now, our MAGA base does not want a war at all whatsoever,” Kirk said on his podcast. “They do not want US involvement. They do not want the United States to be engaged in this.”\n\nIsrael’s attacks\n\nHours before Israel started bombing Iran on Friday — targeting its military bases, nuclear facilities and residential buildings — Trump said that his administration was committed to diplomacy with Tehran.\n\n“ Look, it’s very simple. Not complicated. Iran can not have a nuclear weapon. Other than that, I want them to be successful. We’ll help them be successful,” Trump said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nA sixth round of denuclearisation talks between US and Iranian officials was set to be held in Oman on Sunday.\n\nNevertheless, on Friday, Trump told reporters he had known about Israel’s attacks in advance. He did not indicate he had vetoed the bombing campaign, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio did describe Israel’s actions as “unilateral”.\n\nInstead, Trump put the onus for the attacks on Iran, saying its officials should have heeded his calls to reach a deal to dismantle the country’s nuclear programme.\n\n“I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come,” Trump wrote in a social media post.\n\nParsi said that, at the outset, Trump wanted to reach a deal with Iran, but his demands for Tehran to end uranium enrichment led to a deadlock in the talks.\n\n“Instead of pursuing the negotiations in a reasonable way, he adopted the zero enrichment goal, which predictably would lead to an impasse, which predictably the Israelis used to push him towards military strikes and escalation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nParsi added that he believed Trump engaged in deception over the past week by pushing diplomacy while knowing that the Israeli strikes were coming.\n\n“Trump deliberately made statements in favour of diplomacy, in favour of not having Israel attack, leading everyone to think that, if there is an attack, it would happen after the six rounds of talks on Sunday,” he said. “Instead, it happened sooner.”\n\nThe ‘America First’ base\n\nWhile the Israeli strikes garnered some criticism in Congress, many Republicans and Democrats cheered them on.\n\nBut a key part of Trump’s base has been a segment of the right wing that questions the US’s unconditional support for Israel.\n\n“They really are representative of a solid constituency within the Republican Party, especially if you look at younger individuals,” said Jon Hoffman, research fellow in defence and foreign policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nHoffman pointed to a recent Pew Research Center survey that suggested 50 percent of Republicans under the age of 50 have an unfavourable view of Israel.\n\n“Among the electorate itself, the American people are sick and tired of these endless wars,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nForeign policy hawks who favour military interventions dominated the Republican Party during the presidency of George W Bush, who launched the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nBut those two conflicts proved to be disastrous. Thousands of US soldiers were killed, and many more were left with lasting physical and psychological scars. Critics also questioned whether the wars advanced US interests in the region — or set them back.\n\nThe nation-building project in Iraq, for instance, saw the rise of a government friendly to Iran and the emergence of groups deemed to be a threat to global security, including ISIL (ISIS).\n\nIn Afghanistan, meanwhile, the Taliban returned to power in 2021, almost exactly two decades after the group was ousted by US forces. The US-backed Afghan government quickly crumbled as American troops withdrew from the country.\n\nDuring his campaign for re-election in 2024, Trump tapped into the anger that the two conflicts generated. On multiple occasions, he sketched an alternative timeline where, if he had been president, the collapse of the Afghan government would have never occurred.\n\n“We wouldn’t have had that horrible situation in Afghanistan, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,” Trump said at one October 2024 rally in Detroit.\n\nThe US president also slammed his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris for her alliance with Dick Cheney, who served as Bush’s vice president, and his daughter Liz Cheney, criticising them as “war hawks”.\n\n“Kamala is campaigning with Muslim-hating warmonger, Liz Cheney, who wants to invade practically every Muslim country on the planet,” Trump told another crowd in Novi, Michigan. He added that Dick Cheney “was responsible for invading the Middle East” and “killing millions”.\n\nBut critics say Trump’s posture towards the Israeli strikes in Iran risks embroiling him in his own Middle East conflict.\n\nHoffman, for instance, pointed to the closeness of the US-Israel relationship and the persistence of officials within the Republican Party who have been pushing for conflict with Iran for decades, like Senator Lindsey Graham.\n\n“There is a tremendous risk of the United States being dragged into this war,” Hoffman said.","summary":"Key right-wing figures, including some Trump allies, question the Israeli strikes and warn against a US war with Iran.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/14/drop-israel-how-military-escalation-with-iran-divides-trumps?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-24T064216Z_709110090_RC2T6AAK6TIE_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-1729799828.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 03:29:43","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.053},{"id":331229064,"title":"Nancy Mace blasts Tim Walz after he fails to define what a woman is","text":"Minnesota Gov.

Mace peppered Walz with questions about comparing immigration officials to the Gestapo, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, his time in China in the late 1980s, his time in the military, school shooters and other topics. Walz paused to gather himself before responding. GOP LEADERSHIP UNLEASHES FURY ON DEM GOVERNOR AHEAD OF BLOCKBUSTER CONGRESSIONAL HEARING \"I'm not sure I understand the question here,\" Walz told Mace. \"What do you want me to say?\" Mace then ripped into Walz. \"I want you to say that a woman like me is an adult human female. That men can't become women,\" Mace shot back. \"You guys are the party of violence, and you're the party erasing women. You don't respect us. You're a bigot. You're a misogynist. You're a sexist.

As Paramount struggles to complete a key merger, the company is in the midst of a protracted negotiation to extend one of its biggest and most important franchises: the long-running, foulmouthed cartoon \"South Park.\" Paramount's $900-million overall deal with \"South Park\" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker doesn't expire for another two years. New episodes run first on Paramount's basic cable network Comedy Central. But efforts to renew that venture and bring the show to the Paramount+ streaming service have hit a major snag, according to three people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly. The situation highlights deep tensions and disagreements as a trio of executives try to manage Paramount until the company's sale to David Ellison's Skydance Media, which has the right to approve or deny large deals such as the \"South Park\" pact under covenants made with Paramount. Paramount leaders are desperate to lock down \"South Park\" streaming rights in the U.S. and abroad. They've long been frustrated by a licensing arrangement made six years ago by the previous regime that sent the show to rival HBO Max, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. That deal expires this month. \"South Park\" is one of Paramount's most important series. Along with \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\" the four boys and their celebrity-skewering ways put Comedy Central on the map for basic cable viewers, taking on hot-button issues including Scientology, the War on Terror, the royal family and the Trump administration. During a May earnings call, Paramount co-Chief Executive Chris McCarthy — who runs Paramount's media networks as well as Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios — told investors that \"South Park\" episodes would begin streaming on Paramount+ in July. However, Paramount hasn't nailed down the streaming rights to \"South Park,\" according to the three people familiar with the conversations. Since earlier this year, Paramount has made at least one offer to Parker and Stone as an early extension of their overall deal. The company also wants to secure rights to stream the 333 episodes of \"South Park\" on Paramount+. Some of the knowledgeable people expect \"South Park\" distribution fees to be valued at more than $200 million a year. But Skydance hasn't signed off, believing the deals to be too rich, according to the sources. Paramount executives believe the show is worth the big bucks, given the show's enduring popularity and legacy. Representatives for Paramount and Skydance declined to comment. Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, whose firm WME represents Parker and Stone, defended Paramount and Skydance's handling of the situation on Friday by phone. \"Nobody has rejected anything. They are just doing their analysis,\" Emanuel told The Times in a brief interview. \"We've got offers from other distributors. Everybody wants this show.\" Skydance's $8-billion takeover of Paramount has been in a holding pattern for months as the two companies wait for federal regulators' approval. Skydance, backed by tech mogul Larry Ellison and RedBird Capital Partners, is eager to take over the storied media company. They intend to bring increased financial rigor to Paramount's operations, other sources have said. Paramount and Skydance have told Wall Street the deal will bring $2 billion in cost savings, with half of that coming in the first year. Deadlines are looming. The new season, the program's 27th, is scheduled to debut July 9 on Comedy Central. Unless Paramount strikes a deal with the creators by June 23, the company risks losing the franchise's streaming rights because Parker and Stone could shop the show to other interested streamers, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Hulu. However, sources cautioned that negotiations could go past the June deadline and that the parties expect a deal to get done. Represented by their longtime attorney Kevin Morris, who is leading the current negotiations, the duo carved out the internet rights nearly two decades ago. They formed a joint venture with Paramount (then known as Viacom) called South Park Digital Studios. That decision proved highly lucrative for Parker and Stone, also known for the hit Broadway musical \"The Book of Mormon.\" Paramount runs the joint venture with Stone and Parker, sharing control of the streaming rights to the show that launched in 1997 on Comedy Central, although the duo can veto streaming deals they find unfavorable. Companies are typically not supposed to wade too deeply into another firm's affairs. Federal antitrust laws prohibit so-called gun-jumping, when an acquiring company begins calling the shots before a deal's official closure. But Paramount agreed to accept Skydance's input on big-ticket expenditures while the two sides wait for the deal to close. The \"South Park\" streaming rights negotiations also have been complicated by a lawsuit brought two years ago by Warner Bros. Discovery. That company accused Paramount of violating terms of its 2019 licensing pact for \"South Park,\" after Warner paid about $540 million for the show's streaming rights. Paramount and the \"South Park\" creators developed specials featuring the four animated boys in a fictional Colorado mountain town to stream exclusively on Paramount+. Warner argued the move violated its licensing deal. HBO Max declined to comment. Two years after the HBO Max deal, Paramount struck a new accord with Parker and Stone for $900 million, sealing their partnership and ensuring new episodes of \"South Park\" would be made. That deal runs to 2027, although Paramount executives have offered to extend that arrangement for several years. Paramount has long intended to shift the show to Paramount+ as soon as the HBO Max deal expires. The various parties have long envisioned a scenario where domestic and international rights would be shared by at least two different streaming services. Although neither partner would have exclusive rights, the current trend in television is for studios to maximize revenue to help pay for expensive programs, like \"South Park,\" while maintaining some streaming rights. Paramount also has been dealing with another crisis that has been complicated by the Skydance merger. The company has sought to settle President Trump's $20-billion lawsuit claiming subsidiary CBS News deceptively edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, an allegation CBS denies. Trump's case hasn't been resolved, and the Federal Communications Commission has been slow to review Skydance's proposed takeover of Paramount, extending the deal review. The Skydance transaction has been pending at the FCC since last fall, leaving Paramount executives in limbo.","summary":"Paramount wants to secure the rights to stream 'South Park,' but the deal still hasn't come to fruition as the Skydance deal is still in limbo.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-06-13/south-park-to-paramount","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a979982/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+348/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2Fdf%2F5574648a43aca6c783b02944972b%2Fsouth-park-group-phot","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:05:35","author":"Matt Hamilton,Meg James,Ryan Faughnder","authors":["Matt Hamilton","Meg James","Ryan Faughnder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.015},{"id":331344142,"title":"Alex Cooper’s alma mater responds after she accuses college soccer coach of sexual harassment","text":"Days after Alex Cooper accused her former college soccer coach of sexual harassment, Boston University has responded. The host of the popular “Call Her Daddy” podcast, who made the allegations in a two-part Hulu documentary that premiered Tuesday after screening Sunday at the Tribeca Film Festival, played Division I soccer at the university for three years, during which time Cooper claims coach Nancy Feldman made inappropriate comments about her body and sex life, engaged in controlling behavior and touched her thigh. “Nancy Feldman was someone I trusted. Someone I believed in. Someone who was supposed to help me grow. Someone who was supposed to protect me,” Cooper wrote Thursday on Instagram. “But instead she made my life a living hell and abused her power over me.” In the same post, Cooper said she reported the abuse to athletic director Drew Marrochello, who she said ignored her complaints. The university addressed the allegations in a statement obtained Thursday by People and other news outlets. “Boston University has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. We have a robust system of resources, support and staff dedicated to student wellbeing and a thorough reporting process through our Equal Opportunity Office,” the statement reads. “We encourage members of our community to report any concerns, and we remain committed to fostering a safe and secure campus environment for all.” In an interview with the Boston Globe, Cooper claimed that when she and other teammates contracted mononucleosis, also known as the \"kissing disease,\" she was the only one Feldman called into her office to ask who she had been with. According to Cooper, she pleaded for then-assistant coach Casey Brown to help her, but Brown did nothing. In a statement to the Globe, Brown said she had \"no recollection\" of the event. “But let me be absolutely clear: I would never ignore, dismiss or turn away from anyone — a player, a teammate, a friend, a family member — who sought my help in any capacity,\" Brown told the Globe. \"As a coach, I understood the weight of my responsibility to protect my players and act accordingly. The suggestion that I would do otherwise is completely false.” While Cooper’s documentary began as a way to show behind-the-scenes footage of her 2023 Unwell Tour, a visit to Boston University — specifically the soccer field — brought her emotions back to the surface, she said in Tuesday's brief episode of \"Call Her Daddy\" titled “My College Soccer Trauma.” “The minute I stepped on that field, I felt so small,” Cooper said. “I felt like I was 18 years old again, completely powerless, with no voice.” Cooper said \"everything changed\" when she discovered that other women had alleged similar experiences with Feldman. She decided that she needed to come forward after talking to one of the women. “If a woman in my position, who has power and a platform, is still fearful, is still scared of speaking out about my own lived experience of sexual harassment, how the hell will any other woman feel safe and confident to come forward?” Cooper asked in the episode. Since “Call Her Alex” premiered, TikTok user @sizzlinghotsarah shared her own experience with Feldman, alleging that the soccer coach harassed her for her sexuality. Cooper responded to the post, “I’m sick I’m so sorry she did this to you. Reaching out to u privately.” Feldman retired in 2022, but Cooper claims the harassment continues under her successor. “Call Her Alex” also traces her journey to becoming one of the top podcasters in the world. Featured in the documentary are Cooper's former co-host Sofia Franklyn, husband Matt Kaplan, lifelong friend Lauren McMullen, who is an executive producer on the podcast, and Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports — the previous home of \"Call Her Daddy.\" Cooper has become known for her revelatory interviews with everyone from Hailey Bieber and Paris Hilton to Monica Lewinsky and Jane Goodall. Last year, Cooper sat down with then-Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris — chronicled in the documentary. Cooper created her own podcast network, Unwell, in 2023 and has hired emerging talent including Madeline Argy, Owen Thiele and Alix Earle, who abruptly left in February. In August 2024, Cooper signed a $125-million deal with SiriusXM.","summary":"Boston University has responded to Alex Cooper's claims that she was sexually harassed by former soccer coach Nancy Feldman.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-13/alex-cooper-sexual-harassment-coach-boston-university-documentary-call-her-alex","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e64a8e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2546x1337+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F4e%2Fb67eb83142f2bf05f1c8b700a8b1%2Fgettyimages-2219234252","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 23:02:36","author":"Lauren Harvey","authors":["Lauren Harvey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":331213436,"title":"Letters: South Bay ICE raids are targeting hard-working people","text":"ICE raids are targeting\nhard-working people\n\nOur long-time family gardener reported that he would miss a scheduled service today because he stopped for food at the In-N-Out Burger near Tully and Capitol, where he was confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who asked for his passport.

They were divided into 35 separate documents detailing all the eligible entries in 107 categories, totaling 846 pages of everyone who’s eligible.\n\n(Not all categories are included in the posted ballots, because some use judging panels or other methods of choosing nominees.) \n\nWe’ve looked through all of those pages and learned a few things. So here’s an overview of Emmy nomination voting in 2025, which will last through Monday, June 23.\n\nThere are fewer entries than there were in 2024\n\nLast year was a rough one for the Emmys, with the effects of the pandemic and the actors and writers strikes reducing the number of shows that made it on the air and cutting the number of entries in the vast majority of categories, sometimes by as much as 40%. But rather than rebounding to pre-strike levels, this year’s field is also down, though not nearly as much.\n\nOf the 106 categories for which a year-by-year comparison is possible, 44 have more entries this year than they did last year; six have the name number of entries; and 56 have fewer entries. Overall, the number of submissions in all categories is down – but only slightly, with a total drop of 142 entries spread out across all of the categories.\n\nLimited series had an off year\n\nIn the program categories, Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series took the biggest hit. Only 33 series qualified, 16 fewer than last year’s total and 28 fewer than the 61 eligible titles only two years ago. That led to the three biggest drops in the acting categories, which all took place in the limited series/TV movie categories: lead actor fell by 22, supporting actor by 37 and supporting actress by 32.\n\nSomething similar happened up and down the ballot: In every category devoted to limited series and TV movies, both above and below the line, this year saw a significant drop, almost always in double digits.\n\nBut we’ll have more nominees this year\n\nApart from the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories, which are set at eight nominees each, the number of nominees in each category is determined by how many submissions are made in that category. If it’s 20 to 80, the category gets five nominees; 81 to 160 gets six; 161 to 240 gets seven; anything over 240 gets eight. \n\nAnd despite the overall drop in submissions, more categories appear to be in line to go up in size than to go down this year.\n\nIn the acting races, for example, lead actor in a drama series should drop from six nominees last year to five this year, and supporting actor in a limited series should drop from seven to six. But supporting actor in a comedy should go up from six to seven, guest actor in a drama should go up from five to six (with guest actress following because the rules dictate actor/actress equity) and performer in a short-form series should go up from three nominees last year to five this year.\n\nOverall, eight categories are in line to grow in size compared to last year; only six are in line to go down. \n\nCategory hogging in the acting categories is quite possible this year\n\nFor years, a small number of shows have grabbed a large number of acting nominations. “The White Lotus” is a prime example, dominating the supporting categories in its first two seasons by getting eight noms in its first year and nine in its second. “The Morning Show” got seven acting noms of its own last year, while “Succession” set a record with 14 acting nominations in 2022 and then tied it in 2023.\n\nCould it happen again this year? The Emmy ballots suggest it’s possible, starting with the roster of candidates from “The White Lotus.” A full 20 of the actors from Mike White’s show were submitted, from favorites like Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, Carrie Coon and Aimee Lou Wood to lesser-known contenders like Nicholas Duvernay, Lalisa Manobal and Charlotte Le Bon. Nine men and 10 women are entered in the supporting actor and actress category, while Scott Glenn is the sole cast member entered in a guest category.\n\nBut while “Lotus” has had the greatest success among this year’s contenders in racking up multiple nominations in the past, it’s not the show with the most acting entries this year. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s “The Studio” has 22 entries, which include cast members along with 12 movie-industry figures who are submitted for playing themselves, or at least versions of themselves: Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Ron Howard (also up for playing himself in “Only Murders in the Building”), Zoe Kravitz, Greta Lee, Anthony Mackie, Sarah Polley, Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Stoller, Olivia Wilde, Ramy Youssef and, most surprisingly, journalist Matt Belloni.\n\nOther shows with lots of acting submissions include “Abbott Elementary” with 12, “Hacks” with 13, “The Pitt” with 17 and “Severance” with 19. But they’re all slackers compared to our next item.\n\n“Saturday Night Live” went all out\n\n“SNL” celebrated its 50th season by submitting an astonishing 43 different actors to the Emmys. You’d think they could have gone for an even 50 to match the number of seasons – but there really wasn’t anybody left to enter. The “SNL” submissions included every one of the season’s 14 “repertory players,” all three of its “featured players,” five celebrity guests (Dana Carvey as Joe Biden, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Mike Myers as Elon Musk, Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff and Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris), and every single one of the season’s 20 hosts, from Jean Smart to Scarlett Johansson. Plus, Darrell Hammond was submitted for narrating the series’ anniversary special.\n\nAs fine as the anniversary spirit is, though, voters have been cooling on the show’s performers in recent years. After “SNL” averaged almost eight acting nominations a year from 2015 through 2021, it has averaged only three in the past three years. The only cast members to be nominated in that time have been Kate McKinnon once and Bowen Yang twice, plus nods for hosts Quinta Brunson, Jerrod Carmichael, Ryan Gosling, Pedro Pascal, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig.\n\nThe choreography category has the ultimate category-hogger\n\nThere are 34 entries in the Outstanding Choreography for Variety or Reality Programming categories. They come from shows that include Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show, “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the Grammys and the Oscars and “Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2024,” with 18 different programs supplying 18 of the nominees.\n\nAnd then there’s “Dancing With the Stars,” which submitted the other 16 entries in the category. No other category has this kind of imbalance, with 47% of the entries coming from one program. But it’s worth noting that while “DWTS” has received 23 Emmy nominations for choreography and won five times (placing it a distant second to the 43 noms and 12 wins for “So You Think You Can Dance”), it hasn’t had more than one nomination in the category since 2021, and the only time it has had more than two was in its first year in the competition, 2006. \n\nSome shows are worried about vote-splitting. Others, not so much\n\nIn the directing and writing categories, “How many episodes should we submit?” has long been a thorny question. If you enter multiple episodes, are you increasing your chance of being nominated or are you making it easier to split the vote and lose out entirely? Pundits tend to favor the latter theory, though it’s not hard to find examples of a popular show landing multiple nominations: “The Bear” did it last year for directing and “Shogun” did it for writing.\n\nThis year, many of the top contenders stop with one or two entries in those categories, though it’s fairly common to go up to three submissions in directing. In comedy directing, “Abbott Elementary,” “Agatha All Along,” “The Bear,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “Runing Point” and “Somebody Somewhere” are among the programs that entered a trio of episodes for directing, while “Poker Face” and “Shrinking” were the only two shows to enter four episodes.\n\nDrama directing, though, was a different matter. Seventeen shows entered at least three episodes, with “The Pitt,” “Paradise” and “Severance” stopping at three but others going much farther. “The Boys” and “House of the Dragon” submitted five, “Will Trent” did six (including one directed by Howie Deutch and one directed by his wife, Lea Thompson), “Yellowstone” did seven and Ryan Murphy’s medical drama “Doctor Odyssey” submitted 11, one for each of its first season directors.\n\nWriting submissions were more modest, with the “Star Wars” spinoff series “The Acolyte” submitting eight episodes and the comedy series “The Conners” and “Poker Face” submitting five. Among the shows that stuck with a single entry were the comedies “Abbott Elementary,” “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Righteous Gemstones” and “The Studio” and the dramas “The Last of Us,” “Matlock,” “Severance,” “Slow Horses” and “The White Lotus.”\n\nAnd yes, “Lotus” submitted the episode with Sam Rockwell’s monologue.","summary":"Submissions are down but nominations will be up, and \"Saturday Night Live\" put EVERYBODY on the ballot\n\n\nThe post What I Learned Reading the 846 Pages of Emmy Ballots appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/emmy-ballots-2025-takeaways-submissions/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Emmy-nominating-ballots.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 22:37:41","author":"Steve Pond","authors":["Steve Pond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.006},{"id":331262864,"title":"'Appealing to the racist side of America': Trump voter calls out his 'cruel' policies","text":"President Donald Trump's heavy-handed response to largely peaceful protests in Los Angeles, California has alarmed many Americans — including some voters who supported him in 2024.\n\nThat's according to a Friday article in the New York Times, which featured quotes from several different voters across the U.S. about how they felt Trump was handling the demonstrations.

It wasn’t pretty.\n\n“Oh my God,” he said slowly and softly, his mouth agape as the stream played out on the monitor in front of him.\n\nOn the screen: A United States senator, the first Latino from California in that role, the one raised by immigrant parents in this very part of L.A. — the community of Pacoima — was being forced to the floor by federal agents and then handcuffed.\n\nJust moments before, on that very monitor, he’d been watching an app that reports to show where Immigration and Customs Enforcement stops were happening across the country.\n\nHe scooted the monitor over to show a reporter how on this Thursday afternoon — just hours after Padilla went to the mat — the raids Padilla was protesting were highly concentrated in L.A.\n\nIn fact, one of the multitude of blips on the screen, just down the street, was near a Target store in the heart of Pacoima.\n\nA week after amped-up immigration sweeps began in earnest in L.A., the widely seen incident at U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristy Noem’s press conference at the Federal Building in Westwood on Thursday was rippling into Padilla’s own L.A. hometown. The only thing overshadowing it, perhaps, was fear of ICE raids.\n\nThis is Padilla country, the place he often touts as the starting point to his journey to the U.S. Senate, and now ultimately at the forefront of the region’s clash with the Trump Administration over its immigration raids in the region.\n\nIt’s here, where in one of the oldest neighborhoods in the northern San Fernando Valley, a stretch along Van Nuys Boulevard over the years morphed into the “Mural Mile,” richly adorned with 50 murals representing Pacoima’s cultures in a three-mile radius. This is the town, after all, that was the birthplace of rock legend Ritchie Valens. There’s a mural. And then there’s the fierce stare of Danny Trejo as you head north on the boulevard. Yes. A mural.\n\nThere’s the barbershop, the community center, the panaderia, the street vendors… . It’s a town that makes no bones about its deep immigrant roots.\n\nAnd it’s a community where Padilla, 52, began his ascent in L.A., state and ultimately national politics.\n\nIt was an unlikely ascent at that — but one many, including himself, define as the culmination of an immigrant family’s journey to the American Dream.\n\nFrom Prop. 187 to a ICE raids\n\nLocal allies and many constituents have long known Padilla’s origin story: A Pacoima kid and San Fernando High School graduate who watched his father carve out a living as a dishwasher and short-order cook in the San Fernando Valley and whose mom cleaned houses in nearby affluent Sherman Oaks.\n\nFrom such humble origins, the tall Padilla, whose first love was baseball but with a penchant for math and science, found his way to MIT, where he studied mechanical engineering. Still, he was from blue-collar Pacoima, long a hub for L.A.’s Latinos going back generations, and it fueled a sensitivity to inequities in health, education, and in the workplace.\n\nThe politics of late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A. was the catalyst into public service for a young Padilla and many of his contemporaries from L.A.’s growing Latino base of the time.\n\nThose politics were defined much in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant fervor. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, healthcare, and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down on equal protection grounds, but the fervor propelled Padilla into public service. He would join protests against Prop. 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nBy 1999, at age 26, he’d be elected to the L.A. City Council, becoming the body’s first Latino president, and its youngest. By 2006, voters gave him the nod for the state Senate.\n\nThe rest is more modern history, which aligns with the Gavin Newsom era on the state level and the Trump and Biden eras on the national scene.\n\nAt 47, Newsom appointed him to fill the vacancy created by the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, and the next year, 2022, he won election to the seat.\n\nFull Circle fray\n\nAnd then this week, it all came full circle for Padilla, with shades of the Prop. 187 fervor that got him into politics in the first place.\n\nIn a June 10 tweet, he said as much, comparing now to then: “It was the anti-immigrant rhetoric of Prop. 187 in 1994 that first launched me into politics,” he wrote. “Now, we are witnessing the same level of xenophobia from the White House, and it is fueling a level of extremism, cruelty and disregard for due process that has no place in our country.”\n\nBut in contrast to the 1990s, he’s now the senior senator from California, a state in a protracted standoff over the legality of the administration federalizing the state’s National Guard and sending in Marines to what White House officials say is an effort to bring order back to the area.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in her new conference that “We are not going away” moments before the senator was forcibly removed.\n\nVideo shows a Secret Service agent on Noem’s security detail grabbing the California senator by his jacket and shoving him from the room as he tried to speak up during the DHS secretary’s event. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem delivered a particularly pointed line, saying federal authorities were not going away but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he shouted in a halting voice.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.”\n\nThe rough treatment of Padilla was widely condemned, including by Newsom, who called it “outrageous, dictatorial and shameful,” and by Mayor Karen Bass, who labeled it “absolutely abhorrent and outrageous.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said Padilla should be charged, because although Padilla verbally identified himself as a senator, he was not wearing the pin that identifies lawmakers from civilians.\n\nIn Pacoima on Thursday, not everyone was thinking about Padilla. Some didn’t even know about what happened.\n\nSome residents knew Padilla from signs they’d see around town with his name. Others weren’t yet even born when he became the L.A. City Council’s first Latino president in 2001.\n\nThere were more pressing concerns. Raids. Business owners said they’d seen ICE vehicles driving along Van Nuys Boulevard. They worry about the drop in customers, who are staying away out of fear of being picked up by federal agents.\n\nCindy, who declined to give her last name out of concern amid the raids, wondered: “If a person in such a high position, if they can do this, what do they expect for us?”\n\nCindy runs a party supply business in town and said her shop had been hit hard over the recent days. Customers have been canceling or reducing orders during the normally busy graduation season. People don’t want to make a spectacle out of fear it might attract federal agents, she said.\n\nLike many L.A. County cities, where immigrants have made livings cooking, serving, gardening, building, retailing, cleaning, many in Padilla’s hometown are staying home. An enterprising spirit has been replaced with fear of being detained, or worse.\n\nCindy said her business has seen an abrupt dip in sales as the raids grip L.A. She ran through some of the numbers over the last couple of weeks: Six cancellations, two reduced orders. In a festive season she relies on, customers have turned away.\n\n“The vendors are just not working that much,” she lamented. Those vendors are also her customers. So when they stay home, out of fear, they cut back. And then there’s the customers who are downsizing because they don’t want to make too much of spectacle – to be too noticed, she said, adding she’s been told this directly by her clients.\n\n“Everybody’s gone,” said Reynoso, concerned about the lack of business at the small shop in recent days since the ICE sweeps began.\n\nAfter hearing about Padilla and a reported ICE arrest nearby, Clarissa Sacedo, her cousins and a neighbor ventured out to the corner of Osborne Street and Lauren Canyon Boulevard.\n\nWaving a Mexican flag, they marched at the intersection, attracting drivers and others who would listen that “we belong here,” not ICE. Honks of support echoed.\n\nA lone vendor on Laurel Canyon mused on how a street once “stacked” with vendors is now pretty much empty of them.\n\nIn March 2021, Padilla gave his first speech on the Senate floor, to introduce himself to his fellow senators, in his first appointed term. His voice cracked, much like it did this week when describing the situation at the press conference. He held back tears. He took his place at the lectern: “My name is Alex Padilla y soy el hijo de Santos y Lupe Padilla…”\n\nHis speech was framed by his now-familiar backstory: The middle son of Mexican immigrants who settled their family in Pacoima.\n\nThe new senator flashed back to his roots. He reflected on his mother, a housekeeper, and his father, a short-order cook.\n\n“It seemed liked she never took a day off, ” he said.\n\n“Think about that. In one generation our family has gone from being immigrant cooks and house cleaners to serving in the United States Senate,” he said.\n\n“That’s the California Dream. That’s the American Dream.”","summary":"Now the senior U.S. senator from California, Alex Padilla's career in public service started amid intense fervor over immigration in the early 1990s.

They also asked that Paramount and CBS’ response to a motion to compel from Trump be due July 28.\n\n“The Parties are not seeking to extend any deadlines regarding the pending motions to dismiss, and Defendants intend to file their reply on or before June 23, 2025. Nor are the Parties seeking to extend any other deadlines in the Court’s Scheduling Order,” the filing adds. “Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with counsel for Defendants, and all Parties have consented to this motion in writing.”\n\nTrump’s lawsuit takes aim at an Oct. 7 “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he has claimed was deceptively edited to make her look good. \n\nIn a legal filing last month asking the court to deny Paramount’s motion to dismiss the suit, Trump alleged the Harris interview caused him “mental anguish and confusion” and that its “false advertising and tampering” withheld viewers’ attention from him and his social media platform Truth Social, resulting in a decrease in value for Trump Media and Technology Group and his other media holdings.\n\nCBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing were false, explaining that the promo shown on “Face the Nation” used a longer section of Harris’ answer. It also turned over the transcript and camera footage from the interview to the FCC as part of the agency’s investigation into allegations of “news distortion.” In a March filing to dismiss the Trump suit, CBS called it “an affront to the First Amendment” and “without basis in law or fact.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.\n\nThe high stakes legal battle comes as Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media awaits regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of the media giant’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations. \n\nThe deal, which executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nDemocratic Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden issued a warning to Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone last month that reaching a settlement in exchange for regulatory approval could violate federal anti-bribery laws. The California State Senate has also launched an investigation into the matter and invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion” related to the Harris interview, including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard.\n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.","summary":"The president's team asked the Texas federal court to delay the deadlines for the media giant's motion to compel and his response to that motion to June 30 and July 7, respectively\n\n\nThe post  Trump Lawyers Ask to Extend Deadlines in $20 Billion CBS Lawsuit, Citing &#8216;Active Settlement Discussions&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-cbs-lawsuit-deadline-extension-request-settlement-discussions/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Shari-Redstone.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 21:37:41","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":331197006,"title":"Trump’s plans to be a ‘peace’ president appear to have gone up in flames","text":"President Donald Trump tore into Tehran and stated his support for Israel Friday morning after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched aerial bombardments against Iranian nuclear sites hours earlier and took out some of Iran’s military commanders and nuclear scientists in the process. \n\nSpecifically, Trump chided Iran for not complying with his desire for a “deal” on its nuclear program. \n\nEarlier in the morning, he told Fox News that the United States would assist Israel. \n\n“I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done,” he posted on Truth Social. “I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.” \n\nIt marked a striking change in tone for the White House from just the night before, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio had issued a statement clearly emphasizing that Israel had acted unilaterally. Just hours before the strike, Trump still seemed to signal a willingness to make a deal even while acknowledging Israel could strike.\n\n“We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran,” he said. “They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nThe flare-up between Israel and Iran is just the latest escalation that Trump has overseen. While Trump has always had an anti-interventionist streak, he has attempted more vocally during his 2024 campaign and his subsequent return to the White House to reduce America’s role in foreign conflicts and wind down conflicts that began before his second term. \n\nEarlier this week, Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican in the older model of the word and an ardent supporter of Ukraine, asked Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth whether Ukraine or Russia was the aggressor in the war. In response, Hegseth said Russia was, but when McConnell asked which side Hegseth wanted to win, Hegseth said “this President is committed to peace in that conflict.”\n\nThat reflected Trump’s larger avoidance of outright support for Ukraine. During his one debate with Kamala Harris, he said he wanted the war to end but not whether he wanted Ukraine to win. Specifically, he said that even before he would take the oath of office, he would speak to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nHe famously pledged that he could end the war in 24 hours\n\nTrump’s desire to end the war manifested itself in him blaming Zelensky for the conflict, despite the fact Russia invaded Ukraine. It culminated in his infamous blow-up where Vice President JD Vance tag-teamed with him to heckle Zelensky in front of the cameras and warned “You're gambling with World War Three.” \n\nOf course, Zelensky is simply defending his country from aggression by Russia and Putin has had its eyes on Ukraine long before the 2022 invasion. Zelensky has also shown his own willingness to do what he feels is necessary, such as when Ukraine launched a bold drone attack inside Russia entitled “Operation Spiderweb.” \n\nAnd Putin has not met Trump’s overtures in kind. \n\nRather, Putin continued his assault on Russia, with Trump often imploring “Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!” Last week, Trump spoke with the Russian president and said they had “a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.”\n\nTrump’s decision to side fully with Israel means that Trump will once again set aside his “America First” ambitions, which has sought to have America retreat from the larger world through a three-pronged approach of non-interventionist foreign policy, heavy tariffs to prevent foreign good from entering the United States and immigration restrictionism that seeks to close the country off from immigrants who come legally and illegally while deporting migrants in the United States. \n\nTrump has never been much of a peacenik for humane reasons — he famously threatened to “bomb the s***” out of ISIS — but now, he has realized he has to handle the larger burdens that come with being the president of the world’s super-power. \n\nAnd letting go of that responsibility is harder than he may have imagined.","summary":"The president’s decision to side with Israel’s offensive against Iran is the latest example of how his ambitions for non-interventionism have met reality, Eric Garcia writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-iran-israel-ukraine-russia-peace-b2769826.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/13/17/Pictures_of_the_Week_Global_Photo_Gallery__02447.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wUv4G4GD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-13 21:32:07","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":331208306,"title":"Top Trump stooge eyes California governor run—on one condition","text":"Richard Grenell can’t keep season ticket holders from leaving the once-nonpartisan Kennedy Center, where he’s president of the board of trustees, but apparently, Grenell thinks he has a chance at being California’s next governor. \n\nGrenell, who is also a Trump administration diplomat, is reportedly eyeing a run to replace term-limited Gov.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., for his disruption Thursday of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem‘s press conference.\n\n“Sen. Padilla should have been in Washington, D.C., voting. He has a responsibility to his constituents to show up at work—not try to make a spectacle of himself,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the Senate Majority Whip, told The Daily Signal. \n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also had harsh words for the California lawmaker.\n\n“Sen. Padilla should be standing up for the law-abiding citizens he was elected to serve—not defending illegal aliens committing horrific crimes in communities across California,” Blackburn said.\n\n“His decision to storm into Secretary Noem’s press conference and refuse to follow instructions was entirely unacceptable. This kind of behavior shouldn’t be tolerated from anyone, let alone a sitting U.S. senator,” the Tennessee lawmaker told The Daily Signal.\n\nAfter Padilla repeatedly ignored instructions from Noem’s security team to put his hands up and pushed against the team in attempting to make his way to interrupt her press conference, he was forcibly removed from the room. At that point, he was told to get on the ground and was handcuffed. \n\n“You can’t show up without your pin, refuse to announce yourself, and lunge at a Cabinet secretary. It doesn’t matter who you are,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said in a post on X. \n\n“If Sen. Padilla wanted to speak with Secretary Noem, he could have set up a meeting like everyone else,” Tuberville said. \n\n“But this wasn’t about that. Sen. Padilla wanted to cause a scene … and then to cry wolf when he got it,” the Alabama senator contended. \n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told The Daily Signal he was still assessing the situation.\n\n“Well, I’ve spoken with Sen. Padilla. I’ve spoken with Jennifer Hemingway, who is the sergeant-at-arms in the Senate, and I’m trying to connect with Secretary Noem. I haven’t reached her quite yet, but we want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator. And that’s try to gather all the relevant information,” Thune said. (The GOP leader said he has since spoken with Noem, a fellow South Dakotan.)\n\nPadilla defended his outburst in a number of posts on X. \n\n“What happened yesterday was part of a much bigger effort to try and silence anyone who dares to question what the Trump administration is doing. But we will not be intimidated, and we will not be deterred. We must hold this administration accountable,” the California senator said on the social media platform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the response to Padilla’s disruption. \n\n“[It] sickened my stomach—the manhandling of a United States senator,” Politico reported Schumer as saying. \n\nFellow California Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff also weighed in on the incident.\n\n“The disgraceful and disrespectful conduct of DHS agents, pushing and shoving him out of a briefing like that, demands our condemnation,” Schiff said in a post on X.\n\nPadilla was initially appointed to his Senate seat by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to fill the vacancy left by Kamala Harris after she was elected to the vice presidency in 2020. In November 2022, he won a special election to complete Harris’ term, which was set to expire in January 2023. He won a full six-year term for the Senate in a separate general election also held that November. \n\nNow 52, Padilla has spent half of his life in California politics, serving first as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, where he became the council’s youngest member at just 26 in 1999.\n\nPadilla was elevated to president of the City Council by his colleagues in 2001 and briefly served as acting mayor of Los Angeles after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S. From there, he entered state politics, serving as a member of the state Senate from 2006 to 2014.

Bass, standing before a bank of news cameras, did not hold back. \"I want to tell him to stop the raids,\" she said. \"I want to tell him that this is a city of immigrants. I want to tell him that if you want to devastate the economy of the city of Los Angeles, then attack the immigrant population.\" After taking office in 2022, L.A.'s 43rd mayor carefully avoided public disputes with other elected officials, instead highlighting her well-known penchant for collaboration and coalition-building. The high-profile Democrat, who spent a dozen years in Congress, largely steered clear of direct confrontation with Trump, responding diplomatically even as he attacked her over her handling of the Palisades fire earlier this year. Those days of tiptoeing around Trump, and avoiding head-to-head conflict, are over. Bass is now sparring with the president and his administration at a perilous moment for her city and possibly for democracy. At the same time, the tumultuous events of the past week have given her a crucial opportunity for a reset after the Palisades fire, recalibrating her public image while leading her city through another historic crisis. \"Having two moments of crisis during the first six months of this year has really tested her mettle as mayor,\" said GOP political strategist Mike Madrid, a longstanding Trump critic. \"I think it's fair to say she did not perform to expectations during the fires. I think she's considerably improved during the current situation.\" Since agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal authorities fanned out across the region, searching for undocumented immigrants at courthouses, car washes and Home Depot parking lots, Bass has accused Trump of creating a \"terrible sense of fear\" in her city. Bass said Trump is on track to waste more than $100 million on troops who were neither requested nor needed. On multiple occasions, she said Trump wrongly gave credit to the National Guard for bringing calm to downtown L.A. on Saturday, when those troops had not even arrived yet. In many ways, Trump has emerged as the ideal foil for a mayor who, for much of the past six months, had been on her back feet. In the immediate aftermath of the Palisades fire, which erupted when she was out of the country, Bass struggled to show a command of the details and was savaged by critics over what they viewed as her lack of leadership. Months later, she released a budget that called for the layoffs of 1,600 workers, drawing an outcry from labor leaders, youth advocates and many others. Bass has been quicker to respond this time around, announcing a nightly curfew for downtown, warning of consequences for those who vandalize or commit violence and spelling out the real-world impacts of the ICE arrests on her constituents. The pushback reached a crescendo on Thursday, when — with just a few hours notice — Bass assembled more than a hundred people from religious, community, business and civic groups to denounce the raids. It made for a potent tableau: a multi-ethnic, multiracial crowd of Angelenos cheering on the mayor as she declared that \"peace begins with ICE leaving Los Angeles.\" Bass said she had received reports of ICE agents entering hospitals, workers not showing up to their jobs, parents afraid to attend their own children's graduations. An immigrant rights advocate said Trump had brought cruelty and chaos to Los Angeles. A church pastor from Boyle Heights said his parishioners \"feel hunted.\" Trump and his administration have disparaged Bass and her city since the raids began. Stephen Miller, the president's deputy chief of staff, accused Bass on X of using \"the language of the insurrectionist mob\" while discussing her city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called L.A. \"a city of criminals\" whose law breakers have been protected by Bass. Republicans have begun threatening reprisals against outspoken Democrats, including Bass, with some hinting at criminal prosecution. Asked about Bass' comments over the past week, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE agents would not be \"deterred from carrying out their mission.\" \"We will not apologize for enforcing immigration law and carrying out the mandate the American people gave President Trump in November: deport illegal aliens,\" she said. Fernando Guerra, who heads the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, said Angelenos fully expect their mayor to confront the president head on. Democrat Kamala Harris secured more than 70% of the vote in L.A. during last year's presidential election, while Trump received less than 27%. \"I'm not surprised by what she's doing,\" Guerra said. \"I would even suggest she push a little more. I don't think there's a cost to her politically, or even socially, to taking on Trump.\" The mayor is regularly calling in to TV and radio stations, as well as securing prime time hits on national cable shows. In appearance after appearance, she has warned that L.A. is becoming \"a grand experiment\" — a testing ground for Trump to see if he can usurp the authority of Democratic mayors or governors in other states. On Tuesday, while addressing troops at Fort Bragg, Trump described L.A. as \"a trash heap,\" with entire neighborhoods being controlled by \"transnational gangs and criminal networks.\" Hours later, Bass clapped back on MSNBC, saying: \"I have no idea what he's talking about.\" Bass has spoken repeatedly about traumatized Angelenos who could not locate loved ones caught up in the ICE raids. \"For the most part, the people that have been detained have been denied access to legal representation,\" Bass said during an appearance at the city's Emergency Operations Center. \"This is unprecedented.\" The raids, and their impact on families and children, are deeply personal for a mayor who cut her teeth organizing with immigrant rights activists decades ago. Bass' own family reflects the multi-ethnic nature of her city. Her late ex-husband was the son of immigrants from Chihuahua, Mexico. Her extended family includes immigrants from Korea, Japan and the Philippines. Immigration agents were recently seen making arrests outside her grandson's Los Angeles school, she said. The arrival of ICE, then the National Guard, then the U.S. Marines has caused not just Bass but several other Democrats to step out in ways they might have previously avoided. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a soft-spoken political figure for decades, was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference in Westwood on Thursday after interrupting Noem's remarks. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently accused Trump of a \"brazen abuse of power,\" calling him \"unhinged\" and filing a lawsuit to block the deployment of the National Guard — not a huge departure for Newsom, who relishes both confrontation and the spotlight. Head-to-head accusations are much more out of character for Bass, who spent her first two years at City Hall boasting of her success in \"locking arms\" with her fellow elected officials on homelessness and other issues. In recent months, the mayor has praised Trump for the speedy arrival of federal resources as the city began cleaning up and rebuilding from the Palisades fire. Long before winning city office, Bass prided herself on her ability to work with other politicians, regardless of party affiliation, from her early days as a co-founder of the South L.A.-based Community Coalition to her years in Congress. Bass' strategy of avoiding public spats with Trump during the first few months of his administration was no accident, according to someone with knowledge of her thinking who was not authorized to speak publicly. The mayor, that person said, viewed an extended tit-for-tat as an impediment to securing federal funding for wildfire relief and other urgent needs. \"That's more her brand — to get things done with whoever she needs to get them done with,\" said Ange-Marie Hancock, who leads Ohio State University’s Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity. Mike Bonin, who heads the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State L.A., said he thinks that Bass' career of building multiracial, multi-ethnic coalitions makes her uniquely suited to the moment. Now that Trump has \"all but declared war on Los Angeles,\" Bass has no choice but to punch back, said Bonin, who served on the City Council for nearly a decade. \"I don't see that she had any political or moral alternative,\" he said.","summary":"For Bass, a high-profile Democrat who has avoided public conflicts with other elected officials, the days of tiptoeing around Trump are over.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out raids in Paramount, Los Angeles County, following similar actions at several locations throughout other parts of the city on Friday.The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids, some of which have swept up individuals with proper documentation. In response to protests counter the raiding, Trump announced the deployment of thousands of National Guards and hundreds of Marines.California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles.Mary Trump has been outspoken against her uncle for years, and in 2020, published Too Much and Never Enough, a tell-all book about Trump and their family. In it, she says the president is \"utterly incapable of leading this country and it's dangerous to allow him to do so.\"What To Know As Noem spoke at a scheduled news conference in L.A., Padilla, a California Democrat, was taken from the room while saying he had questions to ask her. Video footage from the incident showed that Padilla was pushed to the ground and handcuffed outside the door.\"I'm Senator Alex Padilla, and I have questions for the secretary,\" Padilla was heard saying as he was escorted out of the room. Noem continued her remarks, addressing an audience of reporters and law enforcement officials.Video footage from the incident showed that Padilla was pushed to the ground and handcuffed outside the door. Noem stopped speaking for a brief moment during the commotion, then immediately continued.Politicians on both sides of the aisle have condemned the interaction, with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, telling reporters the incident is \"shocking.\"\"I've seen that one clip. It's horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know,\" she said.In a Thursday video, Mary Trump referenced Padilla's removal, saying, \"We've been getting to a darker and darker place in this country for quite some time now.\"She continued that since Trump's second inauguration on January 20, \"the rapidity with which America has been sliding down that slippery slope is a little unnerving. And the last week alone has made it clear that we are not turning this around anytime soon.\"Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard and Marines without the approval of California Governor Gavin Newsom, a rare assertion of federal authority over a state. The administration continues to clash with the state and city's Democratic leadership, with both sides trading criticism.In reference to the ongoing ICE raids and Padilla's removal, Mary Trump said, \"Trump and his regime are making it apparent to anybody who is paying attention that whether they are allowed to or not, whether it's constitutional or not, whether it's legal or not, they will detain, manhandle, and arrest anybody who has the audacity to question them, try to get in their way, or protest them.\"Noem addressed the incident afterward, telling Fox News, \"He was never arrested. Nobody knew who he was when he came into the room creating a scene. He was removed from the room and yes, they started to put handcuffs on him. When he finally identified himself ... that was stopped.\"She added, \"Basically, they are encroaching upon our first amendment rights—free speech and to protest peacefully,\" concluding that, \"this basically is what authoritarianism looks like, when the party of power starts arresting the opposition.\"\"No Kings\" protests, organized in part by the 50501 Movement (50 protests, 50 states, one movement) and other groups, are countering a military parade scheduled to take place in the nation's capital on June 14, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, the Army's 250th anniversary, and Flag Day.Organizers of the protests are calling for June 14 to be a \"nationwide day of defiance\" and are calling for both people to join in the protests as well as eat up tickets to the military parade.What People Are Saying Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on X: \"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration's actions in Southern California. This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, wrote on X: \"With regard to the incident in LA this afternoon, the Senator in question was not wearing a security pin and physically resisted law enforcement when confronted. Our FBI personnel acted completely appropriately while assisting Secret Service and we are grateful for their professionalism and service.\"Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, on X: \"Senator Alex Padilla was fulfilling his Congressional oversight duties when he was thrown to the ground and handcuffed. This is no isolated instance; this is a pattern of behavior by the Trump administration. There is simply no justification for this abuse of authority.\"Padilla said in a statement after he was removed: \"If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farmers, to cooks, to day-laborers throughout the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.\"The Department of Homeland Security posted on X on Thursday: \"Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theater and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem.\"What Happens Next The incident has intensified scrutiny of the DHS and has raised fresh concerns about civil liberties amid the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.Organizers are calling for people to attend demonstrations being held across the country or to organize their own events. The president has repeatedly expressed his excitement for the parade this weekend.","summary":"Mary Trump, the estranged niece and vocal critic of Donald Trump, said we are quickly slipping into a \"darker place\" under the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mary-trump-issues-unnerving-warning-usdarker-darker-place-2085396","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662947/mary-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 20:41:10","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":331170082,"title":"Obama isn’t coming to rescue Democrats in desperate need of leadership: NY Times columnist","text":"New York Times columnist Tressie McMillan Cottom said Friday that former President Barack Obama will not be coming to Democrats' collective rescue as the party struggles to find national leadership in the wake of their stinging defeat in 2024. Cottom argued that Democrats desperate for Obama to save the party are \"undignified\" and weak, asserting that change will not come from above, but rather from \"the streets.\" \"We must start asking how we can save ourselves. We are seeing the start of that in places like Los Angeles, San Antonio and Raleigh, N.C.,\" she wrote, referencing the anti-ICE protests occurring across the country. \"Only direct, sustained protest will protect us.\" The Times columnist claimed that President Donald Trump has led the country into \"dangerous territory\" by deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, suggesting the moment feels significant enough to warrant Obama’s intervention. DEMOCRATS FORGE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS AS PARTY FLOUNDERS IN TRUMP'S 2ND TERM She noted that the social media murmurs and essays questioning Obama's whereabouts at such a pivotal moment speak to an accepted truth: \"The Democratic Party lacks leadership\" in the wake of Kamala Harris' 2024 defeat. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., offer \"glimmers of a charismatic party head waiting in the wings,\" she wrote. While Obama may feel like a good option, she wrote, she gave his presidency a mixed review from a liberal perspective, saying he was a \"product of his times.\" Cottom diagnosed those who believe that Obama will come back to save the party with \"Obama Derangement Syndrome\" (ODS). She argued that even if Obama did make his return to the political arena, he would have a difficult time competing in the \"outrage era\" of social media algorithms and big tech monopolies.

It’s not just the uninformed. It’s the ill informed who believe A.I.-generated videos, share political memes about stolen elections and engage in the most unhinged political infotainment imaginable,\" she stated. \"That’s the bell that those with O.D.S. imagine Obama can unring.\" She contended that the Democratic Party's search for a \"charismatic preacher\" is what has led to the \"silly calls\" for a Joe Rogan of the left — or a politician with entertainment chops like Trump to sell their political message. \"If we assume that the left is a coherent ideology with committed adherents — and I would argue that is debatable — it does not need a Rogan. It needs a Spotify,\" Cottom declared, reinforcing her argument by pointing out what Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter has done for conservative discourse online.

Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hoping for rain on Saturday during President Donald Trump's military parade. During a \"What’s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward\" event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP), Walz told CEO Neera Tanden that he had never hoped for rain so much in his life. \"I'm just going to confess to it,\" Walz said. \"It might get me in trouble. Whatever. I have never so hoped for rain in my life.\" Trump is hosting a massive Flag Day military parade on Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in the nation’s capital to witness the historic parade, which also coincides with the president's 79th birthday. TIM WALZ FLOATS CHINA AS 'NEUTRAL ACTOR' WITH 'MORAL AUTHORITY' TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE According to the FOX Forecast Center's Risk Of Weather Impact (ROWI) assessment, there is a medium risk of inclement weather in the nation's capital, with showers and thunderstorms expected throughout part of the evening. And Walz is hoping for that perfect storm. PROTESTERS EXPECTED TO CONVERGE ON DC, NEIGHBORING CITIES AHEAD OF TRUMP'S MILITARY PARADE The Democrat, who rose to the national stage as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during her brief 2024 presidential campaign, criticized Trump along his usual attack lines on Friday. Walz said Trump is \"incompetent at governing,\" and America is in a \"dangerous time\" under Trump's leadership, which the Minnesota governor said is \"marching towards authoritarianism\" following the chaotic incident in which authorities forcibly removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press conference Thursday. The Democrat confirmed on Friday that he will be speaking at a \"No Kings\" protest in St. Paul, Minn., this Saturday during Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C. \"Somehow this got tied to billionaires in China funding this or whatever,\" Walz said Friday. \"I'm like, these are like people in St. Paul that just do protests and stuff. That's what they do. They're feeling it, and they organized it. I think going and making that case, it is a good counter.\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., grilled Walz about attending the protest during a House Oversight Committee hearing with his fellow \"sanctuary governors\" on Capitol Hill Thursday. Luna said DHS discovered that China considered Walz a \"prime target for influence operations.\" \"You are working with, and going to be speaking at, an organization and rally that is not just funded by Christy Walton, the heiress of Walmart, but also has ties to the Chinese Progressive Association largely funding it, that actually brags on their website that they are pro-Maoist,\" Luna said. But Walz dismissed Luna's allegations, doubling down that Trump's military parade \"just looks wrong, feels wrong.\" \"I think I'm going to go be with a few thousand folks who kind of have the tradition that there is a separation there, that we don't need this. This is not Pyongyang on a Saturday,\" Walz said, before admitting he was hoping for rain. Pyongyang is the capital of North Korea, which is a communist, totalitarian dictatorship. Walz has joined many Democrats, including those planning to protest on Saturday, who have criticized Trump's military parade, drawing comparisons to China's and North Korea's military parades. Trump's military parade on Saturday comes amid escalated conflict in the Middle East, after Israel launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and military leaders, and Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory.

Trump’s labeling of Miles as a ‘traitor’ and his issuance of an unprecedented Executive Order that invokes the full investigative weight of the U.S. government against a named, private citizen, is as unconstitutional as it is autocratic. Retaliation has no place in the democratic process, and the Trump administration’s revenge against whistleblowers, like Miles, is ripped right out of the authoritarian playbook.

The noxious practice of aborting girls simply for being girls has become dramatically less common. It first became widespread in the late 1980s, as cheap ultrasound machines made it easy to determine the sex of a fetus. Parents who were desperate for a boy but did not want a large family—or, in China, were not allowed one—started routinely terminating females. Globally, among babies born in 2000, a staggering 1.6m girls were missing from the number you would expect, given the natural sex ratio at birth. This year that number is likely to be 200,000—and it is still falling.\n\nNote: not perfect yet, and in some places still terrible. But this is a good sign.\n\nNote: without enough women to go around, some guys become incels. Not good for them, not good for society.\n\nNever too late to help your brain! Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nIt’s never too late to start eating better to prevent dementia, according a new analysis of research involving 90,000 adults.\n\nPeople over the age of 45 who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were “significantly” less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia, said the University of Hawaii scientists.\n\nThe MIND diet stands for Mediterranean Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, and was developed by the late Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush University nutritional epidemiologist. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension).\n\nIt includes proven ‘brain-healthy’ foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, fish, and olive oil.\n\nThe study found that the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other ‘healthy’ diets for the majority of racial groups in the study.\n\nNote : sometimes it does feel as if the US has become dumber – could this be why? My own father was a committed liberal until the end of his life – when he had dementia.\n\nBill Gates to give most of his fortune to Africa Farouk Chothia BBC News\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates says that most of his fortune will be spent on improving health and education services in Africa over the next 20 years.\n\nThe 69-year-old said that \"by unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity\".\n\nSpeaking in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, he also urged Africa's young innovators to think about how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare on the continent.\n\nGates announced last month that he would give away 99% of his vast fortune - which he expects to reach $200bn (£150bn) - by 2045, by when his foundation planned to end its operations.\n\n🐦 I do a lot of other writing.

So many of them cannot succeed.\n\nHere are some quick hits.\n\n Stay involved. Yeah, that’s tough. I want to look away too, but by taking simple actions you can make a difference. Keep contacting your representatives, both in DC and at home.\n Support causes that will fight. Send money if you can. Also, spread their news with clicks and conversation.\n Slow them down. Oppose and block at every turn.\n Make tRump unpopular. Doing this weakens him. And it should not be that difficult. The GOP made a lot out of Biden is old and eggs cost too much. Well, tRump is older than Biden was at the beginning of his term and tRump has no policies that are going to bring down inflation. And a host of other problems, like he’s a convicted felon.\n Divide the GOP from each other. They are a coalition based on contradictory promises, so there’s plenty to work with.\n Keep telling the truth and showing love.\n Make sure to pace yourselves in this marathon and to practice self-care.\n\nCurrent projects:\n\n Look in the comments for Progressive Muse’s report on Postcards to Voters\n\nAnd Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny Lessons:\n\n(1) Do Not Obey in Advance; (2) Defend Institutions; (3) Beware the One-Party System;(4) Take Responsibility for the Face of the World; (5) Remember Professional Ethics; (6) Be Wary of Paramilitaries; (7) Be Reflective if You Must Own a Gun; (8) Stand Out (this means, speak up, even when others do not); (9) Be Kind to Our Language; (10) Believe in Truth;(11) Investigate; (12) Make Eye Contact and Small Talk;(13) Practice Corporeal Politics; (14) Establish a Private Life;(15) Contribute to Good Causes; (16) Learn from Peers in Other Countries; (17) Listen for Dangerous Words; (18) Be Calm When the Unthinkable Arrives; (19) Be a Patriot; (20) Be as Courageous as You Can.\n\nPresident Joseph R.

President Trump’s disregard of our Constitution – which he has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend – threatens the very fabric of our Republic.\n\n🌹 Let’s Celebrate Love ❤️\n\nAs this Sunday is Father’s Day, this week we celebrate Dads showing love: Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nFrom paying off their child’s credit card debt to donating a kidney, a new survey revealed some of the most life-changing ‘dad acts’ in honor of Father’s Day.\n\nThe survey of 2,000 Americans uncovered fatherhood stories showing they truly are the most helpful heroes, with people sharing stories of selflessness and kindness.\n\nOne respondent shared, “The most heroic thing my father has ever done for me was during Hurricane Harvey—he trudged through the waters to come get me.”\n\n📎Odds & Ends 📎\n\nGlobal investment in clean energy soaring Cristen Hemingway Jaynes EcoWatch\n\nAn increase in spending on clean energy is expected to drive record global energy investment of 3.3 trillion in 2025, with 2.2 trillion of that in “clean-energy technologies,” according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nDespite economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, the World Energy Investment 2025 report shows China leads the way as the largest investor in energy.\n\nClean energy technologies will attract twice the capital of fossil fuels, with more investment being made in solar PV than in any other technology, the report said.\n\n“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record $3.3 trillion as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” said Executive Director of the IEA Fatih Birol in a press release from the intergovernmental organization. “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”\n\nFar fewer girls being aborted these days The Economist\n\nWithout fanfare, something remarkable has happened. The noxious practice of aborting girls simply for being girls has become dramatically less common. It first became widespread in the late 1980s, as cheap ultrasound machines made it easy to determine the sex of a fetus. Parents who were desperate for a boy but did not want a large family—or, in China, were not allowed one—started routinely terminating females. Globally, among babies born in 2000, a staggering 1.6m girls were missing from the number you would expect, given the natural sex ratio at birth. This year that number is likely to be 200,000—and it is still falling.\n\nNote: not perfect yet, and in some places still terrible. But this is a good sign.\n\nNote: without enough women to go around, some guys become incels. Not good for them, not good for society.\n\nNever too late to help your brain! Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nIt’s never too late to start eating better to prevent dementia, according a new analysis of research involving 90,000 adults.\n\nPeople over the age of 45 who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were “significantly” less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia, said the University of Hawaii scientists.\n\nThe MIND diet stands for Mediterranean Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, and was developed by the late Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush University nutritional epidemiologist. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension).\n\nIt includes proven ‘brain-healthy’ foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, fish, and olive oil.\n\nThe study found that the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other ‘healthy’ diets for the majority of racial groups in the study.\n\nNote : sometimes it does feel as if the US has become dumber – could this be why? My own father was a committed liberal until the end of his life – when he had dementia.\n\nBill Gates to give most of his fortune to Africa Farouk Chothia BBC News\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates says that most of his fortune will be spent on improving health and education services in Africa over the next 20 years.\n\nThe 69-year-old said that \"by unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity\".\n\nSpeaking in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, he also urged Africa's young innovators to think about how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare on the continent.\n\nGates announced last month that he would give away 99% of his vast fortune - which he expects to reach $200bn (£150bn) - by 2045, by when his foundation planned to end its operations.\n\n🐦 I do a lot of other writing.

Some of us expected it: the cheating, the lying, and the chaos. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country and the planet from those very bad people.

Here are some of the highlights (I wish they still did transcripts).\n\n No question about what this president is trying to do. The question is, will he succeed? And the answer will not be found by looking at him. It’s by seeing what we do. The question is, what will this country allow him to do.\n The answer is what happens in the streets, the courts, the states, and Congress.\n We are seeing over and over again, is that protesting against him works. He wants to seem strong, but he is weak. Protesting works, courts work, pushback works.\n Marcelo (high school kid in MA), Carol (restaurant worker in MO), little girl with health issues is here, Antonio is still here\n Pushback doesn’t always work, but pushback is the only thing that ever does work\n She shows protests against ICE around the country, and says tRump is panicking\n Protests also put steel in the spine of the political opposition (e.g., the Dems). Shows Governor Newsom, Representative Maxine Waters\n Maddow argues that the forces sent to intimidate Los Angeles and other places are symptoms of weakness — a president who doesn’t know how to get the support of his people\n\nSo, my friends, keep on protesting.\n\nAnd especially you can protest tomorrow!\n\nNeed ideas for making a sign? How about\n\n No masks on ICE\n Budget for people not billionaires\n Tax the Rich\n Save Democracy\n Truth Matters! Love Matters!\n\nAlready got your sign? Tell us about it!\n\n💣 Republicans: Party of Crimes and Chaos 💣\n\nUnpopular! That’s one of our tools. And it helps a lot:\n\nNote it says “today” but it is from Wednesday. Sorry about the Boebert comment.\n\nAnd some off the cuff analysis:\n\nTACO! TACO! TACO! tRump surrenders on deportation:\n\nIn case you don’t want to watch, tRump said, because of pushback from farmers and other employers, ICE is going to stop going after the hardworking undocumented. In fact, the incompetent ICE have been deporting fewer people than were deported daily under Biden.\n\nThis is a complete surrender.\n\ntRump stumbles — sorry for showing the ugly mug! But actually I’m showing it because it is so very ugly...\n\ntRump and musk broke the law. Surprise, surprise!\n\nIt’s important to fan the flames of division in the Rs.\n\nGeorge Conway on how tRump turns on allies Alex Henderson AlterNet\n\nDuring Donald Trump's first presidency, he was on very friendly terms with the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal group, and its activist, Leonard Leo. All three of Trump's U.S. Supreme Court appointees — Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch — were people the Federalist Society aggressively promoted. And many of Trump's appointees to the lower federal courts were endorsed by the Federalist Society as well.\n\nBut Trump, now four and one-half months into his second presidency, is angrily railing against the Federalist Society and called Leo a \"sleazebag\" and a \"bad person\" on his Truth Social platform. :scissors:\n\nThe fact that Trump now hates the Federalist Society after working with them in the past, according to Conway, underscores his \"narcissistic\" personality.\n\nConway told host Sarah Longwell — who, like him, is very much a Never Trumper and rooted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — \"Remember Mary Trump's book?.... The title was 'Too Much and Never Enough.' You can never satisfy this narcissistic appetite of Donald Trump. Because there will always be something else that he'll want from you that you can't give him or won't give him. And then, he'll turn on you.\"\n\nNote: This is why no one should ever give him an inch. Won’t ever be satisfied.\n\ntRump’s paranoia could be bad news for Vance Alia Zehra AlterNet\n\nTrump's decision to select Vance as his vice president, Wolff noted, was influenced by Musk — who allegedly tied his substantial financial support to Vance’s nomination.\n\nIn a post on the social platform X following Musk's attacks against Trump last week, Vance said: “I’m the vice president to President Trump. My loyalties are always going to be with the president.”\n\nBut Wolff said it’s unclear whether Vance’s statement that he stands with the president will be enough to earn Trump’s trust following this fallout.\n\n🚚 💙 Democrats Deliver 💙 🚚\n\nSome inspiration: Governor Newsom has been speaking up. And filing in the court.\n\nAnd the call up was illegal. \n\nI don’t know, can the soldiers just go home? Because tRump, in this case, is not their commander…\n\nAlways enjoy Representative Crockett!\n\nAnd in case you missed it, and even if you didn’t (because repetition is good), Gina Ortiz won her election to become mayor of San Antonio.\n\nI bet some people wrote postcards for her, so well done, gnusies!!!\n\nSome excellent healthcare news in Oregon (sorry, arhpdx, for stepping into your state, but repetition is good)\n\nWe need unity. And we need to join together\n\n⚡️ Walmart heiress runs ads to encourage No Kings protests! AKALib Daily Kos \n\nApparently some of maga are trying to boycott Walmart now, but a friend of mine points out that will be really hard.\n\n⚡️ Unanimous SCOTUS Decision in FBI Wrong House raid Avoid Amnesia Daily Kos\n\nThe FBI raided the wrong house back in 2017 (note who was president) and subjected a family to awful stuff. So far they have been shielded by the idea you can’t sue them. But now SCOTUS has unanimously decided otherwise!\n\nNational History Day contest, which received a total of 132,000 dollars to make it happen, was the victim of DOGE cuts. Thanks to donors it is still taking place.\n\n📥Actions You Can Take 📤\n\nTax-exempt organization complaint referrals. 13909. You can fill this out for the NRA and lots of other organizations. How about if some of us white folk go into some of the MAGA churches and video record what they’re saying?\n\nVoting rights. This may be the biggest issue threatening our democracy right now. Besides contacting your representatives at the state and federal level to do the right thing (depending on who they are),you can support and contact these organizations:\n\nACLU — American Civil Liberties Union\n\nDemocracy Docket — founded by Marc Elias, so important in fighting the challenges after the last election.\n\nFair Fight — founded by Stacey Abrams\n\n🌱Grass roots. Join with local communities to make a difference. It could be your local Dems. It could be your school board or your library. Reach out to people. We all need each other these days.\n\n🏃 Run for something. If you want to run for something, but have no idea what to do, these people will help you. They also like money and volunteers to help those people who are running, so even if you’re not in a position to stand for office, you can help.\n\n👎 Defund the seditionists. This is a list with companies that sometimes have donated to the seditionists. The list is long.

Contact them and compliment or complain, but let them know you are watching. Forward it to others. \n\n🐍Schadenfreude 😈\n\nEl Salvador’s president has colluded with gangs\n\nThe soldiers are not getting paid:\n\nThey are apparently not doing much, either. Which is good. But they are attracting all the cameras.\n\nVote to reduce the government, and the government is not there when you need it.\n\n📣 Let’s Honor Truth ☀️️\n\nWe honor truth tellers. We also honor those who protect the truth tellers. One of those groups is Whistleblower Aid. \n\nWant to know more? Here’s a description by Allison Gill, the founder of Mueller She Wrote, and currently the podcaster hosting The Daily Beans. \n\nHey everybody, it’s AG, and I'm super excited to announce our partnership with Whistleblower Aid. These are the lawyers that go up against the government to protect those willing to speak out, and they do this work pro bono!\n\nAnd they have a track record. Remember that in the first Trump administration, Whistleblower Aid successfully and safely empowered truth-tellers to stand up and protect democratic values, resulting in Trump's first impeachment as well as accountability for intelligence officers and others working to keep the Capitol safe on January 6. They are representing our good friend and fellow whistleblower, Miles Taylor, and are currently supporting several other Trump Administration whistleblowers we can’t even talk about because whistleblower aid cares about protecting the identities of those who want to speak truth to power anonymously!\n\nThese are David and Goliath cases that Whistleblower Aid takes on, again at no cost to those they represent, which is why they need our help. If you can give any amount, no matter how small, you can feel good about helping these incredible attorneys protect and defend the brave folks who want to speak out in the public interest and in defense of democracy.\n\nHere’s the case from the website about how they are representing Miles Taylor against the retaliation from the current evil regime (If you don’t recall, Miles Taylor was the guy who wrote Anonymous during the first evil regime):\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 3, 2025 – Miles Taylor, former President Trump-appointed Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Whistleblower Aid client, filed a complaint against the Trump Administration today, calling on federal watchdogs to investigate Trump’s retaliation against him. In April, Trump issued an Executive Order explicitly targeting Taylor for investigation for a litany of alleged serious crimes, including treason. This is the first time in U.S. history that a President has invoked investigative powers against a named private citizen.\n\nIn response to Miles’s complaint, Whistleblower Aid CEO, Libby Liu, issued the following statement:\n\n“Miles’s bravery in filing this complaint represents a major step in fighting back against President Trump’s weaponization of presidential power to punish those who disclose wrongdoing. Trump’s labeling of Miles as a ‘traitor’ and his issuance of an unprecedented Executive Order that invokes the full investigative weight of the U.S. government against a named, private citizen, is as unconstitutional as it is autocratic. Retaliation has no place in the democratic process, and the Trump administration’s revenge against whistleblowers, like Miles, is ripped right out of the authoritarian playbook. President Trump’s disregard of our Constitution – which he has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend – threatens the very fabric of our Republic.\n\n🌹 Let’s Celebrate Love ❤️\n\nAs this Sunday is Father’s Day, this week we celebrate Dads showing love: Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nFrom paying off their child’s credit card debt to donating a kidney, a new survey revealed some of the most life-changing ‘dad acts’ in honor of Father’s Day.\n\nThe survey of 2,000 Americans uncovered fatherhood stories showing they truly are the most helpful heroes, with people sharing stories of selflessness and kindness.\n\nOne respondent shared, “The most heroic thing my father has ever done for me was during Hurricane Harvey—he trudged through the waters to come get me.”\n\n📎Odds & Ends 📎\n\nGlobal investment in clean energy soaring Cristen Hemingway Jaynes EcoWatch\n\nAn increase in spending on clean energy is expected to drive record global energy investment of 3.3 trillion in 2025, with 2.2 trillion of that in “clean-energy technologies,” according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nDespite economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, the World Energy Investment 2025 report shows China leads the way as the largest investor in energy.\n\nClean energy technologies will attract twice the capital of fossil fuels, with more investment being made in solar PV than in any other technology, the report said.\n\n“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record $3.3 trillion as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” said Executive Director of the IEA Fatih Birol in a press release from the intergovernmental organization. “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”\n\nFar fewer girls being aborted these days The Economist\n\nWithout fanfare, something remarkable has happened.

Alex Padilla responds after forced removal from immigration briefing","text":"U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids that have led to protests in California and around the United States.\n\nNoem’s security detail was captured on camera grabbing Padilla by his jacket and shoving him around the room in a video as he tried to speak during the immigration briefing. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem said that federal authorities were not going away, but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\nAfter images and video of the scuffle ricocheted through the halls of Congress and social media, Padilla read a brief statement to reporters, saying he was in the federal building “awaiting a scheduled briefing from federal officials as my responsibility as a senator to provide oversight and accountability.”\n\nWhile Padilla was waiting for the briefing to begin, he learned that Noem was having a press conference a few doors down the hall, so he decided to attend.\n\nThe White House has accused Padilla of grandstanding.\n\nWhat happened at the news conference\n\nIn an update on immigration enforcement in Los Angeles on Thursday, Noem said immigration authorities will continue to carry out arrests of people in the country illegally who have criminal records, and that protesters who engage in vandalism and violence will “face consequences.”\n\nPadilla interrupted by shouting, “I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.”\n\nNoem continued addressing reporters and law enforcement officers while Padilla was ejected from the room.\n\nScuffling with officers outside the room, Padilla can be heard shouting, “Hands off!” He was later seen on his knees and then pushed to the ground and handcuffed in a hallway, with several officers atop him.\n\nWhile addressing the media outside of the building, Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, said he and his colleagues had received little to no response from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.\n\n“I came to the press conference to hear what she had to say, to see if I could learn any new additional information. And at one point, I had a question,” Padilla said. “Let me emphasize, just like we emphasize the right for people to peacefully protest and to stand up for their First Amendment rights, for their fundamental rights, I was there peacefully.”\n\n“At one point I had a question so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room,” Padilla stated. “I was forced to the ground and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.”\n\n“I will say this, if this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California and throughout the country. We will hold this administration accountable.”\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.” The statement claimed that Padilla did not identify himself.\n\n“Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the statement said, adding that “officers acted appropriately.”\n\nNoem told Fox LA afterward that she had a “great” conversation with Padilla after the scuffle, but called his approach “something that I don’t think was appropriate at all.”\n\n“I think everybody in America would agree that that was inappropriate,” she added.\n\nNoem said that during her 15-minute meeting with Padilla, they “probably disagree on 90 per cent of the topics” but they will continue to speak to each other.\n\n“He and I exchanged phone numbers. We’re going to continue to talk and we’ll have conversations,” she said. “We may be as far apart on the political spectrum as possible but we’re all human beings and we all love this country, I hope.”\n\n“Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “It’s telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.”\n\nPadilla disputes the Trump administration’s account of events\n\nDuring an interview with MSNBC, Padilla disputed the White House’s account of events that took place on June 12.\n\nPadilla said he was removed while demanding answers about U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.”\n\nHe called Noem’s description of the events “ridiculous” after she claimed that he “started lunging towards the podium, interrupting me and elevating his voice.”\n\n“It’s a lie but par for the course for this administration,” Padilla began.\n\n“They said I wasn’t wearing my pin. My polo says ‘United States Senate,'” Padilla said. “There was no threat. There was no lunging. I raised my voice to ask a question, and it took what, maybe, half a second before multiple agents were on me.”\n\nHe called the degree of force used by the FBI agents against him “excessive” and an “overreaction.”\n\nHe said that he complied with the agents’ orders because of the lessons he learned from growing up in San Fernando Valley.\n\n“Where I grew up, you know what happens if you don’t obey law enforcement. So I began to go on my knees to the extent that they would let me,” Padilla said. “I kept repeatedly asking them, ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer. ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer. ‘Why am I being detained?’ No answer.”\n\nAs for his meeting with Noem, Padilla said that the agents removed his handcuffs and he was invited to meet with her for “a few minutes.”\n\n“You’d think she might have started the meeting with an apology for what happened? Of course not,” Padilla said.\n\nPadilla noted that he is OK, but he hopes others feel the outrage he does.\n\n“If this can happen to a United States senator for having the audacity to ask a question for the secretary of homeland security … just image what could happen to anybody in the country for that matter,” he said.\n\nPadilla has been very vocal about Trump and his deportation agenda.\n\n“Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda, he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way,” Padilla said of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles in a social media post.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nMany of Padilla’s colleagues shared their outrage after he was removed from the cabinet secretary’s news conference and many demanded an immediate investigation into the interaction.\n\nCalif. Gov. Gavin Newsom called Padilla’s removal “outrageous” in a social media post.\n\n“This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control,” he said. “This must end now.”\n\n“If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you,” Newsom added.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw “sickened my stomach.”\n\n“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,” the New York senator said from the Senate floor. “It’s despicable, it’s disgusting, it’s so un-American.”\n\nKamala Harris wrote in a social media post Thursday that Padilla “was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this administration’s actions in Southern California.” She called his forceful removal “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”\n\nDemocratic senators quickly gathered in the chamber, denouncing the treatment of their colleague and urged Americans to understand what was happening.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump is making this country “look more and more like a fascist state.”\n\n“Will any Republican senator speak up for our democracy?” Warren pleaded.\n\nSen. Tina Smith called on Noem to resign, saying there was no justification for Padilla’s treatment and that the Trump administration needed to be held accountable.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson accused Padilla of “charging” Noem and indicated that the behaviour “rises to the level of a censure.”\n\n“My view is it was wildly inappropriate,” Johnson told reporters outside the House chamber as people walking past shouted over him, “That’s a lie!”\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” Johnson said, loudly speaking over reporters’ questions. “It’s beneath a member of Congress. It’s beneath the U.S. senator.”\n\nSenate Republican leader John Thune said he had spoken to Padilla and is trying to reach Noem but hasn’t yet connected with her.\n\n“We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator and try to gather all the relevant information,” the South Dakota senator said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said what happened to Padilla “was un-American” and those involved must be held accountable.\n\n“This is not going to end until there is accountability and until the Trump administration changes its behaviour,” Jeffries added.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal called the video “utterly revolting” and said there should be consequences.\n\n“If they can do this kind of violent reprisal against a United States senator just for showing up at a press conference, it can happen anywhere,” Blumenthal said.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called Padilla’s removal “abhorrent and outrageous.”\n\n“He is a sitting United States Senator. This administration’s violent attacks on our city must end.”\n\nLeaders from the League of United Latin American Citizens expressed their outrage and condemned Padilla’s treatment.\n\n“What happened to Senator Alex Padilla is nothing less than an outrageous abuse of power and a direct assault on our democracy,” Roman Palomares, LULAC national president, said in a statement. “That a Latino U.S. Senator was physically removed from a public press event simply because he dared to ask tough questions of a federal cabinet official is unacceptable and will not be silently tolerated in our country.”\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"'There was no threat.

During a \"What’s Next: Conversations on the Path Forward\" event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP), Walz responded to a question from CEO Neera Tanden about the \"escalatory\" nature of the strikes. Walz said, \"Iran has to retaliate, in their mind,\" and the \"Middle East is back on fire in a way that has now expanded.\" \"Now, who is the voice in the world that can negotiate some type of agreement in this? Who holds the moral authority? Who holds the ability to do that? Because we are not seen as a neutral actor, and we maybe never were,\" Walz said of the United States' role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle East. According to Walz, the United States once attempted \"to be somewhat of the arbitrator\" in those negotiations during the Iran Nuclear Deal, but he said Americans must face the reality that the \"neutral actor\" with the \"moral authority\" to lead negotiations in the Middle East \"might be the Chinese.\" WALZ RIPPED FOR 'SICKENING' USE OF NAZI-ERA LANGUAGE DESCRIBING TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY: 'ANTI-AMERICAN' Walz didn't elaborate on why China would be that world leader. WALZ SAYS HARRIS PICKED HIM FOR VP TO 'CODE TALK TO WHITE GUYS' The Democrat's ties to China took center stage during his brief time as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election. During the 2024 campaign cycle, Fox News Digital reported that Walz had been a longtime vocal supporter of a medical research institute in his home state with a long track record of collaborating with a firm labeled by the Pentagon as a \"Chinese military company\" and with Chinese officials with controversial ties to the CCP. And in a letter unearthed by Fox News Digital, Walz boasted about Minnesota hosting several top Chinese leaders. The Minnesota International Chinese School showcased a 2021 letter from Walz on its YouTube channel celebrating the 10th anniversary of the school's Chinese New Year. CAP, who hosted the conversation with Walz, has its own questionable ties to China.

In 2020, their net favorability stood at +23 points. This year that has flipped to -6—a 29-point decline in support for undocumented immigrants among immigrants themselves. Enten did not specify which demographics were included in his aggregate.It comes as polls suggest that Trump's hardline immigration stance is resonating with much of the public. In a sharp turnaround from his first term, Trump now holds a net positive approval rating on immigration, rising from -21 in June 2017 to +1 today, according to CNN's Harry Enten—his biggest gain on any issue.A YouGov/CBS News poll conducted June 4-6 found 54 percent of Americans support Trump's deportation program targeting undocumented immigrants, surpassing his ratings on the economy (42 percent) and inflation (39 percent). Additionally, 51 percent approve of ICE conducting searches.An RMG Research poll echoed that result, with 58 percent backing the deportation efforts. And in an Insider Advantage survey, 59 percent approved of Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to the protests.But the support has limits. Some polls show that Trump's handling of deportations is broadly unpopular. A survey conducted by YouGov/Economist found that just 39 percent of respondents approve of how the former president is managing deportations, while 50 percent disapprove, giving him a net approval rating of minus 11. A separate Quinnipiac poll showed even deeper dissatisfaction, with 40 percent approval and 56 percent disapproval—netting a negative 16-point rating on the issue.Meanwhile, 56 percent disapprove of how Trump's mass deportation program is being implemented, according to the CBS/YouGov poll. A separate YouGov survey found only 39 percent approve of the administration's overall approach to deportations, while 50 percent disapprove.The issue remains deeply polarizing as 93 percent of Republicans support the deportation plan, compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Independents are divided. Nearly half of Americans believe Trump is going further than he promised during his campaign.His military deployment is even more controversial. A June 9-10 YouGov poll found only 34 percent of Americans support sending Marines to Los Angeles, while 47 percent disapprove. A majority—56 percent—say state and local governments, not the federal government, should handle the situation.But among immigrant voters, Trump's immigration policy appears to be resonating.Experts say that immigrants are increasingly backing Donald Trump's hardline immigration stance due to frustration over what they see as a broken and unfair system.Thomas Gift, a political science professor at University College London, told Newsweek that many immigrants feel betrayed by current immigration policies, especially ones created under President Joe Biden. \"Part of this shift likely stems from frustration among immigrants who feel they 'followed the rules' and now resent those who entered the country unlawfully,\" Gift explained.Jeremy Beck, co-president of the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA, told Newsweek that more immigrants came to the U.S. between 2021 and 2025 than during any other period in history—\"more than half of them illegally.\"Between 2021 and 2024, there were over 10.8 million total illegal border encounters, according to the Department of Homeland Security, far exceeding the 2.8 million total from 2017–2020.That surge, he said, has spurred a backlash even among immigrant voters who helped form Trump's \"winning coalition in November.\" These voters, he added, sent a \"decisive message\" to Washington: \"Manage immigration at levels we can sustain, and credibly enforce the limits.\"The shift is also visible in the broader electorate. Beck pointed to Latino-majority districts in Texas and Colorado where Trump or immigration hardliners performed strongly. Trump made historic gains among Hispanic voters in 2024, with only 55 percent supporting Kamala Harris to Trump's 43 percent—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest percentage for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked.Beck concluded that Trump's \"willingness to enforce immigration laws gives him a clear advantage\" with voters—especially immigrants who went through the legal process. \"After the border crisis, voters are aware of how important it is to manage immigration policy in the national interest,\" he said.But Maria Cristina Garcia, Professor of American Studies at Cornell University, cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from polling on immigrant views toward immigration enforcement and support for Donald Trump. \"This poll as represented here in the video doesn't really tell me much,\" she said, emphasizing that Latino and immigrant communities are far from monolithic.Garcia argued that attitudes on immigration vary significantly depending on national origin, geography, and personal history. \"People of Mexican ancestry who live in border counties along the Rio Grande... are likely more hawkish on immigration than, say, a Dominican American in Washington Heights in NYC,\" she explained. Similarly, Cuban Americans differ in outlook depending on when and why they migrated to the U.S.But she noted that economic conditions strongly influence immigration attitudes, which could explain their support for Trump: \"Historically, U.S. citizens (including the foreign-born) have been more likely to demand bars to immigration when the economy sputters and they experience more pressure on their day-to-day lives.\"Gift echoed this, explaining that, like other Americans, immigrants are feeling the economic pressure from illegal immigration, including \"stresses on public services, housing shortages, and rising competition in certain labor markets.\"Beck, meanwhile, noted that immigrants are often the first to feel the impact of mass migration: \"They tend to work in the same occupations. They feel the downward pressure on their wages, and witness the degradation of workplace conditions for themselves as well as new arrivals.\"According to a 2024 report, approximately 36 percent of immigrants lived in lower-income households, compared to 29 percent of U.S.-born individuals. And a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) indicates that 43 percent of immigrants anticipate their financial situation will worsen in the coming year, compared to approximately 33 percent of U.S.-born individuals.Trump has sought to attribute economic pressures like this to illegal immigration. During a June 2024 presidential debate, Trump claimed that illegal immigrants were \"taking Black jobs\" and argued they were \"killing\" working opportunities for minority communities.\"His big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in... They're taking Black jobs now... and they're taking Hispanic jobs,\" he said.And in a March 2025 speech to Congress, Trump blamed \"open-border\" policies for causing widespread strain—implying economic stress on hospitals, schools, and communities, which often correlates with inflation concerns.\"Joe Biden didn't just open our borders—he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities,\" he said.For Beck, this is why immigration resonates so strongly with immigrant voters grappling with economic anxiety.\"The party that can set enforceable limits on immigration that serve the interests of immigrant voters could achieve a lasting realignment,\" he said.What People Are SayingEnten said: \"There is no bloc of voters that shifted more to the right from 2020 to 2024 than immigrant voters.\"Thomas Gift said: \"Part of this shift likely stems from frustration among immigrants who feel they \"followed the rules\" and now resent those who entered the country unlawfully or are seen as having bypassed the legal process. Like other Americans, immigrants themselves are affected by many of the same perceived challenges associated with illegal immigration, such as stresses on public services, housing shortages, and rising competition in certain labor markets. These numbers show just how far Biden's alleged \"open border policies\" have shifted immigrants toward supporting the Republican Party.\"Maria Cristina said: \"This poll as represented here in the video doesn't really tell me much, though.\"Let's say these pollsters just focused on Latinos who are foreign-born citizens. You're likely to find differences across Latino groups and geographic regions. People of Mexican ancestry who live in border counties along the Rio Grande, for example, are likely more hawkish on immigration than, say, a Dominican American in Washington Heights in NYC. A Cuban American who arrived in the 1960s and has no family left in Cuba might be more hawkish than a Cuban-born US citizen who arrived in 1996 and hopes to one day sponsor a family member. The more interesting question (to me) is why are some groups more hawkish than others? What is it about their experience that has led them to hold certain perspectives?\"For many foreign-born citizens (like all citizens in general), perspectives on immigration are tied to the state of the economy. Historically, US citizens (including the foreign-born) have been more likely to demand bars to immigration when the economy sputters and they experience more pressure on their day-to-day lives.\"As for why some immigrants voted for Trump...again, much depends on the group. Immigrants that fled a communist country, for example, might believe the MAGA-GOP's falsehood that Democrats are socialists or communists and worry about it. Or they might worry about the culture wars and feel that the Democratic party disregards their more religious or patriarchal values. There are many different reasons for the shift to the GOP. If so, voting GOP doesn't necessarily mean they liked Trump. Indeed, I'd like to see a polling question of GOP voters on whether they actually liked Trump.\"\"But in the end, immigrants are most concerned about the economy and the opportunities they believe will be available to them.\"Jeremy Beck said: \"Those are remarkable findings, although not entirely surprising. Whenever immigration levels spike, recent immigrants are among the first Americans to feel the impact. They tend to work in the same occupations. They feel the downward pressure on their wages, and witness the degradation of workplace conditions for themselves as well as new arrivals. They see the exploitation. They live in communities overwhelmed by unsustainable numbers. Mass immigration's strain on infrastructure, hospitals, schools, and homeless shelters affects foreign-born citizens directly and indirectly.\"More people came to the U.S. between 2021-2025 than in any other period in history; more than half of them illegally. The shift in immigrant voters is part of a broader shift in American voters who live off of their wages as opposed to their stock portfolios. These immigrant voters were part of Trump's winning coalition in November and they delivered a decisive message to Washington, D.C. last November: Manage immigration at levels we can sustain, and credibly enforce the limits. Enten's polling should not be surprising to anyone who remembers the shift toward Trump in majority-Latino districts in South Texas. Or in Colorado's 8th district, which is 40 percent Latino, where two candidates campaigned on who was tougher on immigration enforcement. The border crisis was tied with inflation for the top reason voters did not vote for Vice President Harris; and thirty six percent of Latino voters cited immigration as a top concern. One out of four Democratic voters believe the Party deliberately open the border. President Trump willingness to enforce immigration laws gives him a clear advantage with these voters. Many immigrant voters who themselves work through a sometimes difficult legal process understandably rejected policies that led to a crisis in which millions of people who should not have been admitted to the U.S. were released into the country outside of the legal system established by Congress.\"After the border crisis, voters are aware of how important it is to manage immigration policy in the national interest. The party that voters trust to fully enforce the law within the limits of the law has an advantage. The party that can set enforceable limits on immigration that serve the interests of immigrant voters could achieve a lasting realignment.\"What Happens NextTrump's approval rating among immigrant voters is likely to fluctuate.Meanwhile, coordinated nationwide protests against Trump and his administration's policies are also planned to take place in cities in all 50 states on the president's birthday on June 14.","summary":"The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-immigration-immigrant-voters-2084425","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662774/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 16:45:39","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":331110710,"title":"Moore headlines another swing state event despite insistence 2028 isn’t on his mind","text":"The Detroit NAACP event, titled the “70th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner,” will feature Moore alongside Detroit leaders like NAACP Detroit President Rev.

The thinking is that current management is resizing the business because they plan on operating Paramount for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs On The Money was first to report, Paramount’s top brass – aside from Redstone (she’s recused herself because of the potential payday) – is wary of the optics of paying off Trump so Shari can walk away with what’s left of the nest egg left to her by her father, the late merger impresario Sumner Redstone.\n\nThey fear it could open the company to bribery charges by settling the frivolous lawsuit – alleging “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris in the heat of the campaign (Trump won the election so there’s no damages) – that their directors and officers insurance doesn’t cover if some prosecutor brought a case.\n\nAll true, but the layoffs had little to do with the future of the deal, one way or the other, people close the transaction told On The Money.\n\nSkyDance had planned to own Paramount by now, and was planning the exact same cuts to make the numbers work before it can invest and grow the business, sources said.\n\nWith the deal in limbo, Paramount just did it first so cross that tea leaf off your list.\n\nThe second tea leaf is a little more interesting, though I am told, just as inconsequential to the deal’s outcome.\n\nIt involves the appearance of Skydance boss David Ellison ringside at a UFC 314 fight in Miami several weeks ago with Trump, who was shaking hands and schmoozing with the likes of Joe Rogan and Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nThe tea-leaf-reading talk here speculated that the deal is back on – Trump can’t wait to approve it as a favor to David’s dad, and Trump bestie, Larry Ellison. Why would Trump be seen with Larry’s kid if he were about to screw him?\n\nExcept, guess who else was ringside as Trump made his way through the crowd? Elon Musk, yes that Elon who had just called Trump some really nasty names. So nasty that earlier this week, Elon issued a semi-apology. He was sitting with his son, not far from the younger Ellison and Trump.\n\nSo cross that one off as well, deal watchers tell me.\n\nFor now, those looking for clues on how this stalemate ends will have to turn over a new tea leaf.","summary":"If Shari Redstone settles Trump's \"60 Minutes\" lawsuit, will that be enough to get the deal approved by his broadcast regulators?","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/13/media/how-to-read-the-tea-leaves-on-stalled-8b-paramount-skydance-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Shari-Tea-leaves-ANIMATE2.gif?w=950","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 13:11:06","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":331058648,"title":"Texas' Largest Newspaper Trashes Greg Abbott Protest Move: 'Expect Better'","text":"The Houston Chronicle, Texas's top selling newspaper, has published an editorial fiercely critical of Governor Greg Abbott over his rhetoric and decision to deploy Texas National Guard troops in response to protests against immigration enforcement, saying \"we expect better of him.\"Newsweek contacted Governor Abbott for comment on Friday via email outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersOn Tuesday, Abbott announced the deployment of Texas National Guard soldiers. The following day on X he said \"5,000+\" National Guard personnel would help manage protests in the state adding: \"Don't mess with Texas.\"The move came after days of unrest in Los Angeles which began on June 6 when demonstrators clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents attempting to conduct raids in the city. The following days saw more violent disorder with Waymo self-driving vehicles set on fire and rocks thrown at police who responded with tear gas and other \"less lethal\" weapons.Abbott's move places him at odds with California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who opposed President Donald Trump's decision to deploy California National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles.What to KnowIn its editorial, the Houston Chronicle said Abbott's decision to deploy National Guard troops following protests \"seems like an overreaction,\" adding: \"But there was no serious indication Tuesday that Texas was on the verge of exploding. No burning cars. No looting. No mayors imposing curfews.\"Instead the editorial claimed the \"most significant provocation to violence seemed to come from Abbott himself, citing the governor's warning that \"Peaceful protesting is legal. But once you cross the line, you will be arrested. FAFO.\" FAFO is an acronym for 'F*** around find out.'The editorial described this as \"the kind of thing that middle schoolers say before a fistfight\" adding: \"This isn't the grown-up leadership that Texas needs.\"According to All Sides, a website which monitors media bias, the Houston Chronicle is a centrist publication. In recent years it has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates including Kamala Harris in 2024 and Joe Biden in 2020.There was some disorder in Austin and Dallas on Monday night during anti-ICE protests, police making a number of arrests in both cities.According to Fox 7 Austin, four officers were injured after some demonstrators began throwing rocks and other missiles, while police responded with pepper balls and tear gas.Further protests are expected across Texas on Saturday as part of the national \"No Kings\" movement, which said it has organized 1,800 demonstrations nationwide. The protests coincide with Trump's 79th birthday and a controversial parade planned for Washington, D.C. nominally celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ordered the Trump administration to return control of the California National Guard troops he deployed to Newsom, though this was later temporarily blocked by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal.What People Are SayingIn its editorial the Houston Chronicle said: \"We join Gov. Abbott in urging that anyone planning to protest do so peacefully. But we also hope that he and other leaders will set a respectful tone and allow police to do their jobs. Local law officers have more peacekeeping training and community knowledge than National Guard soldiers. And the National Guard, in turn, is far better at domestic peacekeeping than the U.S. military. Domestic policing is not the military's job, not what the vast majority of soldiers are trained to do.\"On Thursday, via X, Abbott said: \"Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we've seen in LA. I deployed 5,000+ Texas National Guard soldiers & 2,000+ DPS troopers across Texas to maintain order at these protests.\"Anyone who damages property or harms a person will be arrested. Don't mess with Texas.\"Speaking to Newsweek about Saturday's planned protests Mark Shanahan, who teaches American politics at the UK's Surrey University, said: \"How many people turn out for the 1,800 planned protests will be fascinating and an indication of the strength of opposition to Trump's hard-line policies on immigration and law and order. For 249 years the USA really hasn't tolerated kings or tyranny, yet this president continues to push ever-harder at those Constitutional barriers. His military parade is more reminiscent of the exercises in hubris and vanity often seen in Moscow and Pyongyang.\"What Happens NextIt remains to be seen what role, if any, the Texas National Guard will fulfill during Saturday's 'No Kings' protests. Any conflict between soldiers and demonstrators on American streets would likely spark civil liberties concerns.","summary":"Anti-Trump protests are expected across Texas on Saturday as part of the \"No Kings\" movement.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/texas-largest-newspaper-trashes-greg-abbott-protest-move-expect-better-2085043","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662458/greg-abbott.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 12:44:17","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.051},{"id":331046462,"title":"Angry Democrats could face Tea Party-like movement from the Left","text":"Hogg’s extracurricular activities created a crisis of confidence for new DNC Chairman Ken Martin, according to leaked audio.\n\n“I’ll be very honest with you, for the first time in my 100 days on this job … the other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I wanna do this anymore,” he said in a May 15 Zoom meeting.\n\n“No one knows who the hell I am, right? I’m trying to get my sea legs underneath of me and actually develop any amount of credibility so I can go out there and raise the money and do the job I need to put ourselves in a position to win,” Martin continued, directing his meltdown to Hogg. “And again, I don’t think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to. So it’s really frustrating.”\n\nThe DNC has voted to hold new vice chair elections and Hogg won’t run again. But Democrats are angry and want leaders who are generally younger and uniformly more willing to take on President Donald Trump. The fall of party boss Hogg is just a single example in a larger pattern. This could all lead to a political climate inside the Democratic Party similar to the one produced by the Tea Party inside the GOP more than a decade ago.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) abandoned months of yukking it up with political rivals such as Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast to challenge Trump on sending the National Guard to Los Angeles during riots over immigration enforcement.\n\nIn the short term, Newsom may be rewarded for standing up to Trump. “This is about all of us, this is about you,” he said in a June 10 video. “California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.”\n\nBut Newsom may also help position Democrats as pro-riot and hostile to immigration controls and law enforcement more generally. These issues cost the Democrats in last year’s elections and Newsom is pushing the party to the left of positions many of its candidates took during that campaign.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) tussled with security after trying to interrupt remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) hesitated to affirm his support for Schumer’s continued leadership. Schumer’’s book tour, already on a topic that divides Democrats (it’s titled Antisemitism in America: A Warning), was sharply curtailed for fear of left-wing protests.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA), an erstwhile progressive hero who has been trying to move his party toward the center, has faced a whisper campaign against the state of his mental health not all that different from what Republicans were saying about him during the 2022 Senate race. Fetterman has said he is being smeared by the “left media.”\n\nLiberals were miffed that party elders passed over progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. The Democratic caucus voted 131-84 to install Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) instead. But Connolly was 74 and suffering from throat cancer. He died in office in May. The vacancy helped Republicans pass their reconciliation bill, which extends the Trump tax cuts and funds his immigration enforcement.\n\nProgressives have been complaining about Democratic Party leaders putting their thumbs on the scale since at least the 2016 primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nDemocrats lost last year’s presidential election after former President Joe Biden was shielded from a competitive primary process. After Biden dropped out, former Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him as the nominee without any opposition. \n\nOcasio-Cortez won her seat by beating former Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of the leadership team as House Democratic caucus chairman, in a primary as a progressive challenger in 2018. But former Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost a 2024 primary to a relative centrist, Rep. George Latimer (D-NY).\n\nDemocrats may finally have an appetite for more progressive primary challengers. The Tea Party proved a mixed bag for Republicans. Conservative activists helped the GOP gain 63 House seats in the 2010 midterm elections. But many Tea Party nominees proved to be weak general election candidates when running for Senate, delaying Republican control of the upper chamber until 2014.\n\nDemocrats are currently debating whether to head toward the center or the left in response to last year’s elections.

Its pretense as a cultural marker was timed to match McDonald’s Tony Award nomination for playing Mama Rose in the revival of Gypsy. It was meant to coincide with the presumed victory of her winning a seventh Tony Award, thus making statistical history alongside Gypsy’s political makeover as a black show. But the real news, as it turned out, was Nicole Scherzinger’s win for Sunset Blvd., blocking McDonald’s ascension. Time was humiliated just as Newsweek had been for its premature “Madame President” cover crowning Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe advance planners of the legacy media machine arranged for McDonald’s coronation by scheduling Oprah Winfrey, who has never performed on Broadway, to be the presenter for the Best Actress in a Musical category. It would certify McDonald’s triumph in a way only Oprah could: as a specifically racial and womanist achievement. That confirmation of the diversity agenda would, ironically, rewrite the cultural canon and impose racial superiority. Oprah could hand McDonald the glory she had sought for Kamala Harris but was denied. (The NAACP had similarly awarded Harris a consolation prize during its recent Image Awards ceremony.)\n\nAfter the Tony loss, Oprah’s reparations for McDonald kicked in. Social media was flooded with clips of McDonald’s Tony-night performance of Gypsy’s climactic number, “Rose’s Turn.” And Oprah’s earlier video hosannah to McDonald, on Oprah Daily, was revived: “To watch someone perform at their highest vibration, a performance straight out of the soul bed. It was so stirring, her soul stirring ours, the audience, and us all having this glorified, shared, frequency experience, like she was absolutely tapped into the god source.”\n\nMcDonald herself would match Oprah’s gushing overstatement with an exhibition of highly wrought theatrics and repulsive calculation. Coming after Scherzinger’s tour de force rendition of “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” McDonald strained to upstage the competition. Shockingly, her “Rose’s Turn” emphasized all the offense of the production’s modern, Hamilton-ized racial undertones.\n\nEarlier in the week, on a CBS Morning Show interview, McDonald told Oprah’s consort Gayle King that her characterization in the Gypsy revival obeyed director George C. Wolfe’s new interpretation, reflecting Millennial race consciousness. The original 1957 Gypsy had mythified the rough-and-tumble experience of Jewish showbiz transients as they moved from vaudeville into burlesque, based on the early years of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee and Mama Rose, her aggressive stage mother pushing her daughters into showbiz.\n\nInstead of producing an original play depicting the segregated vaudeville circuits where Ma Rainey, Louis Armstrong, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, the Bert Williams & George Walker duo, and many others struggled, Wolfe and McDonald offered an anachronistic, canon-challenging hybrid of white and black theatrical history. Though set in the early 20th century, their production appealed to the Millennial social-justice fad, presenting Mama Rose — in McDonald’s words — as “a single woman who, at this time when black people were being lynched, is trying to protect these babies.”\n\nOn Tony night, McDonald attacked the scourge of racism. She ramped up the most famous solo in American musical theater, second only to Carousel’s “Soliloquy (My Boy Bill),” into her personal version of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going!” — to evoke Jennifer Holiday’s anguish in Dreamgirls and to vanquish memories of all Broadway Mama Roses who came before her. She growled, whimpered, and shrieked, using hebephrenic vocal gymnastics, swinging her arms at invisible phantoms, and nudging aside ghosts of chattel slavery with her ample hips.\n\nBy contrast, the skeletal Scherzinger transformed Sunset Blvd.’s movieland horror story into a film noir Hollywood Babylon. Her barefooted, postmodern siren sang out a film-culture elegy; she deserved the Tony for that night alone. But McDonald choose angry ugliness to tell the world “J’accuse!”\n\nAnd the PC Tony audience went nuts for it. Their standing-O followed Oprah’s cult-leader directive: “Everyone in that theater got to see Audra McDonald at her highest vibration and share in that frequency. . . . I’m still so moved and vibing from it,” Oprah emoted, testifying to a sensual, almost erotic reaction. But it was also polemical: “I walked out of there wanting to do better and be better. That is what great art does.” On Instagram, she further praised McDonald: “She’s pulling from the ancestors, the forces of life.” Oprah went tribal — part of her Jim Jones act, which was replicated in polarized social media comments about McDonald’s conniption fit.\n\nMcDonald renounced the showbiz dazzle that underscored Ethel Merman’s legendary Mama Rose prototype to emphasize the social justice politics that now dominate Broadway and corporate media. When Oprah congratulated McDonald’s fake raw anguish — “That is what great art does” — it proved this era’s ignorance of art’s true effect and purpose. We are culturally deprived, and the attempt to venerate McDonald for her unedifying turmoil backfired. Oprah and Audra sought to institute a new legend based on accusatory narcissism. Audra destroys the connection between delight and purpose that justifies Gypsy and all of showbiz. Scherzinger closed her set with the lyric “We taught the world new ways to dream.” Oprah and Audra gave us a nightmare.","summary":"Gypsy’s famous stage mother, played by shrieking Audra McDonald, is racialized in Broadway’s latest instance of gaslighting.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/the-oprah-approved-mama-rose-is-an-angry-narcissist/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audra-mcdonald-gypsy-tony-awards.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 10:30:49","author":"Armond White","authors":["Armond White"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.204},{"id":331012308,"title":"Los Angeles seals the Democrats’ leftward lurch on immigration","text":"On the day Trump returned to office in January, the Senate voted 64 to 35 to pass the Laken Riley Act. Named after a 22-year-old woman who was murdered by an illegal immigrant while she was jogging at the University of Georgia, the legislation stiffened penalties on illegal immigrants who commit crimes in the United States and mandated detention for more offenses.\n\nTwelve Democratic senators voted in the affirmative. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), John Fetterman (D-PA), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) all represented battleground states Trump carried. (Ossoff and Warnock also hail from the state where Laken Riley was slain.) Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) came from states where Trump cut the Democrats’ margin of victory to single digits. \n\nForty-six House Democrats also voted for the bill. “Most Democrats waved the bill off as a political messaging effort last year when Republicans first proposed it,” NPR reported on Jan. 22, saying the vote “marked a sharp shift from recent immigration debates on Capitol Hill.”\n\nActivists were incensed, with one group calling the bipartisan vote “a betrayal” and another denouncing it as “shameful” and “anti-immigrant.” A third advocacy organization complained the new law, which Trump signed nine days into his second term on Jan. 29, “calls for the unjust detention of undocumented people accused of theft-related crimes, as small as shoplifting, and allows state attorneys general to sue the federal government if they believe their states had been harmed by its failure to enforce immigration laws.” \n\nDemocrats seemed finally ready to buck the activists behind their dramatic leftward lurch on immigration. They had just lost 45% of the Hispanic vote, and most Hispanic men, to Trump. But the shift proved short-lived. As protesters rage against Trump in the streets, Democrats are being pushed even further to the left on immigration than they were before losing the election.\n\nThe Democrats’ new embrace of immigration radicalism is being led by none other than Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who initially seemed desirous of presiding over a pivot back to the center. Newsom attempted a rebrand from symbol of blue-state liberal misgovernment to thoughtful podcaster who was going to get Democrats on the right side of those “80-20 issues” that bedeviled fellow Californian former Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign last year.\n\nNewsom interviewed conservative influencers Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, both deeply ensconced in Trumpworld. He exhorted Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s running mate, to join him in trying to understand MAGA, even if only to figure out how to defeat the president’s political movement. “When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom explained to an underwhelmed Walz, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\nThat all went up in smoke as quickly as a car on the streets of Los Angeles, as the city was convulsed by violent protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “My understanding is that protesters essentially attempted to barricade ICE inside where they were staging for their raids, which is an activity that has been going on around the country for some time now,” Kyle Shideler, an expert on radical protests with the Center for Security Policy, told the Tablet. But things soon got out of control. \n\nNewsom sided with the mob and against Trump, who sent in the National Guard and active-duty troops to protect federal buildings and keep the peace. Newsom said it was democracy that was under attack. He seized the anti-Trump opportunity in front of him while projectiles were being hurled at police.\n\n“This isn’t just about protests here in Los Angeles,” Newsom said in a video. “This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”\n\n“This moment we have feared has arrived,” Newsom warned, harkening back to his party’s repeated warnings that Trump posed a unique threat to democracy.\n\nNewsom’s comments echoed those of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whom Joe Biden had passed over for vice president five years earlier. “It makes me feel like our city is actually a test case,” Bass told reporters in a sudden burst of federalism, “a test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state or away from local government.”\n\nThis is exactly what many Democrats and Democratic-aligned interest groups want to hear. And Trump has been known to overreach at times, so it is always possible the situation in Los Angeles could evolve, or deteriorate, in unpredictable ways. \n\nBut it wed the Democrats to a series of unpopular positions from which they were trying to disassociate themselves. “Abolish ICE” was a kissing cousin of “defund the police” that even Biden had spent years disavowing, though as president from 2021 to 2025, he did undermine the agency and limit its reach in various ways. Democrats began backsliding on that before the Los Angeles riots commenced.\n\nLike defund the police, joining the anti-ICE protests makes it seem as if Democrats oppose all immigration enforcement. So does advocacy for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, alleged to be a gang member and human trafficker rather than just a simple “Maryland man,” and Emiliano Garduno-Galvez, an arrested LA rioter alleged to have lit and tossed a Molotov cocktail at Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies. \n\nDemocrats were initially emboldened when their position on Abrego Garcia seemed to poll well. But most of those polls appeared to test narrowly whether Trump should obey valid court orders and avoid mistaken deportations, which most people would reasonably want. They did not reference the criminal allegations against him.\n\nThe focus of the protests and mainstream Democrats’ outrage is supposed to be on hardworking busboys and long-settled grandmothers who have not followed up their immigration violations with subsequent crimes. Some illegal immigrants caught up in the Trump dragnet might otherwise be sympathetic figures, and deportation quotas could lead officials to make occasional mistakes. But these are not the poster children the Democrats have chosen.\n\n“Emiliano Garduno-Galvez is a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who threatened the lives of federal law enforcement officers by attacking them with a Molotov cocktail during the violent riots in Los Angeles,” Department of Homeland Security official Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “These are the types of criminal illegal aliens that rioters are fighting to protect. The Los Angeles rioters will not stop us or slow us down. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nWorking-class voters have shifted toward the GOP under Trump in part because they don’t believe their wages should be undercut by even sympathetic illegal immigrants. Many of them believe people should be deported for violating immigration law, not just using these violations as a pretext for punishing them for breaking other laws, even if most think criminal immigrants should be the top enforcement priority. \n\nMoreover, it was the mishandling of the border under Biden and Harris that contributed to a hardening of public attitudes on immigration. A recent CBS News poll found that 54% supported Trump’s deportations, and a plurality believes they are making the U.S. safer. CNN found a 40-point swing in favor of the Republicans on the issue of immigration among legal immigrants. The RealClearPolitics polling average finds most voters approve of Trump’s job performance on immigration, with only Quinnipiac finding net disapproval. \n\nA 2024 Gallup poll found that 55% wanted to reduce immigration, the highest percentage taking that position since 2001. Only 16% wanted to increase immigration levels. While the results varied, some polls found a plurality to majority support for the mass deportations Trump was promising on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden did not take the most radical position on immigration in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He had opponents who favored decriminalizing border crossings and dismantling some aspects of internal immigration enforcement. But he did call the Obama-era deportations that took place while he was vice president, which were unpopular with progressive Democrats and immigrant activists at the time, “a big mistake.” Once he was in office, at least 8 million illegal immigrants poured across the border. The New York Times described Biden as having presided over “the largest immigration surge in U.S. history.”\n\nAfter his last State of the Union address, Biden apologized not for mispronouncing Laken Riley’s name but for describing her murderer as an “illegal.” No human is illegal, the activists would say. Not even a convicted murderer. \n\nAlthough Biden and most Democratic elected officials would never put it this way, the progressive activists who influence the party’s decision-making in this area fundamentally do not believe it is legitimate for wealthy, Western countries to enforce immigration limitations meaningfully against poor people of color. This is regardless of how unregulated immigration affects working-class citizens and lawful residents of all races and ethnicities, or what the voters want.\n\nDemocrats have not always thought or talked like this about immigration. When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) first ran for president, he told liberal journalist Ezra Klein in an interview that open borders were a libertarian concept harmful to the working class. “No, that’s a Koch brothers proposal,” the Vermont socialist said.\n\nThe backlash was swift. Vox published an article calling Sanders’s “fear of immigrant labor” — remember we are largely discussing illegal immigration here — “wrongheaded” and “ugly.” By 2020, Sanders was listed alongside asterisk candidate former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as one of the two hardest-core ICE abolitionists in that year’s Democratic presidential field. “Bernie Sanders was once wary of immigrant workers,” Vox noted approvingly in February 2020. “Now he’s on their side.”\n\n“All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,” then-President Bill Clinton said in his 1995 State of the Union address. “The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That’s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.”\n\nClinton went on to mention his immigration reform commission, chaired by a former Democratic Texas congresswoman named Barbara Jordan. But she talked very differently about the issue than today’s Democrats do. “Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave,” Jordan said. “The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.”\n\nEven the sainted Barack Obama acknowledged the moral legitimacy of immigration enforcement. While he was accused of cooking the books to make his deportation numbers look higher than they were as president, he did pursue a policy of removing illegal immigrants even if he was mainly trying to build support for “comprehensive immigration reform,” a mixture of enforcement and a mass amnesty for most illegal immigrants already in the country.\n\n“When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment,” Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope, published in 2006 before he won the presidency. “When I’m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.” (Though Obama did preface this with a confession of “nativist sentiments.”)\n\nObama failed. As president, he was unable to persuade Republicans, especially in the House, to join him in support of amnesty. Many in the GOP felt they had tried this under then-President Ronald Reagan in 1986, and it did not work. The enforcement proved episodic at best, the amnesty was permanent, and illegal immigration increased into the 1990s. (Indeed, some point to this amnesty when they look at the scenes unfolding in California, a reliably Republican state at the presidential level as recently as 1988, now.) \n\nLeft-wing activists were outraged that a Democratic president was the “deporter in chief.” They held placards saying, “No borders, no nations, stop deportations!” While Obama did not go quite that far, he then moved toward legalizing illegal immigrants by executive fiat despite arguing not long before that he lacked the legal authority to do so. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, remains in place today.\n\nThe Los Angeles riots, with their Mexican flag-waving and clashes with law enforcement, threaten to radicalize the Democrats beyond the issue of immigration. They are reminiscent of the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the anti-Israel demonstrations that unfolded on college campuses after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.\n\nUntil recently, Democrats have treated 2019 and 2020 as a sort of fever dream from which they were trying to awaken. Harris spent most of her abbreviated presidential campaign trying to obscure or walk back positions she took during that period. The excesses of the pandemic and the so-called racial justice movement were regarded as at least somewhat regrettable. \n\nTrump’s popular-vote plurality in an election that was framed as a referendum on democracy itself appeared to catch Democrats off guard. There was not even symbolic opposition to certifying the election results. In the months leading up to his inauguration and for several weeks afterward, Democrats appeared to be weighing accommodation rather than Resistance.\n\nThe pendulum soon swung back in the opposite direction, gradually at first and eventually drastically. Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency, the tariffs, and ultimately the deportations deepened progressive anger. Now, it is in full force.\n\nBORDERS VS. BUDGETS: TRUMP ALLIES SPAR OVER SECOND-TERM PRIORITIES \n\nTrump appears willing to respond in ways he only talked about doing in 2020. Invoking the Insurrection Act if the riots continue to spiral, for example, remains on the table. His allies are already referring to the anti-ICE protesters as insurrectionists. (Though Trump has also signaled a willingness to accommodate certain industries, such as hotels and agriculture, inconvenienced by his immigration crackdown.) This time, voters have rejected the progressive fever dream at the ballot box. It isn’t 2020 anymore.\n\nBut we could be in for a long summer, nevertheless.\n\nW.

She's looking to be part of a root-and-branch overhaul of the Democratic Party.Foxx is running in the special election to fill the seat for Arizona's 7th District, which remains vacant after longtime Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva died of cancer in March. Foxx's campaign, in both style and substance, mirrors that of one of her political inspirations, New York's Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: young, unapologetically progressive and grounded in her personal experience as a member of the working class.Foxx, who told Newsweek she's determined to become the youngest woman elected to Congress, hopes to bring a fresh Gen Z voice to a Democratic Party that is still soul-searching after the fallout of the second election of Donald Trump in November.Viral OriginsIf Foxx's name sounds vaguely familiar, she went viral at the age of 16 when she confronted Arizona's Republican Senator Jeff Flake at a town hall over cuts to Planned Parenthood.\"I was a teenager living with my boyfriend, working at a gas station. We relied on Title X funding,\" she told Newsweek's Olivia Cataldo in a video interview, referring to the federal program that supports family planning and health services like those provided by Planned Parenthood.Foxx says she was at \"Planned Parenthood centers to get the birth control that I needed to take control of my body and my future when I had no money, no parents and no insurance. And this is just one of those ways that policymakers often disconnected from their constituents, vote without ever thinking about the consequences for real people.\"After the clip of her confronting Flake rocketed across the internet in 2017, she became more involved in advocacy, regularly pressing local leaders to update sex-education curricula to include consent and medically accurate information, while also opposing GOP cuts to Planned Parenthood.\"We won an organizing victory to rewrite that curriculum in southern Arizona's largest school district,\" she said. \"It was my first storytelling practice as an organizer and my first win. And I never looked back.\"Born in Tucson, which sits halfway in Arizona's 7th District, Foxx was raised by a single mother relying on Section 8 housing, a federal program providing rent assistance for low-income individuals. Her mother juggled a patchwork of jobs—cleaning houses, making deliveries, sorting mail—while also struggling with addiction and working her way through recovery.\"When she was out of work, I watched her step up to help our community members make enough,\" Foxx said, recalling how her mom volunteered to cover childcare so others could take extra shifts.\"Those are my first organizing memories,\" she added, reflecting on how neighbors pitched in—offering rides to school, pooling gas money, and providing collective childcare.\"That's really the organizing tradition in which my politics is rooted,\" she told Newsweek.Life and Political Experience Foxx is the first in her family to attend college, earning a full ride to Columbia University in New York. She studied political science there, but she's quick to point out what she believes many overlook: \"Lived experience is experience.\" Her campaign, she insists, isn't just rooted in policy knowledge—it's shaped by her life.She's critical of policymakers who \"attempt to understand the implications\" of cutting programs like Medicaid or SNAP by leaning on data and cherrypicked anecdotes. \"It often falls flat because they can't actually understand the experiences,\" she said. Her official platform advocates for affordable housing, a $17 hour minimum wage, investment in early‑education and protection of social services including Medicaid.\"I have an intimate knowledge of [those social services], a personal knowledge of the stakes of what we are voting on and the responsibility we have to our constituents.\"While at Columbia, Foxx found herself thrust into the behind-the-scenes of a national presidential campaign. At 19 years old, she joined then-Senator Kamala Harris's first presidential campaign as one of its youngest staffers, leading the 2020 campaign's influencer strategy.\"What it taught me is a lesson that I took in to 2024 and that I'm taking into my own special election here in 2025 as I stick my head up to lead and to run — which was what it means to be fearless.\"Foxx says she carries that lesson forward, seeking to \"get into something. To get into a fight. Not because you're certain you can win, but because you're certain of your values.\"In the wake of the 2024 election—when Harris lost all seven swing states, including Arizona, to Donald Trump, with congressional Democrats not faring much better—Foxx said she looked around at young voters and \"felt a deep sense of responsibility.\"\"It wasn't enough for me to just work the behind the scenes of campaigns or in front of the cameras,\" she said, adding \"I needed to give them someone they could get excited about, or we would stand to lose our generation.\"Foxx said her peers were feeling \"so disillusioned and they have every right to. They feel left out. They feel left behind. They feel lied to,\" and that her campaign is offering a new leader for them to \"put their hope on.\"\"We are doing the hard work to put a new face to this party,\" she said.An Arizonan AOC? Foxx's vision and approach to politics draws obvious comparisons with Representative Ocasio-Cortez's longshot 2018 Congressional campaign that shook the Democratic establishment when she defeated longtime incumbent Joe Crowley in her New York City district.Ocasio-Cortez, then 29, ran on an unapologetically progressive platform that included support for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and tuition-free public college. The Bronx-born activist worked as a waitress and bartender, positioning herself as a voice for working-class communities and challenging establishment Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez is now so well known in national politics — even floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender — that she is one of the few elected leaders to be recognized by nothing more than a three-letter nickname.The young Arizonan candidate, who also prides herself in grounding her campaign in lived experience rather than generational political careers, says she looks to both AOC and Representative Jasmine Crockett, Democrat of Texas, as guiding leaders who \"best represent the values of the party.\"What draws her to them, she says, is that they are \"outspoken, who are clear in their values, and who communicate with voters right where they are.\" She added that AOC is respected by some even on the right because \"she's honest, she feels real in a time where inauthenticity is running our party.\"\"And I stand in that lineage,\" she stated.Even more so than AOC in 2018, Foxx's campaign remains a longshot. Polling for Arizona's 7th remains scant, but a small Public Policy Polling survey in April put her at 5 percent support, compared to 11 percent for Daniel Hernandez and 49 percent for Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late Rep. Grijalva now hoping to fill her father's long-held seat.Foxx remains undaunted by those numbers. She says her campaign mirrors the community she represents, with 98 percent of contributions coming from small-dollar donors, \"people who donate under $200,\" she explains, noting the \"average contribution is about $29.\" It's that kind of grassroots support that helped carry AOC over the line, to say nothing of the wave of support that built behind Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.In a Congress with an average age of 59, Foxx is trying to lean into the symbolism of generational change of which many disillusioned Democratic voters say the party is in desperate need.\"If everybody who told me I was too young went and told somebody that they were too old, we would be in a vastly different, political structure right now,\" she said.The Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th District is scheduled for July 15, with the special general election set for September 23.","summary":"Deja Foxx, a young progressive in Arizona, is mounting a long-shot bid for Congress. It's one that resembles that of her political inspiration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/deja-foxx-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-arizona-special-election-democrats-2084714","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662168/deja-foxx.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 10:00:02","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.178}]}
