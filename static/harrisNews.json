In times of crisis, when urgent demand vastly outpaces supply, consumers can be especially vulnerable to price gouging.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a Monday post on social media platform X that his agency was “keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton to make sure airlines are not charging excessively increasing fares.”\n\n“The Department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously,” he added.\n\nFlorida is preparing for Hurricane Milton to make landfall on its western coast Wednesday, deepening the wounds left by the devastation of Hurricane Helene, which ravaged the southeastern U.S. about a week earlier.\n\nIn areas where Milton is expected to have the worst impact, local officials have urged residents — and in some cases ordered them — to evacuate.\n\nFlights in and out of Tampa International Airport have been suspended since Tuesday morning. The nearby Orlando International Airport plans to suspend operations at 8 a.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines have added flights to help get people out of the area. American also said it protectively capped fares on flights for certain Florida airports.\n\nNonetheless, demand for airline tickets and other goods has shot up and spiked some prices, compounding concerns that companies could take advantage of consumers in a moment of crisis.\n\nThe Florida Attorney General’s Office on Saturday extended the state’s “price gouging hotline,” offering consumers a way to file complaints as the state braces for Milton.\n\nThe attorney general’s office has received more than 450 consumer contacts alleging price gouging related to Helene, which “mostly concern fuel,” a spokesperson told CNBC. The office has received more than 200 contacts related to Milton, mostly about fuel and water.\n\nThough the price-gouging panic is normal during natural disasters, just the term “price gouging” has political implications, less than a month out from a presidential election that is extremely close.\n\nDemocratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a federal ban on price gouging in the grocery sector as part of her campaign’s economic platform, though she has acknowledged that the bulk of corporations do not artificially inflate prices.\n\n“These storms and these hurricanes,” Harris said in a Tuesday interview on “The Howard Stern Show.” “When people are desperate in emergencies, some bad actors will jack up prices. We need to go after them.”\n\n— CNBC’s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.","summary":"US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg attends a Cabinet meeting with US President Joe Biden in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on September 20, 2024.  Samuel Corum &#124; AFP &#124; Getty Images The Department of Transportation said Tuesday it is in contact with airlines about the affordability of their flights in &#8230;\n\n\nThe post White House &#8216;in touch&#8217; with airlines as hurricanes Helene, Milton spark price-gouging fears appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/white-house-in-touch-with-airlines-as-hurricanes-helene-milton-spark-price-gouging-fears/","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108045022-1728418954636-gettyimages-2172407133-AFP_36GM9H6.jpeg?v=1728418997&w=1920&h=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 01:02:43","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.007},{"id":258982406,"title":"Kamala Harris Takes Lead Over Donald Trump, New Poll Shows","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\n2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, ... [+] on July 30, 2024.\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nIn a key moment for the 2024 presidential race, a national poll from The New York Times and Siena College has found Vice President Kamala Harris holding a slight edge over former President Donald Trump, positioning her as the candidate of change. The poll, which surveyed 3,385 likely voters and was conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6, shows Harris leading Trump 49 percent to 46 percent—a narrow margin within the poll’s margin of error. The results suggest a shift in voter sentiment, with Harris now seen as the candidate with a new vision.\n\nIn previous polls, Trump had maintained a lead on this narrative, but after losing the 2020 election and facing multiple legal challenges, his image as a disruptor appears to be losing some appeal with voters.\n\nThis marks the first time Harris has led Trump in a Times/Siena poll since July, when President Joe Biden officially dropped out of the race and Democrats united around Harris as his successor. With less than a month until the general election, the poll indicates the race for the White House could be one of the tightest in recent history.\n\nFor Trump, who has built his political identity as an outsider determined to disrupt the establishment and has used the slogan “Make America Great Again” as his political mantra, the recent poll shows a potential weakness because many voters now view Harris—not Trump—as the candidate representing a break from the status quo.\n\nHarris’s growing recognition as a changemaker is a critical development in a race where many voters are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Poll after poll has shown that voters overwhelmingly believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. In this climate, candidates who position themselves as fresh alternatives may have the upper hand, and Harris has tapped into this desire for new leadership by distancing herself from unpopular elements of Biden’s presidency.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nA Missile Could Not Erase Russian Drone’s Embarrassing Stealth Secret\n\nHurricane Milton: Winds Pick Up As ‘Extremely Dangerous’ Storm Heads For Florida—Here’s What To Know\n\nGmail Hackers Have Control Of 2FA, Email And Number? Here’s What To Do\n\nOne notable factor in Harris’s growing appeal is her increasing support among key voter demographics. According to the poll, she has strengthened her backing among older voters—a group previously skeptical of her candidacy. She has made small but notable gains among Republicans, with 9 percent of Republicans indicating they would support her, up from 5 percent the previous month. Though still a minority, this shift could be significant in a highly polarized election season.\n\nHarris has also narrowed the gap on questions of temperament and trust, areas where Trump had previously held an advantage, and her lead can be partially attributed to her public appearances, including her performance in the presidential debate, where she emphasized the importance of the working class in America’s economy.\n\nDespite Harris’s lead, Trump continues to hold an advantage on several key issues, most notably the economy. Many voters still trust Trump more on economic matters, and his ability to maintain the loyalty of his supporters, particularly in swing states, will be important in the final stretch.\n\nWith election day approaching, both campaigns are investing in efforts to mobilize voters, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but voters will ultimately have to choose between two vastly different visions for the future. The question is whether Harris’s message of change and unity can resonate more deeply with voters than Trump’s call for a return to his populist agenda. Both campaigns are preparing for an intense final push, aiming to win over undecided voters who could ultimately decide the outcome of this closely watched election.\n\nSughnen Yongo\n\nEditorial Standards\n\nForbes Accolades","summary":"A new poll suggests a shift in voter sentiment, with Harris now seen as the candidate with a new vision for the American people.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/10/08/kamala-harris-takes-lead-over-donald-trump-new-poll-shows/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6705d3be4bf6f38126e86eb8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 00:57:08","author":"Contributor,Sughnen Yongo","authors":["Contributor","Sughnen Yongo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.113},{"id":258982322,"title":"Howard Stern whines to Kamala Harris about Maya Rudolph’s impersonation of her on ‘SNL’: ‘I hate it’","text":"Shock jock Howard Stern told Kamala Harris that he “hates” seeing her being mocked on “Saturday Night Live” during the vice president’s appearance on his radio show Tuesday. \n\n“I hate it.

Some Harris aides privately winced as gleeful Republicans swiftly circulated clips of her response and Donald Trump swiped at her in a social media post, calling it “her dumbest answer so far.”\n\nIt wasn’t until later in the show that Harris named something that she would do differently than Biden — she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.\n\nThe Democratic nominee said she would welcome contributions from the other party “because I don’t feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.”\n\nThe interview was a reminder that friendly media venues — the women of “The View” were nearly rapturous in their embrace of Harris — can be as treacherous for politicians to navigate as hardball journalistic interrogations. And it came at a delicate moment for Harris, whose motorcade whisked her from studio to studio in New York on Tuesday.\n\nLater, during a taping of CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” the late-night host asked Harris a similar question about “what would the major changes be” from Biden. She again offered few, responding, “I’m obviously not Joe Biden, so that would be one change” — before noting that she’s also not Trump.\n\nEven though her abbreviated and unexpected campaign for the presidency is more than half over, Harris is still racing to introduce herself to voters who haven’t made up their minds about her or whether to cast ballots in this year’s election. Between “The View” and “The Late Show,” she spoke to radio host Howard Stern. The trio of appearances came after Harris granted interviews to CBS’ “60 Minutes,” which aired Monday night, and Alex Cooper’s podcast “Call Her Daddy,” which was released Sunday.\n\nIt’s a kaleidoscopic media blitz intended to reach key demographics, from men who are longtime fans of Stern to young women who follow Cooper’s frank conversations about sex and relationships.\nHarris’ decision to open up is a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, and it’s an acknowledgment that she needs to do more to defeat Trump.\n\nGetting personal has never been easy for Harris, a lawyer by training whose first job in public life was making opening and closing arguments as a courtroom prosecutor.\n\n“It feels immodest to me to talk about myself,” Harris said to Stern. “A friend of mine actually said, ‘Look, this is not a time to worry about modesty, because obviously you gotta let people know who you are.'”\n\nBy the time she was finished with the interview, Harris had, by her standards, bared her soul. Some examples:\n\nShe ate a family sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton. She works out on an elliptical every day. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother’s laboratory, and she got fired. Her favorite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, and she recommends going with a “clear head,” meaning not high on drugs, because “there’s a lot of visual stimulation.”\n\nHarris also said “I literally lose sleep” over the election because “the stakes are so high.”\n\nDuring the taping with Colbert, Harris opened a beer, with the host noting that she had “asked for Miller High Life.” Harris said the last time she had drunk beer was at a baseball game with her husband. She only took one sip with Colbert.\n\nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe “all the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don’t know anything about my life, I can’t relate to them at all.”\n\n“They want to like and trust you,” she said.\n\nJennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.\n\n“We did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,” she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that “will be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.”\n\nHarris used her Tuesday appearance on “The View” to discuss her proposal to have Medicare cover in-home care for the elderly, helping to relieve the burden faced by an increasing number of families.\n\nShe spoke about taking care of her own mother when she was dying of cancer, including cooking for her and picking out soft clothing that wouldn’t irritate her. And she criticized Trump as selfish and uninterested in helping Americans. If you watch his grievance-filled rallies, she said, “he does not talk about what your parents need, what your children need.”\n\nInstead, Harris said, “he talks about his needs.”\n\nIt was a moment that Harris’ campaign would much rather get noticed than her answer about Biden. They believe that a small yet pivotal numbers of undecided voters want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.\n\nRepublican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters’ eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.\n\n“This race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who’s going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,” he said.\n\nHarris’ name recognition grew when she became vice president, but 1 out of 10 people still said they didn’t know enough about her to have an opinion, according to AP-NORC polling. Recent shifts in her favorability numbers suggest that views on Harris may still be somewhat malleable.\n\nOther polls have similar results. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her.\n\nNear the end of Harris’ interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, Cooper confronted the vice president with one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\nSo many people, Cooper said, are “frustrated and just exhausted with politics in general,” so “why should we trust you?”\n\nHarris answered by saying “you can look at my career to know what I care about.”\n\n“I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,” she said. “I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.”\n\nMegerian reported from Washington.

At the time, Biden was serving as vice president under former President Barack Obama.\"They f***** up in 2014,\" Woodward quoted Biden saying to a close friend in December 2023, according to the Associated Press, who obtained a copy of Woodward's book before its publishing date on October 15. \"Barack never took [Russian President Vladimir Putin] seriously.\"Biden is also quoted as telling the friend that the White House \"never should have let Putin just walk in there\" and that Washington \"did nothing\" when Russia invaded.Former President Donald Trump has also pointed blame at the Obama administration's handling of Putin's invasion, which boiled over into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. During a press briefing in 2018, Trump told reporters that he had \"a very good meeting\" with Putin earlier in the year, during which the pair \"discussed about...the fact that President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken\" in 2014.\"That was President Obama's regime,\" Trump added during the briefing.Newsweek reached out to the White House press office via email on Tuesday night for comment.Biden and Trump have repeatedly disagreed over how the U.S. should handle the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. The current White House administration has stood firm in supporting Ukraine through aid packages and defense boosts. Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris has also vowed a similar commitment to securing Ukraine's sovereignty if elected to the Oval Office in November.Trump, however, has been much more elusive as to how he plans to address the war in Ukraine if he wins a second term in the White House.

Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was arrested Monday in connection with conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and getting firearms and ammunition to execute a violent attack in the U.S. on behalf of the terrorist group. Tawhedi made his initial appearance Tuesday in the federal courthouse in Oklahoma City before U.S. Magistrate Judge Suzanne Mitchell. The pair were arrested after they met two confidential human sources and an undercover FBI agent, who posed as business partners, at a rural location in the Western District of Oklahoma, to buy the rifles, 10 magazines and ammunition for the planned attack. According to court documents, Tawhedi indicated in seized communications that he planned his attack for Election Day, Nov. 5. Authorities said that in an interview after his arrest, he confirmed that the attack was intended to target large gatherings and that he was expected to die a martyr along with a juvenile co-conspirator, described as an Afghan citizen with legal permanent resident status. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Tuesday that the Justice Department would continue “to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America’s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people.” According to court documents, Tawhedi made efforts to liquidate his family’s assets, resettle family members in Afghanistan, and obtain AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition. A review of Google records showed that Tawhedi viewed and saved ISIS propaganda, according to court documents. Records also showed that in July he searched “How to access washington dc cameras,” and “Which U.S. States Have Passed Permitless Carry Gun Laws?” they said. In late August, Tawhedi and his co-conspirator tried to liquidate family assets, including property in Moore, Oklahoma, which is under contract and pending sale, the family’s two cars, electronics and other assets, court documents allege. Tawhedi’s arrest comes amid rising concerns about the potential for political violence surrounding next month's election. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that he was confident that the election “will be free and fair,” but was less certain about “whether it will be peaceful.” Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have condemned political violence in the wake of two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, who has hinted at the potential for violence if he loses in November. The U.S. continues to battle the threat posed by ISIS both domestically and abroad. In June, eight men from Tajikistan who had been on the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force radar with potential links to ISIS were arrested in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Defense officials said in August that the U.S. had conducted a military operation in Iraq that killed at least 15 Islamic State militant group fighters, including members in leadership. A month earlier, U.S. Central Command said in a statement that through the first half of the year, ISIS took responsibility for 153 attacks in Iraq and Syria and that the terrorist group was on track \"to more than double the total number of attacks they claimed\" in 2023.","summary":"Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, a resident of Oklahoma City, was charged with conspiring to carry out a terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS on Election Day, according to federal prosecutors.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/afghan-national-living-us-charged-allegedly-plotting-election-day-terr-rcna174606","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241008-oklahoma-city-ok-us-courthouse-google-maps-ac-626p-0bbd4c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 00:21:31","author":"Ken Dilanian,Zoë Richards","authors":["Ken Dilanian","Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":258980750,"title":"Melania Trump supports J.K. Rowling’s views on transgender women in sports in her initial remarks","text":"Melania Trump sided with author J.K. Rowling and husband Donald Trump on transgender women in sports, arguing female athletes should be ‘protected and respected.’\n\nThe former first lady writes about the issue in her memoir Melania, which was published on Tuesday. \n\nRowling caused a massive controversy when she revealed her views on transgender, which were seen as harmful to the trans community. Republicans, too, have turned the issue into a major political battlefield.\n\nMelania revealed her disagreement with her husband on abortion rights, which she supports, but. on transgender issues, the couple is in alignment. \n\n‘Today, some groups attempt to impose their ideologies on everyone, deepening the divisions in our society. One example is the ongoing debate over trans inclusion in sports, specifically when male-born athletes who identify as female compete against women,’ she writes.\n\n‘Male bodies generally have physical advantages – muscle strength, height, bone density, and lung capacity – that can affect fairness in competition, even at the high school level.\n\n‘Some argue that the number of trans-athletes is low, but even one can upset the balance in a female league or tournament due to these physical advantages.\n\n‘High school athletes often dedicate years to training with the hope of being recruited by universities. Seeing that dream collapse is an unnecessary and avoidable consequence. \n\n‘This issue also has broader implications, including the loss of future earning potential as professional athletes and a potential setback for equal pay in sports,’ she adds.\n\nThe former first lady, notes, however, her longtime support for LGBTQ rights.\n\n‘As many of you may know, I fully support the LGBTQIA+ community. But we must also ensure that our female athletes are protected and respected,’ she writes. \n\nDonald Trump has mocked transgender people during his campaign and Republicans have used the issue to rally their conservative base. \n\nMelania addresses the issue in her memoir, which touches on her time as first lady without getting into some of the more controversial moments, such as Stormy Daniels allegation she had an affair with Donald Trump. \n\nThe 256-page book is filled with stories from Melania’s childhood in Slovenia and photos from her private life, including her childhood in Europe and raising her son Barron in New York. \n\nThe former first lady has been the subject of many biographies and books but this is the first time she is telling her story.\n\nShe is selling two editions: a $150 collector’s edition featuring 256 pages in full color throughout, with each copy signed by the author. The memoir edition will be 304 pages and available for $40 with signed copies available for $75. \n\nHer book has some shocking revelations, such as she supports a woman’s right to choose when it comes to abortion – contrast to her husband’s position on the issue.\n\nThe former first lady wrote that she’s ‘carried this belief’ for her ‘entire adult life’.\n\n‘It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,’ Melania writes. \n\n‘Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,’ she continues.\n\n‘Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,’ she says. ‘I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.’\n\nThe eyebrow-raising admission came just one month before her husband battles it out in the presidential election with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, with abortion rights set to be one of the most decisive issues among voters.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMelania Trump sided with author J.K.

Scott Fitzgerald, actor Humphrey Bogart and jazzman Cole Porter, it still attracts famous people, such as bestselling author Douglas Kennedy who on Monday cast the election year's first ballot here.\"It's an interesting tradition,\" said Timothy Zeller, an American tourist. \"They haven't always been right, but they've been right more than they've been wrong.\"The outcome of the Harry's Bar vote has, in fact, diverged from the actual US election result only three times since the tradition started in 1924: In 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, in 2004 when George W. Bush was re-elected and in 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House.\"My mind is made up,\" said American literary critic Steven Sampson, a Paris resident casting his ballot at Harry's for the first time.He told AFP he was \"curious\" to see whether the straw poll will get it right again when Kamala Harris faces off against Trump on November 5.To pass the time until the result, patrons can sample two cocktail creations inspired by the candidates, the \"Trumpet\" -- on the menu since Trump's 2016 campaign -- and the \"Kamala Harry's Bar\".Back in the 1920s American expatriates could not vote in presidential elections because there was no absentee voting, said bar manager Franz-Arthur MacElhone.His great-grandfather Harry MacElhone decided to give Americans in Paris the chance to vote symbolically \"and have a party\" to overcome their frustration at not being allowed to participate in the real thing.American expatriates tend to favour Democratic candidates, but visiting tourists can easily make the pendulum swing the other way.In the weeks leading up to the November 5 contest, Harry's Bar posts the current score every Wednesday.On election night the final result will be announced just after voting ends in the US, and well before the new president is declared back home.","summary":"A straw poll at Harry's Bar in Paris, famous for calling US elections with uncanny accuracy, celebrates its centenary this year as Americans again flock to the drinking hole ahead of the November vote.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/harrys-bar-paris-drinks-us-straw-poll-centenary-3746010","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4552830/most-time-harrys-bar-patrons-get-it-right.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 00:12:18","author":"Emma Guillaume And Emma Vallee-Guillard","authors":["Emma Guillaume And Emma Vallee-Guillard"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.088},{"id":258980262,"title":"Mark Cuban was sleeping on the floor of a 'nasty' Dallas apartment less than a decade before he became a millionaire","text":"These days, billionaire Mark Cuban resides in a 24,000-square-foot mansion located in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Dallas.But that wasn't always the case.The former \"Shark Tank\" host recalled living in a \"shithole\" Dallas apartment with five other guys in the 1980s during a conversation on The San Francisco Standard's \"Life in Seven Songs\" podcast this week.\"I slept on the floor. If someone was out of town, I got a bed,\" Cuban said in the Tuesday episode, recounting his time in the \"nasty\" apartment. \"I didn't have my own closet, didn't have my own drawers, nothing.\"Cuban was fresh out of college at Indiana University when a friend convinced him to move to Dallas in 1982, promising great weather and scores of beautiful women, he said.\"The women are beautiful? Here I come. I'm 24 years old,\" Cuban said, recalling that time in his life.Cuban's post-college stint in Dallas was initially meant to be a quick stopover, but after a couple of months, he got a job selling software in the city.His time at that job, however, was short-lived. Cuban said he had the chance to make a $15,000 sale, which would have yielded him a $1,500 commission check. But his boss fired him instead, Cuban told The Standard.The setback was ultimately a positive, Cuban said. He started a company called MicroSolutions in 1983. Less than 10 years later, the company had grown to more than $30 million in revenue.In 1990, Cuban sold the company for $6 million, officially becoming a millionaire.After selling, Cuban said he \"made a lot of money\" and bought a lifetime pass on American Airlines to travel and party.\"I was young, single, and crazy, and there were no limits,\" Cuban told the outlet. \"I just wanted to have a beer with as many people as I possibly could, experience as many things as I possibly could.\"Cuban famously went on to appear on \"Shark Tank\" as an investor. The entrepreneur announced last year that he would leave the show after filming for this season wraps next year.The Dallas resident also bought the Mavericks for $285 million in 2000, but he sold his majority stake in the franchise earlier this year for a valuation in the range of $3.5 billion. Cuban maintains a 27% stake in the team.More recently, Cuban has been stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris, offering to serve in her potential administration and criticizing former President Donald Trump, though he says he doesn't hate the Republican nominee.","summary":"Mark Cuban moved to Dallas after college because his friend told him the city was full of beautiful women, he told The San Francisco Standard.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-slept-dallas-apartment-floor-years-before-making-millions-2024-10","image":"https://i.insider.com/66e7956ccfb7f307e571ad54?width=1024&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 00:03:15","author":"Erin Snodgrass","authors":["Erin Snodgrass"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":258980442,"title":"Trump gifted Putin a COVID test machine early in pandemic, book claims","text":"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, then-President Donald Trump sent Russian President Vladimir Putin a COVID-19 test machine, according to the new book \"War\" by Bob Woodward. \"This is a moment when COVID is running wild, not just in the United States, in the world,\" Woodward told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview. \"He gives Abbott point-of-care testing kits to Putin. I mean, these are precious assets to anyone in the world, in the country, and he gives it to him for his personal use.\"Putin insisted Trump keep quiet about the gift, according to Woodward.Vide President Kamala Harris addressed the claims Tuesday during an interview with Howard Stern, saying, \"Everybody was scrambling to get these kits, these COVID test kits, and this guy, who's president of the United States, is sending them to Russia, this murderous dictator, for his personal use?\"Even after leaving office, Trump has stayed in touch with the Russian president, according to Woodward. An unidentified aide told Woodward the former president had as many as seven private calls with Putin — although Woodward noted he was unable to speak to Trump or Putin to verify the calls happened, and he was wasn't able to confirm the calls through the Trump campaign or intelligence sources.But according to the aide, one of the calls came early this year, when Trump was urging Republicans to block additional aid to Ukraine to help the country's fight against Russia.The newly revealed contacts raise additional questions about Trump's relationship with Putin. In a recent presidential debate, Trump twice refused to say who he wanted to prevail in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Harris told \"60 Minutes\" she believes Trump would have allowed Putin to conquer Ukraine.\"If [Trump] were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,\" Harris said. \"He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on day one.' You know what that is? It's about surrender.\"Trump's 2024 campaign communications director Steven Cheung blasted Woodward's claims, saying in a statement, \"None of these made up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"Cheung said Trump gave Woodward \"absolutely no access\" for the book and said it \"belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section.\" Woodward's book also includes tales of President Biden's private frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

His wife Karen is a vital cog in the blue dot machinery.\"The ultimate goal is elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\" Conn said.One blue dot has become a blue washing of the entire area, with more than 10,000 signs and new events added daily.These signs occupy a grand visual tradition in American politics. Some date back to the mid-nineteenth century and litter any available patch of grass during election season. Each sign can represent up to 6, sometimes 10 votes, according to some estimates.Recently, former President Donald Trump pressured the Nebraska legislature to change how it allocated electoral votes and make the state a winner-take-all state. Republican Senator Mike McDonnell was against the proposal.When asked if his stance could mean that Harris wins by just one electoral vote, McDonnell said, \"That's democracy.\"He continued, \"I'm okay with practicing democracy.\"Around the same time, Republican Ellen Ehlers came up with her own response to the blue dot â a red dot with a yellow flourish of Trumpian hair.\"All of a sudden [the blue dots] just were multiplying overnight and we're surrounded as you can see.

Harris replaced Biden as the party’s nominee after concerns about his age and ability prompted him to step aside.\n\nHarris told The View she was unable to name a decision she would have made differently than Biden.\n\n“We’re obviously two different people,” Harris said, adding that “I will bring those sensibilities to how I lead”.\n\nWhen she was pressed on where she might have diverged from Biden had she been in charge, Harris said: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”\n\nHarris’s appearance with Stern, a radio host, also came with another first: Media critics believe it is her longest uninterrupted interview since becoming the Democratic nominee.\n\nWhen she spoke to Stern, Harris took shots at Trump, who had a public falling-out with the radio host.\n\nAt one point, she and Stern discussed how Trump has refused to say he would accept the results of the 2024 election even if he lost.\n\nMimicking the former president, Stern said: “‘If I win, it’s a fair election. If I lose, Kamala Harris and her buddies fixed it.’” He summed up that viewpoint by saying, “That’s delusional.”\n\n“In America, we call that a sore loser,” Harris responded.\n\nTrump was a regular guest on the shock jock’s radio show in the 1990s and 2000s, using it to boost his New York tabloid fame.\n\nHe once told Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was his “personal Vietnam”.\n\nHarris appeals to Republicans\n\nTuesday’s cavalcade of interviews came after a high-profile interview on Monday with 60 Minutes, known as the oldest television newsmagazine in the US.\n\nOn 60 Minutes, Harris suggested that a number of Republicans agreed with her views, especially about economic issues.\n\n“You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I’m talking about because their constituents know exactly what I’m talking about; their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses,” she said.\n\nHer appearance on 60 Minutes was meant to be half of an election-season special: The news programme had invited Trump to interview as well, and he accepted.\n\nBut Trump pulled out of the interview shortly before it was scheduled to be recorded, according to a statement from the newsmagazine.\n\n“It’s been a tradition for more than half a century that the major party candidates for president sit down with 60 Minutes in October,” host Scott Pelley said in a statement.\n\nPelley explained that the Trump team offered “shifting explanations” for the cancellation, including objecting to the on-air fact-checking of his statements.\n\n“Trump has said his opponent doesn’t do interviews because she can’t handle them. He had previously declined another debate with Harris,” Pelley said on Monday.\n\n“So tonight may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and Election Day.”\n\nMore important to hit the battleground states\n\nPolls suggest the race between Harris and Trump is extremely close.\n\nThe poll-tracking website FiveThirtyEight currently has Harris pulling in 48.6 percent support nationally and Trump with 45.9, a difference that falls within the margin of error. Polls for the nearly half-dozen swing states – like Wisconsin and Georgia – are similarly close.\n\nPolitical analysts speculated that the Harris campaign was initially focused on hitting those battleground states with rallies and tours, rather than giving media interviews.\n\nAfter all, she and her running mate Tim Walz enjoyed a surge of public enthusiasm in the weeks after announcing their ticket.\n\nBut as the novelty has died down, both Harris and Walz have turned to media appearances to keep up their momentum.\n\nThis week, for instance, Harris recorded a session of the Call Her Daddy podcast with Alex Cooper, which has a huge social media following: Two million people follow the podcast on Instagram alone.\n\nSaid to be the most popular podcast in America for women, Call Her Daddy gave Harris a platform to speak about how voters are “frustrated and just exhausted with politics in general”.\n\n“Why should we trust you?” Cooper asked.\n\n“You can look at my career to know what I care about,” Harris responded.\n\nShe added: “I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due. I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.”\n\nA tracking poll by the website FiveThirtyEight this week has Harris at 48.6 and Trump at 45.9, a difference with the margin on error. Polls for the half-dozen swing states are similarly close.","summary":"As many as a quarter of US voters say they want to learn more about the vice president ahead of November&#039;s

Wednesday set a 10-year deadline for American cities to replace their lead pipes — a massive project that an industry group said could cost more than $90 billion, mostly paid for by water customers.\"Folks, what is a government for if it cannot protect the public health?\" Biden asked a crowd of union members in Milwaukee.The largest city in the swing state of Wisconsin has the fifth-highest number of lead pipes in the U.S., according to the Associated Press, which cited data from the Environmental Protection Agency.Biden's announcement of a new EPA rule governing lead in drinking water came a decade after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, highlighted the continuing dangers of lead in tap water.It also came during the closing weeks of the tight presidential campaign and highlighted the issue of safe drinking water, which Vice President Kamala Harris has prioritized in her race against former President Donald Trump.Exposure to lead can cause a range of disorders and it's especially dangerous to children under the age of six, who can suffer behavior and learning problems, lowered IQs, hyperactivity and slowed growth.Despite enactment of the Safe Water Drinking Act in 1974, Biden said the U.S. still had more than 9 million lead pipes in use, a fact he called shameful, AP said.\"We're finally addressing an issue that should've been addressed a long time ago in this country,'' he said. \"We are showing up as a partner to get it done.\"Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 provided $15 billion for cities to replace their lead pipes and the EPA is making another $2.6 billion available for drinking water infrastructure to encourage compliance with the new rule, AP said.The agency is also offering $35 million in competitive grants for programs to reduce lead in drinking water, AP said.In a statement, the head of the American Water Works Association, which represents water utilities, said that it shared the EPA's desire to eliminate lead pipes and that the federal money would be \"helpful in closing the funding gap.\"\"However, AWWA estimates the cost of replacing lead service lines nationwide could top $90 billion,\" CEO David LaFrance said. \"Ultimately, most of these costs will fall to consumers through higher water bills.\"","summary":"The American Water Works Association, an industry group, said consumers would pay for most of

It was during a time even worse than now. A time when contraception was not readily available and only if you were married.\n\n\"But I feel that so many women of my generation went through similar, traumatic events and I feel stronger when I think of them. I believe, like me, they must want to fight for their grandchildren and all the young women of this country.\n\nShe said in the video: \"I had no choices in my life; I didn't have a lot of family support or finances. I had graduated high school, but no one ever said, 'How about college?'\n\n\"Nothing. I didn't know what was gonna be. And then I found out I was pregnant... I still feel very shamed about it because I was raised in the '50s, and it's ingrained in me.\"\n\nField recalled how a family friend, who was a doctor, drove her with her mother to Mexico for the procedure.\n\nShe continued: \"We parked on a really scrungy-looking street, scary. And he parked about three blocks away and said, 'See that building down there?'\n\n\"And he gave me an envelope with cash, and I was to walk into that building and give them the cash and then come right back to him.\"\n\nShe had \"no anaesthetic\" for the procedure, besides a \"technician giving me a few puffs of ether\", which gave her a sense of numbness but didn't stop the pain.\n\nShe alleged the technician was sexually assaulting her doing the procedure, which pushed her into an \"absolute pit of shame\".\n\n\"And then, when it was finished, they said, 'Go go go go go!', like the building was on fire.

Among the leaders heading the coalition are four prominent Utah Republicans: Sen. Mike Lee, Rep. Celeste Maloy, Rep. Burgess Owens and state Attorney General Sean Reyes. “President Trump has consistently stood by our side in defending both, ensuring that Latter-day Saints and people of all faiths can worship freely and live according to our beliefs,” Lee said. “His dedication to life and protecting the unborn has fortified our families’ foundations, and his leadership is exactly what America needs to preserve the God-given rights that make us strong and free.” While the church’s home is based in Utah, which has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, there is a significant Latter-day Saints population in Arizona — more than 442,879, according to the church. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 11,000 votes in 2020. Exit polls show Biden won 18% of the LDS vote in Arizona, a significant defection from a reliably conservative denomination rooted in traditional family values. Latter-day Saints voters’ steadfast support for GOP candidates has long helped keep Utah and Idaho — the states with the largest share of LDS voters — impenetrably red on election nights. Arizona Republicans signing onto the Trump-LDS coalition include Rep. Andy Biggs and Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who ran an unsuccessful Senate campaign this year. Lamb said he believed Trump would protect his religious freedom and his right to “raise and protect” his family. The former president plans to hold a roundtable with Latter-day Saints leaders on Sunday in Arizona, according to a campaign aide. But some LDS voters have soured on Trump based on his often divisive political style — as well as his attacks on immigrants and refugees — which run contrary to the denomination’s ministry and culture. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has sought to exploit this tension within the community and create a permission structure to back her instead, focusing on character and a more moderate personal — if politically progressive — style. The Harris campaign hosts a “Latter Day Saints for Harris-Walz coalition on its website and launched an advisory committee in Arizona last month. The Democratic campaign also organized a LDS coalition in Nevada this week. Others who signed onto the new Trump-LDS coalition include retired Air Force four-star general and retired general authority of the Mormon church Robert Oaks, conservative media commentator Glenn Beck and entertainment personalities “The Diesel Brothers.” In another sign of his growing influence within the Trump campaign, a campaign aide told NBC News that Donald Trump Jr. was a key figure in launching the LDS coalition for Trump, noting he has strong relationships with members of the Mormon community.","summary":"Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “Latter-Day Saints for Trump” coalition less than a month before Election Day, as the campaign looks to shore up support among a key voting bloc in which defections could be particularly damaging in key western battlegrounds.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-announces-latter-day-saints-coalition-push-battleground-voters-rcna174427","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240925-donald-trump-ew-615p-60d447.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-08 23:24:28","author":"Garrett Haake,Olympia Sonnier","authors":["Garrett Haake","Olympia Sonnier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.696},{"id":258982598,"title":"Poll: Trump Leading Kamala Harris by Two Points in Arizona","text":"Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona with a narrow lead of two points, according to a recent poll.\n\nA poll, conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research for AARP between September 24 – October 1, found that in a two-way race between Trump and Harris, Trump received 50 percent of support from Arizona voters, while Harris received 48 percent.\n\nIn a race with other candidates, Trump received 49 percent of support, while Harris received 47 percent of support.

Byron Donalds (R-FL) and Cory Mills (R-FL) were scheduled to attend the event but canceled due to Hurricane Milton being expected to hit their home districts. \n\n“When we started working with President Trump talking about [early voting], he said, ‘We’re going to build the largest grassroots organization the country has ever seen,’” Scalise recalled. “So we can go into communities that we haven’t been able to reach before to encourage people to get out and vote like we’ve never seen before.” \n\n“We will overwhelm them with the vote this time around,” the Louisiana Republican added.\n\nEarly voting begins Wednesday, Oct. 9, in Arizona, a practice Arizona voters have utilized for decades. During the 2020 election, Trump did not support early voting as he viewed it as fraudulent, but in his third presidential campaign, he has urged his supporters to utilize the practice.\n\nThe chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, Gina Swoboda, and Republican congressional candidate Abe Hamadeh opened up the event. Speaking with the Washington Examiner, Hamadeh emphasized Arizona’s importance in this election. \n\n“Having the majority leader of the House … come out shows you how important Arizona really is,” Hamadeh said.\n\nArizona’s 8th Congressional District, where Hamadeh is running, has the highest population of seniors in the state. He said residents often tell him they cannot afford groceries or pay for their lives off of Social Security alone.\n\n“They admit to me — you know, it’s so sad. These are people in their 70s — they admit to me that they have to go to churches, to go to food banks to get food. That’s not where we should be as Americans,” Hamadeh said. “They’re sick and tired of being treated as second-class citizens.” \n\nA recent AARP poll showed Trump up 2 points in Arizona over Vice President Kamala Harris, but the state is currently a toss-up among seniors, with the former president polling just 1 point ahead with voters 65 and older. Hamadeh said he was “not surprised” by those numbers in the poll. \n\n“In my primary race, we saw similar numbers as well; I think that’s pretty typical. It seems to me that people over the age of 65 too often watch the media a lot more closely. I think they have a little more trust in the media so that narrative that Kamala Harris is putting out, you know, these ads that we get bombarded with in Arizona, but right behind her is Trump’s border wall,” Hamadeh said. \n\nBorder security was a top theme throughout the event. Arizona shares nearly 400 miles of its border with Mexico. \n\n“Especially here in Arizona, the border crisis is the No. 1 issue,” Scalise told reporters, pointing to fentanyl overdoses and crime.\n\nHamdedah also said the border was one of the most pressing issues in his district.\n\n“How can we be a country when we don’t have a secure border?” Hamadeh questioned. \n\n“We have fentanyl coming in, we have communist Chinese coming in,” Hamadeh continued. “Which concerns me, especially my district, because we have all these Taiwanese companies moving into the district, so it’s a hotbed for intelligence activity.”","summary":"PHOENIX — Republican lawmakers and a congressional candidate rallied Arizona phone bankers volunteering for former President Donald Trump at one of his campaign headquarters in Phoenix.  Ahead of the start of early voting in the battleground of Arizona, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), alongside Rep.

A fiscal think-tank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, estimated on Monday that Trump's plans would pile up $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the $3.5 trillion from Harris' proposals.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nBut after significant U.S. deficit declines in 2021 and 2022 as the economy recovered and COVID-19 rescue spending faded, deficits have grown significantly during the past two years, and CBO estimates that \"baseline\" deficits, which assume no changes to current laws, will grow $22 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS:\n\nCBO estimated that total revenues rose 11% to $4.918 trillion, powered by higher individual income taxes and corporate income taxes as economic growth remained strong. The non-partisan budget referee agency estimated that outlays for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 totaled $6.752 trillion, up 11% from fiscal 2023.\n\nThe biggest growth in outlays comes from interest on the public debt, which rose 34% to $950 billion, while spending on Medicare, Social Security and the military also increased.\n\nThe year-on-year deficit comparisons were affected by the fiscal 2023 reversal of $330 billion in costs associated with President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan that was struck down by the Supreme Court. Without the reversal, last year's deficit would have exceeded $2 trillion.\n\nSome Republicans seized on the estimates to claim that Biden and Harris were fiscally irresponsible.\n\n\"President Biden and Vice President Harris have ignored resounding messages from Iowans and Americans nationwide, as well as alarms from global credit ratings companies.

The book reveals a president desperately trying to stave off war in the Middle East, fearful of Russia unleashing nuclear warfare, and worn down by his wayward son. \n\nBiden also lashes out about everyone from Garland to Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netnyahu and even Barack Obama — who Biden blames for not stopping Putin’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, raging that “Barack never took Putin seriously.”\n\nThe president has publicly said he will not pardon his son’s conviction on three federal gun charges or commute his sentence — but remains privately furious at the AG, writes Woodward, who describes how Biden told an associate he “should never have picked Garland.”\n\nAccording to the book, Biden moaned, “This is never going to f—king go away” about his son’s longstanding legal problems, including three felony and six misdemeanor tax charges, which he pleaded guilty to in September.\n\nWoodward also describes a scene between the president and his spoiled son at the White House in spring 2022.\n\nWhile the president was having dinner with a friend, Hunter came in and claimed it was he who had the most to lose from the midterm elections.\n\n“Hunter rambled on about his personal crisis. President Biden leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes and sighed,” Woodward writes.\n\nThe book, which was obtained by CNN ahead of its release, is based on interviews with those who saw Biden explode.\n\nHere’s who’s found themselves in the firing line: \n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nPresident Biden blasted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu as a “bad f–king guy,” as Israel’s war on Gaza intensified, Woodward alleges.\n\nThe journalist reveals how Biden raged to an associate earlier this year, “That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f–king guy!”\n\nWoodward describes the prickly relationship between Biden and Netanyahu as the Middle East descended into chaos following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nWhile Biden supported Israel publicly, he fought with Netanyahu behind the scenes over how the country was conducting the war in Gaza\n\n“What’s your strategy, man?” Biden asked Netanyahu during an April phone call, Woodward claims. “Bibi, you’ve got no strategy.”\n\nThat same month, Israel launched a strike in Syria that killed a top general in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, prompting Iran to launch more than 100 ballistic missiles in response.\n\nThe US, along with Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other US allies, came to Israel’s defense. While nearly all of the Iranian missiles were intercepted, Netanyahu wanted to retaliate.\n\nBiden told Netanyahu to “take the win,” but the Israeli prime minister pushed back. “You don’t need to make another move. Do nothing,” Biden said.\n\nIn the end, Israel launched a small strike against Iran, which Biden considered a win. But his frustration boiled over as the war continued to escalate.\n\n“Bibi, what the f–-k?” Biden yelled in July this year after an Israeli airstrike killed a top Hezbollah military commander and three civilians in Beirut, according to Woodward.\n\n“You know the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,” the president said to Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu responded that the target was “one of the leading terrorists.”\n\n“We saw an opportunity and took it,” he said. “The harder you hit, the more successful you’re going to be in the negotiation.”\n\nVladimir Putin\n\n“That f–king Putin,” Biden raged to advisers soon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Woodward. “Putin is evil. We are dealing with the epitome of evil.”\n\nWoodward reports that in the lead-up to the invasion, the US in October 2021 obtained intelligence which showed “conclusively” Putin’s plans to storm in with 175,000 troops.\n\n“It was as if [intelligence sources] had secretly entered the enemy commander’s tent and were hunched over the maps,” Woodward writes.\n\nWhile Biden and his advisers agreed the plan was “dead serious,” it was still hard to believe.\n\n“This would be so crazy …” Biden responded. “Jesus Christ Now I’ve got to deal with Russia swallowing Ukraine?”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the warnings, even after Vice President Kamala Harris told him in February 2022 that an invasion was imminent. After the meeting, Woodward writes, Harris said she was worried it might be the last time they ever saw Zelensky.\n\nBut by September 2022, “exquisite” US intelligence reports claimed that Putin was so desperate about battlefield losses in the war on Ukraine that there was a 50% chance he might use tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nThe book recounts a tense phone call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Russian counterpart, Minister Sergei Shoigu, in October 2022.\n\nAccording to Woodward, Austin warned that nuclear war “would isolate Russia on the world stage to a degree you Russians cannot fully appreciate.”\n\n“I don’t take kindly to being threatened,” Shoigu responded.\n\n“Mr. Minister,” Austin reportedly said. “I am the leader of the most powerful military in the history of the world. I don’t make threats.”\n\nTwo days later, the Russians requested another call. This time, Shoigu claimed the Ukrainians were planning to use a “dirty bomb” — a false story the US believed the Kremlin was pushing as a pretext to deploy a nuclear weapon.\n\nStill, “it was probably the most hair-raising moment of the whole war,” Colin Kahl, a senior Pentagon official, later said of the episode.\n\nBarack Obama\n\nAhead of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Biden blamed Obama for not stopping Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\n“They f–ked up in 2014,” Biden told a friend, according to Woodward. “That’s why we are here. We f–ked it up. Barack never took Putin seriously.”\n\nBiden added, “We did nothing. We gave Putin a license to continue!” Biden was angry: “Well, I’m revoking his f–-ing license!”\n\nDonald Trump\n\n“War” also reveals how then-President Donald Trump sent Putin a shipment of Covid-19 testing equipment for his personal use during the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Please don’t tell anybody you sent these to me,” Putin said to Trump, according to Woodward.\n\nWhen Trump replied he didn’t care, Putin told him: “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don’t care about me.”\n\nWoodward writes that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin after leaving office and details a moment at Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where Trump allegedly told a senior aide to leave the room so “he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.”\n\n“According to Trump’s aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, maybe as many as seven in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021,” Woodward writes, although Trump aide Jason Miller denies this in the book.\n\nSaudi crown prince Prince Mohammed bin Salman\n\nAfter October 7, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made a whirlwind trip through the Middle East, trying to negotiate humanitarian assistance for Gaza — only for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to keep him up all night waiting for a meeting.\n\nWoodward quotes Blinken saying, “MBS was nothing more than a spoiled child.”\n\nThe book also recounts a meeting that Lindsay Graham had with the crown prince in March.\n\n“Hey, let’s call Trump,” Graham said to MBS while visiting with the Saudi leader in March.\n\nWoodward writes that bin Salman had an aide bring over a bag with about 50 burner phones, pulling out one labeled “TRUMP 45.” Among the others in the bag, Woodward writes, was a burner labeled “JAKE SULLIVAN” — Biden’s National Security Advisor.\n\nThe 2024 election\n\nWoodward writes how Trump’s decision to run for president again came after conversations with his golfing buddy, Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\n“Going to Mar-a-Lago is a little bit like going to North Korea,” Graham said. “Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.”\n\nMeanwhile, the book claims, it was Blinken who broached the subject of Biden dropping out of the race during a private lunch on July 4.\n\n“I don’t want to see your legacy jeopardized. Anyone who is written about gets one sentence. That’s the legacy,” Blinken reportedly said. “If this decision leads you to staying in and winning reelection, great. If it leads to you staying in and losing reelection, that’s the sentence.”\n\nBlinken asked Biden: “Can you see yourself doing it for another four years? You’ve got to answer that question.”\n\n“War” also offers a glimpse into Harris’ private dealings with Biden as his VP. Woodward writes about her being concerned over Biden’s isolation.\n\n“I’m calling to ask you — to really beg you, actually — could you please talk to the president more than you talk to him?” Harris reportedly said on a call to one of Biden’s closest friends.\n\nThe friend told Harris, the books says that the president mainly called them to “swear freely about ‘what a f–king a–hole Joe Manchin is.’”","summary":"Furious Joe Biden regrets choosing Attorney General Merrick Garland to lead his Justice Department after the agency prosecuted his son Hunter, a new book claims.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/us-news/joe-biden-rages-at-obama-putin-and-netnyahu-in-woodward-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/2021-2022-medal-valor-recipients-11234734.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-08 23:01:45","author":"Sara Nathan","authors":["Sara Nathan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":258977112,"title":"Harris goes on media blitz in final stretch of 2024 race","text":"Harris goes on media blitz in final stretch of 2024 race\n Vice President Kamala Harris is appearing on several popular shows this week, including \"60 Minutes,\" \"The View,\" \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and more.

The unidentified aide said the two might have spoken a half-dozen other times since Trump left the White House.\n\nThe book also reports that Trump, while still in office early during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, secretly sent Putin what were then rare Abbott Point of Care test machines for the Russian’s personal use. Putin, who has been described as particularly anxious about being infected at the time, urged Trump to not publicly reveal the gesture because it could damage the American president politically. “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,” Putin reportedly told him.\n\nThe disclosures raise new questions about Trump’s relationship with Putin just weeks before an election that will determine whether the former president will reclaim the White House. A copy of the book was obtained by The New York Times. The Washington Post, where Woodward has worked for more than half a century, and CNN, where he often appears as a commentator, also reported on the book today.\n\nWoodward, who rose to fame with his Watergate reporting and regularly produces bestselling books with explosive reporting based on access to high-level sources, attributed his account of the continuing communications between Trump and Putin to a single Trump aide who is not named in the book. The aide offered no specific details beyond saying there had been what Woodward characterized as “maybe as many as seven” contacts. There was no immediate independent confirmation today.\n\nTrump’s campaign dismissed Woodward’s book by assailing the author with typically personal insults — “a total sleazebag” who is “slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality” — without addressing any of the specifics reported in it.\n\n“None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Steven Cheung, the campaign communications director, said in the statement. Cheung said Trump did not give Woodward access for the book and noted that the former president was suing the author over a previous book.\n\nThe Kremlin likewise denied the reporting in Woodward’s book about conversations between Trump and Putin and the provision of COVID tests. “This is not true,” Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson, said in a text message. “It’s a typical bogus story in the context of the pre-election political campaign.”\n\nWhile generally disputing Woodward’s account, the Trump campaign statement did not explicitly say whether the former president had spoken with Putin since leaving office and the campaign did not immediately respond to a question about that. But Trump’s oft-expressed affinity for the master of the Kremlin has long baffled even his own appointees, prompted investigations and troubled Republican national security specialists.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Putin had ordered the Russian government to intervene in the 2016 election to help Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a conclusion that Trump rejected, suggesting that he believed Putin’s denial. While special counsel Robert Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy that could be proved in court, he documented an unusual number of contacts between Russia and people in Trump’s circle during that campaign.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to praise Putin. He called the Russian leader a “genius” when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 and since then has refused to say that Ukraine should win the war. He has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and leaned on congressional Republicans not to approve more assistance. He has boasted that if he wins he will negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine within 24 hours and do so even before the inauguration.\n\nTrump has not explained how he would do that, but possible terms described last month by his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, sounded a lot like what Putin would want. Vance said that Russia could keep the Ukrainian territory it has seized by force in violation of international law and receive a “guarantee of neutrality” from Ukraine, which would not be allowed to join NATO.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, in an interview on “60 Minutes” on Monday night, criticized Trump’s ties with Putin. “Right now, we are supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression,” she said. “Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, ‘Oh, he can end it on day one.’ You know what that is? It’s about surrender.”\n\nWoodward’s book does not report what Trump and Putin discussed in the call in early 2024, nor does it provide details about the additional calls mentioned by the Trump aide. It quotes Jason Miller, a top campaign aide to Trump, saying that he had “not heard that they’re talking, so I’d push back on that.” But Miller also said that “I’m sure they’d know how to get in touch with each other” if they did want to talk.\n\nAvril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence appointed by President Joe Biden, hedged on the question when asked by Woodward. “I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin,” she told him. “I wouldn’t purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done.”\n\nFormer presidents meet with foreign counterparts after leaving office from time to time. In fact Trump has hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and others at Mar-a-Lago. But those meetings were publicly known, and Trump posed for pictures with his guests.\n\nIt would be highly unusual for a former president to privately talk with a top U.S. adversary like Putin without clearing it with the current administration — especially at a time when the United States and Russia are on opposite sides of a war in Europe. Biden has not spoken with Putin since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Former President Donald Trump has secretly spoken with President Vladimir Putin of Russia as many as seven times since leaving office, even as he was pressuring Republicans to block military aid to Ukraine to fight Russian invaders, according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/08/breaking-news/trump-kept-secret-contact-with-putin-post-presidency-book-says/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241008_brk_put01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-08 23:00:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":258976906,"title":"New York Times poll says Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by three points","text":"Democratic White House candidate Kamala Harris is leading her Republican rival Donald Trump by three points, according to a New York Times poll released on Tuesday, October 8th, four weeks before the US election.\n\nThe 59-year-old Democratic vice president has 49 percent of voting intentions nationwide, compared to Trump’s 46 percent.\n\nThe candidate has won the support of 9 percent of Republicans, according to the poll conducted with Siena College.\n\nHarris is trying to win over a part of this electorate based on the hypothesis that some moderate Republicans do not want another presidency of the 78-year-old billionaire.\n\nLast week, the Democrat held a rally with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, repudiated by Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, she reiterated her intention to name a Republican to her cabinet if she is elected in the presidential elections on November 5.\n\nThe latest New York Times poll, published in mid-September, found the two candidates tied at 47 percent nationally.\n\nBut U.S. presidential elections are held by indirect universal suffrage, so the outcome depends on a handful of closely contested states where the candidates are tied.\n\nThe New York Times poll questioned 3,385 voters nationwide between September 29 and October 6.

The Democratic presidential nominee announced this plan on the television talk show “The View.”\n\nHarris explained that she aimed to take the burden off members of the “sandwich generation,” who are taking care of their kids and aging parents at the same time. She said the cost of this additional paid care could be paid for with the money the government will save by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to reduce what Medicare pays for prescription drugs.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. asked Jane Tavares and Marc Cohen, scholars of long-term care, to assess what’s known so far about the plan.\n\nWhy is long-term care significant?\n\nLong-term services and supports are one of the most significant expenses for older adults. They range from nonmedical assistance with food preparation, bathing, dressing and other activities of daily living to medical care in a skilled nursing facility.\n\nToday’s 65-year-olds have a 70% chance of eventually needing some kind of long-term care as they age, and 20% will need long-term care for more than five years.\n\nThe costs associated with even one year of long-term care can prove to be unaffordable for most people. In 2023, the median yearly cost of a private room in a nursing home was US$116,796 and that of a home health care aide was $33 per hour. That’s $96,360 yearly for eight hours of daily in-home care. \n\nThe National Council on Aging has found that 80% of older adults would be unable to absorb a financial shock — such as the need for long-term care — without impoverishing themselves. The council noted that 20% of older adults had no assets at all, and another 60% would not be able to afford more than two years of either nursing home care or care in their own homes. The average length of a long-term care stay is just over three years.\n\nMedicare currently does not cover any long-term care, but it does cover short-term professional in-home care for recovery after a qualifying illness or injury for up to 21 days and a maximum of 100 days in a skilled nursing facility after a qualifying hospital stay.\n\nMedicaid currently covers about 61% of the country’s total long-term care costs, over 70% of which are for home-based services. However, Medicaid has strict income and asset eligibility requirements. Although Medicaid eligibility and coverage vary by state, those who qualify for the program are at or near the federal poverty level and have less than $2,000 in individual assets, or $3,000 as a couple.\n\nOnly 15% of Americans who were 65 and older were covered by Medicaid as of 2022.\n\nAdding to the challenge, there is a shortage of long-term care workers. In 2022, about 700,000 people were on Medicaid waitlists for home- and community-based services, and 10% of those with skilled medical needs were waiting in hospitals for spots to open in nursing homes.\n\nWhat would be the impact of increasing the number of older people getting care?\n\nAn estimated 77% of older Americans desire to stay in their homes as they age, but 1 in 5 need assistance with activities of daily living. With the high costs of long-term care and few coverage options, unpaid family caregivers typically provide this care.\n\nExpanding Medicare coverage to include professional in-home long-term care, as Harris proposes, would make it easier for older adults to stay in their homes without impoverishing themselves. It could also help alleviate burdens born by unpaid family caregivers.\n\nAlthough it will depend on details that weren’t immediately available, expanding long-term care coverage beyond the people who are enrolled in Medicaid has the potential to help many vulnerable older adults.\n\nFor example, getting professional assistance with eating or bathing could prevent health complications associated with malnutrition or poor hygiene. And this care would not be at the expense of a family caregiver who might otherwise have to leave their job or take on additional physical and mental stress to provide that care.\n\nHow much will this cost the government?\n\nClearly, the costs associated with any new program depend on many factors. The most important are who qualifies for the program, the circumstances under which they can get benefits, and how generous those benefits are. \n\nHarris has indicated that the new Medicare home care benefit she’s proposing would be paid for by the savings from reductions in Medicare drug costs. A relatively recent estimate for that savings in 2026 is $6.3 billion. If this is the primary way to pay for the program, it could finance only a very modest home-care benefit. \n\nOther long-term care proposals put forward by researchers and policymakers look at increasing the Medicare tax to pay for expanding access to this benefit. Here again, how much money needs to be raised depends on how comprehensive the program would be. Researchers at the Brookings Institution estimated that making long-term care more widely available to people covered by Medicare would probably cost about $40 billion.\n\nWhy hasn’t Medicare covered in-home care until now?\n\nWhen it was originally launched in 1966, the Medicare program was intended to cover acute medical care services. At that time, life expectancy was lower than it is today – meaning that fewer Americans over 65 were eligible for its benefits and would live long enough to require long-term care. \n\nIn the following six decades, no public insurance program like Medicare has emerged to help people pay for this care. \n\nBut as far back as 1994, lawmakers were drafting proposals to cover long-term care. More recently, legislators have introduced bills that could fill this gap. However, many prior efforts have failed due to a lack of agreement on how to pay for these benefits and whether everyone should be eligible, or just low-income people.\n\nBecause the federal government hasn’t stepped up, some states have introduced their own policies.\n\nWashington state is the furthest along in this effort. It has created a public long-term care insurance program where working Washington residents contribute a small percentage of their income into the fund and can then access earned benefits to pay for services. However, due to a ballot measure that Washington voters will weigh in on during the November 2024 elections, the program may become voluntary. We believe that letting people opt out would likely make that program unsustainable.\n\nCalifornia has also made headway, completing two feasibility studies to examine the potential of a statewide long-term care insurance program. In 2024, California also eliminated the financial asset limits for Medicaid eligibility to help expand the program so it can cover more of the state’s older residents.","summary":"Her proposal is aimed at easing the burden for family caregivers.

Donald Trump","text":"The mayor of a town that made headlines when members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua allegedly took over apartment buildings has welcomed a visit by former President Donald Trump.Aurora, Colorado, Mayor Mike Coffman said Tuesday that the visit this coming Friday would be an opportunity to put an end to some of the \"exaggerated\" stories about the gang's impact.Trump announced Monday that he would be holding a rally in what had become a \"war zone\" because of Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies.The Republican presidential candidate has frequently spoken about Aurora as an example of the ways he says the current administration's policies have failed, in a similar way to his unfounded claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.\"Former President Trump's visit to Aurora is an opportunity to show him and the nation that Aurora is a considerably safe city – not a city overrun by Venezuelan gangs,\" Coffman said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \"My public offer to show him our community and meet with our police chief for a briefing still stands.\"Trump claims at the end of August that the city, close to Denver, had been overrun by criminal migrant gangs after a video showing violence in an apartment building went viral and claims were made that TdA members had taken over the complex.At the time, Coffman told Newsweek that there were concerns about criminal activity, but these had been blown out of proportion when Aurora had supported Venezuelan migrants for many years.\"So, it's my understanding that when you do have a concentration of Venezuelan migrants, sometimes, sadly, that criminal element follows and exploits them within their own immigrant communities,\" he said.A few weeks later, the city's police department identified ten members of the gang who had allegedly caused problems for many months.\"The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated,\" Coffman said Tuesday. \"The incidents were limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents.\"The TdA began as a prison gang in Aragua, Venezuela, before expanding rapidly in recent years, according to the U.S. State Department, focusing on human trafficking and other abuses of desperate migrants.The focus on Aurora appeared to have moved on in recent weeks, with Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, turning their attention to Springfield and accusations that Haitian immigrants were eating pets. Local officials and community leaders repeatedly debunked those claims.Trump later promised he would visit both cities, saying his mass deportation plan would begin here, but he called off the visit to Ohio after pushback from leaders.Friday's planned visit, including a rally at the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center at 1 p.m. MDT, will bring the focus back onto Aurora.\"Kamala's border bloodbath has made every state a border state, leaving Colorado families at the mercy of criminals,\" the Trump campaign said in its announcement. \"The only solution to stop the border crisis is to elect President Trump, who will secure the border, deport dangerous criminals, and Make America Safe Again.\"","summary":"The city has been impacted by the gang Tren de Aragua, but Mayor Mike Coffman said stories have been \"greatly exaggerated.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aurora-colorado-donald-trump-visit-venezuelan-gang-immigrants-1966075","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2490699/donald-trump-butler-pa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-08 22:44:24","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":258976090,"title":"'Auto Workers for Trump' Admit They Aren't Actually Autoworkers","text":"Supporters at a Trump rally in Detroit held by Republican vice presidential candidate Senator JD Vance appeared wearing T-shirts stating \"Auto Workers for Trump,\" but later admitted they were not autoworkers.More than a dozen at the event Tuesday were wearing the shirts, but six told The Detroit News that they were not from the industry.\"Auto Workers for Trump 2024\" began as a countermovement to the United Auto Workers (UAW) union's endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris, but the group's support of the former president stretches back to just before the 2016 election.Brian Pannebecker, who started the pro-Trump group, reportedly gave spectators the shirts to wear on Tuesday while Vance spoke at Detroit's Eastern Market Shed 3. Newsweek reached out to Pannebecker via his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon for comment.Vance told the crowd that he and GOP presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump were not planning on pulling funding from the federal government directed at car manufacturing in Michigan, although he said the $500 million given to the General Motors plant there was \"table scraps.\" The senator also promised to be an \"ally\" to autoworkers in the city if Trump gets elected as president for a second term.Despite the UAW endorsing Harris in July, shortly after she accepted the nomination from President Joe Biden, her rival has shown strong polling among working-class voters.Harry Enten, analyst and host of CNN's Margins of Error podcast, this month said that Trump is on track for the best Republican performance among union voters in 40 years.Enten said Trump was polling ahead of Harris by 31 points among voters who graduated from vocational and trade schools. The Harris-Walz campaign has mostly focused on creating a strong middle class.Michigan has been a key focal point for both campaigns, as the parties fight for one of seven crucial swing states. In 2020, when the Wolverine State had 16 Electoral College votes, Biden won it with 50.6 percent of support. Due to census changes, Michigan will have 15 electoral votes for the 2024 and 2028 presidential elections.Polling out Tuesday showed Harris narrowly ahead of Trump in Michigan, where just a few days ago the Republican was leading. As in many polls across the 2024 election, the candidates have alternated as the favorite in key states.For Trump, winning in Michigan would ease some of the pressure on winning North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania—three other battleground states, with 51 total votes, which could be enough to push him over the 270 Electoral College finish line.","summary":"Those wearing T-shirts at a rally in Michigan said they were handed the merchandise by the leader of a group opposing the United Auto Workers union.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/auto-workers-tshirts-vance-michigan-rally-union-1966058","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2490647/jd-vance-michigan-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-08 22:40:20","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":258979110,"title":"JD Vance trolled after claiming he’d ‘never’ praise Obama - despite writing article doing exactly that","text":"Social media users have trolled JD Vance for claiming he “never” praises Barack Obama — despite a glowing op-ed about the former president seven years ago.\n\nAt a rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday, the GOP vice presidential nominee spoke highly of Obama’s response to a natural disaster as a point of comparison to the Biden-Harris administration’s response to Hurricane Helene — efforts that he has repeatedly attacked and spread falsehoods about.\n\n“You’re never gonna hear me praise Barack Obama,” Vance said, before correcting himself: “You rarely hear me praise Barack Obama.”\n\nBut X users quickly pointed out that Vance has in fact praised Obama before — in the form of a 2017 New York Times op-ed article.

He was responding to Harris’s appearance on Alex Cooper’s mega-popular podcast over the weekend.\n\n“The Vice President goes on some show called Call Her Daddy or Call Your Daddy or Who’s Your Daddy or something — Call Me Daddy, I like Who’s Your Daddy better — and among other things, she’s talking about tampons,” the senator said.\n\nCall Her Daddy is the second most popular podcast on Spotify, boasting millions of listeners and second only to the Joe Rogan Experience. It’s unclear why the senator appeared surprised that women’s health was a topic of conversation between two women on a podcast whose audience is largely women.\n\n“The people of Appalachia right now don’t give a function about tampons. They need water. They need to get out,” he said.\n\nKennedy is an Oxford-educated senator from Louisiana, not Appalachia.\n\nRepublicans have been trying to paint the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene as a failure of Joe Biden’s administration, even going so far as to call the storm “Kamala’s Katrina” on Fox News.\n\nSocial media users were quick to point out that Kennedy did not speak for the women affected by the storm.\n\n“Guess what, women in Appalachia who can’t get their monthly supplies do [care].

But she is also dipping into the world of mega-popular, not straightforwardly journalistic podcasts—notably appearing on the show Call Her Daddy last weekend. I spoke with my colleague Helen Lewis, who covers the podcast-sphere, about why Donald Trump and Harris are both spending time on these sorts of shows, what these interviews avoid, and how independent podcasters became major players in political media.\n\nThe New Mainstream\n\nLora Kelley: How does the value to the viewer of a traditional press interview—one focused on the specific issues and policies of the race—differ from that of a lifestyle podcast?\n\nHelen Lewis: Roughly speaking, there are two types of sit-down conversations in politics: the accountability interview and the talk-show appearance. One focuses on pinning down candidates on their past statements and their future promises; the other, which most podcasts fall into, tries to understand the candidate as a person. The latter aren’t necessarily soft options—being charismatic and engaging while making small talk or fielding deeply personal questions is a skill in itself. (And I found Donald Trump’s appearance on Theo Von’s podcast, where he talked about his elder brother’s struggle with alcoholism, very revealing indeed.)\n\nBut only with the accountability interviews do you get candidates pressed repeatedly on questions that they’re trying to dodge. On Logan Paul’s podcast, Impaulsive, Trump was asked about the transmission of fentanyl over the border, and he got away with rambling about how “unbelievable” the German shepherds Border Patrol officers use are. On Lex Fridman’s podcast, Trump asserted that he could easily sort out the crisis in Ukraine—and that was it. Who needs details? When Kamala Harris went on Call Her Daddy, the host, Alex Cooper, gave her a chance to lay out her message on reproductive rights but didn’t, for example, challenge her on whether she supports third-trimester abortions, which are deeply divisive.\n\nLora: From the perspective of a political campaign, are there any downsides to appearing on a podcast such as Call Her Daddy?\n\nHelen: The obvious criticism of Harris appearing on Call Her Daddy, which has a young, female audience, is that she already has a big lead among young women aged 18–25. You can say the same about Trump appearing on podcasts that are popular with young men. But both groups contain many people who will be undecided about whether to vote at all.\n\nLora: Harris has done some traditional press interviews during this campaign cycle, including her 60 Minutes interview yesterday. But are we in a new era in which chats with friendly podcasters rival (or even overtake) traditional media interviews?\n\nHelen: Well, quite. An article I think about a lot is John Herrman’s 2015 “Access Denied,” in which he asked why an A-lister—someone like Kim Kardashian—would give an interview to a celebrity magazine if she had something to sell, instead of simply putting a picture on Instagram. Why cooperate with the old guard of media when they are no longer the gatekeepers of attention? Herrman argued that the traditional media was suffering a “loss of power resulting in a loss of access resulting in further loss of power.”\n\nThat dynamic has now migrated to politics. The legacy brands no longer have a monopoly on people’s attention, and the online right, in particular, has been extremely successful in building an alternative, highly partisan media. Fox News is no longer the rightmost end of the spectrum—beyond that is Tucker Carlson’s podcast, or the Daily Wire network, or Newsmax, or Elon Musk’s X.\n\nNow candidates tend to talk to the traditional media only when they want to reset the narrative about them, because other journalists still watch 60 Minutes or whatever it might be. There’s still a noisiness around a big legacy interview that you don’t get with, say, Call Her Daddy—even if more people end up consuming the latter.\n\nLora: Are these podcasts really doing anything new, or are they largely replicating traditional media interviews without the same standards and accountability?\n\nHelen: The better ones strive for impartiality and don’t, for example, reveal their questions in advance—but many political podcasts are wrapped in an ecosystem where big-name guests mean more advertising revenue, and thus bigger profits for the hosts personally; plus, their only hope of getting a second interview is if the candidate feels the first one was sympathetic. Compare that with 60 Minutes, which interviewed Trump so robustly in 2020 that he has asked for an apology.\n\nI’m as guilty as anyone, but we need to stop treating these podcasts as the “alternative” media when they are absolutely the mainstream these days. The top ones have audiences as big as, if not bigger than, most legacy outlets. If they don’t want to hire all the editorial infrastructure that traditional journalism has (such as fact-checkers, research assistants, etc.), or risk being unpopular by asking difficult questions, that’s on them. Joe Rogan renewed his Spotify contract for $250 million. Alex Cooper signed a deal with SiriusXM this year worth $125 million. We should stop treating the mega-podcasts like mom-and-pop outfits competing with chain stores. They’re behemoths.\n\nLora: You recently wrote about The Joe Rogan Experience, which is the top-listened-to podcast on Spotify and arguably the most influential behemoth of them all. Why haven’t the candidates gone on the show yet? Who from each ticket do you think would make the most sense as a guest?\n\nHelen: As I understand it, Team Trump would love to get on The Joe Rogan Experience. The two politicians that Rogan adores are Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who are now both working with the Republicans, and Team Trump would hope to encourage some of Rogan’s audience of crunchy, COVID-skeptic libertarians to follow them in moving from the independent/Democrat column to the GOP. But Rogan isn’t a full MAGA partisan like some of his friends, and Trump recently said that Rogan hasn’t asked him to appear.\n\nIn any case, I think Rogan would prefer to talk to J. D. Vance, who is very much part of the heterodox Silicon Valley–refugee tendency that he admires. For the Democrats, Harris might struggle to relax into the stoner-wonderment vibe of Rogan, given the tight-laced campaign she’s running. Rogan and Tim Walz could probably have a good chat about shooting deer and the best way to barbecue.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThey Were Made Without Eggs or Sperm.

What do they, and Kamala, have to hide?”\n\nTrump, 78, refused to participate in the show’s presidential election special despite the campaign previously telling “60 Minutes” producers that he would take part, correspondent Scott Pelley claimed on Monday’s broadcast. \n\nThe Trump campaign has denied that any appearance was nailed down, and the former president said last week that he won’t do an interview with “60 Minutes” until the show apologizes for dismissing The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story during the 2020 campaign.\n\nThe Post has reached out to a “60 Minutes” representative for comment.","summary":"The 59-year-old Democratic nominee’s response in the TV broadcast was completely different and far more coherent than her rambling answer in a preview clip released by the show. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/us-news/trump-campaign-demands-unedited-transcript-of-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview-after-her-israel-word-salad-disappears/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/91251305.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KWIonDFY-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-08 22:33:39","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431}]}
