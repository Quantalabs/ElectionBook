Klein interviewed David Shor, the head of data science at Blue Rose Research, a Democratic polling firm, for his podcast in an episode titled \"Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won.\" When Klein and Shor reviewed numerous charts, including one headlined, \"2024 Democratic Support by Age – Split by Race and Gender,\" the pollster explained that in this chart in particular, \"One thing you can notice is that among 18-year-olds, women of color are the only of the four [race and gender demographic groups] that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men.\" The Times columnist seized on one \"shocking\" finding in the data that defies one of the Democratic Party’s core beliefs. JOURNALIST TELLS CNN THE DEMOCRATS' ADVANTAGE WITH YOUNG MEN IS ‘COMPLETELY GONE’ \"I find this part of this chart shocking. I sometimes talk about narrative violations, and if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago, it was that young people didn’t like him. And Republicans had been maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors,\" Klein said. \"But if you look at this chart, 75-year-old White men supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than 20-year-old White men.\" \"It is a real shift,\" Shor agreed. \"This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years — that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers, and maybe even in some ways more so, to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years.\" The data expert went on to discuss what he called \"the scariest chart in this entire presentation,\" which shows the massive and historically unusual polarization between young men and women. \"What’s crazy is that if you look at people under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. Eighteen-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics,\" Shor said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE While he argued it is still too early to explain exactly why, Shor observed there are similar patterns in countries like Canada, the U.K., and Norway. \"There’s a lot of research to do here, but it’s still very striking,\" Shor said. \"It’s similar to how a lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem — and it’s still somehow underrated, because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think.\" Klein noted numerous factors at play in recent years, ranging from the #MeToo movement and the rise of the Manosphere, to how \"there’s a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more a pro-women party and in some ways, sort of anti-young men. And that, in turn, had a huge effect on young men’s political opinions.\" Shor responded by stressing again that \"this seems to be a global phenomenon,\" saying he seeks to focus on the \"broader cultural shifts.\" After discussing a theory that part of the polarization may be driven by how men and women are interacting with wildly different content on social media, Klein spoke again about how Democratic narratives about an ascendant majority from younger generations have fallen apart.

I do think that, even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority became a little discredited in 2016 and 2020, Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them,\" he said. \"They thought that this was a last gasp of something and that if Donald Trump couldn’t run up his numbers among seniors and you had Millennials and Gen Z really coming into voting power, that would be the end of this Republican Party. That is just completely false, and it might be the beginning of this Republican Party,\" Klein added. \"I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago, and it seems I was wrong,\" Shor replied. \"The future has a way of surprising us.\"","summary":"NYT columnist Ezra Klein spoke with Democratic pollster David Shor about how the youth voted has shifted radically in a piece headlined, “Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-writer-says-dems-getting-destroyed-data-show-gen-z-most-conservative-generation-decades","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/931/523/ezra-klein-on-podcast.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 23:51:17","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":302818106,"title":"Ex-GOP Rep torches Bill Maher for hinting at sitdown with Trump","text":"Remember when Bill Maher called Donald Trump an orangutan and was hit with a lawsuit by an overly sensitive and litigious guy in orange makeup? \n\nRemember when Maher mocked president and candidate Trump (and his family) with nearly every breath? \n\nRemember when he harped on the corruption and incompetence and sounded the air-raid siren every week on his HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher?\n\nRemember when Maher gave a million dollars to the Democrats to fight for Senate control during Trump’s first administration — because legislatively checkmating the mad king was crucial to the future of U.S. democracy?\n\nRemember when Maher predicted that Trump wouldn’t leave the White House without a fight, then spent the four years after the insurrection telling us, “I told you so”?\n\nGood times, right?\n\nWell, they’re over.\n\nMaher — with MAGA consigliere Kid Rock brokering the most unlikely peace summit since Vito Corleone met with his son’s assassins in The Godfather ... and we know how that turned out — said he plans to meet with Trump at the White House.\n\nEven this is a bridge too far for former Republican Rep.

(Their first son Nevada died of SIDS in 2002).\n\nNext, twins Vivian and Griffin, born in 2004. In 2022, Vivian came out as transgender, changing her surname to her mother’s and saying in a court filing “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form”.\n\nThese days, Vivian is an outspoken – and hilarious – baiter of her estranged father.\n\nOne down, 13 to go.\n\nGriffin is only very occasionally seen with Mr Musk – for example, this fleeting glance of him with his dad at an event in Miami for celebrity hotspot restaurant Carbone in May, 2024.\n\nNext up we have triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian, born in 2006 who, like their older brother, have little interest in appearing in public with their father, aside from in 2022 when he took them along for the ultimate lads road trip – to meet the Pope.\n\nNot a huge amount is known about the boys, however, Walter Isaacson’s influential 2023 biography Elon Musk reveals that Damian is a classical music prodigy who excelled in maths and physics and who is “brighter” than Mr Musk, according to Elon’s own mother, Maye Musk.\n\nPer Isaacson, Damian became a vegetarian at age eight “to decrease my carbon footprint”.\n\nThat alone rules him out for ever being Mr Musk’s White House plus-one, given the president’s view that even chicken is suspiciously vegetable-adjacent.\n\nSo we have a daughter who wants nothing to do with the Muskinator and four sons who have zero appetite for the spotlight.\n\nAnd that was where things stood until 2020, with it looking like the Tesla boss and caffeine-free Diet Coke’s number one hype man was done with adding to his brood. \n\nAu contraire.\n\nIn the next five years, Mr Musk would have eight more children with four mothers in rapid-fire succession.\n\nHe had Lil X with Grimes in May 2020.\n\nHe had twins Strider and Azure with Shivon Zilis, one of his Neuralink company’s execs, in November 2021.\n\nA month later in December 2021 came Exa Dark Sideræl Musk with Grimes.\n\nThen in June 2022, son Techno Mechanicus, again with Grimes, was born via a surrogate.\n\nIn March 2024 came daughter Arcadia, also with Ms Zilis.\n\nConservative influencer Ashley St Clair has claimed she gave birth to Mr Musk’s eighth son in September 2024, while at some stage this year came another boy, named Seldon Lycurgus, with Ms Zillis.\n\nYou see the issue here. \n\nOf Mr Musk’s 14 children, they either hate him, have no desire to be dragged around by their father as part humanising accessory, part PR prop, or have not yet learnt to sit up. \n\nAll, that is, aside from Lil X.\n\nAdded to which, Mr Musk clearly feels a unique connection with the boy. \n\nEven as a baby, X “calmed and beguiled Musk, who craved his presence”, Issaccson has written. \n\n“He took X everywhere.”\n\n“I think E is really seeing him as a protégé,” Grimes told the biographer.\n\nWhich might be kind of sweet, if Mr Musk’s actual fathering skills were not on par with Mr Trump’s enthusiasm for experimental LGBT+ interpretative dance.\n\nMr Musk’s oldest daughter Vivian Wilson, in an interview with NBC news last year, described him as “cold”, “very quick to anger” and “uncaring and narcissistic”.\n\nShe recounted: “I was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn’t know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars — I don’t remember which one — and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high. It was cruel.”\n\nIt is also impossible to get away from the fact that Mr Musk’s constant toting of Lil X and all of his performative parenting is plain old weird and uncomfortable to watch. \n\nHe has described Lil X as “my emotional support human”, which is seven flavours of deeply unhealthy bordering on the disturbing. (X’s future raft of therapists are really going to have some rich material to work with).\n\nHis status as Mr Musk’s little princeling slash personal crutch slash binkie in human form can hardly be doing him any sort of psychological favours.\n\nLet us, however, count small mercies here, because it’s not for a lack of trying that Mr Musk does not have more kids. \n\nAt a 2023 dinner party, he reportedly offered to donate his sperm to a couple he hardly knew. Pass the potatoes, would you?\n\nLast year, Taylor Swift came out behind Kamala Harris, referring to herself as a “childless cat lady”. \n\nAccording to the New York Times, Mr Musk was only “half joking” when he immediately offered to have a child with her.

Now Trump aims to reverse course","text":"By Bram Sable-Smith, KFF Health News\n\nIn 2019, Cristina Iglesias filed a lawsuit that changed the course of treatment for herself and other transgender inmates in federal custody.\n\nIglesias, a trans woman who had been incarcerated for more than 25 years, was transferred from a men’s prison to a women’s one in 2021. And in 2022, she reached a landmark settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to receive gender-affirming surgery, which the agency said it had never provided for anyone in its custody.\n\nBy the time she got the surgery 10 months later, another federal inmate had also received a procedure to align their body with their gender identity. No other such surgeries for people in federal custody are publicly documented, although some people in state prisons have also received gender-affirming surgery, including at least five in Illinois and 20 in California within a U.S. prison population that tops 1.25 million people.\n\nStill, those procedures loomed large in the 2024 presidential election. Political advertising for President Donald Trump and other Republicans included $215 million on anti-trans ads, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. One such ad declared that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris supported “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” and concluded, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” Some Democrats bemoaned the ads as having helped tip the election.\n\nIn the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, 55% of voters felt support for trans rights had gone too far, according to VoteCast, a survey by The Associated Press and partners including KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Trump issued a flurry of executive orders that included a directive to bar federal spending on gender-affirming care in federal prisons and to “ensure that males are not detained” in federal women’s facilities.\n\n“President Trump received an overwhelming mandate from the American people to restore commonsense principles and safeguard women’s spaces — even prisons — from biological men,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email. “Forcing taxpayers to pay for gender transition for prisoners is the exact sort of insanity that the American people rejected at the ballot box in November.”\n\nBut for Iglesias, 50, Trump’s order was a shocking reversal.\n\n“It puts someone’s life in danger being in a men’s prison as a trans woman,” she said from Chicago, where she’s lived since her release in 2023. “It’d be like putting sheep in a hyenas’ den.”\n\nIglesias said she faced emotional and physical abuse from her father for her desire to be female. When she was 12, she said, he put a gun in her mouth after finding her wearing her sister’s clothes. Iglesias said she ran away from home, stole checks, cars, and jewelry, and ended up in jail.Lockup was not fun, Iglesias said, but it was the first place she got to be treated as a woman. So, she said, she wanted to stay. In 1994, she landed in federal prison after writing threatening letters to federal judges and prosecutors, according to court filings. In 2005, records show, she pleaded guilty to sending a letter to British officials that she falsely claimed contained anthrax. She told investigators she hoped to get extradited.\n\n“I was reading these things where they were allowing trans females to start living with females,” Iglesias said.\n\nShe said her outlook changed after the death of her mother in 2010, which prompted her to get serious about having a life outside of prison, and about improving her life inside it.\n\nShe began requesting hormone therapy in 2011 and was approved for it in 2015, according to court records. The 2019 lawsuit that led to her transfer to a women’s prison and her surgery was initially handwritten and prepared with the help of only another inmate.\n\n“The lawsuit was the foundation for everything that I am today,” Iglesias said. “For the first time in my life, instead of digging myself in these holes, I was digging myself out.”\n\nAlong with her settlement, Iglesias received a commitment from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to create a timeline for considering other inmates’ requests for gender-affirming care, and to recognize permanent hair removal and gender-affirming surgery as medically necessary treatments for gender dysphoria — a medical condition in which the discrepancy between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth causes significant distress.\n\nIn February, in response to Trump’s executive order, the bureau issued new guidelines requiring prison staffers to refer to inmates’ “legal name or pronouns corresponding to their biological sex,” and ending clothing requests “that do not align with an inmate’s biological sex.” The guidelines end referrals for gender-affirming surgery but allow inmates already receiving treatment, such as hormone therapy, to continue.\n\nHowever, in a lawsuit filed March 7, a trans prisoner alleged the hormone therapy she had been receiving since 2016 was stopped on Jan. 26.\n\nSpokespeople for the bureau did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe bureau spent $153,000 on hormone therapy in fiscal year 2022, its former director told Congress, 0.01% of its total spending on health care.\n\nThe new guidelines on trans inmates say that Trump’s executive order “does not supersede or change” the obligation to comply with federal regulations. But the executive order calls for amending them to prevent trans women from being housed in women’s prisons.\n\n“It hurt my heart when I seen that because I do know other girls that are still in prison,” said Iglesias, who spent more than 25 years in male facilities. “Female prison is safe for a trans woman, and you can be who you are. You’re not penalized because you’re feminine.”\n\nBut requesting a transfer to a facility matching inmates’ gender identity had not been easy, and few prisoners had been moved before the order. A 2025 government court filing said that federal prisons house 2,198 trans prisoners out of over 155,000 inmates. Of those, the filing said, 22 are trans women housed in female facilities, and one is a trans man in a men’s facility. Although courts have blocked attempts to move that small subset of trans prisoners after the order, a trans prisoner not included in those suits had been relocated, The Guardian news outlet reported.\n\nA Department of Justice report from 2014 estimated that trans inmates in state and federal prisons were 10 times as likely as other prisoners to report incidents of sexual victimization.\n\nIglesias said she experienced such violence firsthand.

Now Trump aims to reverse course","text":"By Bram Sable-Smith, KFF Health News\n\nIn 2019, Cristina Iglesias filed a lawsuit that changed the course of treatment for herself and other transgender inmates in federal custody.\n\nIglesias, a trans woman who had been incarcerated for more than 25 years, was transferred from a men’s prison to a women’s one in 2021. And in 2022, she reached a landmark settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to receive gender-affirming surgery, which the agency said it had never provided for anyone in its custody.\n\nBy the time she got the surgery 10 months later, another federal inmate had also received a procedure to align their body with their gender identity. No other such surgeries for people in federal custody are publicly documented, although some people in state prisons have also received gender-affirming surgery, including at least five in Illinois and 20 in California within a U.S. prison population that tops 1.25 million people.\n\nStill, those procedures loomed large in the 2024 presidential election. Political advertising for President Donald Trump and other Republicans included $215 million on anti-trans ads, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. One such ad declared that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris supported “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” and concluded, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” Some Democrats bemoaned the ads as having helped tip the election.\n\nIn the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, 55% of voters felt support for trans rights had gone too far, according to VoteCast, a survey by The Associated Press and partners including KFF, the health policy research, polling, and news organization that includes KFF Health News.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Trump issued a flurry of executive orders that included a directive to bar federal spending on gender-affirming care in federal prisons and to “ensure that males are not detained” in federal women’s facilities.\n\n“President Trump received an overwhelming mandate from the American people to restore commonsense principles and safeguard women’s spaces — even prisons — from biological men,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email. “Forcing taxpayers to pay for gender transition for prisoners is the exact sort of insanity that the American people rejected at the ballot box in November.”\n\nBut for Iglesias, 50, Trump’s order was a shocking reversal.\n\n“It puts someone’s life in danger being in a men’s prison as a trans woman,” she said from Chicago, where she’s lived since her release in 2023. “It’d be like putting sheep in a hyenas’ den.”\n\nIglesias said she faced emotional and physical abuse from her father for her desire to be female. When she was 12, she said, he put a gun in her mouth after finding her wearing her sister’s clothes. Iglesias said she ran away from home, stole checks, cars, and jewelry, and ended up in jail.Lockup was not fun, Iglesias said, but it was the first place she got to be treated as a woman. So, she said, she wanted to stay. In 1994, she landed in federal prison after writing threatening letters to federal judges and prosecutors, according to court filings. In 2005, records show, she pleaded guilty to sending a letter to British officials that she falsely claimed contained anthrax. She told investigators she hoped to get extradited.\n\n“I was reading these things where they were allowing trans females to start living with females,” Iglesias said.\n\nShe said her outlook changed after the death of her mother in 2010, which prompted her to get serious about having a life outside of prison, and about improving her life inside it.\n\nShe began requesting hormone therapy in 2011 and was approved for it in 2015, according to court records. The 2019 lawsuit that led to her transfer to a women’s prison and her surgery was initially handwritten and prepared with the help of only another inmate.\n\n“The lawsuit was the foundation for everything that I am today,” Iglesias said. “For the first time in my life, instead of digging myself in these holes, I was digging myself out.”\n\nAlong with her settlement, Iglesias received a commitment from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to create a timeline for considering other inmates’ requests for gender-affirming care, and to recognize permanent hair removal and gender-affirming surgery as medically necessary treatments for gender dysphoria — a medical condition in which the discrepancy between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth causes significant distress.\n\nIn February, in response to Trump’s executive order, the bureau issued new guidelines requiring prison staffers to refer to inmates’ “legal name or pronouns corresponding to their biological sex,” and ending clothing requests “that do not align with an inmate’s biological sex.” The guidelines end referrals for gender-affirming surgery but allow inmates already receiving treatment, such as hormone therapy, to continue.\n\nHowever, in a lawsuit filed March 7, a trans prisoner alleged the hormone therapy she had been receiving since 2016 was stopped on Jan. 26.\n\nSpokespeople for the bureau did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe bureau spent $153,000 on hormone therapy in fiscal year 2022, its former director told Congress, 0.01% of its total spending on health care.\n\nThe new guidelines on trans inmates say that Trump’s executive order “does not supersede or change” the obligation to comply with federal regulations. But the executive order calls for amending them to prevent trans women from being housed in women’s prisons.\n\n“It hurt my heart when I seen that because I do know other girls that are still in prison,” said Iglesias, who spent more than 25 years in male facilities. “Female prison is safe for a trans woman, and you can be who you are. You’re not penalized because you’re feminine.”\n\nBut requesting a transfer to a facility matching inmates’ gender identity had not been easy, and few prisoners had been moved before the order. A 2025 government court filing said that federal prisons house 2,198 trans prisoners out of over 155,000 inmates. Of those, the filing said, 22 are trans women housed in female facilities, and one is a trans man in a men’s facility. Although courts have blocked attempts to move that small subset of trans prisoners after the order, a trans prisoner not included in those suits had been relocated, The Guardian news outlet reported.\n\nA Department of Justice report from 2014 estimated that trans inmates in state and federal prisons were 10 times as likely as other prisoners to report incidents of sexual victimization.\n\nIglesias said she experienced such violence firsthand. Included in her suit was a copy of a 2017 psychological report that said Iglesias reported being the victim of sexual misconduct or abuse in 1993, 2001, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Later filings included allegations of having been raped in 2019 and 2020, and a series of rapes, threats, and other abuse in 2021 before she was transferred to a female facility. Iglesias said she faced more abuse than she officially reported.\n\n“Just because you commit a crime doesn’t mean you deserve to have violence against you,” said Michelle García, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Illinois and one of the attorneys who ultimately represented Iglesias.\n\nFederal law requires all inmates to be protected from abuse.

JD Vance Makes Big Allegations About Former VP","text":"Vice President JD Vance recently made a wild claim about his predecessor, Kamala Harris. He said that her famous “word salads” might’ve had a little something to do with knocking back some alcohol before meetings. He threw shade at her on Vince Coglianese’s podcast, saying he doesn’t “have four shots of vodka before every meeting.” \n\nThis has stirred the pot in the political world, with some slamming his words as made up, while his fans are all for it.\n\nThis dig comes after Vance had a heated exchange with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, which has people talking even more about him. He’s not afraid to say what’s on his mind, even if it upsets some people. \n\nThe folks at the White House haven’t said anything about it yet. And as for Harris, she’s keeping mum now that she’s with CAA Speakers. She’s probably too busy with her new gig to worry about this.\n\nVance took to the podcast world to set himself apart from Harris, saying he has a more down-to-earth approach to being VP. \n\n“That’s one way I think that Kamala really tried to bring herself into the role—these word salads. I think I would need the help of a lot of alcohol to answer a question the way Kamala Harris answered questions,” Vance said.\n\nThis ex-Ohio senator doesn’t usually hit the bottle before sitting down for talks, and he implied that Harris might need a drink or two to get through her job. The Conservatives have been trying to paint Harris as not really cutting it as VP since Biden’s team took over.\n\nOver the last seven days, communities in Southern California have experienced horrific loss due to wildfires.

I feel empowered in a way that I think a lot of vice presidents haven’t been.”\nIf taxes are cut, the Kennedy and Epstein files are released, and other promises are kept—will you stand with JD Vance in 2028?\n\nYes or No? pic.twitter.com/40GroGnA7L\n— Barron 🇺🇸 NEWS (@_NewsBarron) March 17, 2025\n\nHarris often gets teased about the way she talks, especially when she says things that seem pointless or hard to understand. In September 2024, she said something that really got people talking. She told everyone, “I grew up understanding the children of the community are the children of the community.” It’s saying the same thing twice, and it’s a line that keeps coming back to haunt her on social media from people on the right.\n\nBut some on her side say that all the fuss about what she says is way over the top and unfair. They think she’s being picked on more than other vice presidents because she’s a woman. \n\nThen there’s JD Vance, who’s been in hot water, too, for some things he’s said. His comments have upset a lot of people, with many calling him out for just throwing mud without any good reason. “This is nothing more than a desperate attempt to smear a former vice president with misogynistic tropes,” tweeted Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Vance, though, isn’t letting it get to him too much. \n\nLooks like things are getting nasty in the 2026 midterm elections, with people attacking each other’s personal lives and characters more than ever before.","summary":"JD Vance’s claim about Kamala Harris drinking before meetings has ignited political controversy and fueled debates over leadership and professionalism.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/did-kamala-harris-drink-before-meetings-jd-vance-makes-big-allegations-about-former-vp","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JD-Vance-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 21:02:29","author":"Sohini","authors":["Sohini"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.014},{"id":302793188,"title":"JD Vance is winning—as the most unpopular vice president","text":"When JD Vance puts his eyeliner on in the morning, he probably doesn’t anticipate being the least-liked vice president in U.S. history thus far. \n\nBut according to Real Clear Polling, that’s the sentiment reverberating across the nation as of late.

Vance’s boss took over the Kennedy Center earlier this year by booting out the institution’s president and holding what some people called a sham election to make himself chair. This sparked a massive protest not only from staff members but from stars with shows on the calendar. The wildly successful Broadway show “Hamilton” was set to run at the Kennedy Center in 2025, but canceled its dates after the takeover. \n\nOne of the many ways Vance has made enemies of the American public is through his comments about women’s reproductive rights. The GOP venture capitalist has made it clear he’s all about ending abortion access and has paraded around on the concept of slamming “childless cat ladies.”\n\nThe politician has also been called out plenty of times for how jarringly far right, and as MSNBC host Rachael Maddow says, pro-fascist, his views are. \n\nEven his own family has distanced themselves as he continues to insert his foot in his mouth.\n\nThe internet, including his own far-right fan base, even made fun of Vance earlier this month by turning him into a slew of memes. Following the meeting with Zelenskyy, a multitude of memes began to circulate showing different edits of Vance’s blown up, shrunken, or heavily altered head. \n\nAll in all, the VP doesn’t seem to be gaining any fans, even on his own team.","summary":"When JD Vance puts his eyeliner on in the morning, he probably doesn’t anticipate being the least-liked vice president in U.S. history thus far. \n\n\n\nBut according to Real Clear Polling, that’s the sentiment reverberating across the nation as of late.

Many say those two words have no business being next to each other. But despite the constant criticism that Black MAGA leaders face, folks like Candace Owens and Mark Robinson continue to make their political party proud... so they say.\n\nOn the flip side, others like journalist Don Lemon, argue there’s no way in hell any person can be both Black and “rational MAGA.” The reason why? Well, he says a large part of the MAGA movement is soaking in racist ideals. From continuous attacks on immigrants to President Donald Trump’s anti-DEI agenda and verbal attacks on former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris, it’s clear there’s some discrepancies between Black MAGA supporters and the agenda they choose to follow. \n\nSo now, The Root is looking at all of the colorful and flat out racist statements previously made by Black MAGA politicians... \n\nMark Robinson Calls Obama “Sh*t”\n\nFormer N.C. Lieutenant Gov. Mark Robinson is no stranger to controversy, as the MAGA-backed politician is notorious for his divisive and borderline offensive political rhetoric. In 2012, Robinson said he’d “take Hitler over any of the sh*t that’s in Washington right now!” about former President Barack Obama.\n\nHerschel Walker\n\n Over the years, former NFL player Herschel Walker has expressed his love for the president, but what’s more interesting is his commitment to separating himself from his race. Walker previously said the country is fully past racism. “You’re not a racist unless you’re 185 years old in today’s world,” Walker said in October at the Memory Lane Classic Car Museum, according to NBC News. \n\nCandace Owens Calls Fani Willis A “Ghetto Superstar”\n\nConservative pundit Candace Owens has created her brand by saying the most outrageous and offensive things imaginable. Last year, Owens attacked Ga. District Attorney Fani Willis, calling her a “ghetto superstar.” Additionally, Owens said “Love and Hip Hop” should give her and her special prosecutor Wade a call before mocking Willis’ use of ebonics.\n\nBen Carson Enables Trump\n\nThe surgeon and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development knows how to stir up trouble while also keeping his nose clean. But sometimes, endorsing foolish is worse than spewing it. In 2020, he defended accusations claiming Trump was racist. “President Trump does not dabble in identity politics. He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, ‘a rising tide lifts all boats,’” Carson said. “Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong.”\n\n Byron Donalds Agrees VP Kamala Harris “Turned Black”\n\nRemember when MAGA began spewing that nonsense that former Vice President Kamala Harris “turned Black?” Well, Fla. Rep. Byron Donalds was one of the many MAGA supporters who perpetuated the notion. “This is really a phony controversy,” Donalds said. “I don’t really care, most people don’t, but if we’re going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was AP that said she was the Indian-American United States senator. It was actually played up a lot,” citing the Associated Press.\n\nLarry Elder Claims Black Folks “Exaggerate” Racism\n\nIf you have no clue who this guy is, we don’t blame you. The radio host previously launched a bid for president but ended his campaign in 2023. Larry Elder is no stranger to controversy, however. He previously said “Blacks exaggerate the significance of racism” and “women exaggerate the problem of sexism.”\n\nCandace Owens Calls BLM a “Terrorist” Organization\n\nOf course, Owens would make another appearance on this list... During the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, Owens said BLM was a “terrorist” organization.\n\nDaniel Cameron’s “War on Woke”\n\nAfter losing his race for Kentucky Governor, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron pivoted to attacking “woke,” just as many of his MAGA colleagues do. “We will shine a bright light on those whose ideological agendas seek to dismantle American freedom and prosperity,” Cameron said in a news release. “We will stop investment management firms, elected officials and corporate interests from using other people’s money to advance their radical political agendas.”\n\nJason Whitlock Says LeBron James Is too Rich to Suffer From Racism\n\nThe former sports columnist and show host knows exactly how to offend Black folks. Back in 2017, he said NBA legend LeBron James was too rich to be a victim of racism. “LeBron James whether he likes it or not or whether people close to him are telling him or not, he has removed himself from the damages and ravages of real racism,” Whitlock said.\n\nMark Robinson Declares Himself a Nazi\n\nOf the many racially motivated comments made by Robinson, perhaps the most shocking came after CNN exposed him for allegedly having a secret account on a pornography website. According to CNN, Robinson called himself a “black NAZI” on the porn site... among other things.\n\nCandace Owens Blames George Floyd for His Death\n\nSurprise, surprise... she’s back! It’s clear the MAGA supporter will stoop low t0 get her point across. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Owens became an avid critic of the Black father. She even blamed him for his own killing. Since her insensitive comments, Floyd’s family expressed plans to sue in response.\n\nClarence Thomas’ Mistruths About Welfare\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court justice has caught flak over his conservative views, including suggesting the court reconsider past rulings on same sex marriage.

He has taken a radically different approach to both conflicts than Joe Biden, and in some cases produced results. \nWhat he has not done is end either war. In fact, this week, resolution to both conflicts seemed farther off than ever. \nThe fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which came into effect shortly before Trump took office, shattered after Israel launched airstrikes that killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and resumed large-scale ground operations. Hamas has also resumed firing rockets into central Israel, and the situation is rapidly sliding back into full-scale war. \nAlso this week, during a phone call with Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin effectively rejected a proposed 30-day ceasefire — which Ukraine had earlier, under US pressure, agreed to. Russia and Ukraine did agree to a mutual halt in attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure, but this has not stopped mass drone attacks from both sides, including a Russian attack on a hospital that took place just hours after the pause was announced. \nThe two sides will hold talks — via US intermediaries — in Saudi Arabia next week, and the Trump team is reportedly hoping to rapidly move toward a full ceasefire, but stark differences remain between the two sides’ negotiating positions. So, barring a miracle at the negotiating table, the war in Ukraine doesn’t seem any closer to a resolution now than it did in January. The war in Gaza seems farther from one. \nWhat does this tell us? First, an obvious but important point: Ending wars is harder than starting them. Hamas and Israel still have essentially incompatible demands for a final ceasefire. Putin has given no indication, either in his public statements or in US intelligence assessments, that he is interested in ending the war with anything other than complete Ukrainian capitulation. \nIt would be unrealistic to expect any American administration to end two intractable foreign wars in its first two months. If Trump is being held to that standard, it’s only because he himself suggested during his campaign that he could end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours,” a promise he said this week may have been “a little bit sarcastic.” It also shows the limits to Trump’s unpredictable style of diplomacy.\nThe state of affairs in Gaza and Ukraine, briefly explained\nOn Gaza, Trump started strong in January, when the incoming president’s team worked with the outgoing Biden administration to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. \nBoth Biden administration officials and regional governments credited Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, with applying the kind of pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to compromise that had been missing from the Biden team’s approach for months. \nBut that deal was just “phase one” of a ceasefire, intended to last six weeks, during which Israel and Hamas were supposed to negotiate a permanent end to hostilities. Phase one saw the release of 33 Israeli hostages and nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, but it expired at the beginning of March with no deal in sight.\nFundamentally, Israel is still unwilling to agree to any permanent settlement that leaves Hamas in place, and is also unwilling to countenance the Palestinian Authority taking over governance of the strip, as the Biden administration wanted. Hamas is unwilling to disarm, unlikely to give up the remaining hostages that are its main remaining source of leverage, and probably won’t be swayed by the prospect of more Palestinian civilians being killed. \nTrump, of course, had other ideas of how to resolve the conflict, suggesting that the US should take ownership of Gaza, “clean out” its civilian population, and redevelop it as a beachfront resort. \nAnd so the ceasefire has now been effectively taken off life support. Restarting the war has allowed Netanyahu to reconstitute his right-wing government, avoiding early elections. For the moment at least, he has the full support of the Trump administration. Meanwhile, a brief respite in the suffering of the people of Gaza has ended and hope is dimming for the remaining hostages. \n[Image: A Palestinian family cooks food on the roof of a partially demolished building in Beit Lahia, Gaza Strip, on March 17, 2025. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/gettyimages-2205140631.jpg?quality=90&strip=all]\nIn Ukraine, it’s now been about five weeks since Trump upended US policy by opening direct negotiations with Russia — without Ukraine present — which was followed closely by the televised public dressing down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, and the US halting weapons deliveries and intelligence cooperation with Ukraine. It appeared to many as if the US was not just changing its approach to the conflict, but changing sides.\nIn the end, however, it’s unclear how much actually changed after a month of drama. The war is raging as fiercely as ever, and after a brief pause, the US has resumed weapons deliveries. Recent events may ultimately have had a bigger effect on US relations with Europe than they did on the course of the war: NATO allies are questioning the alliance’s long-sacrosanct security guarantees, and heads of state everywhere are forced to question whether they really want to visit the White House if it entails a risk of getting the kind of treatment Trump and Vice President JD Vance dished out to Zelenskyy. \nArguably, the Ukrainians gained a rhetorical victory by agreeing to a ceasefire that the Russians then rejected. It could also conceivably bolster the case of the more Ukraine-sympathetic members of the administration. Before presenting the deal to Moscow, Secretary of State Macro Rubio had said that the “ball is now in Russia’s court” and that, “If they say no, we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment to peace is here.”\nBut for now, there are few signs the White House is preparing to exert any pressure on Russia to accept a broader ceasefire, and in fact may be preparing more concessions on Ukraine’s behalf. In stark contrast to his treatment of Zelenskyy, Trump has said nothing but positive things about his interactions with Putin. Witkoff, the New York real estate developer turned all-purpose diplomat who is now Trump’s point man on both the Middle East and Ukraine, is defending Russia’s drone strikes by saying they came before the pause went into effect and promising potential US-Russia energy cooperation. \nTrump’s “break stuff” diplomacy\nTrump’s willingness to break norms and radically shift policy can sometimes produce diplomatic results. \nHis threats to pull US troops out of Syria reportedly gave the US military leverage to negotiate a deal between Kurdish forces in Syria and the country’s new government, forestalling, at least for the time being, a new deadly conflict that many feared after the fall of the Assad regime. \nTrump has been criticized for speaking directly to Putin over Ukraine and more recently, having his envoy negotiate directly with Hamas over a US citizen held hostage. (There was a time when Republicans attacked presidential candidate Barack Obama for saying he’d be willing to talk directly to US adversaries “without preconditions.”) \nStill, when it comes to Ukraine, there’s a case to be made that Trump and his officials are merely publicly acknowledging what the Biden team privately acknowledged: that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to retake all its territory by military means, even with US support. \nWhen Trump began talks with Russia in February, Samuel Charap, a RAND Corporation analyst and former State Department official who has advocated negotiations to end the war, told me that he credited the Trump team with having “demonstrated the political will to restore bilateral channels” with Russia, but added, “my concern is just that they’re diving into this quite hastily without a coordinated plan about what to do about the war.”\nLikewise on Gaza, the Trump administration took office with a ceasefire in place that they could claim some credit for — but now appears to have given up on it. \n“There is a certain advantage to being totally untethered from normal conventions like the Trump administration is. You can just go in and try new things and break stuff and maybe some of it is a good idea,” Ilan Goldenberg, a Mideast specialist who served in the Biden administration and on the Kamala Harris campaign, wrote recently, discussing the blow-up over direct talks between the US and Hamas. “On the other hand, rigor, knowledge, and preparation also matter a great deal if you want to negotiate complex deals.”\nThe two attitudes combined in January, he said, to reach the initial Gaza ceasefire. \nUltimately, the limit of Trump’s approach may be how disconnected from reality it often is. Trump’s AI-constructed fever dreams of a Gaza beach resort have distracted from work on developing an actual workable plan for Gaza’s future and legitimized the most extreme aims of Israel’s annexationist right. \nSome Trump officials, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, suggested Trump’s nonsensical vision was a pressure tactic to induce regional governments to come up with their own solutions. \nBut when Arab governments did exactly that, presenting their own (admittedly flawed) Gaza reconstruction plan in early March, the White House immediately rejected it, sticking with Trump’s vision of a Levantine “riviera” cleansed of Palestinians. As with Greenland and Canada, it does appear Trump is serious about this.\nOn Ukraine, Trump’s views of the conflict appear heavily influenced by Russia itself, or at least its sympathizers in the US, including his inaccurate comments suggesting that it was Ukraine that started the war and that Zelenskyy is a highly unpopular “dictator.” \nMore recently, he claimed that Ukrainian troops are “completely surrounded” in Russia’s Kursk province and at risk of being massacred. This jibes with Putin’s own claims about the situation in Kursk, but not US intelligence assessments. (Ukrainian forces in Kursk are steadily losing ground but are not encircled.)\nMore fundamentally, he consistently claims that Putin is interested in ending the war and that it’s only a matter of Ukraine ceding territory, despite little evidence that this is the case. \nTrump’s unpredictable approach and willingness to break the unwritten rules of international diplomacy can sometimes help get adversaries talking. But it’s hard to get actual results without engaging with the reality of the situation.","summary":"Put the Nobel Peace Prize on hold for just a bit.&#160; President Donald Trump came into office promising a swift end to two wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

(Bildnachweis: REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz) (credit: REUTERS/ELIZABETH FRANTZ)Challenges of political identity after October 7, 2023These days, Trump is back in power and immigrants and LGBTQ Americans are back in the crosshairs. But Zlotnitsky isn’t feeling up for a fight — especially one where he feels lonely as a Israeli American and Jew.“Jews and antisemitism are [at] the water’s edge. I’m not willing to go much further than that with anyone if they’re not with me there,” he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “I struggle not to cry, to this moment, whenever I confront anything from Oct. 7,” he said. “It’s so visceral. And that’s what makes my allies turning away so f—ing painful. It’s hard to care about other groups when people who are in those groups don’t seem to care about us.”He added, “I’m 51 years old. It’s been some of the most destabilizing moments of my life in terms of my identity, politically.”In his pain, Zlotnitsky offers a case study for liberal American Jews who have felt unmoored politically since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hesitant to ally with progressives who have expressed antipathy to Israel, yet unwilling to ally with much of the pro-Israel movement because of its affinity for Trump, he voted for Democrat Kamala Harris but now finds himself staring down Trump 2.0 feeling more confused and hurt than ready to resist.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now “The biggest champions for Israel now are on the other side of the aisle, and I have so, so much that I disagree with them on,” said Zlotnitsky, who has long donated to Democratic candidates. “And yet, on this issue, I hate to admit it, they’re closer, in my opinion, to the right side of history than our side. That’s destabilizing.”The Zlotnitsky family has experienced many of the forces shaping contemporary U.S. politics. Tal, who came to the United States from Israel when he was 12, immigrated illegally but later, in an era when immigration reforms routinely included amnesties for people already in the country, became a legal resident and then a citizen.Members of the family are LGBTQ and federal employees, two demographics that Trump is targeting. And Jacob, 14 when the family rallied at Dulles, is now a senior at Tufts University, where he has had a front-row seat to the tensions over Israel roiling college campuses that have unnerved many American Jews and become a winning political issue for Republicans. “You feel separated from a lot of your peers on campus. Or you see people in different lights,” Jacob Zlotnitsky said. “Like, wow, this person has a pretty unhinged take where they’re essentially supporting Hamas. And I used to joke with them in lab.”Family Dynamics and Political StrugglesJacob remembers canvassing for Barack Obama with his dad when he was 9 years old. From their home in Maryland, they hit the trail just as strongly four years later.“During Hillary Clinton’s campaign, my dad and I actually drove to Pennsylvania to canvas on Election Day,” Jacob recalled. He would also tag along when his dad would meet with U.S. senators. “Progressivism has been a large part of my upbringing. Social justice, things like that.”Like his father, who attended Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, Jacob graduated from high school in Maryland before heading to Boston for college. Tal, meanwhile, moved in recent years to the Tampa, Florida, area to be near other members of his family.After Oct. 7, Israel took center stage in the family’s politics. As progressives began mounting protests against Israel’s response in Gaza, his father affixed an Israeli flag to his car, Jacob recalled. Antisemitism became the primary topic at family gatherings. And Tal Zlotnitsky watched as some of his friends — “people,” he said, “that should know better” — joined in what he called a “vilification of Israel.”In an Instagram post two weeks after the attack, he poured out his feelings. “To my non-Jewish friends, those who have stood with the Jewish community in this time of desperate need, I am forever indebted to you, forever grateful to you,” he wrote. “For others, many who are deeply good people, who are continuing to live their lives, as if nothing has changed, as if we didn’t just witnessed [sic] the worst massacre of Jews in 90 years: Know that it hurts.”Sharing a picture from inside a protest for racial justice, he added, “It hurts to stand alone, or mostly alone at this time. I’ve stood with Muslims when Trump denied them refuge, and was banning them. I’ve stood with my fellow Americans of color in support of Black Lives Matter … I stood with minimum wage workers. I stood with the LGBTQ community for marriage equality. What about us?”It’s not that the Zlotnitskys have no qualms about Israel’s response to being attacked, which included a steep death toll and widespread destruction in Gaza. “I’m not thrilled with Israel’s reaction,” Tal Zlotnitsky said.But he had the sense that people on the left were furious with Israel for even having a reaction to begin with — a reaction to Hamas murdering roughly 1,200 Israelis, many in their own homes, and kidnapping about 250 others. He said, “I think any American in the same situation would expect their government to do everything necessary to free anyone who’s taken.”He thought Harris did a good job of navigating the complex issue during her Democratic National Convention speech, in which she reiterated the horrors of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack while also saying she was working for an outcome where “the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”“I thought she took a principled position,” Zlotnitsky said. “She clearly stood on the side of truth about what had happened there, and also talked about the need for a different outcome in the region. I agree with her.” (Jacob, too, said he supported Palestinian statehood and opposed Israeli settlers: “I think I am, in the truest sense of the word, pro-Palestinian, because I do think Palestinians have a right to sovereignty.”)But even as Harris got huge applause in the room, many progressives were furious that the DNC hadn’t permitted a Palestinian to speak at the convention. Unlike in previous election cycles, Zlotnitsky decided not to donate to downballot Democrats — unless they had explicitly stated a pro-Israel platform.“I hated doing it,” he reflected. “It was a dark moment. … It’s been a lot of soul-searching and a lot of self-doubt and a lot of fear about what’s to come, what are we leaving here for our kids?”He had already experienced heartbreak after finding and supporting a rare candidate: one progressive enough to nab the endorsement of the local Democratic Socialists of America, a group known for its vociferous Israel criticism, but with a pro-Israel policy platform.It felt natural for Tal to donate to and organize for Evan Minton, who was running for state senate in California and hoped to be the state’s first openly transgender state legislator. A policy manager and former legislative aide, Minton had made headlines in 2021 for taking a lawsuit against a Catholic hospital’s refusal to perform gender-affirming care to the Supreme Court.“Pro Israel candidate in California who needs our support,” read one fundraising email Zlotnitsky sent his network. He feared that Minton’s support for Israel after Oct. 7 would make their candidacy an uphill battle in the modern progressive tent.Those fears were borne out after the Sacramento-area district held its primary in March 2024. Minton finished dead last out of seven candidates, with 2.6% of the vote.“His position on Israel overshadowed everything,” Zlotnitsky said. Looking back on it, he cites the race as “a pivotal moment” when he lost faith in the progressive coalition he’d devoted much of his adult life to supporting.“I was so thrilled to have someone, from a community I care deeply about and want to champion, take our — I hate to say ‘our side’ — take a view that I thought was principled on this issue, knowing the certain opposition,” he said.“And then to watch this person just get clobbered for it…” He trailed off. “I need to stop, because I don’t even know who my allies are anymore.”On Election Day in November, Zlotnitsky posted a picture of himself on Instagram wearing his Obama/Biden ’08 T-shirt. “Hoping today above all else for peace, for brotherhood and sisterhood, for Americans to come together and recognize that what’s made us the shining city on the hill is that our system of electing our leaders, while imperfect, is fair, predictable, and temperate,” he wrote. “I hope today is not the end of that American era.”By that night, it was clear that Trump had won. Zlotnitsky is more convinced than some other Democrats that Israel played a role in costing them the election. “I think our division cost us in November. I think — I know — I’m not alone,” he said. “I’ve talked to a lot of people who are Jews and activists who felt untethered.”For now, has redirected his activism closer to home. Through the Israeli-American Council — a group that runs local cultural activities and has a national political arm that leans right — he works with Jewish high school students “to bring Jewish teens closer to Israel.”And through the University of South Florida’s business school, which he sits on the board of, he talks to college students who are first-generation Americans.With the first group, Tal hears “horrifying” stories about their experiences with antisemitism. “It feels like we’re whistling past the graveyard,” he said. “The only thing you can do with these kids is just hug them and tell them that we understand.”But with the latter, he takes the opposite approach: “I have been avoiding the issue of Israel.” It feels wrong on some level, but at the end of the day he still believes in helping immigrant families. He’d rather not know “where their sympathies lie.”Progressive coalitionsJacob, too, feels similarly about the communities he and his family used to advocate for under the first Trump administration.“To this day I’m proud to stand up against the Muslim ban. I’ll stand up for it again,” he said. “The only thing that’s changed is that, in the back of your head, a lot of the people you were standing up for probably don’t want your family to exist as they do in Israel.”Both father and son are occupied by the question of how, or whether, Jews could ever rejoin progressive coalitions. Tal figures there would need to be “some answer” in Gaza — “and it’s certainly not, ‘Gaza is the new French Riviera,’ whatever President Trump’s fantasies are.” (He was alluding to Trump’s proposal to turn Gaza into a “Riviera,” an idea captured in an AI-generated social media video imagining a gold-plated “Trump Gaza.”)“Whatever happens, maybe then, there could be some restoration of partnership between Jews and Jewish groups and our natural allies,” Tal mused.But, he added in the same breath, “maybe not.” He said he’d recently dined with “a dear friend” who was a “former very senior official in the Obama administration, who I consider an ally.” Tal found himself “deeply disappointed” by what he considered the former official’s interest in “blaming Israel.”Zlotnitsky is deeply concerned about what the Trump administration is doing on almost all fronts.“We’re seeing more actions that represent a fundamental lack of respect for basic democratic principles and bedrock American values such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and due process,” he said in an email this week. “It’s disheartening to say the least.”But earlier, in a Zoom interview, he had held up the latest mailer he’d received from the Democratic Party, asking him to pledge donations.

The video went viral on social media with thousands of views. Here's the video: The video was widely shared by right-wing influencers on X. It included Benny Johnson, who shared a meme with the video. It was not clear what the context of the fight between the two passengers was. The video, however, garnered a lot of reaction with many supporters of Trump's MAGA movement slamming the woman for attacking the man. \"So a White Democrat is calling a Brown Republican a racist?

Their House majority was wiped away in the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats also suffered only their second national popular vote loss at the presidential level since 1988.\n\nTypically, the party out of power splits between forces that want to pivot back to the center, correcting mistakes that cost it the previous election, and those that think it is important to draw a stronger ideological contrast with their opponents.\n\nThe Democrats in 2025 are no different. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has made rhetorical overtures to Republicans and voted with them a handful of times. And Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) jeopardized his leadership position by defying the progressive base on a government shutdown. Both have faced backlash from those on the Left who want congressional Democrats to fight the GOP agenda at all costs.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for being too left-wing and cautious. Her past progressive positions, especially those taken in her failed 2020 presidential campaign, cost her votes in November. But she also soft-pedaled or reversed many of those stances, seeming like a flip-flopper and potentially depressing progressive enthusiasm for her candidacy. \n\nNewsom would surely like to be the Democratic standard-bearer in 2028. Since launching his podcast, he has interviewed MAGA figures such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. The California governor has also repudiated many progressive excesses, such as biological men competing as transgender women in female sports and the term “Latinx.” \n\nWalz might also be looking to strike out on his own after being Harris’s understudy in the 2024 campaign, especially if she doesn’t run again. The Minnesotan was sure to demonstrate he remained appropriately outraged by MAGA in all its forms.\n\nWhile Newsom said he wanted “to first understand what their motivations are” and figure “what they’re actually doing,” Walz had a simpler question for dealing with their shared political opponents: “How do we put some of those guys back under a rock?” \n\n“These are bad guys, though,” Walz said as Newsom explained why he had people such as Bannon and Kirk on his podcast. “These are bad guys.”\n\n“When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom said, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\n“But he denies the election!” Walz shot back, referring to 2020 instead of the more recent election he and other Democrats lost.\n\nNeither Newsom nor Walz is an ideal candidate for a Democratic rebranding. Both face major authenticity problems. Walz said of Trump supporters, “I do think I could kick most of their ass,” a characteristically awkward formulation. Newsom would have to explain constantly changing positions no less than Harris did and defend California’s dysfunction and liberalism. \n\nBut their conversation highlighted the Democrats’ choices in the next two elections. They can continue to run on democracy, Jan. 6, fighting Trump, and more or less reinforcing the progressive agenda. Or they can try to adjust, both in style and substance, so they are no longer on the wrong side of public opinion on as many matters. \n\nThe third option is to wait for Trump to self-destruct. It has happened before, and it is easy to see opportunities for it to happen again. \n\nYet, after nearly a decade in national politics, Trump is still here. He is in the Oval Office while two leading lights of the Democratic Party are arguing about his aides on a podcast having failed to “kick most of their ass.”\n\nIt’s a conversation Democrats will be having a lot over the next couple of years.","summary":"A quirky podcast conversation between Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Tim Walz (D-MN) revealed an important divide within the Democratic Party as it seeks to regain power.

The former is preparing to spin off its cable network portfolio by the end of 2025, while the latter has entered into a deal to acquire Frontier Communications that is expected to close by the first quarter of 2026.\n\nCarr also reinstated “news distortion” complaints against WPVI-TV over ABC’s fact-checking of Trump during a presidential debate and WCBS-TV over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris and a complaint against WNBC-TV alleging Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” violated the agency’s equal time rule. The FCC is allowing the public to weigh in on Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview video and transcript it requested as part of its investigation into WCBS-TV and as it reviews the pending $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger’s required transfer of broadcast licenses. \n\nAdditionally, Carr is investigating NPR and PBS for alleged violations of the agency’s underwriting rules for noncommercial broadcasters and KCBS Radio for allegedly violating public interest obligations for describing an immigration raid during one of its news broadcasts.\n\nIn a letter to the agency, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal slammed Carr for singling out media broadcasters that “faced the wrath of President Trump during his presidential campaign, including actual litigation or outright threats of investigations in retaliation for perceived negative coverage.”\n\nHe noted that the “exclusive targeting to the apparent benefit of the President” is further reflected by Carr’s decision to not renew a news distortion complaint against a Fox TV station nor launch any investigation into News Corp. around its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\n“The Commission’s investigations appear predicated on dubious legal theories that deviate from the FCC’s public guidance, rules, and past enforcement actions, raising the question of whether the FCC is operating under a new set of standards,” the letter added. “Carr’s vexatious investigation of opponents of President Trump represents a threat to the First Amendment and inflicts upon newsrooms, affiliate groups, local media, nonprofit organizations and religious broadcasters an ever-looming risk of retaliatory federal investigations for protected speech.”\n\nThe Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has set a deadline of March 26 for the FCC to turn over information and records related to its investigations. Representatives for the FCC did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment.","summary":"\"If there’s businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward,\" Brendan Carr says \n\n\nThe post FCC Chair Threatens to Block M&amp;A for Companies That Embrace DEI Policies appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-chair-threatens-company-mergers-over-dei/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brendan-carr-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 18:02:44","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":302741674,"title":"Paul Weiss's version of its agreement with Trump doesn't include a line pledging not to use DEI","text":"On Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced he agreed to withdraw his executive order targeting Paul Weiss after the elite law firm agreed that it \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.\"But that line is nowhere to be found in an internal version of the agreement about the Paul Weiss executive order sent to its own lawyers about 30 minutes later, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.Instead, it only says the firm \"affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention\" and will hire experts to do a \"comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices\" — language that is also in the version Trump posted on Truth Social.The dueling documents emerged after Trump issued an executive order stripping security clearances from Paul Weiss lawyers and threatening government contracts with the firm. Both versions show Trump agreed to rescind this order after the firm promised $40 million in pro bono legal services and made other commitments.Paul Weiss's version also omits a statement from the White House saying that the law firm's chairman, Brad Karp, \"acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul, Weiss partner, Mark Pomerantz, the grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice\" in a meeting with Trump.Pomerantz, a frequent target of Trump's ire and a former Paul Weiss partner, joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office during its criminal investigation into Trump's hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels.Pomerantz left the prosecutor's office before the case went to trial and wrote a book about his frustrations with how the investigation was handled. A jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business documents in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. He was sentenced to an \"unconditional discharge\" — essentially, no punishment — and has filed an appeal.The Trump administration has taken a special interest in the diversity initiatives of Big Law firms. The acting chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Andrea Lucas, a Trump appointee, sent letters to 20 elite firms this week with detailed questions about their diversity programs.Representatives for Paul Weiss and the White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about the discrepancy. In an email sent to firm staff, Karp said the deal was consistent with the firm's principles.\"With this behind us, we can devote our complete focus — as we always do — to our clients, our work, our colleagues, and our firm,\" he wrote.In some ways, Paul Weiss is like every other big law firm. Its attorneys work late nights on deals and defense work for some of America's biggest companies, and top partners charge more than $2,000 an hour for their advice.But in important ways, it's not. While many law firms' lawyers and staff skew Democratic, Paul Weiss has long been close with Democratic power players. Its partners include two members of former president Barack Obama's cabinet, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Its chairman, Brad Karp, was a major fundraiser for Kamala Harris, and its partner, Karen Dunn, helped Harris prepare for debates.Perkins Coie, which was also targeted by one of Trump's executive orders, sued the administration and promptly won a temporary restraining order from a judge. Perkins said in court papers that it faced existential risks from the executive order, which would require its clients with government contracts to reveal whether they use the firm — creating pressure to cut ties.The president issued a narrower memorandum targeting any lawyers at the Big Law firm Covington & Burling who may have assisted former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith, who filed two now-dismissed criminal cases against Trump. The law firm hasn't publicly reacted to the order.At an Oval Office event Friday, Trump said big law firms \"all want to make deals\" after they \"went after me for four years — ruthlessly, violently, illegally.\"\"They're not babies. They're very sophisticated people,\" Trump said. \"Those law firms did bad things.\"On Thursday night, Skadden Arps associate Rachel Cohen resigned from her position due to what she described as an inadequate response to Trump's actions.Skadden \"has been given time and opportunity to do the right thing,\" she wrote in her resignation letter, which went viral on LinkedIn. \"Thus far, we have not.

That had infuriated Trump.\"On the other hand, Trump \"wanted\" to do the show but believed Rogan should have been the one to ask him on, the author revealed.\n\nMusk and Kennedy knew the appearance would benefit the president-elect and quickly \"worked both sides\" to make it happen that fall.\n\nThe move notably came right after Democratic candidate Harris, 60, had already made waves on Alex Cooper's hit show – leading to a sort of rivalry in the world of new-age campaigning.In the beginning of October, Rogan interviewed Calley Means, a health advocate and adviser to Kennedy. \n\nAfter the show, Means told Rogan he would love to see Trump on the program and provided contact details for Trump's team. \n\nWith the election just a month away, Rogan was hearing from pro-Trump listeners urging him to make it happen.Musk pitched the idea to the MAGA leader, telling him: \"It's the number one podcast. You can't pass this up.\"\n\nIsenstadt then revealed Rogan \"extended a request for an interview in early October, and the two sides agreed on a date: October 25.\"On October 25, Trump’s motorcade arrived at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas, where he had prepped for the interview – focusing on health-related issues. \n\nThe studio, which looked like an industrial facility from the outside, featured unusual décor like mounted deer heads and an embalmed crocodile, the author explained.\n\nThe nearly three-hour interview touched on topics like UFC, windmills, and life on Mars, with Rogan discussing Trump’s election stance and his views on pharmaceutical reform.Despite some doubts from Kennedy's camp, Trump didn’t give a direct answer about his support. \n\nThe interview quickly gained 38 million views, reaching a multitude of young men just before the election – making it a strategic win for Trump.Isenstadt noted: \"For Trump, the timing couldn't have been better. \n\n\"The election was rapidly approaching, and here he was reaching millions of young men with Rogan, a key demographic for the campaign.\"The author's new book is full of backstage content leading up to Trump's 2024 presidential win.\n\nElsewhere, Isenstadt reveals shocking details on the president's infamous July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt.\n\nThe journalist also gives insight into Trump's relationship with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, revealing how he called him a \"piece of s---,\" and his son, James, a \"crazy liberal.\"","summary":"Elon Musk and Robert F.

Tim Walz unusually influenced former Vice President Kamala Harris’ November election loss.\n\nFox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Trump about Walz’s Tuesday comments on “This is Gavin Newsom,” where the former vice presidential candidate said he feels he “could kick most of their ass,” with Doocy criticizing Walz’s remarks as referencing Trump supporters. The president said Walz would “be in trouble” if he had to fight Trump supporters, and that he feels Walz dragged Harris down, despite conventional wisdom being that vice presidential candidates typically do not affect the top of the ticket. (RELATED: Tim Walz Appears To Snipe At Any Kamala Harris 2028 Ambitions)\n\n“Well, he’s a loser, you know? I mean, the guy’s a loser. He lost an election. He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn’t play a part, they say,” Trump said. “I think Tim played a part. I think he was so bad that he hurt her. But she hurt herself and [former President] Joe [Biden] hurt them both. They didn’t have a great group. But I would probably put him at the bottom of the group.”\n\nWalz’s comments about believing he could take his critics in a fight took place just after he expressed frustration about attacks on his masculinity during the 2024 campaign.\n\n“It just baffled me how much time they spent trying to attack me — that I wasn’t like masculine enough in their vision. Like, I would have never believed this,” Walz said. “I saw Fox News did, like, a couple days because I used a straw, and I’m like, ‘Hell, man, how else do you drink a milkshake type of thing?’ But they focused on it obsessively, which I think, again, is their obsession, their weirdness.”\n\n“We buy their frame on these issues of sexuality, you know? But their whole thing was is that they spent all their time — these guys on Fox News — that Walz is gay, he’s not masculine, you know?” he continued. “And he doesn’t coach football the way he should.”\n\nIn addition to criticism of his masculinity, the governor faced backlash during the 2024 campaign for the far-left initiatives he has backed, such as signing legislation in 2023 that mandated schools provide tampons in both girls’ and boys’ restrooms, which led to Trump and others calling him “Tampon Tim.”\n\nWalz also repeatedly made inaccurate claims regarding his past during the campaign.\n\nMoreover, the governor revealed on “Fast Politics with Molly Jong-Fast” that he regretted wasting several days of the campaign prioritizing Trump’s comments regarding Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n“I will kick myself that I got sucked in. I bet you I spent three or four days, maybe longer, not clowning, but just hammering them over the eating dogs and cats because it was so ridiculous,” Walz said. “And I took that hook, line and sinker. We were talking about immigration at a critical part of the campaign. And it was hurtful. And it pissed me off. And I was standing there to defend people. And it didn’t do a damn bit of good electorally.”\n\nThe governor told The New Yorker in a March 2 interview that he would weigh launching his own 2028 presidential bid if the circumstances and his “skill set” were right. He also launched a town hall tour in red districts across the nation in March, stating that he plans to “lend a megaphone” to Americans.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

She kicked it off with the Moneybagg Yo collaboration “On What U On,” which stalled at No. 56 on the Hot 100 — and was her only release that year to even reach the chart. Everything she dropped bricked, whether it was the radio-ready “Lick or Sum” or her direct response to detractors, “Internet Trolls.” And that March, tragedy struck when three people died in a fatal crowd surge at her concert with Finesse2tymes in Rochester, N.Y. With her commercial pull waning, everyone on the internet (trolls and otherwise) seemed to agree: Big Glo had fallen off.\n\n “2023 was an eye-opener for me,” the 25-year-old says. “I realized that I can’t take my foot off the gas. I didn’t know I was doing that, but I did. It was a reality check when I would drop music and people would hate it. Getting closer to God was one of the key things that helped me.”\n\n Join us at Billboard Women in Music 2025 — get your tickets here. \n\n Born Gloria Hallelujah Woods, the eighth of 10 children, GloRilla grew up in the church. She sang in the choir and her mother only allowed gospel music in the house; as her taste evolved and she found a home in hip-hop, gospel music and its encouraging messages remained present in her raps — from 2022’s “Blessed” to “Rain Down on Me,” a gospel-rap track from Glorious, her 2024 debut studio album.\n\n GloRilla also looked to Yo Gotti, the rap superstar and fellow Memphian who’s now her label head, as a mentor. Since Gotti signed Glo to his CMG Records imprint in 2022, the two have worked closely to hone her sound and image, taking her from viral breakout to presidential campaign surrogate (she performed at a Wisconsin rally for former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall). “Even with all the success and accolades, she’s still the same authentic and ambitious hustler that I met back in 2022,” Gotti says of Glo.\n\n With the help of her CMG team, renowned choreographer Sean Bankhead and creative director Coco Gilbert, GloRilla spent late 2023 plotting the perfect road map to recapture her momentum. The plan worked: With her first release of 2024, the anthemic “Yeah Glo!,” GloRilla came out swinging. Arriving in February, the motivational anthem took over nightclubs, cookouts and locker room celebrations. The song topped Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay for two weeks and reached No. 28 on the Hot 100, then her highest peak for a solo single.\n\n “To have that little break, come back with ‘Yeah Glo!’ and have it start going up on the first day [of release] — that was personal,” GloRilla tells Billboard in between rehearsals for her forthcoming Glorious tour.\n\n “Yeah Glo!” was meant to introduce GloRilla’s debut album, but its runaway success significantly shifted those plans. “I felt like I had to build my momentum back, so that’s where the mixtape kicked in,” she explains. “We made that decision around the time ‘Yeah Glo!’ came out.” Ehhthang Ehhthang arrived in April and yielded another hit single, the Megan Thee Stallion-assisted “Wanna Be,” which later received a Cardi B remix and peaked at No. 11 on the Hot 100. The week before, Megan had announced Glo as the special guest for her arena-conquering Hot Girl Summer Tour. Between Ehhthang Ehhthang and successful guest appearances on BossMan Dlow’s “Finesse” and Big Boogie’s “Bop,” GloRilla had become inescapable — and she hadn’t even launched her official album campaign yet.\n\n While opening the Hot Girl Summer Tour in June, GloRilla released “TGIF,” which kicked her 2024 into an even higher gear. Within a week of the song’s release, Rihanna shared an instantly viral clip of herself adorably dancing and singing along to it. By February 2025, GloRilla became the first artist to simultaneously become a face of all four of Rihanna’s Fenty brands.\n\n With Riri begging for an album in her DMs and Beyoncé posting pictures with her on Instagram, GloRilla had undoubtedly became the hottest woman MC in the game. As “TGIF” cemented her pop appeal, GloRilla kept her core audience fed — and reinforced her sound — with her feature on Real Boston Richey’s “Get in There.”\n\n “Me and my team figured out the difference between a mixtape and album song: You just got to hear it,” she says. “My core sound is how [gritty] the mixtape sounded. When I went into album mode, I already had a lot of those songs before the mixtape — but I knew they weren’t mixtape songs.”\n\n After months of recapturing and multiplying her momentum, GloRilla finally released Glorious in October. With collaborators ranging from Sexyy Red to Maverick City Music, Glo’s studio debut was a capstone on her massive year, earning the highest opening week total for an album by a female rapper in 2024 (69,000 units) for a No. 5 debut on the Billboard 200. Five of its songs landed on the Hot 100, including “Whatchu Kno About Me” (No. 17), which Taylor Swift later used to soundtrack an Eras Tour TikTok. “I was real excited about that,” Glo recalls. “Everybody was sending it to me — I was feeling like ‘that girl’ when she posted that.”\n\n Now, after scoring three Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay No. 1 hits in under a year and being named Billboard’s Hottest Female Rapper of 2024, Billboard’s 2025 Women in Music Powerhouse is determined to deliver an impeccable show on her tour, which commenced March 5 in Oklahoma City and will play arenas and music halls throughout the United States.\n\n “Even though I’m not as good at dancing, I’m getting better and I learn fast,” she says, noting that her tour prep playlist includes gospel classics like Yolanda Adams’ “Open My Heart.” “I learn about two new routines a day. I like helping out with choreography because I get to do what I’m comfortable with and showcase my vision.”\n\n Still, GloRilla isn’t as concerned with being the best rapper alive as she is with her own consistent personal growth. “I have the desire to be the best me I can be,” she proclaims.\n\n This story appears in the March 22, 2025, issue of Billboard.","summary":"Last year, Billboard’s Women In Music Powerhouse scored cosigns from the likes of Rihanna and Beyoncé, and her biggest solo hits yet.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/glorilla-women-in-music-2025-powerhouse-1235925918/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/feature-glorilla-billboard-2025-bb5-sami-drasin-1-650.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 16:29:16","author":"Eric Renner Brown,Kyle Denis","authors":["Eric Renner Brown","Kyle Denis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":302767814,"title":"Poll: Kamala Harris Leads Democrat 2028 Presidential Field","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is leading the Democrat Party’s 2028 potential presidential primary field, a Morning Consult survey found.\n\nThe survey asked both Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who they would support in the 2028 presidential primary, and Harris — who lost handily to President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November — is leading the pack with 36 percent support.\n\nIn second place comes former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with ten percent support.

He is delusional and arrogant to think that he can be a value add to the Democratic Party. We need to move on from the era of Joe Biden and embrace new, younger leadership.”\n\nThe ridicule extended to congressional Democrats, who control neither chamber of Congress following the Nov. 5 wipeout loss by then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was thrust into the race after Biden announced July 21 he would not seek a second term.\n\n“The best thing Biden could do for the DNC is offer [DNC Vice Chair] David Hogg a high-paying role at his foundation,” a congressional Democratic aide snarked.\n\n“Is this serious?” a former Democratic aide asked. “I mean, it has to be a joke. This is an ‘SNL’ skit.”\n\nBiden has kept a relatively low profile in retirement — only rarely posting tweets.\n\nIt’s unclear how the former chief executive will seek to monetize his post-presidency, though he recently signed with the talent firm Creative Artists Agency, with which he previously partnered to promote his book “Promise Me, Dad” after he left office as vice president in 2017.\n\nBiden’s son Hunter and brother James Biden reaped millions of dollars for their family based on their proximity to power — hauling in massive amounts from associates in China, Ukraine and other countries where US policy was at one point controlled by their relative.\n\nHunter started a novice art career following his dad’s assumption of the presidency, in what was widely seen as a way to further monetize Joe’s authority, but said in a recent court filing that he’s been unable to make many recent sales.\n\n“These people drank so much of their own Kool-Aid,” ranted the ex-senior White House adviser, “that they believed — and still seemingly believe — that an 82-year-old man with a 38% approval rating on a good day, who can’t sit down for a simple traditional 10-minute pre-Super Bowl interview, was the answer for Democrats in 2024 and now this same group thinks the Bidens are the answer for Democrats now?\n\n“The fact that they continue to surround themselves with the same cast of clowns who delivered them nothing but the most devastating humiliation in modern political history — a president’s own power taken away by his own party — is all you need to know about them.

Disney-owned ABC has long been perceived as a liberal network by critics and adversarial to President Donald Trump.

The two candidates vying for a ten-year term are liberal trial court judge Susan Crawford and former Republican attorney general and current trial court judge Brad Schimel.\n\nThe election is technically apolitical—the candidates don’t run as Democrats or Republicans—but in reality it’s anything but. The election comes after the retirement of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley last year. Since a 2023 Supreme Court election, the court has had a liberal majority for the first time in over a decade. Now, Justice Bradley’s retirement and the upcoming election threaten to throw that balance back to conservatives.\n\nThe consequences of a conservative majority on the court would be wide-ranging, potentially handing conservatives victories on abortion, elections, and organized labor. That’s why the election is being flooded with cash by the world’s richest man. All in all, the election has seen more than $66 million in spending, with $13 million of that coming from groups associated with Musk. The majority of the cash, $36 million, is benefiting Schimel. Some campaign finance experts have anticipated as much as $100 million will be spent, on an off-year state Supreme Court election.\n\nWith the massive flow of national money into a state race, it’s clear that this election has consequences that will likely reverberate across the country. Political observers are also looking at the election as a referendum on the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and the Democratic Party’s ability to hold onto power in a critical swing state.\n\n“This will be a referendum on the Trump administration thus far,” said Thomas Nelson, a Democratic county executive in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, and former majority leader of the State Assembly. “This will have a lingering effect on policymaking in the state because, just like the U.S. Supreme Court, the state Supreme Courts, particularly Wisconsin, they’re just legislative bodies. The actions that they take on legislation, on so-called questions of constitutionality, [are] similar to deliberation that occurs in legislatures. There really isn’t a lot of daylight between the two.”\n\nAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE STAKES, two high-profile abortion cases are set to be decided before the state’s high court in coming months. One case concerns the right to abortion, with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin arguing that the state constitution enshrines the right. The second case seeks to strike down an 1849 law that arguably bans abortion in the state. For more than a year after Dobbs, the 176-year-old law came into effect, and Wisconsin abortion providers stopped providing abortion care. In 2023, abortion care in the state was allowed to resume, but that could change depending on who wins this election.\n\nSchimel is trying to frame himself as neutral on abortion to win over moderate Wisconsin voters who support abortion rights. A 2024 poll found that a majority of Wisconsin voters, regardless of party affiliation, oppose criminalizing abortion at any stage of pregnancy. During a March 12 debate between the two candidates, Schimel tried to appeal to that majority, saying that the 1849 law was valid legislation, but also noting: “I don’t believe that it reflects the will of the people of Wisconsin today.”\n\nWhen pushed to state whether he is pro- or anti-choice, Schimel continued to walk a tightrope, punting the question back to Wisconsin voters. “No judge or justice should be deciding this issue for the voters of Wisconsin,” he said. “This issue belongs in their hands.”\n\nThis pivot comes after years of Schimel’s explicitly anti-abortion statements, including in this campaign. At an event in Chilton, Wisconsin, Schimel weighed in on one of the abortion cases before the court, declaring: “There is not a constitutional right to abortion in our State Constitution. That will be a sham if they find that.”\n\nWith the massive flow of national money into a state race, it’s clear that this election has consequences that will likely reverberate across the country.\n\nWhen running for state attorney general in 2014, Schimel said: “I believe that life begins at conception.” His legal work in the role backed up that view. He appealed a 2013 federal appeals court ruling on abortion to the U.S. Supreme Court, trying to overturn the blockage of a targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) law. The law would have required abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges, a medically unnecessary administrative barrier that would have forced half of the state’s abortion clinics to close. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up the appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, extreme anti-abortion groups like Pro-Life Wisconsin and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America’s Women Speak Out PAC are working against Schimel’s strategy by endorsing him and mobilizing money and canvassers to get him elected.\n\nDuring the debate, the candidates also sparred over the state’s controversial Act 10 law, which severely weakens union power among public-sector employees. The bill was signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Scott Walker despite massive public opposition. In the 14 years since then, the law has cropped up in numerous court challenges.\n\nFor public-sector employees covered under the law, like teachers, nurses, and prison guards, Act 10 stripped their unions of the power to negotiate over anything but wages and limited any raises to the rate of inflation. The law also banned unions from directly deducting dues from their members’ paychecks, adding an administrative barrier to union membership. Unsurprisingly, the law squashed union power in the state. Since Act 10 was signed, Wisconsin saw the largest decline in union membership of any state.\n\nOver the decades, Act 10 has been upheld in both state and federal courts. In 2014, a conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the law, saying that public-sector collective-bargaining power is “a creation of legislative grace and not constitutional obligation.”\n\nNow, the law will likely be back in the hands of the state’s high court, though it’s unclear which justices will hear the case. Two of the court’s current justices have past experience that might prompt them to recuse themselves from any Act 10 cases. Liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz said during her 2023 campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional, and also that she would consider recusing herself from cases challenging the law due to her participation in protests against the law. Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Gov. Walker’s chief legal counsel and helped draft Act 10. When he ran in 2015, though, he declined to make any promises that he would recuse himself.\n\nRecusals also came up during the debate between Crawford and Schimel. Tesla is currently suing Wisconsin over a decision blocking the electric-car company from opening dealerships in the state. Wisconsin has a law that prohibits manufacturers from owning dealerships, so Tesla itself cannot open its own without a different owner.\n\nIf that challenge comes to the state Supreme Court and Schimel is on the bench, he may be tempted to rule in favor of his election benefactor, Musk. During the debate, Schimel dodged a question about whether he would recuse himself.\n\nCrawford made clear that “Elon Schimel,” as she called him, appears to be in Musk’s pocket. After Schimel visited Washington, D.C., for Trump’s inauguration, she said, “All of a sudden Elon Musk is tweeting about the race and Brad Schimel is bragging about being on his knees, wearing out his kneepads, asking for contributions.”\n\nMusk is the biggest outside donor in the race. Part of the $13 million given to various organizations has gone to sending text messages to moderate and conservative voters, ostensibly from a Democratic group called “Progress 2028,” praising how reliably liberal Crawford is on hot-button issues. Musk-aligned groups used similar tactics in the 2024 election against Kamala Harris.\n\nAds in the race have focused on both candidates’ records on crimes like rape, assault, and domestic violence. The ads appeal to fears about public safety, often focusing on the most heinous crimes against children and vulnerable women. In one Schimel-sponsored ad, a voice-over says: “It’s terrifying that Susan Crawford would consider a four-year sentence appropriate for raping a child.” Crawford put out an ad in a similar vein: “That was just one time Brad Schimel let a sex predator loose on our kids.” Another Crawford ad tells the story of a “serial rapist” who could have been arrested had Schimel not waited to process a backlog of rape kits. As state Supreme Court justices, it’s likely that neither Schimel nor Crawford would see cases related to sex crimes. Despite that, ads about assault and rape are flooding the Wisconsin airwaves to appeal to voters’ fears.\n\nSchimel wasn’t the only candidate fending off allegations of being too political. During the debate, Crawford argued that she would decide cases concerning the state’s legislative lines impartially, without handing Democrats an electoral edge.\n\nRedistricting has been a contentious issue in the court. In 2023, the newly liberal court saw a case about the state’s legislative maps and ordered the legislature to draw up new ones, arguing that the Republican-drawn maps were unconstitutional. The Republican-controlled legislature bowed to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, passing his maps instead of attempting to draw their own. These changes have put state Democrats in a position to possibly win back the state legislature in 2026.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Crawford attended a virtual call with Democratic donors who framed the meeting around putting two more House seats in play in 2026 by altering the state’s congressional maps. The court declined to hear a case about redrawing the state’s congressional maps in 2024. Schimel and the debate moderators chastised Crawford for attending a call with an overtly political aim, though she argues that she spoke briefly and was not on the call long enough to hear discussion of congressional map-drawing.\n\nIn a statement to the Prospect, Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said that Crawford’s personal politics and beliefs won’t get in the way of her judgments on the court. “Judge Susan Crawford has spent her career focused on upholding our laws and Constitution, and fighting to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Wisconsinites. She understands that a judge’s duty is to set aside personal beliefs and apply the law fairly and impartially. Voters know they can trust Judge Crawford to be an independent, common-sense voice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court,” Honeyman added.\n\nPolling shows a close race ahead of the April 1 Election Day. Among registered voters surveyed, 38 percent say they have no opinion on Schimel, while 58 percent say the same for Crawford. Otherwise, the candidates seem mostly aligned, with similar net favorability ratings and predictable levels of support from partisan voters.\n\nIf Schimel wins, it will be a reminder that Trump and Musk’s agenda doesn’t stop in Washington, D.C. Instead, it threatens to reshape political life on the state and local levels, too.\n\n“I think that Democrats and progressives across the board are in a defensive posture at all levels. The sky is falling. The federal bureaucracy is being destroyed,” Nelson said about the race’s national consequences. “And it’s only a matter of time [until] we’re going to sustain direct hits on the ground in local government.”","summary":"Liberals and conservatives face off in the most political apolitical race in the country.","url":"https://prospect.org/justice/2025-03-21-wisconsin-court-election-drawing-elon-musks-money/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22627/download/Janssen-WI%20supreme%20court%20032125.jpg?cb=80420e628995a9d779903d87363060c2&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 15:00:00","author":"Emma Janssen","authors":["Emma Janssen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":302685274,"title":"Rosie O’Donnell feels ‘safer,’ has less ‘stress and anxiety’ after leaving ‘overwhelmingly depressing’ US over Trump election","text":"Rosie O’Donnell’s mental health has improved significantly since she fled the United States and moved to Ireland following President Trump’s election.\n\n“I feel healthier [and] I’m sleeping better without the stress and anxiety over what was happening politically in the country,” the comedian, 63, shared on TikTok Thursday.\n\nO’Donnell said she feels better now that she’s not being “singled out by the President of the United States” and recalled their famous years-long “quote-unquote feud.” \n\n“I was a host of ‘The View’ and it was my job to talk about current events and politics and when I told the truth about him, he went nutzo,” O’Donnell claimed. \n\nIn her video, the “A League of Their Own” star detailed feeling “so proud and so impressed” by her family’s “resilience” after they moved across the pond.\n\n“They’re doing so well here,” she noted, adding, “It’s not easy to move to another country and we really felt as a family this was the safest and best thing for us to do.”\n\n“And it looks like sadly, we were correct for what’s happening in the United States is overwhelmingly depressing, unconstitutional, illegal, criminal and so so very sad,” she added.\n\nO’Donnell also said that she is “very happy” with her decision to leave the States and is hopeful that the nation will rally against Trump’s administration and their “horrific ideas for what will make America great again.”\n\n“It’s not racism and it’s not homophobia and it’s equality for all,” she expressed. “That’s what we’re promised as American citizens so let’s all remember that.”\n\nO’Donnell also said she was “sick of” Trump’s reign and didn’t want to live in it while he was back in the Oval Office.\n\n“I knew I couldn’t and I knew it would really tax me emotionally to have to do this,” she told her followers.\n\nThe actress believes that Trump voters will soon realize “just how cruel he is” and “do something that will stop him.”\n\n“Enough with old white guys who don’t stand up for what’s right, in both parties,” she said, noting that the country needs more women in power. \n\nThe former talk show host confirmed that she moved to Ireland in March after Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. \n\nO’Donnell skedaddled on Jan. 15 — just five days before Trump was sworn into office. \n\n“It’s been pretty wonderful, I have to say,” she said of the move. “The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming.

Instead, it is rudderless and lost, with no serious leadership stepping up to challenge Trump on substance.\n\nThe loudest voices—Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and their ideological allies—have driven the party into a radical fringe, where woke activism overshadows the core concerns of working Americans.\n\nBut it wasn’t always that way.\n\nThe Democrats of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama once promised hope, change, and reform—Clinton championed fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and tough-on-crime policies, while Obama’s 2008 “Hope & Change” mantra inspired millions who believed he would unite the country, end corruption, and restore faith in government.\n\nYet, instead of delivering on those visions, today’s Democratic Party leadership has abandoned pragmatism in favor of radical identity politics.\n\nMany Americans now feel that Trump 2.0—not the Democratic Party—is fulfilling the very “Hope & Change” promise that Obama once made, while Clinton and Obama stand by silently as their party turns into a circus sideshow of gender activism and woke extremism.\n\nClinton, Obama Tougher Than Today’s Democrats\n\nBill Clinton famously declared, “The era of big government is over.” His presidency was defined by pragmatism, working with Republicans to balance the budget, reform welfare, and enforce immigration laws. He understood that unchecked government expansion led to inefficiency, and he wasn’t afraid to challenge progressive orthodoxy when necessary.\n\nHis 1995 State of the Union address would be unrecognizable in today’s Democratic Party.\n\nClinton stated: “All Americans … are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. That’s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders.”\n\nThat speech could have been delivered by Trump himself, yet back then, Democrats applauded. Today, any Democrat saying those words would be attacked by his or her own party.\n\nObama, too, understood the importance of strong governance. He championed cracking down on government waste, promising that Obamacare would be funded by eliminating “fraud, waste, and abuse.”\n\nIn 2010, he reassured Americans: “We are scrutinizing spending for waste, looking for ways to achieve savings for taxpayers, and we will continue to enforce the law to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.”\n\nYet today’s Democrats mock those very principles, calling fiscal responsibility a right-wing obsession.\n\nObama also had a firm stance on illegal immigration—one that modern Democrats would denounce. Under his administration, the U.S. deported nearly 3 million illegal immigrants, peaking at more than 410,000 removals in 2012—far higher than anything Trump ever achieved during his first term.\n\nYet now, even suggesting border enforcement gets you branded a “racist” by the Democratic Party.\n\nClinton and Obama Were Tough on Islamic Terrorism—Unlike Today’s Democrats and Neocons\n\nFor all their flaws, Clinton and Obama also took Islamic terrorism seriously—something today’s Democrats fail to do.\n\nClinton launched missile strikes against al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and Sudan in response to the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings. He recognized the growing threat of Islamic extremism, though he lacked the political will to fully eliminate it.\n\nObama went even further. His administration drastically expanded drone strikes, authorizing more attacks than Bush and Clinton combined.\n\nHe personally ordered the special forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden, often overruling left-wing activists who wanted softer policies on terrorism. However, his refusal to use the term “radical Islamic terrorism” signaled a dangerous unwillingness to confront the ideological roots of the problem.\n\nTrump, by contrast, obliterated the ISIS caliphate in record time and took out Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top terrorist mastermind—something neither Clinton nor Obama had the courage to do.\n\nUnder today’s Democrat leadership, even acknowledging that terrorism has ideological roots is considered “Islamophobic.” The party has drifted so far left that even Clinton and Obama now look conservative by comparison.\n\nUnfulfilled Promise of Accountability\n\nMany of us voted for Obama in 2008 because we believed in “Hope and Change.” We thought he would challenge the corrupt system, particularly the Bush-Cheney administration, for lying America into the Iraq War—a war that cost thousands of lives and destabilized the entire region.\n\nBut Obama didn’t just fail to prosecute Bush and Cheney—he became them. Instead of exposing the military-industrial complex, he expanded it. Instead of ending regime-change wars, he continued them.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, punished Bush and Cheney by taking over the Republican Party, purging neocons from power, and realigning the GOP toward an America First agenda.\n\nObama had the opportunity to be that kind of leader—but instead, he joined the club he promised to dismantle.\n\nThe Real ‘Hope and Change’ America Was Awaiting\n\nElon Musk is delivering the kind of hope and change Americans expected from Obama—but never got.\n\nInstead of cutting red tape and fueling innovation, Democrats are blocking progress, filing lawsuits, and relying on partisan judges to do their dirty work.\n\nThey’re not just fighting Trump; they’re fighting the future. And in the process, they’re making themselves obsolete.\n\nMusk’s Department of Government Efficiency launch proves that America’s biggest advancements are happening in spite of the Democratic Party, not because of it.\n\nWhile Republicans, independents, and free-thinking liberals support innovation, today’s Democrats look like a bunch of clowns, desperately trying to suppress progress through lawsuits and regulations.\n\nRestore Sanity or Become Extinct\n\nClinton and Obama must decide: Will they watch their party collapse, or will they step in and save it?\n\nThe Democratic Party is collapsing under its own weight—but that’s only half the story. The other half is Trump’s speed, strength, and relentless punch.\n\nWhile Democrats flounder in confusion, Trump is moving fast—rebuilding the economy, securing the border, and reshaping America’s global standing in record time.\n\nThe longer Democrats delay a course correction, the harder his impact will hit them.\n\nAmerica needs a serious opposition party, not a circus. If they don’t act soon, Democrats will be remembered not as leaders, but as the ones who let the party die.\n\nThe choice is theirs. But time is running out.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

That was also the time when the spotlight fell on leaders of Indian origin in the US: Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy and Kash Patel. The NRIs and Indian-origin people in the West have long been seen as India's soft power due to their remarkable success in Western countries. But increasingly, they are also giving India hard power: the power of money. A recent analysis by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows Share of inward remittances from advanced economies, including the US and the UK, has risen, surpassing that of Gulf economies in 2023-24, reflecting a shift in migration pattern towards skilled Indian diaspora. India's remittances, which have more than doubled from $55.6 billion in 2010-11 to $118.7 billion in 2023-24, give the country hard power. While financing around half of India's merchandise trade deficit, net remittance receipts have been an important absorber of external shocks during this period. High remittance inflows contribute to financial stability of the country.Rise of the white-collar NRIIndian migrants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries account for around half of the total Indian migrants in the world. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the largest hub for Indian migrant workers engaged primarily in blue-collar jobs which are dominated by the construction industry followed by healthcare, hospitality, and tourism.The RBI article said there is a gradual shift seen in remittance sources. The results of the survey highlight the gradual shift in dominance of India's remittances from the GCC countries to the AEs (advanced economies) particularly the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada and Australia which together accounted for more than half of the remittances in 2023-24, the article said.The GCC countries (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain) together contributed 38 per cent to total remittances received by India in 2023-24, higher than its share recorded in 2020-21 (COVID-19 pandemic year).The share of the US in India’s total remittances remained largest, rising to 27.7 per cent. The UAE, the largest hub for Indian migrant workers, maintained its position as the second largest source of India’s remittances, with its share increasing from 18 per cent in 2020-21 to 19.2 per cent in 2023-24. This is in stark contrast to the US where Indian migrants are mainly employed in the white-collar jobs, thus explaining the higher remittances received from US despite the lower number of migrants as compared to the UAE, the article said.For Indians, opportunities to work in foreign countries first started pouring in a big way during the seventies when the oil boom in the Persian gulf countries created openings for Indian semi-skilled workers. This led to some initial pick up in remittances. Later in the nineties, the IT boom created a huge market for Indian skilled IT professionals in advanced economies in North America and Europe. This led to a surge in remittances to India leading India to emerge as one of the top recipients of remittances.The success of the NRIs who have reached top positions in several fields in advanced countries has led to more remittances from those countries.The astounding success story of Indian-AmericansA report by BCG and Indiaspora, a nonprofit organization comprising of global Indian origin leaders, has numbers that narrate the desi success story in the US: 51 lakh Indian diaspora at present has a median income of $136,000, which is almost double the US average, and they account for just 1.5% of the US population but paying 5-6% of US taxes. The desi dominance is in all fields and not just technology.“One in 10 physicians in the US is an Indian-American, serving 30% of patients… Sixty per cent of all US hotels are owned by members of the diaspora, generating $700 billion in revenue and creating over 40 lakh jobs… Indian Americans own an estimated 35-50% of all convenience stores in the US, representing $350-490 billion in revenues each year…. Starting with one unicorn in 2010, India has seen exponential growth reaching 114 unicorns as of March 2024… India is the leading country of origin for immigrant-founded unicorns in the US in the last five years,” the report titled “Small Community, Big Contributions, Boundless Horizons” said.A large number of Indians went to the US for coding jobs over the past couple of decades. But because the education in schools and colleges in India is not only about Maths and Science, they had learnt to negotiate; tackle real-life problems and make an overall societal impact, Rohit Jain, CIO, Harvard Business School Alumni Association, had told TOI two years year. “The fact that we knew programming well also helped many Indians to make a natural progression to management roles in the US. And, of course, having degrees from top American management schools brought more to the table with many Indian Americans making big transitions to CEO and senior VP positions,” Jain had said.Indians are among the biggest leaders of innovation in Silicon Valley and America's tech industry cannot survive without them, the CEO of the Silicon Valley Central Chamber of Commerce Harbir K Bhatia had told news agency PTI in an interview in last year. Indians are one of the biggest drivers of innovation in Silicon Valley, Bhatia said in the interview. The tech industry here wouldn't be the same without them. Bhatia said nearly 40% of Silicon Valley CEOs or founders hailed from India. She emphasized the impact Indian-Americans have on major corporations. They're leading companies like Google, YouTube, Microsoft - at the CEO or CXO level, Bhatia said. This doesn't happen by accident. Bhatia attributes this success to a strong cultural emphasis on hard work and achievement.Why NRIs are increasingly investing back homeIncreasingly, the NRIs are investing in India across asset classes. In an interview with ET, Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder & CEO, FinEdge, listed four reasons why India is currently attracting significant interest from NRI investors.Rise of the Indian Economy led by favourable demographics: India’s rapid economic growth, marked by the tag of the world’s fastest-growing major economy, has been a big factor for the country attracting investments from all over the world. Being tipped as a huge consumption and manufacturing story India is projected to become a 5 trillion-dollar economy by 2025. With structural reforms and huge spending on infrastructure, the government of the day is ensuring that the right growth drivers are in place for India to become a developed economy by 2047. We are fast approaching tipping points in higher per capita income which should lead to exponential growth over the next two decades.Performance of the Indian Stock Market: The Indian stock market has consistently delivered strong returns over the past years and there has been large retail participation happening in the overall stock market growth story. A growing economy translates into higher stock market valuation and hence the long-term prospects of the stock markets remain upbeat in line with these growth projections. The Indian stock market is also considered among the most well-regulated in the world.Improved Standard of Living: We are increasingly seeing the trend of reverse brain drain happening in India. With opportunities abound and the start-up ecosystem coming of age, a lot of global Indians are moving back to capitalise on this trend. The improved living standard with infrastructure upgrades is adding to India becoming an attractive destination for NRIs to own assets here.Depreciation of the Indian Rupee: The weakening of the Indian Rupee against major global currencies offers NRIs a favourable exchange rate advantage. This depreciation makes investing in Indian assets, including real estate and equities more advantageous for NRIs earning in foreign currency.","summary":"Prime Minister Modi highlighted the significant contributions of the Indian diaspora in the US. An RBI analysis shows India's remittances have surged, with advanced economies like the US and UK surpassing Gulf economies. Indian migrants in white-collar jobs are now a major source of remittances, boosting India's financial stability. NRIs are increasingly investing back in India, driven by economic growth.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rise-of-the-white-collar-nri-gives-india-hard-power/articleshow/119306309.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119306277,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-151086,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 13:34:59","author":"Et Online","authors":["Et Online"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.195},{"id":302650246,"title":"Wrestling icon challenges Tim Walz to a fight after saying he could beat up Donald Trump's voters","text":"Wrestling icon challenges Tim Walz to a fight after saying he could beat up Donald Trump's voters\n\nREAD MORE: President Donald Trump meets with Man City chief at White House\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nBy JAKE NISSE and ISABEL BALDWIN\n\nPublished: 13:15 GMT, 21 March 2025 | Updated: 13:30 GMT, 21 March 2025\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz has been challenged to a wrestling match by a WWE legend after claiming he could 'kick the a**es' of most Donald Trump voters.\n\nThe comments from Walz, the former running mate of presidential candidate Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly spread throughout conservative circles after he made them on California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast.\n\nAnd Knox County, Tennessee Mayor Glenn Jacobs - formerly known as WWE Hall of Famer Kane - responded by challenging Walz to a charity wrestling match.\n\n'All joking aside, @GovTimWalz , let's put our money where our mouth is...in a charity wrestling match,' he wrote on X on Thursday night.\n\n'We'll split the gate 50/50 between our chosen organizations. I'll kick things off myself with a $10,000 donation. What do you say? #TennesseeWalz #LetsDance.' \n\nThe offer from Jacobs came after he had mocked Walz's comments on Newsom's podcast, sharing an apparently AI photo of Walz wearing a rainbow leotard in the ring.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz said he could beat up most of President Donald Trump's voters\n\nWWE Hall of Famer Kane has responded by challenging Walz to a charity wrestling match\n\nAll joking aside, @GovTimWalz, let's put our money where our mouth is...in a charity wrestling match.

And you can't just dismiss people,' Newsom began.\n\n'How do you fight it? I think I could kick most of their a**, I do think that,' Walz replied.\n\n'I know I can outrun them. I don't know if we're going to fall into that place where we challenge you to a WWE fight here, type of thing,' he continued.\n\nWalz has also come under fire from Republicans for his stance on transgender rights, which he staunchly defended on the campaign trail.\n\nIn April 2023, Walz signed the 'Trans Refuge' bill that shields people seeking and providing gender-affirming care in Minnesota.\n\nMore recently, his state has defied the executive order from President Trump seeking to ban transgender women from women's sports. \n\nThe Minnesota State High School League said last month that it will follow state law - rather than federal law - when it comes to students' eligibility for sports, allowing them to compete based on their gender identity.\n\nGlenn Jacobs, formerly known as Kane, is now the Mayor for Knox County, Tennessee\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order seeking to keep biological males out of women's sports on February 5 \n\nEarlier this month, Walz - a former high school football coach - was ripped into by former Vikings player Jack Brewer, who lobbied for a state bill to ban trans athletes competing in women's sports.\n\nThe bill, named the 'Preserving Girls' Sports Act,' was also been backed by conservative activist Riley Gaines, and passed in the state's House Education Policy Committee on February 20.\n\nFresh trans sports feud breaks out in Oregon as athlete wins 400m race by nearly 10 seconds\n\nHowever, it was ultimately unanimously rejected by the state's House Democrats. \n\nBefore a rally for the eventually failed bill, Brewer took aim at Walz, who was previously a high school football coach at Mankato West High School.\n\n'It's absolutely disgusting, and it's why, when you see him and you see his mannerisms and the way he carries himself, you know this guy doesn't appeal to real men and boys who have battled it out on the gridiron, man. I have nothing in common with this guy,' Brewer told Fox News.\n\n'I think he's a disgrace to the football world to be honest.'\n\nCalifornia has also defied Trump's executive order banning trans athletes from women's sports.\n\nDonald TrumpTim Walz\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWrestling icon challenges Tim Walz to a fight after saying he could beat up Donald Trump's voters\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has been challenged to a wrestling match by a WWE legend after claiming he could 'kick the a**es' of most of Donald Trump's voters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14523267/wrestling-icon-tim-walz-fight-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/21/13/96432319-0-image-m-31_1742562566246.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 13:16:06","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin,Jake Nisse","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin","Jake Nisse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":302659852,"title":"Democrats' new internet strategy tops trending charts but also draws mockery from allies and foes (World)","text":"For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers.

Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.”\n\n“I didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video.\n\nTrump prompts a more aggressive digital posture\n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls.

House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.\n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year’s election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.\n\nDemocrats are aiming to double engagement with digital content\n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes … we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.”\n\nBooker said he’s aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump’s joint address to Congress, according to Booker’s office.\n\nBut the Democrats’ digital efforts also draw Republican mockery\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump’s speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.\n\n“They are all actors reading a script,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it’s a strategy they’ve taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats’ creators event created a “Choose Your Fighter” video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women’s History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don’t consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans’ attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.\n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video.

But Thursday’s CBS Evening News showed MacFarlane dismissing the Trump administration’s labeling of drug cartels as terror groups, denouncing it as a “controversial,” “provocative,” and potentially harmful.\n\nMacFarlane was cued up by co-anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois acknowledging a Coast Guard display Thursday of “nearly 46,000 pounds of illegal drugs seized in the Eastern Pacific” that “includ[ed] more than 12,000 pounds of cocaine.”\n\nMacFarlane actually started on a strong note: “Inside the headquarters of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the walls are covered from nearly floor to ceiling with pictures of Americans killed by fentanyl.”\n\nAfter acting DEA Administrator Derek Maltz said the fight against fentanyl isn’t “a red or blue issue” and seeing these tragic cases “inspires me” to bring justice, MacFarlane brought up the terror designation.\n\n“It seems to be equating them with ISIS, bin Laden. Is that an accurate comparison,” he asked, to which Maltz said it’s something he’s wanted “for years” because “we’re losing 100,000-plus Americans every year to these dangerous substances that are coming into this country.”\n\nWith that number established that, if it were done by an Islamist group, Americans would be enraged, Maltz explained the reasoning behind the designation: “The cartels’ motive is to make as much money as they can, but they really don’t care of the collateral damage...If they kill 100,000 Americans, but they make billions of dollars, that’s okay with them.”\n\nMacFarlane then pivoted back to the terrorists, fretting “[a]nother potentially powerful, though controversial, tool, charging people, including Americans, who help the cartels with a felony charge of material support of terrorism, which could carry a life sentence.”\n\nTo provide a defense of illegal immigrants who belong to foreign gangs now labeled as terrorists and lament this could affect remittances to Latin America, he turned to Rachel Levinson-Waldman, Brennan Center lawyer and Kamala Harris donor (though he left the last part out). It was also here he claimed going after cartels is “provocative” (click “expand”):\n\nMACFARLANE: Rachel Levinson-Waldman is a national security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. [TO LEVINSON-WALDMAN] Do you think it’s realistic that somebody in Chicago or Cheyenne sends money back home to Mexico to family could get prosecuted if the family ends up handing that money over to a cartel?\n\nLEVINSON-WALDMAN: I actually think it’s not unlikely at all and I think that’s especially seeing it through the lens of what this administration has very explicitly stated its goal to be. Its goal is mass deportations.\n\nMACFARLANE: As you try to get after this, you need some cooperation from Mexico. Doesn’t this provocative designation make it harder for Mexico to want to help?\n\nMALTZ: We just can’t keep relying on people that don’t want to cooperate. So we have to be more aggressive than we have been. And we have to use all the tools that are available.\n\nBack live, MacFarlane blasted the idea of charging cartel members and going into their bank accounts by saying it “could scare off people from knowingly giving money to the cartels or risk unknowingly doing so.”\n\n“[L]ate today, a federal lawsuit was filed by the family of a DEA agent allegedly killed by cartel leaders. They have sued the cartel leaders individually for money. John and Maurice, that’s a legal strategy only available in this case to terror victims,” he added.\n\nEven though he already spent time opining like an ACLU lawyer why throwing the book at illegal immigrant drug cartels is somehow wrong, DuBois asked MacFarlane to explain more about the “downside to all of this.”\n\nThe CBS correspondent shamefully fretted this will “scar[e] things off”: “How about scaring off sources the DEA may have inside these cartels, helping them infiltrate it? And also, as we asked at the end there, does it damage relationships with Mexico, which has also been critical right on the border of helping infiltrate the cartels?”\n\nTo see the relevant CBS transcript from March 20, click here.","summary":"With January 6 cases having evaporated, CBS’s Scott MacFarlane has been looking for a new area to channel himself and being the Justice correspondent (i.e. Deep State liaison) has suited him well.

And how we respond to these crises today, will impact not only our lives, but the lives of our kids, future generations, and in terms of climate change, the very well-being of the planet,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tells more than 3,000 rally goers at a park in Las Vegas Thursday. They yell their approval as he shouts “no” to a government run by billionaires and while calling for one that works for everyone.\n\nThe rumpled octogenarian and two-time presidential candidate has no plans to seek the Oval Office again. But at a time when much of the Democratic Party is stunned by the Trumpian onslaught, grasping for a strategy and a message, it’s telling that Bernie Sanders, for now, is stepping into the void – and striking a chord.\n\nIn recent weeks, Senator Sanders has been bringing his populist message to swing districts narrowly won by Republicans throughout the heartland and West. His “Fighting Oligarchy” tour is drawing surprisingly large crowds, in a year with no major elections on the horizon.\n\nIn Warren, Michigan, earlier this month, some 10,000 people turned out to hear Mr. Sanders rail against the Trump administration, which he says is leading the nation toward “authoritarianism” and “kleptocracy.” In Las Vegas on Thursday, organizers had to change venues at the last minute to accommodate all the attendees. In Tempe, Arizona, some 15,000 people showed up, according to organizers, who say 50,000 people have RSVP’d for the rallies in the West.\n\n“Everybody’s looking for someone to get them out of this mess,” says Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who was chief strategist for Mr. Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “He’s kind of a St. John the Baptist of this thing. He’s out there sort of calling, saying, ‘Hey, we’ve got to do something about this.’”\n\nAs with John the Baptist, Mr. Sanders seems to understand his ultimate job may be to help pave the way for the party’s next savior. On his latest stretch of the tour, he brought along New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party’s other progressive stars, young enough to be his granddaughter. Only 29 when first elected to Congress in 2018, and like Mr. Sanders, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has described herself as “evolving.” Some suggest she may eventually end up in the Senate or seek the presidency.\n\n“Assassin smart”\n\nShe had plenty of fans at the rally, who admire her for standing up for progressive values and not giving ground, even to other Democrats. “She’s assassin smart,” says Mike Dicosta, a retiree at the rally with his hiking friends. “She’s one of us,” says Angela Dorsey – that is, working class.\n\nSeveral rally goers said they could see the young progressive taking on the mantle of Mr. Sanders. He’s got experience with national organizing that she could learn from and she’s got an enviable command of social media. He had a strong following among Latinos, who affectionately called their political uncle “Tio Bernie.” She has a Puerto Rican background. Democrats are going to have to win back Hispanics they lost to Mr. Trump in 2024.\n\nMost important, both she and Mr. Sanders bring the kind of fighting posture many Democratic voters seem particularly hungry for right now.\n\n“We’re going to take our country back!” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez promised an eager crowd, marveling at an audience bigger than she had anticipated. When she asked how many people were first-time rally goers, a sea of hands went up.\n\nOther Democratic officials are trying out different kinds of appeals. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another politician with an eye on 2028, has drawn attention and controversy by having prominent MAGA figures on his new podcast in recent weeks. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, in her response to the president’s joint address to Congress, put forward a pragmatic kind of politics, focusing on kitchen table issues.\n\n“There’s clearly a bunch of different approaches going on,” says Democratic strategist Joe Trippi. Mr. Sanders is one of a medley of effective Democratic voices out there, he argues, and it’s a mistake to think only a Democratic populist can stop “the populist Trump.” “It’s going to take everything, and it won’t be one wing, or one flavor, or one person.”\n\nStill, he adds, Mr. Sanders clearly recognizes the high stakes – and is speaking with a particular urgency.\n\nOrganizers describe the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour as a pressure campaign to force vulnerable members of Congress to vote against any potential cuts to Medicaid, housing, nutrition, education and other “basic needs” in order to pay for Republican tax breaks for the rich.\n\n“What we are trying to do is, in one way or another, maybe create a party within the party, of bringing millions of young people, working class people, people of color, to demand that the Democratic Party start standing with the working class of this country and take on the very powerful corporate interests that have never had it so good,” Mr. Sanders said in a March 18 interview with CNN.\n\nDivided Democrats\n\nThe tour comes at a time of particular division and anxiety among Democrats following their November loss of the White House and Senate. A recent CNN poll shows a record low approval rating for the Democratic Party – only 29%, the lowest since the network started polling in 1992.\n\nInfighting boiled over after Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer voted for a Republican spending bill last week to avert a government shutdown. It passed but exposed a sharp disagreement among Democrats in Congress. Both Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, opposed the bill and wanted to use the threat of a shutdown as leverage against President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nSenator Schumer, facing calls to step aside from leadership, argues that a government shutdown would have been far worse for average Americans. But Democrats aren’t in the mood for cooperation with Republicans.\n\n“I’m very, very, very, very disappointed in Democrats,” says Antonio Salas Jr., at the Las Vegas rally, wearing a “Deport Elon” button. A two-time Bernie voter, he says “It’s time to step up and not be nice anymore. I’m a firm believer now that we need to go lower, period, to defend our freedoms, our Constitution.”\n\nThat’s borne out in the new CNN poll, which finds that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would rather stop the GOP agenda than work with Republicans to try to get some Democratic ideas passed – 57% to 42%. It’s a stark reversal from President Trump’s first term, when 74% of Democrats and independents aligned with them wanted the party to work with Republicans to further Democratic priorities.\n\nWhen asked to name the leader they feel best reflects “the core values” of the Democratic Party, the top performer was the former bartender from the Bronx, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, at 10%. The next two were former Vice President and presidential nominee Kamala Harris at 9% and Senator Sanders at 8%.\n\n“He sees a moment, and he’s probably right, there is an opportunity here,” says Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. She sees Mr. Sanders trying to use this moment “to undermine Trump – but also to build on the movement that he has cared about” for decades, pushing for free child care and public college, as well as a national health insurance program, Medicare for All.\n\nA core argument about economic anxiety\n\nThe Vermont senator’s message may not resonate with everyone. Senator Sanders’ version of left-wing populism aspires to even bigger government, at a time when there is very little trust in institutions. And while Elon Musk may be giving billionaires a bad name among some voters, many still view achieving wealth as part of the American dream.\n\n“Bernie Sanders, and his soak-the-rich message, especially, is not going to work, because even Americans that are not wealthy aspire to be,” says Brian Seitchik, a Republican consultant in Arizona who was Mr. Trump’s state director in 2016 and regional political director in 2020.\n\nThe senator’s core argument – which hasn’t really changed over the years – failed twice at the presidential level, Mr. Seitchik points out. “If he’s going to be the face of the Democratic Party for the next two years, I say fantastic!”\n\nYet Mr. Sanders has also been speaking directly to economic issues for over a decade, addressing cost-of-living problems, like housing and health care, that have only gotten worse. Some say the party should have been echoing him more closely all along.\n\n“I think that’s really why people listened to him, because he was talking about issues that were the source of their economic anxiety,” says Mr. Devine. “And that economic anxiety has not gotten better between 2016 and today.”\n\nIf Mr. Trump has an Achilles Heel, it may be the economy. The president has lately conceded that a recession may be necessary to achieve the economic change he’s looking for. And his tariffs have not been popular. Recent polls have shown a majority of Americans now disapprove of Mr. Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\nIf that view persists, the president could face a backlash in the midterm elections – regardless of whether Democrats have unified message or a messenger by then, says David Byler, chief of research at the polling firm Noble Predictive Insights in Phoenix. In 2018, “it wasn’t clear who the Democrats were; it wasn’t clear who their leader was” yet they still won control of the House, says Mr. Byler.\n\n“People forget, or aren’t aware, of what it’s like when you have a wave election in this country,” says Mr. Devine. “If the Trump policies have the kind of impact which I think they’re going to have, which are disastrous – I think a lot of people are gonna be ready to give the Democrats a chance.”\n\n“And when that happens, then new Democratic leaders will emerge.”","summary":"The curmudgeonly Vermont senator, with his populist message, is drawing large crowds.

Don Lemon , 59, made the remarks about black Trump supporters during an episode of Bill Maher’s ‘Club Random’ podcast.\n\nIn the interview released Sunday, Lemon said: ‘If you become a black MAGA person it’s like ‘whoa let’s book this person, let’s put him on television.’ ‘I don’t think you can be black and be a rational MAGA person. I think you can be black and be a Republican.’\n\nMaher immediately challenged the claim, telling Lemon: ‘I think they would find that very insulting.’ Lemon replied: ‘Well, the truth is often insulting.’\n\nThis election, 86 percent of black voters supported Kamala Harris versus 13 percent who cast a vote for Donald Trump , according to CNN exit polls. This is not the first time the controversial ex-anchor has unleashed on Trump supporters.\n\nIn December, Lemon branded MAGA voters as [expletive] idiots’ on his podcast and mocked what he called their ‘stupid MAGA brain.’ During that earlier rant, Lemon said: ‘You’re so [expletive] stupid and you deserve it. You [expletive] deserve it because you’re so dumb. Yes, I am gloating over your stupidity,’ while discussing a controversy about H-1B visas.\n\nLemon’s stint at CNN ended in April 2023 after a 17-years with the network. Lemon was fired by CNN in 2023 after a series of scandals, including an on-air assertion that women in their 40s are ‘past their prime.’ In September, Lemon angered liberals when he warned them that Kamala Harris may not be able to count on large margins of black voters in her quest to beat Donald Trump.\n\nLemon said he tried to educate voters that the Democratic Congress was behind the stimulus checks that Trump had made a point of signing his name to, and that ‘Donald Trump actually held it up so that his name could be on the check, so they think they got the check directly from him.’\n\nTreasury officials denied at the time that adding Trump’s name to the stimulus checks caused any delays. Lemon noted Joe Biden, during his time as President, has also ‘given one or two stimulus checks as well, but they seem not to know and understand that.’\n\n‘You can vote for whomever you want to vote for, but the reasons that you’re going to vote for them, I think they should be accurate and factual, and you should know why you’re supporting someone,’ he said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Last week, the party’s Senate caucus seemed poised to do something that they had never done before: block the Trump administration’s proposed continuing resolution, and shut down the government. It would have been a largely symbolic move, one that signaled opposition to the Trump administration’s usurpation of Congress’s spending authority and a willingness to play procedural hardball in order to slow Elon Musk’s radical anti-government agenda. It would have signaled, too, a party willing to take itself seriously as the opposition to a president with authoritarian ambitions.\n\nGovernment shutdowns are unpopular, but so, right now, is the Democratic party: several senators from swing states seemed ready to stick their necks out, ready to bet that it would be better to be seen doing something – anything – to oppose the Trump agenda than to roll over yet again. And for a few days, at least, it looked like Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, would back them up.\n\nThen he didn’t. Schumer abruptly reversed course on the continuing resolution, vowing to both allow the government funding bill to come to the Senate floor and to vote for it himself. The bill passed.\n\nFor many, the moment was emblematic of the Democratic leadership’s singular unwillingness to oppose Donald Trump, and their bizarre belief that the Republican party – that cabal of increasingly fascist politicians that has spent the past decade calling their opposition pedophiles, attacking the rule of law and eroding democratic self-government – can be reasoned with, cajoled and brought back to their senses. Weak, ineffectual, unburdened by conscience or principle, unwilling to take their own side in an argument, and preferring to lose with dignity than to win at the risk of offending anyone: in the budget fight, Schumer embodied all of his party’s worst impulses, the ones that have allowed Donald Trump to seize control of American politics and turn our constitutional order to dust.\n\nIn many ways, Schumer is reading from a 30-year-old playbook, the one that brought Bill Clinton to power in 1992. Clinton, a moderate, tracked to the right, distanced himself from his party on social issues, prized compromise, and touted himself as tough on crime. This formula worked once, and Democratic party conventional wisdom has demanded that the party return to it, over and over again, in spite of changed circumstances and diminishing returns – like the pet dog who continues to lick a greasy spot on the sofa where she once found a piece of dropped cheese. Times have changed since 1992; the people who were infants that year that Clinton’s centrism swept to power are now not only adults, but adults with back pain. There was a moment in the 2024 campaign, after the selection of Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate, when it looked like the party might finally abandon this old strategy and take on a more aggressive and affirmative tactic; instead, Walz was muffled, and the party leaders are now mistaking the result of their rightward-tacking strategy as a product of the failure to adhere to it faithfully enough. Politics have changed, but the Democrats haven’t: they are old and out of touch, not just in their gerontocratic leadership, but in their worldview. In the New York Times last month, James Carville, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton campaign, advised his party to “roll over and play dead”. But if the Democrats really were dead, would anyone be able to tell the difference?\n\nBut one Democrat seems to be showing some refreshing signs of life. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young, progressive Democrat from New York, had in recent years seemed eager to show her willingness to cooperate with Democratic leadership, acting as a key vote and public messenger on crucial issues. But her patience with her party seems to have run out. In a CNN interview, she called Schumer’s capitulation to Trump a “tremendous mistake” and a “huge slap in the face” to Democratic voters – and to a major federal workers’ union, which had endorsed a shutdown. “There is a huge sense of betrayal” among voters, she told journalists, at the mainstream Democrats’ unwillingness to fight.\n\nThe mainstream of the Democratic party has long accused progressives – like Ocasio-Cortez and her mentor, Bernie Sanders – of a kind of moral vanity, a willingness to sacrifice effective governance or policy gains for the sake of personal purity. The shoe is not on the other foot: it is the mainstream Democratic leadership – Schumer and his allies – who now favor decorum over the public interest, personal dignity over principle, a vain hope for a return to the politics of the past over their responsibility to engage with the realities of the present. It is the centrist Democrats, not the progressives, who are living in a delusion, and who are selling out the country in order to maintain it.\n\nSchumer may have been a better man for the job in a different era. “Schumer once had a salty, outer-borough pique that did some work to counter Trump,” the writer Sam Adler-Bell wrote in New York Magazine, “but his mien today is weary and distracted.” Now, he seems tired, his red glasses slipping down his nose, his affect exhausted. No wonder he doesn’t want to fight Donald Trump – he doesn’t have much fight left in him at all. After her public break with Schumer, some speculated that Ocasio Cortez might challenge him in a primary for his Senate seat. She should. Schumer comes up for re-election in 2028, at which point he will be nearly 78 years old; Ocasio-Cortez will be 39. Would it even be a fair fight?","summary":"Leading Democrats vainly hope for a return to the politics of the past – they must engage with the realities of the present\n\nIs this the way the Democratic party ends – not with a bang, but with a whimper? Last week, the party’s Senate caucus seemed poised to do something that they had never done before: block the Trump administration’s proposed continuing resolution, and shut down the government. It would have been a largely symbolic move, one that signaled opposition to the Trump administration’s usurpation of Congress’s spending authority and a willingness to play procedural hardball in order to slow Elon Musk’s radical anti-government agenda.

Here's Who Qualifies","text":"Elon Musk is offering Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition opposing so-called \"activist judges\" who have ruled against the Trump administration, reviving one of the billionaire's most controversial strategies from the 2024 presidential election.Last year, the Tesla CEO's America political action committee (PAC) promised to award $1 million each day to one lucky swing state voter selected by the group who had signed a pro-Trump petition, in a move that experts condemned as illegal or coming close to it.Why It MattersThe Tesla CEO's cash offer to Wisconsin voters comes after Musk and President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of a federal judge who questioned the administration's deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a controversial prison in El Salvador.In a rare show of opposition, the calls to impeach U.S. District Judge James Boasberg were formally rebuked by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said that for \"more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"However, neither Trump nor Musk appear willing to back down in their criticism of judges opposing the administration's actions. The battle between the executive and the judiciary is heading towards a constitutional crisis.What To KnowIt is not a coincidence that Musk's cash offer is being handed out to voters in Wisconsin, a state where a key election for a crucial seat on the state's Supreme Court will be held on April 1.The new judge will determine whether the Wisconsin Supreme Court will ideologically sit on the political right or the left in the swing state that was courted by both Trump and Kamala Harris last year, but which ultimately voted for the Republican candidate.Two political groups backed by Musk—America PAC and Building America's Future—are spending nearly $20 million to support the candidacy of Brad Schimel, a judge in Waukesha County and former GOP attorney general who is now the Republican nominee for the state Supreme Court's available seat.The Democratic candidate is Dane County judge Susan Crawford, who has received millions in donations from donors such as George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Axios reported that roughly $30 million has already been spent on the race.Musk's America's PAC will give $100 to each Wisconsin registered voter signing the petition and another $100 for every signer they refer. While the billionaire's political group won't know for sure whether a Wisconsin voter who signed the petition will then go on to vote in the April 1 election, the political group will have their contact details.Doubling DownThis latest cash pledge from Musk is a sign that he is not thinking of cutting back his involvement with the Trump mission, despite apparent damage to his Tesla brand both on the markets and on the streets, following vandalism to the cars his company produces.With an estimated net worth of $327.5 billion, Musk is currently the richest man in the world, as well as a \"special government employee\" within the Trump administration. The billionaire has thrown his considerable wealth behind the president's election and, now, his priorities.During the 2024 presidential race, Musk's America PAC spent more than $250 million in support of Trump's candidacy, raising questions about possible conflicts of interest. He recently said he plans to donate $100 million more to Trump's political operation.The billionaire's outsized role and authority within the Trump administration, especially his leadership of the advisory Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tapped by the president with shrinking the size of the federal government, have also sparked outrage among experts, voters and political opponents.What People Are SayingThe petition which Musk is now supporting says: \"Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas. By signing below, I'm rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role—interpreting, not legislating.\"Musk wrote on X earlier this week: \"Something needs to be done to stop the repeated and egregious violation of democracy by the judiciary. That is obvious to all.\"Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday: \"Judge James Boasberg is doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency. He is a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his 'Rulings' are so ridiculous, and inept. SAVE AMERICA!\"What's NextMusk's and Trump's criticism of the judiciary is expected to continue, together with clashes with judges, like Boasberg, who decide to stand up to some of the Trump administration's most controversial and forceful actions.Experts have expressed concerns that an escalating feud between the president and the judiciary could lead to a dangerous constitutional crisis.","summary":"The billionaire is offering cash to Wisconsin registered voters who sign a petition against so-called \"activist judges.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-offering-100-checks-again-who-qualifies-2048361","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2611788/elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 11:31:24","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":302618192,"title":"Democrats' new internet strategy tops trending charts but also draws mockery","text":"WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen. \n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback. \n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.\"\n\nBooker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch. \n\n\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. \n\nThere's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a “Choose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers. \n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.” \n\n“I didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video. \n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key. \n\nSome of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.\n\n“We want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don’t have Democrats on there,” said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. “The ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that’s not typical for the Democratic base.”\n\nSome House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don’t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.\n\n“I think there’s a fine line before we’re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.\n\n“When it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing ‘get ready with me’ videos. It would look super cringe. But I’m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,” said Jacobs.\n\nSome Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it’s communicated on.\n\n“If you know how to talk to people, it doesn’t matter what medium is going to exist,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. “You could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don’t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn’t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it’s just not going to translate.”","summary":"Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/democrats-new-internet-strategy-tops-trending-charts-draws-120015543","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4d5cced8-aa95-4fec-ba9c-9baacbfbe874/wirestory_04776c7db3984606289df74fbc0203c5_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-21 11:24:30","author":"Matt Brown Associated Press","authors":["Matt Brown Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.011}]}
