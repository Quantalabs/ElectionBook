We pray for a fast and full recovery.'\n\nHis post was then shared by wife Michelle, but she did not add any additional words or messages of support, amid longstanding rumors of a feud between she and Biden.\n\nAfter Biden's disastrous debate against Trump in June 2024, rumors began to swirl that Obama had lost confidence in his ability to win a second term and began quietly supporting efforts to find a suitable replacement.\n\nBiden reportedly privately told friends and family he felt 'a deep sense of betrayal' that Obama failed to back him, despite their close relationship which blossomed when he served as Vice President for eight years. \n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for Biden revealed he had been diagnosed with an 'aggressive form' of prostate cancer.\n\nThe cancer has since metastasized and spread to his bones.\n\nObama's reference to Biden's fight to solve cancer relates to his work in the Obama administration. \n\nBiden reignited his Cancer Moonshot initiative in 2022 – he was put in charge of the effort at first when he was serving as Barack Obama's vice president.\n\nThe initiative sought to cut the cancer death rate in half by 2047 and improve the lives of those living with cancer.\n\nHelping to rid the world of cancer was a personal mission which hit close to home for Biden.\n\nBack in August at the Democratic National Convention, Obama lauded his former Vice President with praise, referring to him as his 'brother' and thanking him for his service.\n\nBut during Michelle's rousing 23-minute speech, she notably did not name Biden a single time.\n\nInsiders said at the time it was a snub, adding that the former First Lady allegedly refused to speak at the convention while Biden was still in the 2024 race.\n\nMichelle is said to remain angry with the Bidens over their treatment of her close friend Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden's ex-wife.\n\nBuhle has been exiled by the family during a lengthy separation from Hunter dating back to 2017.\n\nMichelle never campaigned for Biden when he was the nominee and, sources say, only confirmed her DNC speaking slot after he was out the way.\n\nObama's statement comes hours after Kamala Harris released a lackluster response to the diagnosis in a weak attempt to mend fences with her old boss.\n\nDespite the former Vice President's close relationship with Biden while serving as his second-in-command - her response appeared less emotional than arch-rival President Trump, and even GOP firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene. \n\n'Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis,' she wrote.\n\n'We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. \n\n'Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.' \n\nA statement from Biden's office claims that the form of cancer he has appears to be hormone sensitive and might be effectively managed by various treatments. \n\nHarris and her husband, Doug, shared coordinated messages of support on X, with Doug moments later sharing a picture of he and Biden, captioned: 'Sending love and strength to my friend, Joe Biden.'\n\nHarris and Biden's alleged feud has been brewing since Joe Biden was forced to drop out of the 2024 Presidential race - and was replaced by his deputy.\n\nHe did so on July 21 - endorsing Harris a few hours later. \n\nBut after her resounding loss to Trump just months later, there were rumors the president began giving Harris the cold shoulder.\n\nSome officials told the Daily Mail at the time he genuinely believed Harris could beat Trump and struggled to understand how she blew the race – and a billion dollars in campaign contributions – so spectacularly.\n\nBut other insiders said he was quietly seething that he was forced to bow out at all, and had expressed that he thought he would have won the race.\n\nTrump beat Harris both in the popular vote and the electoral college. \n\nSome in the Democratic Party blamed Biden himself – arguing he should have dropped out of the race far sooner than he did, and that more time would have benefited Harris's campaign.\n\n'It's almost Shakespearean that Biden didn't just kill his own campaign, he killed hers, too,' a Harris campaign adviser rather dramatically told the Washington Post.\n\nHarris' decision to post her message to Biden on X has added further fuel to the flames, raising questions about whether she called him directly as well.\n\n'Are you even serious? You stabbed this man in the back and then threw him to the wolves,' one critic said.\n\n'Such public displays of empathy... a performance for the masses. It is as if genuine concern is a rare commodity that must be theatrically displayed. Perhaps true compassion starts where the cameras end.'\n\nSome of Biden's biggest critics and MAGA loyalists have also issued heartfelt statements, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene and President Trump himself.\n\n'I’m sorry to see this news. Cancer is truly awful. My Dad passed away in 2021 with cancer. Prays for Joe Biden and his family,' Greene wrote.\n\nTrump took to TruthSocial to share his tribute, writing: 'Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. \n\n'We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\n\nBiden left office as the oldest serving president in US history – he was also elected as the oldest ever person to hold the highest office.\n\nThe Trump family were often highly critical of Biden's cognitive decline.\n\nPresident Trump, 78, often referred to Biden as 'sleepy Joe' as he slammed his light schedule as he claimed the White House was being run by his 'handlers.","summary":"Barack Obama has offered his condolences to Joe Biden following his devastating prostate cancer diagnosis - after he and Michelle helped to oust him as the Democrat presidential candidate.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14725739/Barack-Michelle-Obama-Joe-Biden-cancer.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/19/01/98514763-0-image-a-14_1747615462316.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:50:02","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":322694418,"title":"‘The people want to fight’: Western Pennsylvania Democrats lay out future for party under Trump 2.0","text":"What does winning look like for a post-Biden Democratic Party?\n\nTheir party is re-litigating the 2024 election, day by day, over the course of successive news cycles centered around new revelations about the 46th president and the unprecedented effort to hide his decline from the public.\n\nThe Tuesday release of Original Sin, a book from Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, promises more startling details about the Joe Biden that aides were insisting was plagued merely by a busy schedule and not, as has been reported, more severe memory lapses and moments of halted speech. Those concerns were underscored on Sunday as the former president announced a diagnosis of an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone.\n\nBiden’s party is truly in the wilderness after the 2024 election cycle. High-profile Democrats tied to the Obama administration and Harris campaign both have unleashed hell on the Biden family for insisting that the president would run for re-election and not, as many thought he’d indicated, serve one term before endorsing a successor.\n\nMany are also worried that the coalition patched together by Barack Obama and his then-running mate, Joe Biden, in 2008, is on the brink of shattering in the wake of his disastrous 2024 campaign. Experts point to declines in turnout among Black voters and inroads made by Republicans among Hispanic communities as a sign that the Democratic base is splintering.\n\nParty officials could look to western Pennsylvania as a way to make sure it doesn’t, elected Democrats from the region argue.\n\nThe state was one of seven battlegrounds lost by Kamala Harris in November. Worse, Democrats lost a key Senate seat with Bob Casey’s defeat and two members of the state delegation in the House of Representatives lost to Republicans as well. The vice president bet big on the Philadelphia metro area, only to lose three wards to Donald Trump, which Biden had won in 2020 — her campaign then traded insults with Bob Brady, a longtime Philly Democratic power broker.\n\nDemocrats held their own out west, gaining ground in the suburbs surrounding Pittsburgh and the city itself. Rep. Summer Lee, the state’s first Black congresswoman, won a second term with ease and ever-so-slightly drove up her margin over two years prior. Chris DeLuzio won a second term in the 17th district, one of the state’s most important battleground districts.\n\nSo what do those Democrats say about where the party goes from here?\n\n“If the people want to fight, they're going to want leaders that want to fight,” says Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey.\n\nThe first Black mayor of the largest city in the region, Gainey spoke to The Independent on Saturday ahead of a tight Democratic primary fight’s conclusion on Tuesday. The mayor laid out a vision for what he described as a “multi-racial, multi-generational coalition” that mirrored the demographics that propelled Democrats to victory in three presidential elections since the 2000s.\n\nGainey said his goal was to “unite the people behind a common message of making sure that we're speaking up for the working-class families, families that have been attacked.“\n\nFacing the son of a former mayor, Corey O’Connor, Gainey is betting that the voters who turned out for Harris to keep her afloat across the city, including Black voters, younger Democrats and progressives, will see him to victory. His campaign has focused on issues including affordable housing, while he’s pledged to continue rejecting any cooperation with Donald Trump’s deportation authorities.\n\n“That type of coalition led to, you know, Congresswoman Summer Lee being the first African-American congresswoman elected throughout the state,” Gainey told The Independent. “Then from there, we were able to step up and make Sarah Innamorato the first woman to be county exec.”\n\n“I think that momentum running, you know, going into Kamala Harris's campaign, just kept up, and we were able to make sure that that coalition delivered for her,” he said. “A lot of the metro areas, they didn't see the same thing.”\n\nAlex Wallach Hanson, the executive director of the left-leaning group Pennsylvania United, said that such a coalition “doesn't exist by accident.” His group focuses on organizing voters around progressive causes across the state, including calling for investigations into the tax-exempt status of the state’s largest employer, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).\n\n“People around the country are looking at what happened, what's happening here in Allegheny County,” said Hanson. “Why is it that this is one of the few cities in the country where Kamala Harris did nearly as well as Biden did in the 2024 election?”\n\nLocal leaders, including Lee and Gainey, have run “rooted in the identities and the stories of this multiracial, multi-generational working class coalition,” he said, “and then have brought those people into government, to help shape how government delivers for people in a really material way.”\n\nGainey spoke passionately in his interview about why seeing leaders from every community in government was important for younger Americans, explaining how politics seemed an impossible future when he was a child.\n\n“Growing up, I never met a politician,” said the mayor.\n\nNow that he’s older, he says: “I get it. I get the fact that at the end of the day, the fact that I’d never seen a politician until I got to college, how that impacted me. I get why I got into this business. Because I wanted to see something that I didn't see as a child, a city where we can use…our political instruments as a way of lifting people up.”\n\nPittsburgh is the fastest-growing city in the state, and is home to a growing tech industry. Under Gainey, it dealt with a bridge collapse while the mayor fought to address a number of familiar urban issues, including rising homelessness and a lack of affordable housing. The city has also struggled to address police staffing issues, though it has recovered from a Covid-era violent crime spike that hit many metropolitan areas.\n\nWith their party in the minority in the House and Senate, a number of Pennsylvania Democrats have taken to pressing the offensive against Trump and the GOP in town hall meetings and other events, while Republicans struggle to push the president’s first legislative priority, a budget bill, over the finish line. Gainey, Lee and DeLuzio are among them — hosting events and town halls together aimed at drawing attention to Republican threats of cutting Medicaid benefits and rolling back rights for visa holders and immigrants.\n\nDeLuzio appeared recently at an event headlined by Sen. Bernie Sanders as part of the latter’s massively popular Fighting Oligarchy speaking tour. Gainey and Lee also held an event with Conor Lamb, a former congressman rumored to be plotting another bid for office. John Fetterman, the state’s senior senator, remains plagued by reports of his erratic behavior and hasn’t held a public event in months.\n\n“We need unprecedented unity right now,” Gainey, standing beside Lee, said at one town hall event in April. “This is the time where if you don't know other communities, get to know them. Don't judge them, know them.”\n\nFor his party, the mayor also offered a simple prescription: do not back away from the communities responsible for your past wins.\n\n“Cutting things back and being conservative is not going to empower anybody. We need to be about the business of empowering people,” he said. “That's the message we should be pushing: ‘We are here to protect your civil rights.’”\n\nHe added: “And again, I'm gonna bring it back to the local. That's why in these metro areas that we're talking about, it is so important for mayors to stand up and speak out and talk about exactly what we're doing.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/people-want-fight-western-pennsylvania-225132890.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e414e59a3ca4807cac8c1542d1def7e2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:48:18","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":322692850,"title":"Illinois Officials React to Former President Joe Biden’s Prostate Cancer Diagnosis","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — Political figures and officials from Chicago and Illinois swiftly reacted on Sunday to the announcement of former President Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nBiden’s office made the announcement in a statement, saying he is facing an “aggressive” form of the disease that has spread to his bones.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7.

Joe has been instrumental in advancing treatments for all forms of cancer, and I am confident he will tackle this obstacle with his usual strength and grace. We wish for his quick and complete recovery.”\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker shared the following statement:“President Biden knows that when you get knocked down, you get back up and fight. I join the nation in sending strength to President Biden and his family and hope for a full recovery. We’re with you in this fight, Joe.”\n\nIllinois Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton shared the following statement:“Bryan and I are sending faith-filled prayers of healing and strength to President Biden. To the entire Biden family, I know your faith will give you strength for the journey ahead. You’re in our hearts.”\n\nIllinois U.S. Senator Dick Durbin shared the following statement:“Praying for my friend and former colleague, Joe Biden, after hearing news of his diagnosis.

Amy and I are rooting for you.”\n\nThe initial concern with the cancer diagnosis comes with the fact that Biden is 82 years old. Medical experts told ABC7 this cancer is not curable because it has already spread to his bones.\n\nDr. Chris George, a medical director from the Northwestern Hospital system, said hormonal treatment will likely be the best option for the former president.\n\n“It’s not curable. If it spreads to the bones, you cannot cure the cancer. Curative therapy does not exist, but it’s very treatable and controllable,” Dr. George said. “I would expect his quality of life over the next year to be reasonably good. I would expect if there is any baseline frailty or cognitive disfunction. I would expect that to perhaps get worse I would worry about that. I would not expect him to die from this disease in the next year.”\n\nDr. George explained that chemotherapy would probably not be a good option for Biden as it would quickly diminish his quality of life.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; Political figures and officials from Chicago and Illinois swiftly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Illinois Officials React to Former President Joe Biden&#8217;s Prostate Cancer Diagnosis first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/illinois-officials-react-to-former-president-joe-bidens-prostate-cancer-diagnosis/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biden-cancer-Reactions-pour-in-from-Illinois-officials-after-former.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:29:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.26},{"id":322693680,"title":"Joe Biden oo laga helay cudurka Kansarka Qanjirada","text":"May 19-(Jowhar)-Madaxweynihii hore ee dalka Maraykanka Joe Biden ayaa laga helay nooc halis ah oo ah kansarka qanjirka, kaas oo la sheegay inuu ku fidey lafahiisa.\n\nBiden oo 82jir ah, ayaa baaritaan lagu sameeyay lagu ogaaday heerka uu gaarsiisan yahay cudurka ku dhacay Jimcihii, isaga iyo qoyskiisuna waxay dib u eegis ku sameynayaan dhakhaatiirta daaweyn lahayd.\n\nBiden, oo soo noqday madaxweyne intii u dhaxaysay 2021 ilaa 2025, ayaa si lama filaan ah u soo afjaray ololihiisii ​​doorashada ee bishii Luulyo ee la soo dhaafay,kadib markii shaki laga muujiyay caafimaadkiisa.\n\nMadaxweyne ku xigeenkii xilligaas Kamala Harris ayaa la wareegtay xilka musharaxa xisbiga balse waxaa bishii November ka adkaaday Trump.\n\nMarkii la doortay, Biden wuxuu ahaa qofka ugu da’da weyn ee ku guulaysta madaxtinimada dalka Maraykanka.","summary":"May 19-(Jowhar)-Madaxweynihii hore ee dalka Maraykanka Joe Biden ayaa laga helay nooc halis ah oo ah kansarka qanjirka, kaas oo la sheegay inuu ku fidey lafahiisa.

It extended his stay in hospital and put his life in even more danger.\n\nBiden later said he was given less than a 50 percent chance of survival during this ordeal - and the pulmonary embolism was part of that dire prognosis.\n\n2003 - Gallbladder surgery and atrial fibrillation\n\nAs Biden eyed a return to presidential politics in the early 2000s, health questions once again resurfaced. \n\nIn 2003, he underwent gallbladder removal surgery - a routine procedure, but one that again raised questions about his age, stamina, and medical history. \n\nAt the time, Biden was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation - a condition that causes an irregular or fast heart beat. \n\nMedics have warned the condition can cause tiny blood clots that slowly injure parts of the brain over time, which can cause thinking and memory problems. \n\nAlthough he recovered quickly, the health scare only served to remind skeptics of his mounting list of ailments.\n\n2015 - Personal tragedy and cancer moonshot \n\nIt was not Joe Biden who was diagnosed in 2015 - but his eldest son, Beau. \n\nThe former Delaware attorney general died of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain cancer, at just 46. Biden was devastated.\n\nBut his grief became a goal and Biden launched the 'Cancer Moonshot,' a federal effort to accelerate cancer research, harnessing his political weight and his heartbreak into action. \n\n'This is the time to be bold,' he said. But even as he launched the campaign, his own aging body continued to battle new threats.\n\n2019 – Coughing fits and campaign concerns \n\nAs Biden campaigned for the presidency in 2019, his public appearances drew scrutiny not just for his gaffes, but for his health. \n\nReporters noted frequent coughing spells and hoarse speech. The campaign insisted he was fine, blaming seasonal allergies. \n\nThe concerns were only amplified as Biden, then 76, stumbled through debates and faced increasing speculation about his mental sharpness and endurance. \n\nNovember 2021 – Colon polyp removal \n\nThe White House revealed in November 2021 that Biden had a 'benign but potentially pre-cancerous' polyp removed from his colon during a routine colonoscopy. \n\nWhile doctors insisted it was nothing serious, the fact that it had been allowed to grow over time triggered concern.\n\nThe polyp was an adenoma, which has the potential to turn into colon cancer if left unchecked. \n\nThough Biden was given a clean bill of health, the incident was a reminder that even 'routine' issues could become serious at his age.\n\nJuly 2022 - COVID-19 \n\nBiden experienced 'very mild symptoms,' including a runny nose, fatigue, and a dry cough during the pandemic. \n\nHe continued working in isolation from the White House residence, and doctors began administering Paxlovid, the antiviral treatment authorized for high-risk patients.\n\nBut while Biden's public appearances via Zoom were meant to project confidence, Americans were on edge. \n\nWithin a few days Biden tested negative and was declared recovered.\n\nBut just three days later came a twist with Biden testing positive once again in what doctors referred to as a 'Paxlovid rebound' - a documented phenomenon in which symptoms and the virus return after initially subsiding.\n\nFebruary 2023 – Skin cancer \n\nJust months into the second year of his presidency, Biden had a skin lesion removed from his chest that was later identified as basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer. \n\nIt was treated successfully, but it marked the first time Biden was publicly diagnosed with any form of cancer while in office.\n\nThe White House attempted to downplay the development, noting how the type of cancer rarely spreads, but it was yet another sign of Biden's body under strain.\n\nBiden had 'several localized non-melanoma skin cancers' removed from his body before he started his presidency, White House doctor Kevin O'Connor said in his summary of the president's physical. \n\nHe also acknowledged that Biden spent a lot of time in the sun in his youth. \n\nJune 2024 – Cognitive decline \n\nThe moment Biden's health concerns could no longer be dismissed came in June 2024 during a catastrophic debate performance that stunned even his staunchest supporters. \n\nBiden appeared confused, paused for extended moments, and frequently lost his train of thought.\n\nHis team chalked it up to a cold, but inside the West Wing, alarm bells were blaring. \n\nAccording to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's bombshell book 'Original Sin', aides had been shielding the extent of Biden's mental decline from the public for months - if not years.\n\nThe episode led to an irreversible turning point with Biden dropping out of the 2024 race, clearing the way for Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. \n\nBut the damage was done. His health had finally cost him the presidency.\n\nMay 2025 – Stage 4 prostate cancer \n\nThe most devastating blow came on Sunday as Biden's office announced that the former president has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer and has already spread to his bones.\n\nThe diagnosis followed tests prompted by urinary symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule. \n\nThe Gleason score - a scale used to measure how aggressive prostate cancer is - came back as a 9. \n\nThat places Biden's cancer at the extreme end of the scale. By comparison, anything above 7 is considered high risk.\n\n'This represents a more aggressive form of the disease,' his office admitted in a stark statement. 'But the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.'\n\nThat means the cancer needs testosterone to grow and can potentially be controlled by therapies that starve it of hormones. \n\nStill, experts warn that once prostate cancer metastasizes to the bone, it becomes vastly harder to treat and nearly impossible to cure.\n\nThe former president does have longevity in his family. His father lived to be 86 while his mother lived to age 92.","summary":"Joe Biden has faced a series of serious health issues over the decades, including two life-threatening brain aneurysms and pulmonary embolisms in 1988.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14725369/joe-biden-health-scares-years.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/18/23/98511553-0-image-m-16_1747606803283.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/07/05/125160261279172787/1024x576_MP4_125160261279172787.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:12:26","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.823},{"id":322690122,"title":"Joe Biden disahkan hidap kanser prostat agresif","text":"WASHINGTON: Bekas Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Joe Biden disahkan menghidap kanser prostat yang agresif dan dilaporkan sudah merebak ke tulangnya, menurut kenyataan pejabat peribadinya semalam.\n\nBiden, 82, dan keluarganya kini sedang meneliti pilihan rawatan bersama pasukan perubatannya.\n\nBeliau kini berada di kediamannya di Wilmington, Delaware, menurut sumber yang rapat dengan perkara itu.\n\n\"Minggu lalu, Presiden Joe Biden menjalani pemeriksaan susulan selepas mengalami gejala kencing yang semakin teruk.\n\n\"Pada Jumaat, beliau disahkan menghidap kanser prostat, diklasifikasikan sebagai Kumpulan Gred 5 dengan skor Gleason 9 serta menunjukkan tanda-tanda metastasis ke tulang,\" menurut kenyataan itu.\n\nWalaupun diagnosis itu menunjukkan bentuk penyakit yang lebih agresif, kanser tersebut dilaporkan sensitif terhadap hormon, yang membolehkan rawatan dijalankan dengan berkesan.\n\nPengumuman ini dibuat beberapa hari selepas jurucakap Biden memaklumkan, bekas Presiden AS itu menjalani pemeriksaan berikutan penemuan \"nodul kecil\" pada prostatnya.\n\nSepanjang tempoh pentadbirannya, isu berkaitan usia dan kesihatan sering menjadi perhatian, terutamanya selepas prestasi beliau dalam debat menentang Donald Trump pada Jun tahun lalu.\n\nPada Februari 2024, Biden menjalani pemeriksaan kesihatan rutin di Pusat Perubatan Tentera Nasional Walter Reed.\n\nDoktor peribadinya, Dr Kevin O'Connor, ketika itu melaporkan, tiada kebimbangan baharu mengenai kesihatan beliau dan mengesahkan beliau 'layak untuk bertugas.'\n\nKesihatan fizikal dan mental Biden sebelum ini sering menjadi tumpuan media selepas dilantik menjadi Presiden AS yang juga individu tertua yang pernah memenangi jawatan itu.\n\nSementara itu, Presiden Donald Trump dan isteri, Melania Trump turut berkongsi kesedihan dalam satu hantaran di Truth Social Trump.\n\nPasangan berkenaan mengirimkan ucapan dan berdoa buat seluruh keluarga Biden dan berharap pemimpin yang pernah menerajui AS sebelum beliau itu diberi kesembuhan segera.\n\n\"Melania dan saya sedih mendengar tentang diagnosis perubatan Joe Biden baru-baru ini.

On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the statement said.\n\nIt continued, “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.”\n\nBiden, 82, and his family “are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,” the statement said.\n\nThe news comes days after a spokesperson for Biden said the former president was recently evaluated for a “small nodule” discovered on his prostate.\n\nProstate cancers can be assigned a grade, known as a Gleason score, based on what the cells look like under a microscope. A Gleason score of 9 “means it’s the most aggressive form of prostate cancer,” Dr. Benjamin Davies, a professor of urologic oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who is also not involved in Biden’s case, said in an email.\n\nBiden is at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, this weekend according to a source familiar. CNN has inquired about where the former president is being treated.\n\nBiden faced concerns over health during 2024 race\n\nConcerns about age and health dogged Biden, the oldest president in US history, throughout his time in office and came into sharper focus following his halting debate performance against Donald Trump last June.\n\nIn February 2024, Biden underwent a physical at Walter Reed National Military Center overseen by his physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who at the time said there were “no new concerns” with the president’s health and he was “fit for duty.”\n\nA new book written by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson describes how the president had been showing signs of decline that aides ignored or explained away, even before Biden’s disastrous debate that led to his decision to exit the 2024 election three weeks later.\n\nBiden has maintained a relatively low profile since leaving the White House but has slowly started to reemerge on the public stage. He appeared alongside his wife, Jill Biden, earlier this month on ABC’s “The View,” where he pushed back on suggestions he experienced cognitive decline in his final year in office.\n\n“They are wrong,” Joe Biden said. “There is nothing to sustain that.”\n\nThe former first lady added, “The people who wrote those books weren’t in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day. He’d get up, he’d put in a full day and then at night, I’d be in bed reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff.”\n\nTrump has continued to criticize Biden, even after Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, and claim the former president suffered from cognitive decline. During Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week, he largely ignored the long-held presidential norms of avoiding criticizing domestic political opponents while traveling abroad, personally attacking his predecessor multiple times. But Trump put his feelings aside Sunday as he expressed well wishes for the former president.\n\n“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” he posted on Truth Social.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who took over the Democrats’ campaign after Biden dropped out, also wished the former president a speedy recovery and added that “Joe is a fighter.”\n\n“Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time,” Harris wrote on X. “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.”\n\nCancer is ‘very serious,’ but there ‘is some good news,’ experts say\n\nBesides the Gleason score, factors such as blood prostate-specific antigen levels, imaging tests and biopsy findings are important in determining how the cancer might behave and what treatment options would be best.\n\nEven patients with high-risk prostate cancer “can live a pretty normal life and have a good quality of life, as long as the cancer is treated,” Brahmbhatt said. That treatment is personalized to each patient and might come in several forms, such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nIt could take “a few weeks” to see which direction Biden’s treatment goes, Brahmbhatt said. “Some of the treatments can affect memory, mood, quality of life, so you have to be very careful about what you end up doing, because you don’t want to be overly aggressive.”\n\nCancer has affected the Biden family before\n\nCancer has long been a personal issue for Biden, whose son Beau, an Iraq War veteran, died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.\n\nBiden established the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative in the wake of Beau’s death. The program, founded while Biden was vice president, was reestablished in 2022 with the goal of “ending cancer as we know it.”\n\nCNN’s Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, Julia Benbrook and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nWhen prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasized cancer is much harder to treat than localized cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumors and completely root out the disease.\n\nHowever, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.\n\nOutcomes have improved in recent decades and patients can expect to live with metastatic prostate cancer for four or five years, said Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center.\n\n“It’s very treatable, but not curable,” Smith said. “Most men in this situation would be treated with drugs and would not be advised to have either surgery or radiation therapy.”\n\nMany political leaders sent Biden their wishes for his recovery.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a longtime political opponent, posted on social media that he was saddened by the news and “we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”\n\nBiden's vice president, Kamala Harris, said on social media that she was keeping him in her family's “hearts and prayers during this time.”\n\n“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris wrote.\n\nThe health of Biden, 82, was a dominant concern among voters during his time as president. After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking reelection, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term. Harris became the nominee and lost to Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nBut in recent days, Biden rejected concerns about his age despite reporting in the new book “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that aides had shielded the public from the extent of his decline while serving as president.\n\nIn February 2023, Biden had a skin lesion removed from his chest that was a basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. And in November 2021, he had a polyp removed from his colon that was a benign, but potentially pre-cancerous lesion.\n\nIn 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration's priorities with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\nHis father, when announcing the goal to halve the cancer death rate, said this could be an “American moment to prove to ourselves and, quite frankly, the world that we can do really big things.”","summary":"Former President Joe Biden's office says he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.","url":"https://www.stltoday.com/news/nation-world/article_aa494139-f52d-535a-ab95-c73c6bd168fb.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/a4/aa494139-f52d-535a-ab95-c73c6bd168fb/682a4451601f0.preview.jpg?crop=954%2C501%2C474%2C422","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 23:15:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":322691064,"title":"Donald Trump's surprise reaction to Joe Biden's 'aggressive cancer' diagnosis revealed","text":"In a rare moment of unity across America’s often-divided political landscape, heartfelt messages of support have poured in following the news that former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.\n\nThe 82-year-old, who served as Vice President under Barack Obama and became the 46th President of the United States in 2021, was diagnosed last week with a high-grade cancer after experiencing symptoms that led to further investigation. \n\nHis office confirmed on Sunday, May 18, that the cancer had metastasised to the bone, but added that it was hormone-sensitive and \"allows for effective management.\"\n\nAccording to the official statement released through his office, the former President is currently in consultation with his medical team and family as they explore the next steps in his treatment. \n\nThe diagnosis came after a routine physical revealed a small but concerning nodule on the prostate.

He lost his first wife, Neilia, and their baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972. In 2015, he tragically lost his son Beau to brain cancer. That journey, one marked by unimaginable grief, has shaped Biden’s public image as a man who leads with empathy.\n\nDr Jill Biden, 72, has yet to comment publicly, but she has been at her husband’s side throughout his presidency, often calling their relationship \"a partnership rooted in love and respect.\"\n\nPublic health experts have noted that prostate cancer, while serious, is treatable, particularly if detected early and if it responds to hormone therapy. According to the American Cancer Society, over three million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer today. The survival rate for localised cases is extremely high, though metastatic cases, such as Joe’s, are more complex to manage.","summary":"President Donald Trump, 78, took to his Truth Social platform to issue a surprising statement  following the news that former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/832663/donald-trumps-surprise-reaction-to-joe-bidens-aggressive-cancer-diagnosis-revealed/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c882f86e17af-gettyimages-2210784282.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 23:13:21","author":"Faye James","authors":["Faye James"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":322681654,"title":"Donald Trump supporters claim 'Democrats knew' about Joe Biden cancer diagnosis","text":"Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which doctors have confirmed as having spread to his bones. The alarming news was shared in a statement from Biden's office today after the 82 year old sought medical help last week due to urinary symptoms. A prostate nodule was detected, and by the end of the week, Biden had received the grim news of a Grade 5 advanced prostate cancer showing rapid progression. Yet, the sombre health update has sparked fierce online debate, especially among right-wing personalities. On X, Infowars, previously managed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but no longer under his ownership, declared: \"It's Official - The 2020 Election Was Stolen, Joe Biden Was Never Legitimately President! And Now, Right On Time, He's Diagnosed with Aggressive Cancer! Alex Jones is LIVE, Exposing the Truth, Breaking Major News and Covering the Latest Shocking Developments.\" Bill Mitchell, conservative pundit and host of YourVoice America, pondered why the cancer wasn't discovered much sooner, commenting: \"Here's my question. If this prostate cancer is so advanced it has spread to his bones, how did his White House physician not diagnose and treat it earlier? Early diagnosis and treatment is key to survival. Joe Biden has likely had prostrate cancer for 4 to 6 years!\", reports the Mirror . Tim Pool, host of Timcast IRL and The Culture War Podcast, also weighed in, suggesting that the Democrats were aware of Biden's illness prior to his presidency. Pool tweeted: \"Joe Biden has Cancer with metastasis to the bone. This is considered advanced. If he had the best medical care and screenings for 4 years they'd have found it and it means he's likely had it since before dropping out. Democrats knew.\" Regarding Biden's cancer, former US President Trump expressed his sympathy on his Truth Social platform, stating: \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\" Although Biden's cancer diagnosis appears severe, there is a glimmer of hope. The disease is reportedly \"hormone-sensitive,\" which could make treatment more effective. According to a statement released by Biden's office: \"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.\" It continued: \"On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" It is unclear if anyone knew Biden had cancer before his presidency. Biden, who held the presidency from 2020 to 2024, opted not to run for a second term, handing over the reins to Vice President Kamala Harris. His choice was influenced by growing scrutiny over his age and health, especially in light of a potential rematch with Donald Trump. Although Biden's personal doctor confirmed he was \"fit to serve\" after a February 2024 check-up at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, doubts persisted. A new book is about to offer more insight. Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, set for release on Tuesday (May 20), is penned by CNN presenter Jake Tapper and Axios journalist Alex Thompson. The book reportedly discloses that Biden's team once considered the possibility of him needing a wheelchair for a second term. This internal worry followed several public stumbles and falls, including a widely shared incident in June 2023 when Biden tripped during a commencement address at the US Air Force Academy and required assistance from Secret Service agents to stand. Social media users and medical professionals have pointed out Biden's slower movements and frequent falls, hinting at potential neurological or spinal conditions. What has the White House said regarding Biden's health? White House staff have tended to minimise these episodes as typical signs of ageing, but Biden's eventual withdrawal from the 2024 election came after extensive discussions within the party. His departure opened the way for Kamala Harris, though some in the Democratic Party feel it was too tardy. Over the weekend, Senator Amy Klobuchar remarked: \"We needed a real debate about the future of the country. Instead, we were stuck in a waiting game.\" As the ex-president tentatively re-engages with public life, he and wife Jill Biden made an appearance on The View last week, eliciting a polarised reaction from Democrats regarding his level of participation in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Biden visited a Philadelphia hospital last Friday for additional tests on what has been described as a \"small nodule\" – a concerning development that necessitates \"further evaluation,\" a representative stated.

Sporting a Deus Ex-Machina jacket and Ray-Ban sunglasses, \"The Boss\" worked his way down a line of fans hoping to get his signature on a piece of memorabilia when he was asked if he had a message for Trump. Rather than answer, Springsteen could be seen chuckling for a moment before raising his hand, and then moving onto the next fan. Springsteen tore into Trump on Wednesday during the first of a series of concerts in Manchester, England. TRUMP REIGNITES FEUD WITH TAYLOR SWIFT: 'NO LONGER HOT' BECAUSE OF ME \"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock and roll in dangerous times,\" he told the crowd. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\" The crowd responded with applause when Springsteen continued to pontificate his stance on the current administration. \"Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\" Springsteen added in a video posted on his YouTube page. TRUMP CALLS SPRINGSTEEN 'HIGHLY OVERRATED' AFTER ROCKER LABELS HIM 'TREASONOUS' OVERSEAS Trump responded by slamming Springsteen and calling him \"highly overrated\" on Friday. \"I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\" The president continued in his post, saying \"Sleepy Joe didn’t have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is ‘dumb as a rock,’ and couldn’t see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.’ Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!\" Springsteen declared last year that \"I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz\" in the presidential election. Harris ended up losing the race to Trump.

Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasised cancer is much harder to treat than localised cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumours and completely root out the disease.However, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumours of hormones.Many political leaders sent Biden their wishes for his recovery.President Donald Trump posted on social media that he was saddened by the news and “we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, said on social media that she was keeping him in her family's “hearts and prayers during this time.”“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris wrote.The health of Biden, 82, was a dominant concern among voters during his time as president. After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking re-election, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term.

High-profile Democrats tied to the Obama administration and Harris campaign both have unleashed hell on the Biden family for insisting that the president would run for re-election and not, as many thought he’d indicated, serve one term before endorsing a successor.\n\nMany are also worried that the coalition patched together by Barack Obama and his then-running mate, Joe Biden, in 2008, is on the brink of shattering in the wake of his disastrous 2024 campaign. Experts point to declines in turnout among Black voters and inroads made by Republicans among Hispanic communities as a sign that the Democratic base is splintering.\n\nParty officials could look to western Pennsylvania as a way to make sure it doesn’t, elected Democrats from the region argue.\n\nThe state was one of seven battlegrounds lost by Kamala Harris in November. Worse, Democrats lost a key Senate seat with Bob Casey’s defeat and two members of the state delegation in the House of Representatives lost to Republicans as well. The vice president bet big on the Philadelphia metro area, only to lose three wards to Donald Trump, which Biden had won in 2020 — her campaign then traded insults with Bob Brady, a longtime Philly Democratic power broker.\n\nDemocrats held their own out west, gaining ground in the suburbs surrounding Pittsburgh and the city itself. Rep. Summer Lee, the state’s first Black congresswoman, won a second term with ease and ever-so-slightly drove up her margin over two years prior. Chris DeLuzio won a second term in the 17th district, one of the state’s most important battleground districts.\n\nSo what do those Democrats say about where the party goes from here?\n\n“If the people want to fight, they're going to want leaders that want to fight,” says Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey.\n\nThe first Black mayor of the largest city in the region, Gainey spoke to The Independent on Saturday ahead of a tight Democratic primary fight’s conclusion on Tuesday. The mayor laid out a vision for what he described as a “multi-racial, multi-generational coalition” that mirrored the demographics that propelled Democrats to victory in three presidential elections since the 2000s. \n\nGainey said his goal was to “unite the people behind a common message of making sure that we're speaking up for the working-class families, families that have been attacked.“\n\nFacing the son of a former mayor, Corey O’Connor, Gainey is betting that the voters who turned out for Harris to keep her afloat across the city, including Black voters, younger Democrats and progressives, will see him to victory. His campaign has focused on issues including affordable housing, while he’s pledged to continue rejecting any cooperation with Donald Trump’s deportation authorities. \n\n“That type of coalition led to, you know, Congresswoman Summer Lee being the first African-American congresswoman elected throughout the state,” Gainey told The Independent. “Then from there, we were able to step up and make Sarah Innamorato the first woman to be county exec.”\n\n“I think that momentum running, you know, going into Kamala Harris's campaign, just kept up, and we were able to make sure that that coalition delivered for her,” he said. “A lot of the metro areas, they didn't see the same thing.”\n\nAlex Wallach Hanson, the executive director of the left-leaning group Pennsylvania United, said that such a coalition “doesn't exist by accident.” His group focuses on organizing voters around progressive causes across the state, including calling for investigations into the tax-exempt status of the state’s largest employer, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).\n\n“People around the country are looking at what happened, what's happening here in Allegheny County,” said Hanson. “Why is it that this is one of the few cities in the country where Kamala Harris did nearly as well as Biden did in the 2024 election?”\n\nLocal leaders, including Lee and Gainey, have run “rooted in the identities and the stories of this multiracial, multi-generational working class coalition,” he said, “and then have brought those people into government, to help shape how government delivers for people in a really material way.”\n\nGainey spoke passionately in his interview about why seeing leaders from every community in government was important for younger Americans, explaining how politics seemed an impossible future when he was a child.\n\n“Growing up, I never met a politician,” said the mayor. \n\nNow that he’s older, he says: “I get it. I get the fact that at the end of the day, the fact that I’d never seen a politician until I got to college, how that impacted me. I get why I got into this business. Because I wanted to see something that I didn't see as a child, a city where we can use…our political instruments as a way of lifting people up.”\n\nPittsburgh is the fastest-growing city in the state, and is home to a growing tech industry. Under Gainey, it dealt with a bridge collapse while the mayor fought to address a number of familiar urban issues, including rising homelessness and a lack of affordable housing. The city has also struggled to address police staffing issues, though it has recovered from a Covid-era violent crime spike that hit many metropolitan areas.\n\nWith their party in the minority in the House and Senate, a number of Pennsylvania Democrats have taken to pressing the offensive against Trump and the GOP in town hall meetings and other events, while Republicans struggle to push the president’s first legislative priority, a budget bill, over the finish line. Gainey, Lee and DeLuzio are among them — hosting events and town halls together aimed at drawing attention to Republican threats of cutting Medicaid benefits and rolling back rights for visa holders and immigrants.\n\nDeLuzio appeared recently at an event headlined by Sen. Bernie Sanders as part of the latter’s massively popular Fighting Oligarchy speaking tour. Gainey and Lee also held an event with Conor Lamb, a former congressman rumored to be plotting another bid for office. John Fetterman, the state’s senior senator, remains plagued by reports of his erratic behavior and hasn’t held a public event in months.\n\n“We need unprecedented unity right now,” Gainey, standing beside Lee, said at one town hall event in April. “This is the time where if you don't know other communities, get to know them. Don't judge them, know them.”\n\nFor his party, the mayor also offered a simple prescription: do not back away from the communities responsible for your past wins.\n\n“Cutting things back and being conservative is not going to empower anybody. We need to be about the business of empowering people,” he said. “That's the message we should be pushing: ‘We are here to protect your civil rights.’”\n\nHe added: “And again, I'm gonna bring it back to the local. That's why in these metro areas that we're talking about, it is so important for mayors to stand up and speak out and talk about exactly what we're doing.”","summary":"Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor says his party needs to be able to stand up for its own base","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-democrats-pennsylvania-harris-biden-gainey-b2753380.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/18/19/07/GettyImages-1240728309.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 22:51:32","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":322683350,"title":"&#8216;Will Face This Challenge With Same Strength&#8217;:  Kamala Harris Wishes Speedy Recovery To Joe Biden Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer","text":"Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris offered a heartfelt message following the announcement that former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which has now spread to his bones.\nPosting on X, she said, “Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis.

The former secretary of state and failed 2016 presidential candidate notably said on Sept. 9, 2016 that 50% of President Donald Trump’s supporters belonged in what she referred to as “the basket of deplorables.”\n\n“Well, first of all, don’t be a handmaiden to the patriarchy, which kind of eliminates every woman on the other side of the aisle, except for very few,” Clinton said.\n\nThe former secretary of state named Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska as one of the rare examples of a Republican woman who is not ” a handmaiden to the patriarchy.” Hoover also mentioned former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, which Clinton appeared to agree with, saying, “Yeah, there’s a few.”\n\nMurkowski opposed Trump’s nomination of Pete Hegseth to serve as Defense secretary, along with his pardons of Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol rioters. She also joined Senate Democrats and three additional Republican senators on April 3 to end Trump’s national emergency declaration underpinning his tariffs on Canada.\n\nCheney was one of two Republicans appointed to the Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She lost her 2022 reelection bid to Trump-backed Harriet Hageman by over 37%, and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election in September.\n\n“Look, first we have to get there, and it is, you know, obviously so much harder than it should be,” Clinton added. “So, you know, if a woman runs who I think would be a good president — as I thought Kamala Harris would be, and as I knew I would be — I will support that woman.”\n\nHarris performed well with women and college-educated white voters in November, while Trump received significantly more support than her among men and white voters without college degrees, NBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki reported in December.\n\nClinton received backlash for her 2016 “basket of deplorables” comment, which she made at a fundraiser in New York. Trump defeated Clinton in the 2016 election just two months later, despite being an outsider businessman who had never served in public office, shocking the political and media establishment.\n\n“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?” she said at the time. “The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.”\n\n“He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric,” she added. “Now, some of those folks — they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.”\n\nThe former secretary of state expressed remorse the following day.\n\n“Last night I was ‘grossly generalistic,’ and that’s never a good idea,” Clinton said. “I regret saying ‘half’ — that was wrong.”\n\nMoreover, former President Joe Biden called Trump supporters “garbage” in October 2024, also receiving blowback. Trump responded shortly after by donning a bright safety vest and hosting a press conference from inside a garbage truck in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In response, former US vice president Kamala Harris expressed her support, describing Biden as “a fighter” who will face the illness with strength and optimism. Harris shared her thoughts in a post on X, saying, “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.” She added that she was “saddened” to learn of the diagnosis. Biden’s diagnosis came after recent medical checks following urinary symptoms. A routine physical exam revealed a small nodule on his prostate, which led to further testing. By Friday, doctors confirmed that Biden’s prostate cancer was present and that it had already spread to his bones. According to his office, although the cancer is aggressive, it is hormone-sensitive, which means it can be effectively managed. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,” the statement said. Prostate cancers are measured by a Gleason score, which ranges from 1 to 10 and indicates how abnormal the cancer cells are compared to healthy ones. Biden’s score of 9 shows the cancer is very aggressive. Earlier this week, media outlets including ABC News and The New York Times reported that Biden had undergone medical examinations following the discovery of the nodule. The New York Times noted that Biden spent Friday in a Philadelphia hospital for additional tests. Joe Biden, now 82, has had his physical and mental health closely watched by the public during and after his presidency.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.

All cancerous tissue was successfully removed...No further treatment is required.\"He added: \"Basal cell carcinoma lesions do not tend to 'spread' or metastasize, as some more serious skin cancers such as melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma are known to do. They do, however, have the potential to increase in size, resulting in a more significant issue as well as increased challenges for surgical removal.\"Speculation regarding Biden's health circulated widely last year before he dropped out of the presidential election race and was replaced by then-Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.In February 2024, Biden's doctor declared him \"fit to serve\" after he underwent a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.What To KnowIn a statement from Biden's office, it was revealed that he had 9 on the Gleason score, which runs from one to 10.The Gleason score is determined by looking at biopsied tissue under a microscope and indicates the severity of the case, with six or higher indicating cancer, according to the Cleveland Clinic.Prostate cancer occurs when cells begin to grow out of control, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Cells can look like healthy cells early on in the disease progression before developing into more obvious cancerous cells, the Cleveland Clinic says. This is common on a Gleason score of one. Once it progresses, the cancer cells will look like cancer cells under a microscope.On a Gleason score of 8, 9 or 10, \"The cells look very different from healthy cells, which is called poorly differentiated or undifferentiated,\" according to the Cleveland Clinic.The score is a grading system used to help determine plans of treatment for patients. A high score can mean it is more likely to spread or metastasize, the clinic said.It is not the only way of measuring the disease's progression, however. Blood levels, imaging test and other diagnostics should and can be done, according to the clinic.The prostate is located in the male reproductive system behind the bladder and above the rectum. Symptoms can include pain, difficulty and frequency urinating, as well as pain in the back, hip and pelvis that doesn't go away, the CDC said.According to data gathered by the CDC, 33,363 men died from prostate cancer in 2022.While there was a 97 percent survival rate for most patients, rates for patients who had their cancer spread dropped significantly to 36.2 percent, the data from the CDC shows.Anyone experiencing any of these systems should seek medical attention.What People Are SayingStatement from the Personal Office of Former President Joe Biden: \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\"President Donald Trump on Truth Social: \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\"Houman David Hemmati MD PhD, a medical commentator said on X: \"President Biden's diagnosis of advanced, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9 and bone metastases is a sobering reminder of how aggressive this disease can be when caught late. As a physician and former prostate cancer researcher, I know that while early-stage prostate cancer is often curable, high-grade cases like this require lifelong management.\"He added: \"Hormonal therapies can slow progression and improve quality of life—but they are not curative. This is a moment to raise awareness: men over 50 (and earlier for those with risk factors) should talk to their doctor about PSA screening. Early detection saves lives.\"What Happens NextIn the statement from Biden's office, they said the condition was \"hormone-sensitive.\"The Cleveland Clinic says there are a range of treatments for people suffering from aggressive forms of prostate cancer that include chemotherapy, hormone therapy, as well as immunotherapy.","summary":"The Gleason score is determined by looking at biopsied tissue under a microscope and indicates the severity of the case.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-gleason-score-cancer-diagnosis-2073867","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2646929/president-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 22:21:45","author":"Hollie Silverman","authors":["Hollie Silverman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":322685686,"title":"Donald Trump Reacts to Joe Biden's 'Aggressive' Prostate Cancer Diagnosis","text":"President Donald Trump is speaking out about former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosisIn a statement, Trump said, \"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery\"Biden announced on Sunday, May 18, that he had been diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer\n\nDonald Trump is speaking out about former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis.\n\nFollowing an announcement from Biden's personal office that he has been diagnosed with \"aggressive\" prostate cancer, Trump, 78, shared a statement on Truth Social wishing Biden, 82, a \"successful recovery.\"\n\n\"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis,\" Trump wrote. \"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, May 18, Biden's personal office announced in a statement obtained by Wall Street Journal reporter Ken Thomas that he received the diagnosis after seeing a doctor last week.\n\n\"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,\" the statement said.\n\n\"On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,\" the statement continued. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.

While they can be benign and harmless, some can be associated with bigger health concerns like infections or, in this case, cancer.\n\nQuestions over the former president's age, health and fitness for office ultimately led him to ditch his reelection campaign and let then-Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, take over.\n\nLeaders within the Democratic Party have started to publicly admit that Biden should not have run for reelection in 2024. Some claim that they were duped by advisers who were shielding Biden from the public and telling members of the party he was fit behind the scenes. \n\nProgressive California Democrat Ro Khanna, who appeared on ABC's This Weekon Sunday to discuss the concealment of the former president's mental state during his time in office, stated that he was 'Praying for @JoeBiden and his family to defeat the cancer he’s recently been diagnosed with. He and Jill have always been fighters and I am confident they will meet this challenge with grit and grace.'\n\nTim Walz, who joined the Democratic ticket for the White House after Biden's Kamala Harris was anointed the party's presidential nominee as Biden was pushed aside from another presidential run wrote 'Gwen and I are praying for President Biden and his family.

The shocking announcement came via a statement from Biden’s office today, confirming that the 82-year-old sought medical attention last week after experiencing urinary symptoms. Medics discovered a prostate nodule, and by Friday, a devastating diagnosis had been delivered – a Grade 5 advanced prostate cancer with signs of rapid spread. However, the tragic diagnosis has triggered heated reaction online, particularly from right-wing figures. Infowars , the controversial platform founded but no longer owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, posted on X: \"It’s Official — The 2020 Election Was Stolen, Joe Biden Was Never Legitimately President! And Now, Right On Time, He’s Diagnosed with Aggressive Cancer! Alex Jones is LIVE, Exposing the Truth, Breaking Major News & Covering the Latest Shocking Developments.\" Conservative commentator and YourVoice America host Bill Mitchell questioned how the cancer had gone undetected for so long, saying: \"Here's my question. If this prostate cancer is so advanced it has spread to his bones, how did his White House physician not diagnose and treat it earlier? Early diagnosis and treatment is key to survival. Joe Biden has likely had prostrate cancer for 4 to 6 years!\" Tim Pool, host of Timcast IRL and The Culture War Podcast , also weighed in, writing: \"Joe Biden has Cancer with metastasis to the bone. This is considered advanced. If he had the best medical care and screenings for 4 years they'd have found it and it means he's likely had it since before dropping out. Democrats knew.\" However, President Trump himself took a measured and compassionate tone via his Truth Social platform: \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\" Despite the severity of Biden's illness, there is a glimmer of hope. The cancer is described as “hormone-sensitive,” which could allow for more effective management. The statement shared by Biden’s office detailed: \"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.\" It continued: \"On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.\" \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" Biden, who served as President from 2020 to 2024, chose not to seek re-election, passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris. His decision came amid mounting questions over his age and fitness, particularly as he prepared to face off again with Donald Trump . Despite his personal physician declaring him “fit to serve” following a February 2024 assessment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, concerns had continued to swirl. Now, a forthcoming book is set to lift the lid further. Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again , due out Tuesday (May 20), is authored by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson. It reportedly reveals Biden’s advisers had at one point discussed whether he might need a wheelchair if he pushed for a second term. The behind-the-scenes concern came after a series of stumbles and public falls — including a viral moment in June 2023 when Biden tripped during a commencement speech at the US Air Force Academy and had to be helped up by Secret Service agents. Observers on social media and medical experts alike commented on his slowed gait and frequent falls, suggesting possible neurological or spinal issues. While White House aides downplayed the incidents as normal signs of ageing, Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the 2024 race followed months of internal party debate. His exit cleared the path for Kamala Harris, though some Democrats believe it came too late. Senator Amy Klobuchar said this weekend: \"We needed a real debate about the future of the country. Instead, we were stuck in a waiting game.\" As the former president begins a cautious return to public life, he and wife Jill Biden appeared on The View last week, sparking a mixed response from Democrats about how involved he should be in the upcoming 2026 midterms. Just last Friday, Biden attended a Philadelphia hospital for more tests on what was initially identified as a “small nodule” – a worrying sign that required “further evaluation,” according to a spokesperson.

That’s not a typographical error. And it’s not just a gotcha phrase, preparing the reader for learning that Mississippi leads the nation on all sorts of negative things.\n\nOnce upon a time, that was true, and in some respects it still is. Mississippi has the lowest or nearly the lowest income levels of any state.\n\nIt’s been lagging in population growth over the last decade and in the longer term. Mississippi topped the 2-million mark in 1930, and it got within 18,000 of the 3-million mark in 2018, 88 years later, but it has fallen by 55,000 since.\n\nMississippi has long been the state with the highest percentage of black residents, and black people have had, on average, lower incomes and educational achievement by various measures than others.\n\nThus, not much notice was taken in 2011, nearly a decade after passage of the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act, when Mississippi finished dead last in the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests in reading and math taken by fourth- and eighth-grade students. Louisiana, with the second-highest black population percentage, ranked 49th.\n\nThe 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress tests produced some starkly different results. Mississippi jumped to No. 14 in fourth-grade math and No. 9 in fourth-grade reading. And when the Urban Institute adjusted the scores for various poverty measures, thus measuring students in one state with those in another of the same level of economic status, Mississippi ranked No. 1 in both fourth-grade reading and fourth-grade math.\n\nLouisiana ranked No. 2 and Florida No. 3 in adjusted fourth-grade reading, and Florida, Texas and Louisiana ranked just behind Mississippi in fourth-grade math.\n\nOn the eighth-grade tests, Mississippi fell in the lower half of states in unadjusted reading and math scores. However, in the Urban Institute’s adjusted scores, Mississippi ranked fourth in reading, behind Massachusetts—whose unadjusted National Assessment of Educational Progress scores typically lead the nation—Louisiana and Georgia. And on adjusted eighth-grade math scores, Mississippi ranked first.\n\nThese astonishing numbers represent substantial and, so far as I know, entirely unpredicted progress in Mississippi, and just slightly less in Louisiana. They stand in vivid contrast to the national trend, as lengthy school shutdowns produced by powerful teacher unions in more “progressive” states resulted in sharply diminished learning and lower test scores.\n\nThe watering down of No Child Left Behind standards in the bipartisan 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act has also produced less proficiency in many states. “States like New York and Washington, with powerful teachers’ unions,” RealClearInvestigation’s Vince Bielski writes, have been “tamping down rigor, such as testing for graduation and accelerated programs, to achieve ‘equity’ for disadvantaged students.”\n\nIn contrast, “Southern states have seized on a political environment that allows them to do the things that matter,” Frederick Hess, American Enterprise Institute education policy studies director, writes. “To drive improvement, it’s easier if you have the politics of Mississippi than the politics of Massachusetts.”\n\nAs a result, black and low-income pupils are getting a better education in Deep South states such as Mississippi and Louisiana than in the “progressive” big cities of the North.\n\nWhat is Mississippi doing right? According to The 74’s Chad Aldeman, over the last decade, it has deployed literacy coaches to low-performing schools, prompted schools to screen pupils early for reading problems, and required holding back third graders not reaching reading proficiency.\n\nSchools use “science of reading” phonics-based curricula, which require repetitive drills that education school professors and many teachers loathe but young children thrive on. Parents are notified when their children are lagging and mobilized to help.\n\nOne gets the sense of group mobilization to encourage constructive learning rather than fostering grievance—something like the culture of mutual reinforcement that has produced so many successful black STEM graduates at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County’s Meyerhoff program.\n\nThree generations ago, from 1940 to 1965, millions of black people moved from places such as the Mississippi Delta to “the promised land” of cities such as Chicago. Today, young black people are receiving better educations in Mississippi than they are in Chicago, whose mayor, Brandon Johnson, is a former teachers union organizer.\n\nJohnson has the city government borrowing to pay for current spending on a contract with raises for teachers and administrators for a school system that parents have fled, with enrollment down 20% over the past decade. His fellow Democrats seem little bothered by this doubling down on a failed system. Former Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ 2024 platform talked about preschool and college loan forgiveness but said nothing about K-12 public schools.\n\nThose interested in doing so, and improving the life chances of disadvantaged children, need to look to Mississippi and to other mostly Republican-run states in the South, which have shown the nation the way without substantial spending increases.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

While they can be benign and harmless, some can be associated with bigger health concerns like infections or, in this case, cancer.\n\nQuestions over the former president’s age, health and fitness for office ultimately led him to ditch his reelection campaign and let then-Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, take over.\n\nLeaders within the Democratic Party have started to publicly admit that Biden should not have run for reelection in 2024. Some claim that they were duped by advisers who were shielding Biden from the public and telling members of the party he was fit behind the scenes. \n\nBiden reignited his Cancer Moonshot initiative in 2022 – he was put in charge of the effort at first when he was serving as Barack Obama’s vice president. \n\nThe initiative sought to cut the cancer death rate in half by 2047 and improve the lives of those living with cancer. \n\nSolving the problem of cancer hit close to home for Biden. \n\nHis son Beau Biden died at the age of 46 in 2025 after he was diagnosed in 2013 with glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive type of brain cancer.

The statement explained that Mr Biden sought medical attention last week for urinary symptoms and was found to have a \"prostate nodule\". On Friday, doctors handed down the diagnosis to the 82 year old - revealing a Grade 5 advanced cancer indicative of rapid growth and spread, now metastasized to his bones. Thankfully, the cancer is reported as \"hormone-sensitive\", providing hope for effective management as the family evaluates potential treatments. Leading the statement was the detail: \"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.\" It continued, \"On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.\", reports the Mirror . Concluding the announcement, the note mentioned: \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" Biden, having served as Commander-in-Chief from 2020-2024, made the decision to pass on the presidential campaign to Vice President Kamala Harris amidst growing concerns over his age and health, stepping back during a contentious time against opponent Donald Trump. Despite his physician declaring him \"fit to serve\" following a February 2024 examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, concerns about the former president's health during his last year in office were raised both publicly and privately. A new book titled 'Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again' is set to hit shelves on Tuesday (May 20), revealing details of Biden's deteriorating health. CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, the authors of the book, report that some of Biden's senior advisers quietly discussed the possibility of him needing a wheelchair for mobility if he pursued a second term. This conversation reportedly took place against a backdrop of increasing instances of imbalance and falls, which attracted widespread attention and criticism during the latter part of Biden's presidency. One particular incident that was shared extensively online was when Biden, aged 82, stumbled during a commencement speech at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado in June 2023, requiring assistance from Secret Service agents to stand. Medical experts and observers on social media commented on his shuffling walk and frequent stumbling, indicating potential spine and neurological deterioration. White House officials downplayed these incidents at the time, suggesting they were normal signs of ageing. Biden's announcement not to run for re-election in 2024 followed prolonged speculation and internal party pressure. Though initially the front-runner, he eventually withdrew in favour of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, calling for new leadership. Democrats have suggested Biden's decision could have come sooner to give contenders like Harris a stronger foundation for challenging Donald Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar remarked this weekend that the Democratic Party might have reaped benefits from a full primary contest in 2024 instead of settling early on an incumbent. She asserted: \"We needed a real debate about the future of the country. Instead, we were stuck in a waiting game.\" As Biden starts resuming public duties with caution, he and former First Lady Jill Biden graced ABC's The View last week, triggering varied responses among Democrats regarding his expected involvement in the approaching 2026 midterms. Last Friday saw him at a Philadelphia hospital for a further look into a \"small nodule\", initially found, needing \"further evaluation\", according to a spokesperson.","summary":"The former US President was diagnosed with the &quot;aggressive&quot; cancer on Friday, his office said, adding that he and his family are &quot;reviewing treatment options&quot;","url":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/world-news/joe-biden-cancer-latest-former-31670837","image":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/article31670834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Biden-Delivers-Remarks-On-Hurricane-Milton.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 21:13:06","author":"Christopher Bucktin,Liam Doyle,Michael D.

The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,\" it continued.Cancer cells are commonly found in the prostates of men of Biden's age, though in most cases they grow slowly. Hormone therapy is a common treatment that can shrink tumors and slow cancer growth, but is not a cure. According to the statement, Biden's cancer was found to have \"a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5).\"Prostate cancer that looks \"very abnormal\" is assigned the highest rating, Grade 5, according to the American Cancer Society. The Gleason Score often indicates the sum of the grades from the two areas in the prostate that make up most of the cancer, but can also be calculated other ways.Biden left office in January this year as the oldest serving US president in history, and was dogged by questions over his health and age for much of his presidency. For years he had faced questions, including from Democratic voters, over whether he was too old -- lacking in mental acuity or physical endurance -- for a job as trying as the presidency. His response to doubters was a brisk: \"Watch me.\"But in July last year he was forced to drop his reelection bid after a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump in which fears about his decline and cognitive abilities came surging to the fore. His vice president, Kamala Harris, eventually lost to Trump. Biden maintains that he could have won the election, but questions have long swirled over the responses of staff and key Democrats to evident signs of his decline.They have flared with the release, set for this Tuesday, of \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\" by CNN journalist Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios.Last week a newly published recording of Biden speaking hesitantly and struggling to remember key events and dates fueled renewed debate over his mental capabilities while still in office.Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy. In 1972 his wife and baby daughter were killed in a car crash, days after he had been elected as a US senator at the age of 29. Biden underwent surgery twice in 1988 for brain aneurysms. In 2023 he had a skin lesion -- a basal cell carcinoma -- removed from his chest. He had previously had non-melanoma skin cancers removed.

He steered a divided country out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the chaos of Trump's first four years, before pushing through an impressive raft of legislation.But Biden's single term will now be bookended by his rival's presidencies. And it will be defined by a single fateful decision -- to defy mounting concerns about his age and run for reelection in 2024.For many, the defining image of the 46th US president will be a haunted-looking Biden lost for words in the disastrous debate against Trump that eventually forced him out of the race.His replacement as Democratic candidate, his vice president Kamala Harris, was left with an almost impossible task to prevent Trump's return -- and indeed it proved insurmountable.Biden has often insisted that he could have beaten his Republican nemesis.But questions about Biden's physical and cognitive abilities -- and the responses of staff and key Democrats to evident signs of decline -- have flared with Tuesday's release of \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\" by CNN journalist Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios.And a newly released audio recording of Biden speaking haltingly in October 2023, and struggling to remember facts and dates, have added to the debate.Biden's inauguration in January 2021 was a remarkable comeback for an often underestimated politician who spent a lifetime battling both political odds and personal tragedy.But he was an unlikely savior.Biden was America's oldest elected president at the time -- until Trump's election in 2024 -- and arguably more famous for his gaffes and for being Barack Obama's vice president.Though his single term will be remembered for his appointment of the nation's first Black, South Asian and female vice president, and his commitment to the Western alliances that Trump had trashed, there were irreparable problems.Biden's popularity suffered an early blow with the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 -- and never really recovered. His approval rating was just 36 percent in a final CNN poll.His pandemic stimulus sent inflation soaring, part of the reason Americans punished Harris at the polls. His lax border policies led to record crossings of illegal immigrants, which Trump pounced on.Fond of folksy tales about his upbringing as a child with a stutter from a blue-collar, Irish Catholic background in Pennsylvania, he would often quote his father's mantra: \"When you get knocked down, you get back up.\" He had battled through the tragedy of a car crash that killed his wife and baby daughter in 1972, just days after he'd been elected a US senator at the age of 29 -- then rebuilt his life with the help of his second wife, First Lady Jill Biden.Then there was Beau's death in 2015, and the drug and legal problems of his younger son Hunter, to whom he controversially issued a pardon as he left office.But age was a battle he couldn't win. Trump dubbed Biden \"Sleepy Joe\" and every stumble -- on the stairs of Air Force One, off his bike -- was relentlessly replayed on social media. The White House insisted there was no problem and increasingly shielded Biden from unscripted public appearances -- until it was too late.He had a parting shot for Trump, warning in his farewell speech of a dangerous \"oligarchy taking shape in America.\"","summary":"Joe Biden lost his eldest son Beau to brain cancer in 2015 -- a loss so great that he has repeatedly talked about it over the years.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/joe-biden-democratic-fighter-now-battling-cancer-3773918","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4601627/joe-bidens-failure-keep-donald-trump-out-office-haunts-his-legacy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 21:00:28","author":"Danny Kemp And Susan Stumme","authors":["Danny Kemp And Susan Stumme"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.13},{"id":322660950,"title":"Joe Biden diagnosed with prostate cancer, his office says","text":"The news comes nearly a year after the former president was forced to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election over concerns about his health and age.

On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with the disease having metastasized to the bone.\n\n“Although this is a more severe form of cancer, its hormone-sensitive nature allows for effective management,” stated his office. “The President and his family are currently discussing treatment options with his medical team.”\n\nEarlier in the month, a routine medical examination uncovered a “small nodule” on Biden’s prostate, as reported by Nexstar’s The Hill. A spokesperson informed affiliate NewsNation that the finding “required further evaluation.”\n\nIn those diagnosed with prostate cancer, normal prostate cells become altered and start to grow “in an uncontrolled way,” the Prostate Cancer Foundation explains. As in other cancers, these cells will then form masses, known as tumors.\n\nThe organization says one in eight men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, making it the second most common cancer among men after skin cancer. \n\nMore than 313,000 new cases of prostate cancer could be diagnosed in the U.S. this year alone, the Prostate Cancer Foundation estimates.\n\nDiagnosed early, there are many treatment options available, according to the Mayo Clinic. The same is true even if it grows beyond the prostate and spreads. It can, however, become more difficult to cure. Still, there are options to slow the cancer’s growth.\n\nTreatment options can include surgery and multiple forms of therapy: beam radiation, brachytherapy, ablation, hormone, immunotherapy, targeted, and radiopharmaceutical.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic says that when prostate cancer is diagnosed early, 99% of patients live at least five years after diagnosis. When the cancer has metastasized or spread, the survival rate drops to about 32%.\n\nProstate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of 1 to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nBiden, 82, had a lesion removed from his chest during a physical exam in 2023. It was determined to be a basal cell carcinoma, according to The Hill. Two years prior, he had a polyp removed from his colon that was a benign, but potentially pre-cancerous lesion.\n\nHis health was a top concern among voters during his time in office. After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking reelection, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris became the nominee and lost to Republican Donald Trump, who returned to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nBut in recent days, Biden rejected concerns about his age despite reporting in the new book “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that aides had shielded the public from the extent of his decline while serving as president.\n\nIn 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration’s priorities with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former President Biden Diagnosed with Aggressive Prostate Cancer first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/former-president-biden-diagnosed-with-aggressive-prostate-cancer/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Former-President-Biden-diagnosed-with-aggressive-form-of-prostate-cancer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 20:45:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266}]}
