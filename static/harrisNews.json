Darrell Issa, R-Calif., accused Smith of targeting Trump and others because they were President Joe Biden's and Vice President Kamala Harris' \"political enemies.\"\n\n\"They were the enemy of the president,\" Issa said. \"And you were their arm, weren't you?\"\n\nSmith denied engaging in politicized lawfare against the president and instead said Trump knowingly violated federal laws when organizing the protest that devolved into a riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe president \"willfully broke the very laws that he took an oath to uphold,\" Smith said.\n\n\"If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,\" he told the committee.\n\nSmith said he is \"not a politician\" and that he has \"no partisan loyalties.\"\n\nHe also denied accusations of spying on lawmakers and others when committee members raised the matter of Smith secretly examining the phone records of nine Republican senators while investigating the Capitol riot that began as a protest against the 2020 election.\n\nSmith told the committee that the phone records were germane to the investigation and defended a $20,000 payment made to a confidential source.\n\nSome Republican committee members suggested the payment was an improper use of taxpayer dollars, but Smith said the payment was for a source that reviewed photographic and video evidence of the event.\n\n\"No one should be above the law in our country,\" he told the committee. \"The law required that he be held to account, so that is what I did.\"\n\nSmith said the only regret he had about the dual prosecutions was that he did not do more to express his appreciation for the staff that assisted him at the time.\n\nHis investigative team collected enough evidence to support his charges against Trump, Smith said, adding that the president \"was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy.\"\n\nSome Democratic Party members of the committee expressed their support for Smith and his efforts to investigate and prosecute Trump.\n\nRanking Member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called Smith one of the country's \"great prosecutors,\" and some of the committee's other Democrats told Smith that they agreed that Trump had broken federal laws.\n\nWhile Smith's testimony was underway, the president on social media called him a \"deranged animal\" who should not be allowed to practice law\n\n\"Deranged Jack Smith is being decimated before Congress,\" Trump said. \"It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions.\"\n\nHe accused Smith of destroying \"many lives under the guise of legitimacy\" and said his law license would have been revoked and \"far worse\" would have been done if he were a Republican.\n\n\"Hopefully, the attorney general is looking at what he's done, including some of the corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use against me,\" the president continued.\n\n\"The whole thing was a Democrat scam,\" he added. \"A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our country through!\"\n\nWhen committee members informed Smith of Trump's comments, he declined to respond to them and instead said that he expected the Justice Department to punish him in some way.\n\nSmith largely declined to answer questions regarding a separate case against Trump over the president's handling of classified documents.\n\nHe said an ongoing court case on the matter prevents him from discussing it.\n\nSmith earlier testified before the committee for eight hours on Dec. 17, which the committee later made public, along with a 255-page transcript of his testimony.\n\nSmith secured two indictments against Trump in 2023. One accused Trump of keeping classified documents after his first term, and the other accused him of plotting to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nHe dropped both cases after Trump won in 2024 because the Justice Department has a policy against prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nTrump denied any wrongdoing and has called the indictments \"witch hunts\" and repeatedly has called for the prosecution of Smith since he took office last year.","summary":"President Donald Trump broke federal laws, former Special Counsel Jack Smith said while testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2026/01/22/jack-smith-testify-house-donald-trump-investigations/3571769095474/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3571769095474/2026/1/8fb32610caad0d5dcd4b6b60c5192ee8/v1.5/Jack-Smith-defends-Trump-prosecutions-during-contentious-hearing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 00:32:52","author":"Lisa Hornung","authors":["Lisa Hornung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":395154834,"title":"Another Escalation in Trump’s War on Blue States","text":"Trump II’s North Star\n\nThe Trump administration has been using the president’s cruel mass deportation visions as a vehicle to, also, crack down on the residents of blue cities across the U.S. who did not vote for him. It’s a pattern we’ve seen play out almost daily, whether via selective National Guard occupations or ICE raids, since the start of his second term. \n\nBut administration officials have increasingly also found more mundane and creative ways to make retribution against Democrats the primary focus of Trump’s second term.\n\nHis Office of Budget and Management Director Russ Vought used the historically lengthy government shutdown last year — during which Democrats withheld their votes to fund the government to demand Republicans help them come up with a solution for the Obamacare subsidies that, at the time, were set to expire (they’ve since expired) — to freeze billions in federal funding for key infrastructure projects in New York and clean energy funds for 16 other Democratic-run states (a federal judge just ordered the clean energy money reinstated this month).\n\nMost recently, the retribution crusade against civilians and elected officials who dare oppose his presidency has gotten even more experimental and disjointed. At the start of the year, Trump administration officials seized on ongoing, legitimate social service fraud investigations in Minnesota as justification for unleashing thousands of ICE agents there, terrorizing immigrant families and clashing with protesters while claiming to be cracking down on undocumented violent criminals and scammers. Trump officials are currently in the process of creating a new executive branch fraud enforcement arm that will be run out of the White House, which is expected to investigate supposed fraud in blue states’ use of federal funding.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump declared in a speech that any states that have sanctuary policies or jurisdictions — communities that provide safe spaces and resources for undocumented immigrants who are working their way through the immigration legal system — will lose federal funding. The Department of Health and Human Services also announced this month that it was freezing $10 billion in social services funding for five blue states, also under the guise of rooting out supposed fraud. (After the states sued, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, which has allowed the states to continue to receive funds, for now.)\n\nThings escalated further on Thursday. RealClearPolitics and CNN were first to report that Trump’s Office of Management and Budget has ordered all federal departments and agencies, except the Defense Department and the VA, to review federal funding for 13 blue states and Washington, D.C. The states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and then also D.C.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget memo, which was reviewed by CNN, requests detailed spending information to “facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds.” Notably, the effort “does not involve withholding funds,” the memo says and is “part of a “data-gathering exercise.”\n\nThe memo directs agencies to include in their spending reports all grants, loans, contracts, subcontracts and “other monetary awards” provided to 13 states and Washington, DC. All of the states voted for Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and 12 of the 13 states have Democratic governors. A fourteenth Democratic-led state has since been included in the review, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe crackdown on dissent continues to be Trump II’s raison d’être.\n\n— Nicole LaFond\n\nJack Smith Expects To Be Indicted\n\nDuring his first public defense of his Jan. 6 prosecution of President Trump, former special counsel Jack Smith said he believes he will eventually face the same treatment as Trump’s other political enemies. When asked during a congressional hearing whether he thinks the Trump DOJ will “find some way” to indict him, he said, yes.\n\n“I believe they will do everything in their power to do that because they have been ordered to by the president,” Smith said.\n\n“I think the statements are meant to intimidate me,” he continued, referencing Trump’s social media attacks. “I will not be intimidated. I think these statements are also made as a warning to others — what will happen if they stand up.”\n\n“We followed the facts and we followed the law and that process resulted in proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed serious crimes,” he said. “I’m not going to pretend that didn’t happen because he’s threatening me.”\n\n— Nicole LaFond\n\nMaryland Could Be Closer to Redistricting \n\nIn what might soon be another blow to the Trump administration’s nationwide gerrymandering pressure campaign to help Republicans keep the U.S. House, Maryland’s Redistricting Advisory Commission voted on Tuesday to recommend a new congressional map. If approved, the new map would likely flip the state’s only Republican district into a Democratic-leaning one. \n\n“At a moment when other states are moving aggressively to redraw maps, and when fundamental voting rights protections face renewed threats, Maryland has a responsibility to lead with urgency,” U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), who is the chair of the commission, said in a statement. \n\n“Our goal is to ensure our congressional delegation reflects the will of the people, protects representation for historically underrepresented communities, and gives Marylanders a Congress that can serve as a real check on this President,” she added. \n\nDemocratic Gov. Wes Moore announced the creation of the five-person Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission in November. The proposal will now go to the Democratic-controlled state legislature for a vote.\n\nThe initiative, like Dem-led redistricting efforts in Virginia and California, was launched as a way to offset the damage of Trump’s months-long gerrymandering blitz in red states throughout the country.\n\nThe fate of Maryland’s proposal remains unclear, as the initiative continues to face opposition in the state Senate despite Democrats having the majority. In a letter from October, first reported by Politico, Senate president Bill Ferguson acknowledged that “redistricting is at the core of this fight because of President Trump’s actions,” but he said that redistricting could also be “catastrophic” for the state. \n\n“Despite deeply shared frustrations about the state of our country, mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined,” he wrote. \n\n— Khaya Himmelman\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nStill no tariffs ruling: What Does It Mean That SCOTUS Hasn’t Ruled on IEEPA Tariffs?

That doesn't mean that there aren't occasionally stories and videos out there that suggest they aren't doing everything right,” said Vance, flanked by top ICE and Homeland Security Investigations officers.\n\nHe said that his purpose in the city was to “tone down the temperature, reduce the chaos” as he blamed that chaos on state officials and agencies refusing to cooperate with ICE officials attempting to organize targeted immigration enforcement operations. The result, Vance claimed, were the volatile raids seen on city streets and individual businesses throughout Minneapolis.\n\nEven as he addressed questions from the media, though, Vance declined to infer that the tactics and demeanor of ICE agents interacting with the public during enforcement operations contributed to that chaos. Instead, he argued that it was largely the fault of state officials.\n\nDescribing an environment where ICE agents were in fear for their safety even when off-duty, Vance said that threats of violence and intimidation against federal officials were being hurled by “far-left” agitators while state and local officials refused to step in.\n\n“That is the environment that has been created, I think, by a lot of very, frankly, far-left people but also by some of the state and local law enforcement officials who could do a much better job with cooperating and working [with us],” claimed Vance.\n\n“What I need [state leaders] to do is empower their local officials to help...our federal officials out in a way where this can be a little less chaotic and it can be a little bit more targeted. Like, if we’re trying to find a sex offender, tell us where the guy lives!” he exclaimed.\n\nAnd Vance said repeatedly that his purpose was to discover the reasons behind the uniquely raised temperature of protests and confrontations in Minneapolis between residents and ICE agents — yet he did not seem to accept that the common factor was ICE’s own behavior in the city, even as he seemed to acknowledge that protests had only grown louder and angrier after the shooting death of Renee Young by an ICE agent earlier this month.\n\nWhile toeing the administration’s line on the shooting, Vance did mark a clear departure from his previous line of thought offered in defense of the administration in the wake of Good’s shooting. \n\nAt a White House news conference in the days immediately following the shooting a very different version of the vice president appeared: Furiously, that version lectured and shouted at reporters for supposedly inflaming tensions with misinformation while calling the coverage of her death an “absolute disgrace.” He also labeled Good, 37, was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe Vance on display Thursday was more akin to the version that helped Donald Trump win the White House in 2024 and delivered a calculating debate performance against Tim Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. He parried questions from reporters about the detentions of U.S. citizens, including members of city police, and a five-year-old migrant child that have made headlines in recent days. \n\nHe still accused Good of trying to run over ICE agents with her car, but softened his tone and did not label her “deranged” or any other insulting language. The vice president also seemed to dial back the administration’s position on whether Good’s shooting and other instances of alleged ICE misconduct would be subject to federal investigations after previously claiming that they had “absolute immunity” in the field. He said they would.\n\nBut tone shift or not, the vice president showed no signs that the administration was rethinking any of its tactics or strategies on Thursday, as protests continued for their second week over Good’s death and nationwide the reaction to ICE tactics grows increasingly sour. He was eager to dive into specifics in cases where Americans or migrants involved in confrontations with ICE agents were in the wrong; less so in the case of videos where agents are seen manhandling people and detaining them with varying degrees of violence, or reports of profiling.\n\nQuestioned about reports that off-duty city police officers had been swept up and detained in immigration raids, prompting anger from city officials including in law enforcement, Vance only demurred that it would have to be reviewed to determine if those accounts were accurate.\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday clearly appeared to be trying to cool down its own rhetoric, with Vance at the helm. \n\nBut there’s only so much a skilled communicator can do when the visuals of the president’s mass deportation strategy are increasingly hard to escape for everyday Americans.","summary":"JD Vance tried to ease tensions but his only suggestion?

Smith told the hearing that Trump’s insults and threats to throw him in jail are designed to intimidate him.\n\n“I will not be intimidated,” Smith said Thursday. “I think these statements are also made as a warning to others if they also stand up. … We followed the facts and we followed the law. That process resulted in proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed serious crimes. I’m not going to pretend that didn’t happen because he threatened me.”\n\nThe hearing follows the Trump administration’s attempts to rewrite the narrative of the January 6 assault in the halls of Congress and his mass pardons for virtually every defendant charged in connection with the attack, including rioters who assaulted law enforcement. Some of those officers sat in the audience Thursday, brawled with far-right activists seated next to them and mocked Republicans who came to the president’s defense.\n\nThe hearing also took place at a vulnerable moment for Smith, who Trump has repeatedly threatened to investigate and imprison. “I believe they will do everything in their power to do that because they’ve been ordered to by the president,” the veteran prosecutor said.\n\nWhile Smith testified, Trump appeared to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute him on his Truth Social.\n\n“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse!” Trump wrote. “Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done, including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me.”\n\nTrump called the investigations a “Democrat SCAM” and warned that “a big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”\n\nAfter the hearing, Trump accused Smith of perjury and said “there is no question” that he should be prosecuted.\n\nIn testimony, Smith said he had “great concerns” about the president’s attempts to obstruct investigations and his “targeting of witnesses,” including election workers whose lives were “turned upside down” by Trump and his allies in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\n“I had a duty to protect witnesses in this investigation,” Smith said. “That threat was only confirmed when we went forward in this case and Donald Trump suggested one witness should be put to death and issued a statement to the effect of, ‘If you come after me I’ll come after you.’”\n\nSmith said he considered that a “direct threat.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Smith said he would prosecute the president again today if provided with the same evidence.\n\n“I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including my decision to bring charges against President Trump,” he said in his opening statement.\n\n“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity,” he said. “If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat. No one should be above the law in our country and the law required that he be held to account.”\n\nWhen it came to Trump’s efforts to reverse his election loss, “Donald Trump was not looking for honest answers,” Smith said.\n\n“He was looking for ways to stay in power,” he said. “When people told him things that conflicted him staying in power, he rejected them ... When individuals would say things that allowed him to stay in power, no matter how fantastical, he would latch on to them.”\n\nFormer Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone and Capitol Police officers Aquilino Gonell and Harry Dunn sat behind Smith as he testified Thursday.\n\nFanone — wearing a T-shirt repping band the Dropkick Murphys with the slogan “fighting Nazis since 1996”— was dragged down the Capitol steps, beaten with pipes and threatened with his own gun as a mob surrounded him on January 6, 2021. Fanone suffered a heart attack after the riot. \n\nOn Thursday, Dunn had to hold Fanone back as he confronted right-wing activist Ivan Raiklin, who amplified election conspiracy theories that fueled the mob.\n\nLater, when Republican Rep. Troy Nehls blamed Capitol leadership for the violence on January 6, Fanone coughed out “f*** you” loud enough for microphones in the room to pick it up.\n\nWhen a mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers convened to certify election results, Trump “caused what happened,” according to Smith’s testimony.\n\nEvidence determined that Trump “exploited that violence,” he said.\n\nSmith was the chief prosecutor for a war crimes tribunal investigating the Kosovo War at The Hague at the time of the January 6 attack.\n\n“I was shocked. I was shocked by it,” he responded, when asked by a Democratic lawmaker for his reaction to seeing footage of the mob. “I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it. I’d just never seen anything like that happening in our country.”\n\nSmith also appeared dumbfounded that Trump pardoned virtually everyone who participated.\n\n“The people who assaulted police officers and were convicted after trial, in my view and I think in the view of the judges who sentenced them to prison, are dangers to the community,” he said. “I do not understand why you would mass pardon people who assaulted police officers. I don’t get it, and I never will.”\n\nFormer Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed the veteran prosecutor to handle the investigations as an independent special counsel, following two federal grand jury indictments accusing the president of more than 40 crimes connected to his efforts to remain in power and withhold classified material at his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nA federal grand jury indictment in 2023 charged Trump with conspiracy and obstruction for his efforts to reverse his election loss and his failure to stop a mob of his supporters from breaking into the Capitol.\n\nTrump was separately charged with mishandling reams of classified documents hoarded inside his private Mar-a-Lago residence, and then obstructing attempts from federal authorities to get them back.\n\nIn closed-door testimony last month, Smith defended the investigations and determined prosecutors were likely to secure convictions against the president should the two cases reach trial. Neither did.\n\nA Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the classified documents case in 2024, arguing that Smith was unlawfully appointed.\n\nWeeks after Trump won the 2024 election, Smith filed the motions to dismiss both cases altogether, a decision that appeared inevitable. After months of delays, appeals and Supreme Court decisions that granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution for potential crimes committed in office, the cases were ultimately upended by Trump’s victory against Kamala Harris, throwing the courts and the Justice Department into unprecedented territory in which the special counsel determined he could not prosecute a sitting president.\n\n“There had not been a case of this nature ever where someone was elected president with charges pending,” Smith said. “We consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel and determined pursuant to policy the cases needed to be dismissed.”\n\nSmith delivered his final reports to Garland on January 7, days before Trump’s inauguration, and then resigned from his position before Trump could fire him.\n\n“The evidence made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,” Smith said of the election interference case.\n\n“These crimes were committed for his benefit,” he said. “The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.”\n\nCourt filings traced the history of Trump’s bogus and ongoing narrative that the election was “stolen” and “rigged” against him as an attempt to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, despite knowing that his claims were false.\n\nSmith outlined Trump’s “increasingly desperate efforts” to cling to power with “knowingly false claims of election fraud,” spelled out in hundreds of pages of evidence.\n\nTrump intentionally lied to voters, election officials, and his own vice president Mike Pence in what amounted to a criminal effort to stay in office, culminating in his failure to stop a mob that tried to do it with violence, according to Smith.\n\nThe Justice Department released Smith’s final report on Trump’s alleged election subversion, but a second volume that details the Mar-a-Lago investigation remains sealed.\n\nA federal judge appointed by Trump will decide whether it can ever be released. The president has urged the court and the Justice Department against releasing the report, claiming it would “improperly endorse and give legal effect to Smith’s unlawful investigation and prosecution” and “irreparably harm” Trump and his former co-defendants.","summary":"‘We followed the facts and we followed the law.

Gavin Newsom.\n\nAnd the put-down was warranted, given that Newsom was hopping from camera to camera at the conference, painting himself as the leader of the American resistance against the American president, and generally acting the fool.\n\nI always thought Newsom looked like how the Devil’s lawyer would be portrayed in a movie, but a mix of the main villain from “American Psycho” and Barbie’s boyfriend certainly seems spot on.\n\nAside from Bessent’s barb, Newsom’s presence at Davos—where world leaders and the global elite generally gather to out-smug each other—didn’t do him any favors.\n\nSomehow, in an environment that seems perfectly suited to his persona, Newsom flamed out. And that flameout wasn’t just because his speech, which was clearly intended to be in the style of a post-State of the Union address partisan rebuttal, got canceled.\n\nNo, I think the reason is that his newest schtick of being the American lefty memelord who is totally not running for president ran into the larger political forces at play. Newsom clearly wanted to present himself as the champion of the great global “liberal international order” empire fighting those mean nationalistic bullies like Russia and the United States.\n\nBut Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered what was almost certainly the best address representing that view. And while Carney’s speech was wrong on much of its substance—President Donald Trump certainly had some harsh and apt criticism—it was at least serious and credible.\n\nNot so with Newsom, who just seemed eager to please cameras while making strange analogies and telling crude inside jokes about how world leaders are “selling out” to Trump, which didn’t land.\n\nWhat made this “selling out” joke even more ridiculous is that Newsom decided it was the right idea to take a minute to pose for a picture with leftist billionaire megadonor Alex Soros while he was there.\n\nAgain, not great.\n\nSome may say that Trump often creates a spectacle, that he’s not above trolling, and that Newsom is just acting in response. But Trump is the president and he’s actually getting things done on the world stage. Even the Greenland brouhaha that caused so much angst throughout Europe seems to have ended up as a deal that’s good for the U.S. and our allies. \n\nIn other words, there is a purpose to what Trump says in line with the administration’s foreign policy goals.\n\nNewsom isn’t the president and he certainly doesn’t have any power over U.S. foreign policy. He’s just a state governor. Instead of being crowned the head of the global resistance to Trump, he just came off looking like an anti-American punk.\n\nStephen A. Smith, the sports commentator turned political commentator, likely echoed the sentiments of many when he lambasted Newsom for criticizing Trump and America on foreign soil.\n\n“Our problems are our problems. But we ain’t taking dirty laundry outside,” Smith said on his SiriusXM show. “You don’t go on a world stage to disrespect your own house, which is the United States of America. I don’t like that at all, not even a little bit.”\n\nAnd the optics issue doesn’t even get to the bigger question about Newsom and Davos. What exactly was a state governor doing there at all? \n\nCalifornia seems to be having a lot of problems. Shouldn’t Newsom be at home fixing those? He should at least refrain from delivering a moral lecture to the world about how Trump and his administration are so awful when his own state is so dysfunctional and frequently tyrannical, right?\n\nWhile the Democrat Party is quite farcically pivoting to the idea that it’s all about “affordability,” California is practically the poster child of a runaway cost of living. In the Golden State, pretty much nothing is affordable thanks to Newsom’s policies. Meanwhile, the California governor is yucking it up with global elites about how proud he is to be giving taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens.\n\nEven some writers at The Atlantic had to concede this week that Newsom’s record on economics is a bad look—and on cultural issues an even worse look—if he ever intends to win over a national audience.\n\n“California’s affordability problems are dire, but Newsom’s greatest vulnerabilities may be cultural issues,” wrote Marc Novicoff and Jonathan Chait. “His tenure has seen the state fall hard for faddish progressive policies on immigration, education, and crime that either didn’t work, violated the intuitions of most Americans, or both.”\n\nNow, Newsom could go back to California and start trying to clean up the mess, maybe do a little more to help the Palisades that burned down, or maybe try to curtail homelessness that he promised to fix decades ago, or perhaps even work to ensure that men don’t play in woman’s sports in his state given that he once called it “unfair.”\n\nBut as always with Newsom, you shouldn’t take him literally or seriously. Hopefully, a few more people learned that after his Davos debacle.","summary":"“Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris.”...

Anderson via the Mises Institute,\n\nSince the 1960s, when racial turmoil exploded in the United States, there have been reparations demands, with groups representing black Americans calling for massive wealth transfers from whites and other economically successful ethnic groups to account for black chattel slavery in the US and the policies of Jim Crow. For example, during their heyday in the 1960s, the Black Panthers in 1966 called for a number of measures, including reparations, to bring about what they saw as justice. They included:\n\nWe believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if the White American businessmen will not give full employment, then the means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in the community so that the people of the community can organize and employ all of its people and give a high standard of living.We believe that this racist government has robbed us, and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules were promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor and mass murder of Black people. We will accept the payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities.\n\nNearly a half-century later, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote “The Case for Reparations” for The Atlantic in which he chronicled more than a century of racial discrimination for American blacks, looking at the life of one man, Clyde Ross, who spent his early years in Mississippi, where lynchings were common and there was little legal protection for blacks:\n\nWhen Clyde Ross was still a child, Mississippi authorities claimed his father owed $3,000 in back taxes. The elder Ross could not read. He did not have a lawyer. He did not know anyone at the local courthouse. He could not expect the police to be impartial. Effectively, the Ross family had no way to contest the claim and no protection under the law. The authorities seized the land. They seized the buggy. They took the cows, hogs, and mules. And so for the upkeep of separate but equal, the entire Ross family was reduced to sharecropping.This was hardly unusual. In 2001, the Associated Press published a three-part investigation into the theft of black-owned land stretching back to the antebellum period. The series documented some 406 victims and 24,000 acres of land valued at tens of millions of dollars. The land was taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism. “Some of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,” the AP reported, as well as “oil fields in Mississippi” and “a baseball spring training facility in Florida.”\n\nWhen Ross moved to Chicago, he and his family had to deal with “redlining” and other discriminatory practices that made home ownership more difficult for blacks than whites. Coates writes:\n\nIn Chicago and across the country, whites looking to achieve the American dream could rely on a legitimate credit system backed by the government. Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. “It was like people who like to go out and shoot lions in Africa. It was the same thrill,” a housing attorney told the historian Beryl Satter in her 2009 book, Family Properties. “The thrill of the chase and the kill.”\n\nInterestingly, Coates does not present any specific plans or programs. Instead, he chronicles the examples of racial discrimination—which are many—and then says the logical outcome should be reparations in one form or another:\n\nBroach the topic of reparations today and a barrage of questions inevitably follows: Who will be paid? How much will they be paid? Who will pay? But if the practicalities, not the justice, of reparations are the true sticking point, there has for some time been the beginnings of a solution. For the past 25 years, Congressman John Conyers Jr., who represents the Detroit area, has marked every session of Congress by introducing a bill calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for “appropriate remedies.”A country curious about how reparations might actually work has an easy solution in Conyers’s bill, now called HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. We would support this bill, submit the question to study, and then assess the possible solutions. But we are not interested.\n\nOther groups have also called for reparations, including the NAACP, the National African American Reparations Commission (NAARC), and the evangelical magazine, Christianity Today. The NAARC has some semi-specific proposals, while CT keeps everything in the abstract realm. Indeed, Coates’s “easy solution” is actually very difficult precisely because the “practicalities” are difficult—and very expensive—to put into action.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that there haven’t been attempts to come up with reparations plans. Evanston, Illinois—a city just outside of Chicago—has a program meant to deal with redlining and other discriminatory measures the city took earlier in the 20th century, but it is limited in scope and has a specific funding source: taxes from legal cannabis sales:\n\nTo be eligible, a person has to be Black and prove they lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 — the period when state-sponsored segregation and redlining were rampant — or be a direct descendant of someone who did.\n\nThose eligible receive checks up to $25,000 and other in-kind aid from the city government. There are plenty of arguments to make against this plan, to be sure, but at least it does not bust the city’s budget, and it is a good-faith attempt to deal with overt policies that unjustly hurt Evanston’s black residents. San Francisco, however, is another matter, as its city council recently laid out a plan to pay the city’s black residents $5 million apiece and provide down payments for buying homes. Although San Francisco never had Jim Crow laws and blacks there never faced the kind of discrimination that the city practiced against Chinese immigrants, the politicians there have hatched a plan that is so costly that it will never be able to be carried out.\n\nLikewise, the State of California’s legislature has created a reparations task force and passed a number of bills to identify past discriminatory practices in the state and to compensate black residents. However, Gov. Gavin Newsom—who almost surely will run in the 2028 Democratic Primary for president—has vetoed five of these bills.\n\nWhile racial discrimination has existed in California—as it did in most other places, especially during the 19th century and the Progressive Era—the state never had Jim Crow laws mandating racial segregation and discrimination. However, with California dominated politically by the left wing of the Democratic Party, its politicians are eager to engage in the kind of political theater on this subject that is guaranteed to leave the entire matter in the abstract realm.\n\nWhat is meant by classifying this discussion as “abstract” is that politicians are coming up with grandiose proposals that are so costly that they never could be funded, even if they were justified. For example, Rep. Cori Bush from Missouri introduced a bill calling for $14 trillion in reparations payments, even though that number is close to half of what real GDP was in the US in 2025. The numbers are so out-of-sorts that they can never get out of the abstract realm because this country could never come up with the resources necessary to fund these schemes even if Americans actually agreed that reparations were justified.\n\nBelievers in reparations hold that these payments are necessary to deal with the very real wealth gaps between black and white Americans as a whole. Two years ago, the Brookings Institute reported that while overall wealth was rising, it was rising faster for whites than blacks:\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the nation’s racial wealth gap increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2019 and 2022, median wealth increased by $51,800, but the racial wealth gap increased by $49,950—adding up to a total difference of $240,120 in wealth between the median white household and the median Black household.\n\nYet, there is very little in any of the reparations schemes that would enable black Americans to build true generational wealth. Indeed, the adherents to reparations don’t even see the irony in the fact that they are blaming capitalism and private enterprise for racism and racial discrimination even while writers like Coates—no fan of capitalism himself—demonstrate how government agencies at every level in this country were responsible for throwing roadblocks in the way of black American advances.\n\nInstead, they look to expanding the welfare system as the “solution” even though the welfare system itself has accelerated the wealth gaps as welfare programs expanded, something pointed out by Thomas Sowell in Vision of the Anointed. As Ryan McMaken wrote in 2020:\n\nToday, the idea of reparations is geared toward the sorts of policy options that are now quite familiar: more spending on programs that resemble traditional welfare programs of recent decades. Kamala Harris, for example, supports more spending on health programs “as a form of reparations for slavery.”This April 2020 report from the Brookings Institution suggests that reparations take the form of student loan forgiveness, free college tuition, and down payment grants for potential homeowners.This has now become the standard policy formula for reparations. It’s not about payments to specific victims. It’s about increasing funding for the usual package of social programs around housing, cash transfers, and healthcare. In other words, in its form and administration, the “reparations state” is now indistinguishable from the “welfare state.”\n\nMurray Rothbard himself raised the issue years ago about reparations, but his plan was based on natural law, natural justice, and building real wealth. He wrote:\n\nOne of the tragic aspects of the emancipation of the serfs in Russia in 1861 was that while the serfs gained their personal freedom, the land—their means of production and of life, their land was retained under the ownership of their feudal masters. The land should have gone to the serfs themselves, for under the homestead principle they had tilled the land and deserved its title. Furthermore, the serfs were entitled to a host of reparations from their masters for the centuries of oppression and exploitation. The fact that the land remained in the hands of the lords paved the way inexorably for the Bolshevik Revolution, since the revolution that had freed the serfs remained unfinished.The same is true of the abolition of slavery in the United States. The slaves gained their freedom, it is true, but the land, the plantations that they had tilled and therefore deserved to own under the homestead principle, remained in the hands of their former masters. Furthermore, no reparations were granted the slaves for their oppression out of the hides of their masters. Hence the abolition of slavery remained unfinished, and the seeds of a new revolt have remained to intensify to the present day. Hence, the great importance of the shift in Negro demands from greater welfare handouts to “reparations”, reparations for the years of slavery and exploitation and for the failure to grant the Negroes their land, the failure to heed the Radical abolitionist’s call for “40 acres and a mule” to the former slaves. In many cases, moreover, the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed.\n\nUnfortunately, Rothbard’s plan was not followed, nor would any present reparations program do much to increase real wealth in black communities. Instead, it would deteriorate into just another welfare program. The present push for reparations for black Americans is yet another scheme that has failed even before it could possibly come to fruition. Taxpayers would be forced to pay extra taxes—or the funding would come from borrowing and massive money creation by the Federal Reserve System—and the entire thing would deteriorate into the government either handing out checks or offering the usual substandard government services.\n\nYes, some recipients might invest or save their reparations checks, but most likely people would spend them quickly and then demand more to continue their higher-end lifestyles, something that we have seen with many people of all races who won significant amounts of money via a lottery. The reparations industry would no doubt come up with reasons as to why the system had to be expanded, and we would be back to square one.\n\nNo one has built wealth by being served by the nation’s welfare systems, so while any reparations package would result in large wealth transfers to black Americans from everyone else living here, those transfers would not translate into new, appreciable wealth. If anything, they would result in a negative-sum result and make things even worse than they were before.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/reparations-are-welfare-scheme-and-would-have-no-effect-racial-wealth-gaps","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/AdobeStock_Scam-20-282-29.jpeg_webp.jpg?h=d9079ace&amp;itok=Xq2ops9V","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 20:40:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":395150848,"title":"Josh Shapiro Goes to War With Kamala Harris","text":"When former Vice President Kamala Harris passed over Josh Shapiro—the popular governor of the must-win state of Pennsylvania—in favor of perpetually befuddled (and subsequently scandal-plagued) Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join her presidential ticket, many assumed there was bad blood between the two. And that certainly appears to be the case: In his new book, Shapiro side-eyes the Harris campaign for seeking to relegate him to the role of extreme junior partner, insisting that he walk back certain policy statements, and asking whether he was an Israeli double agent.\n\nThis last issue generated significant coverage on social media this week. The mainstream media treated it as big news. Some Democrats expressed frustration with Team Harris and suggested that the question was inappropriate. In grilling Shapiro—who is notably Jewish, and who was the victim of an arson attack during Passover—on his views regarding Israel, Harris' people were implicitly playing into the noxious stereotype that Jews are more loyal to the state of Israel than to the United States. Shapiro himself seemed to feel this way about the question: He writes in the book that he was offended by the line of inquiry, and told the Harris campaign as much.\n\nAs I wrote in response on X, I like Shapiro much more than Harris' other potential veeps; indeed, I like him much more than I like Harris. It's crystal clear she should have picked him instead of the uninspiring Walz.\n\nYet it does not seem to me like these questions should have been deemed unreasonable. If Shapiro were merely asked about his ties to Israel because he is Jewish, then yes, that would have been scandalous. But Shapiro also spent five months living and studying in Israel during his college years, which included volunteering with the Israeli Army, according to The New York Times. Shapiro has subsequently claimed that this involved service projects on a military base: He did not perform military duties or activities.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with any of that, but in an election that involved Israel as a significant wedge issue for the Democratic coalition, Shapiro could have expected questions about it from voters and the media. It seems odd, then, for him to take umbrage with the Harris campaign for due diligence. The campaign also asked Walz about his ties to China, which were far more extensive. In retrospect, they should have looked more closely at his actual record of governance in Minnesota, which has not aged well.\n\nHarris doesn't seem to generate very much positive media coverage these days: A typical, recent profile of her in Politico essentially makes the point that there isn't a particular constituency clamoring for her to return to politics, even though she appears determined to make another go of it. If anything, it's Shapiro who now generates glowing mentions: See this profile of him from The Atlantic in December. It begins: \"It is a rare thing to see Josh Shapiro sweat.\" If that's true, then he shouldn't take offense at being asked about his time abroad.\n\nIn Other Shapiro News…\n\nAnother Shapiro moment that caught my eye: After Shapiro criticized Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the official HHS X account unleashed on him for having \"forced masks on babies and toddlers\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJosh Shapiro forced masks on babies and toddlers. https://t.co/m6Ddo7j4fG pic.twitter.com/1lPZ5SuZ1d\n— HHS Rapid Response (@HHSResponse) January 22, 2026\n\nThere's just one problem: Shapiro was not the governor during the COVID-19 pandemic. He took office in 2023.\n\nThat tweet referenced and screenshotted by HHS was not written by Shapiro, but rather by his predecessor, former Gov. Tom Wolf, from the official governor of Pennsylvania social media account. When a new governor assumes the position, he inherits the account, and the little profile icon changes. If a Republican were eventually elected governor of Pennsylvania, you could make it look like he had written in favor of masking toddlers, too.\n\nThis can produce some pretty amusing results. Glenn Greenwald called attention to this old X post from former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that now looks like it was written by Mayor Zohran Mamdani:\n\nThat Zohran took over the @NYCMayor account without deleting all of the old tweets from Eric Adams and Bill De Blasio, or doing anything else to prevent old tweets from appearing under his name, will be a never-ending source of confusion (and amusement): https://t.co/r609R5ofxm\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) January 8, 2026\n\nToo Late To Apologize\n\nI ran out of time to turn in this newsletter the last two weeks—and I apologize for that!—so I am late weighing in on this: Two left-of-center comedians issued groveling apologies after (correctly) pointing out that Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D–Texas) is not going to win the Texas Senate race and Democrats would be better off spending their money elsewhere.\n\nMatt Rogers: \"Don't waste your money sending to Jasmine Crockett.\"\nBowen Yang: \"I must agree.\" pic.twitter.com/ljM5dVaoVJ\n— Keith Edwards (@keithedwards) January 8, 2026\n\n\"I have great respect and admiration for Rep. Crockett, and I regret that my words suggested otherwise,\" said Matt Rogers in a statement. \"I just want us to win and I will be better at finding ways to help.\"\n\nHe had it right the first time, and in any case, there was zero reason to apologize for slagging Crockett. I suspect the reason he did so was because he faced pushback from online progressives along the lines of How dare he criticize a black woman! Of course, he did not criticize her because he harbors racism or sexism; he criticized her because she is a thoroughly unimpressive and gaffe-prone candidate who is obviously far less likely to win a general election in Texas—a red state—than her opponent, James Talarico. Remember when she accused Republican opponents of taking money from Jeffrey Epstein…but it was a different Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI am joined by Amber Duke to discuss the news of the week.\n\nAlso, are you watching Freed Up, my new show with Christian Britschgi? It's taking the world by storm!\n\nWorth Watching\n\nMany people have asked for an update on my fantasy novel, so here it is: It's coming along! Obviously I missed my self-imposed, very aggressive deadline of January 1. Nevertheless, I have completed about two-thirds of it, maybe more. A third of that is in really good shape and only requires minimal editing, and another third is done but needs serious revision. The last third is still being written. My new plan is to finish by the end of next month. That's probably a bit ambitious, but progress is progress.","summary":"Plus: Why apologize for hating on Jasmine Crockett?","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/22/josh-shapiro-goes-to-war-with-kamala-harris/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sipaphotostwentyfive174636-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 20:20:05","author":"Jack Nicastro,Robby Soave","authors":["Jack Nicastro","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.726},{"id":395161574,"title":"Musk’s Grok created 3 million sexualized images, research says","text":"Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok generated an estimated three million sexualized images of women and children in a matter of days, researchers said Thursday, revealing the scale of the explicit content that sparked a global outcry.\n\nThe recent rollout of an editing feature on Grok, developed by Musk’s startup xAI and integrated into X, allowed users to alter online images of real people with simple text prompts such as “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes.”\n\nA flood of lewd deepfakes exploded online, prompting several countries to ban Grok and drawing outrage from regulators and victims.\n\n“The AI tool Grok is estimated to have generated approximately three million sexualized images, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, after the launch of a new image editing feature powered by the tool on X,” said the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit watchdog that researches the harmful effects of online disinformation.\n\nCCDH’s report estimated that Grok generated this volume of photorealistic images over an 11-day period -- an average rate of 190 per minute.\n\nThe report did not say how many images were created without the consent of the people pictured.\n\nIt said public figures identified in Grok’s sexualized images included American actress Selena Gomez, singers Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj as well as politicians such as Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch and former U.S. vice president Kamala Harris.\n\n“The data is clear: Elon Musk’s Grok is a factory for the production of sexual abuse material,” Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH.\n\n“By deploying AI without safeguards, Musk enabled the creation of an estimated 23,000 sexualized images of children in two weeks, and millions more images of adult women.”\n\nThere was no immediate comment about the findings from X.

While19 percent said they felt about the same, financially speaking, one year into Trump’s second administration.\n\nLocalized effects of these feelings could be devastating for Republicans in November if things don’t change course. A separate tracking poll from The Economist and YouGov this week shows the president’s approval ratings in individual states sinking to new lows, particularly in some of the most important battleground areas set to determine control of the two chambers of Congress in the fall. In Georgia, where Democrat Sen. Jon Ossoff is facing a re-election fight, Trump’s approval rating is 18.6 points in the negative. In Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins is facing her own fight to retain her seat, Trump’s net approval rating is nearly the same: -18.4 percentage points.\n\nThe president even has a net negative approval rating in Alaska, a traditionally red state where Democrats are hoping that Mary Peltola’s campaign can unseat Sen. Dan Sullivan.\n\nIn the New York Times poll, the only issue on which Trump got lower marks than affordability — one of his 2024 campaign issues — was his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n\nThe president ran for office a third time and won while pummeling Biden and his replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris, in part on his ability to bring down the price of consumer goods, energy, insurance and other expenses for families, even vowing to expand health care coverage in America to include IVF treatments. \n\n“Starting the day I take the oath of office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. We’re going to make it affordable again,” he declared at a rally in Pennsylvania in August of 2024.\n\nBut as the first year of his second term came to a close this week he now finds himself oscillating between blaming Democrats for poor economic conditions and insisting that those conditions are actually great. \n\nIn December, the president insisted at an event touting his economic agenda in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, that voters would reward the GOP for his efforts to bring drug prices down through “most favored nation” deals aimed at bringing U.S. drug prices down to international levels. \n\n“Your drugs are coming down at levels that nobody ever thought was possible. This achievement alone should win us for midterms,” Trump argued to his crowd.\n\nAt the same rally, he attacked Democrats for criticizing a lack of progress on bringing down consumer prices: “They use the word affordability, and that's their only word. They say affordability, and everyone says, oh, that must mean Trump has high prices? No, our prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country,” he said. \n\nOverall, drugmakers still hiked prices on hundreds of medicines last year despite the administration’s efforts and prescription drug spending was still projected to increase year-over-year.\n\nAccording to the Economist/YouGov polls, inflation and cost-of-living issues remain the top issue motivating voters. It has skyrocketed to new importance, according to pollsters, and is now mentioned as a leading motivator for more than four in ten Americans.\n\nThe Times poll contained another startling statistic for the White House. More than four in ten independent voters now say that Trump is on track to become one of the worst presidents of all time. Only 12 percent of independents said he was on course to be one of the greats.\n\nIndependents remain largely undecided over the midterms, according to the Times poll, but could be hoping for a course-correction directed by the Republican majorities on the Hill over the next few months.\n\nThe Times poll reviewed responses from 1,625 registered voters with a margin of sampling error of 2.8 percentage points. The Economist/YouGov’s tracking polls are based on weekly survey data.","summary":"Trump blames Democrats for affordability ‘hoax’ but polls show it’s top of mind for voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-poll-approval-economy-2026-b2905809.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/22/3/42/President-Donald-Trump-reacts-after-a-meeting-during-the-Annual-Meeting-of-the-World-Economic-Forum.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/18JDBtO1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-22 18:06:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":395150284,"title":"Trump denounces NYT poll, calls for criminalizing 'fake' polling","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his attacks on the media Thursday, saying he will sue The New York Times over an unfavorable opinion poll and suggesting that what he called “fake and fraudulent” surveys should be criminalized after a New York Times/Siena University poll showed his approval rating falling to 40% one year into his second term.\r\r“Fake and Fraudulent Polling should be, virtually, a criminal offense,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, blasting the Times/Siena poll and saying its findings would be added to his lawsuit against what he again called “The Failing New York Times.” The 79-year-old Republican accused the newspaper of spreading “Radical Left lies and wrongdoing.”\r\rThe Times/Siena survey – consistent with other polls showing declining confidence in Trump’s handling of the economy and his military-style crackdown on illegal immigration – outlined what the Times described as the unraveling of Trump’s 2024 coalition.

Once we have voted for a candidate, we feel invested in him. We don't want to admit to ourselves that we might have made a mistake.\n\nPsychologists have lots of terms for the cognitive glitches that make us think this way: post-decision rationalization, dissonance reduction, commitment escalation, choice-supportive bias. But these phrases don't do justice to the sheer intensity of what happened in red states in November 2016. Voters who detested Hillary Clinton were emotionally fused to the man who defeated her. Something similar happened eight years later with Kamala Harris, soldering the attachment more firmly.\n\nI understand it. On three successive occasions, the Democrats put up terrible candidates—a curiously self-indulgent thing to do, given how high the stakes were, but that's another story.\n\nI don't get a vote, obviously—that was settled at Yorktown—but if I had had one, my candidate in 2016 would have been Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico. Still, let's be honest: Reason is perhaps the only serious publication where I can mention a Libertarian Party candidate and expect more than the tiniest flicker of recognition. For most Americans in most states, there were only two plausible candidates, and, having chosen one on faute-de-mieux grounds, they began unconsciously to build him up in their minds.\n\nAfter all, Donald Trump was delivering on a fair chunk of what he promised. He deported illegal immigrants, stopped appointing left-wing activist judges, moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, cut federal regulations, and said what his voters wanted to hear about trans people. True, his tariffs raised prices and made America less competitive. But in the country with the largest gross domestic product in the world, trade is a small proportion of the economy; a spectacularly dumb tariff policy can be offset by moderately sensible policies on taxation, regulation, and energy abundance.\n\nAt the same time, Trump was being attacked, often stupidly and dishonestly, by people whom his voters cordially loathed. We are a tribal species, and each such attack pushed them closer to him.\n\nAs time passed, the nose pegs came off. Trump was their guy. Sure, he could be brash, bombastic, boorish. But he was more or less delivering on what he had been elected to do. Who cared about his character failings? When you hire a plumber, do you ask whether he is faithful to his wife, or do you just want to get your boiler fixed?\n\nTrump's character flaws, with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy, led to the breakdown of January 6, 2021. Everyone knew, his supporters especially, that Trump cannot admit defeat. Whenever something goes against him—a business deal, an awards ceremony, a round of golf—he calls foul and claims victory. Because no one dared check this behavior in him as president, it became more extreme and more destructive.\n\nWill anything turn MAGA against him? I wondered whether, by threatening to annex Greenland, he had found the one issue where his base would not follow him. He was elected as the candidate who would put an end to foreign adventurism, and voters opposed taking Greenland by 71 percent to 4 percent—4 percent being, coincidentally, the \"lizardman's constant,\" the estimated proportion of people in any poll who will give insincere or demented replies. Perhaps that is why, as I write, he seems to be backing down from the demand.\n\nThe drama, the neediness, the insistence that owning Greenland was \"psychologically important for me,\" the demented letter to the Norwegian prime minister saying that, because he had not won the Nobel Prize, he might just seize someone else's territory—will his people continue to back him through all that?\n\nTrump's refusal to understand that the Norwegian government does not control the Nobel committee is telling. During my time in politics, I came across this tendency again and again when dealing with representatives of tinpot dictatorships. \"Why will you not let British Airways fly to our glorious capital?\" Well, they're an independent airline and, if they think the route is profitable, I'm sure they'll put on a flight. \"Lies! Why does your government not act?\"\n\nThe only two examples I can think of where officials blamed the Norwegian government for the prizes were in 1935, when Hitler went ballistic over the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky, a German pacifist, and in 2010, when China froze relations with Oslo over its award to the dissident Liu Xiaobo. The idea of attacking a country—let alone a different country—over not getting the prize is without precedent.\n\nThere is no point in sugarcoating this. The chief executive is unfit for office. His erratic behavior, his inability to distinguish between his public role and his private interests, his determination to subordinate U.S. foreign policy to his personal wants: These things should bar him.\n\nCongress could put a stop to all this nonsense tomorrow. It could reassert its prerogatives over trade policy and cancel the tariffs. It could begin impeachment proceedings on the grounds that the president is no longer compos mentis. But, filled with cowards and flatterers, it hangs back. And so the checks and balances that the founders put in precisely to contain two-bit Caesarists fail for lack of will.\n\n\"A republic—if you can keep it.\" Can you, cousins?","summary":"Brexit leader Daniel Hannan urges Trump voters to hit the exits.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/22/greenland-as-a-stress-test-for-maga-loyalty/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01.20.26-v2-1-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 14:49:14","author":"Daniel Hannan,Robby Soave","authors":["Daniel Hannan","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":395172948,"title":"CNN Tries to Kickstart Michelle Obama 2028","text":"The American people have, once again, disappointed former First Lady Michelle Obama.

Srivastava, an Indian businessman living in California, said he was uniquely positioned to help.\n\nSrivastava let Troost in on a secret: he was actually a deep-cover CIA operative, using his business activities as a front, and regaled him with personal tales of international intrigue and derring-do. \n\nThe thirty-something businessman spoke of his training at “the Farm,” the CIA's Virginia compound, showed off scars from a covert mission, and described being held hostage by ISIS in 2008 during an operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n\nTo cement his bona fides, Srivastava shared photos of himself with political and military heavyweights, from President Joe Biden to former NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark.\n\nBut the amazing stories Srivastava recounted were made up out of whole cloth, Troost alleges in a RICO lawsuit filed Wednesday. The suit alleges that Srivastava was never in the CIA. It says that his “battle scars” in fact came from a childhood kidney operation and that his ISIS kidnapping could not have happened because the terrorist organization “did not operate in the DRC in 2008, nor did any ISIS-affiliated group exist in that region at that time.”\n\nIn his new RICO complaint, Troost claims Srivastava was a “fake spy” who fabricated his work for the CIA as part of an attempt to steal Troost’s $350 million company. Srivastava was after the money, in part, to purchase a $24.5 million California mansion, complete with bocce court, orchard, and bomb shelter-cum-wine cave, according to Troost’s complaint.\n\n“For more than five years, defendant Gaurav Srivastava led a criminal enterprise that stole and extorted tens of millions of dollars from plaintiffs and other victims based upon the false over-arching narrative that Srivastava was a high-level non-official cover operative for the CIA,” the complaint alleges. \n\n“Srivastava and the other members of the enterprise defrauded victims by convincing them that Srivastava controlled the might of the United States Government and could provide invaluable assistance to his allies and destroy those that dared to cross him. That was all a complete fiction. Srivastava is not a CIA operative—or an agent of any other U.S. federal agency – and never has been. He’s not even a U.S. citizen. He’s simply a fraud.”\n\nToday, Troost’s company is in liquidation, the complaint reveals. \n\nAttorney Jason Masimore, a former federal prosecutor who is representing Troost, told The Independent: “The complaint and supporting evidence expose a massive criminal conspiracy orchestrated in the U.S. by its ringleader, Gaurav Srivastava.”\n\nSrivastava was only able to pull off the alleged scheme thanks to a raft of people helping him - willing lawyers, bankers, an and former intelligence operatives, according to Masimore, who claimed the plot compromised U.S. national security and top-level political leadership. \n\n“Mr. Troost and his companies seek to hold the defendants accountable for their reprehensible conduct,” Masimore said. \n\nThe lawsuit is the latest salvo in a long-running saga between the two men, roping in members of the intelligence community, U.S. senators, foreign government officials, and even pop star John Legend. \n\nIt is the first suit to name Srivastava personally as a defendant. Previous lawsuits have taken on Srivastava’s alleged enablers including a corporate intelligence and crisis communications firm, run by influential CIA veterans, who Troost says conducted an ugly smear campaign against him on behalf of his former business partner.\n\nSrivastava did not reply to messages seeking comment sent to his personal and business emails, nor did his attorney. The Arkin Group, who Troost is suing separately for defamation, also did not respond. (Masimore also has his own defamation lawsuit against Srivastava pending in federal court.)\n\nTroost’s lawsuit against Arkin, which was removed a few weeks ago from federal court to New York State Supreme Court, noted that the case “may have the hallmarks of a Hollywood film – fake spies, theft, and deceit,” but that at its core, the allegations against Srivastava were really “quite simple.”\n\nIn response, Arkin claimed that Srivastava “did not work for the CIA, does not work for the CIA, and never claimed that he worked for the CIA.” \n\nIn his new RICO complaint, filed in Los Angeles federal court, Troost lays out a raft of explosive accusations against Srivastava, who was once described by The Wall Street Journal as “part Austin Powers, part James Bond.” \n\nWhile Srivastava has denied posing as a spy, Troost’s lawsuit includes transcripts of phone calls in which he says he is a clandestine operative under “non-official cover.” \n\n“For years, [Srivastava] had perfected the same elaborate ruse: present himself as a covert CIA officer, fabricate intelligence missions, and use those staged ‘operations’ to extract money, access, and influence,” Troost’s complaint states. \n\nIt claims Srivastava has previously duped, variously, a Ugandan businessman and honorary consul to Malaysia, Sudanese government officials, and actual American spies.\n\nA longtime commodities trader, Troost had made a fortune buying and selling Russian oil over decades. However, when Russia launched its war against Ukraine four years ago, an associate who owed money to Troost threatened to ruin his reputation by spreading false rumors that he was working for the Kremlin, according to the complaint.\n\nTroost, who is under European sanctions related to the conflict, says he dealt with small-scale, independent Russian oil producers and not state entities. But he turned to a contact for help, who advised him to get in touch with an individual known as “Mr. G,” the complaint goes on.\n\n“Mr. G” turned out to be Srivastava, who told Troost he could “ensure that the debtor stopped bothering” him and squelch whatever negative information he might be planning to disseminate. Srivastava said he oversaw a CIA “Program” monitoring Russian oil flows, and that he could also ensure Troost’s company, Paramount Energy & Commodities, would be permitted to continue trading Russian oil even under increasingly severe restrictions imposed by the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAnother prospective business partner had once before convinced Troost that he was with the CIA, and Srivastava had homed in on what the complaint calls the 56-year-old Dutchman’s “critical weak spot – his lingering tolerance for dubious claims.” \n\nOnce Srivastava got Troost onboard, the oil trader truly believed he was part of a secret CIA operation, the complaint continues. Srivastava said all the right things, and appeared to be connected at the highest levels of government. He talked about close working relationships with Biden and then-VP Kamala Harris, as well as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Senator Chuck Schumer, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint says Srivastava boasted of a weapons deal with an unnamed North African country so the CIA could spy on the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organization, and that he told Troost he used his CIA imprimatur to get then-Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto – now president – removed from a U.S. no-entry list.\n\nIn July 2022, Srivastava convinced Troost to sell him half of Paramount at a deep discount, insisting the arrangement “was necessary to avoid U.S. sanctions and ensure government support for continued Russian oil trading,” the complaint states. Troost’s other partners were gravely concerned that he was getting swindled, but Troost assured them that it was all backed by the White House.\n\nThat November, Srivastava delivered the keynote address at an event in Bali held by the Atlantic Council. It was sponsored by Srivastava’s family foundation, and he was publicly lauded from the dais by Rep. Pat Ryan, a member of the House Committee on Armed Services. The confab’s entertainment, singer-songwriter John Legend, took the stage and thanked “Mr. G” for making his appearance possible.\n\nAs the West continued to turn the screws on Russia’s oil industry, Troost began getting cold feet about continuing to do business there, the complaint says. That’s when Srivastava began pressuring Troost to re-domicile Paramount in the U.S., so the supposed undercover program could continue, the complaint states.\n\nIn December 2022, Srivastava had Troost transfer $51 million from a Paramount subsidiary to an Indonesian firm, which he framed as a loan for ongoing operations, the complaint continues. Through complex transactions allegedly designed to foil regulators, the complaint says Srivastava soon funneled $25 million to himself so he could buy a Pacific Palisades mansion. \n\nSrivastava allegedly drained additional millions from Paramount’s coffers by having Troost send large payments to various entities, such as a law firm he claimed was associated with former-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, but was actually run by a California lawyer suspended from practice after a 2011 federal narcotics conviction.\n\nAs 2023 began, Srivastava hired a retired U.S. Army Delta Force operator as his chief of staff. He kitted out an LA office with Paramount’s money, mimicking the look of a federal government workspace.\n\n“The office displayed the Great Seal of the United States and custom-engraved ceremonial swords bearing Srivastava’s name – objects he falsely claimed were gifts from senior government officials, but that he, himself, had ordered and engraved,” the complaint states.\n\nAfter one of Paramount’s directors spotted a news article about the Palisades mansion – which Srivastava had reportedly beaten several A-list celebrities to attain – Troost became suspicious. He hired an investigator who unearthed a history of fraud by Srivastava, with accusations ranging from pilfering $100,000 worth of wine to bouncing six-figure checks, the complaint says. \n\nEven the Atlantic Council sponsorship had been financed with money stolen from Paramount, the complaint alleges. \n\nIn May 2023, Troost confronted Srivastava, who responded that the Dutchman “ha[d] no f***ing idea” what he was capable of, the complaint says. \n\nIf Troost didn’t finish re-domiciling Paramount to the states, Srivastava vowed to tell U.S. authorities that Troost was a Russian agent, get him sanctioned, and have Paramount’s assets blocked, according to the complaint.\n\nBy now, Troost “finally decided he’d had enough,” the complaint states. On May 10, 2023, Troost rescinded Srivastava’s stake in Paramount, citing “intentional deceit.” In response, Srivastava immediately tried to steal the remaining $26 million held by the Indonesian firm but was foiled, according to the complaint.\n\nSrivastava “reacted with anger,” and “launched an aggressive and malicious smear campaign… which continues to this date,” according to the complaint.\n\nSrivastava hired the New York City-based Arkin Group, founded and headed by Jack Devine, the CIA’s former chief of worldwide operations, and Carol “Rollie” Flynn, former director of the CIA’s Office of Foreign Intelligence Relationships, who paid to have “fabricated stories” published about Troost, the complaint contends. \n\n“Together, they generated and promoted articles alleging that Troost had criminal ties to Russia, including claims that he acted as a front for a sanctioned Russian oligarch,” it reads.\n\nOne article, published in May 2023 on a thinly-read blog, stated: “Troost, at Putin’s urging, is one of the largest clandestine funders of the Wagner Group,” and that “Troost, simply put, is the ringleader of a global covert criminal enterprise.” \n\nAnother accused Troost’s daughter of being part of an international crime ring, and Srivastava sent emails from fake journalists to Troost’s son’s university in the UK, trying to get him kicked out, the complaint says. \n\nSrivastava also used Arkin to push a narrative claiming Troost had fabricated the story about him claiming to be in the CIA, painting him as a liar not to be trusted, according to the complaint.\n\nFor their part, The Arkin Group and Srivastava argued in a past court filing, from a separate but related lawsuit, that Troost is “an astonishingly credulous mark” who once before fell for an identical story from another “fake spy.” They said it was not Srivastava who sank Troost, but the Dutchman’s own “profound and ruinous gullibility.”\n\nIn August 2024, The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy and painstakingly-researched article about Srivastava which picked apart his spy claims and “dismantled his public persona,” according to Troost’s complaint. Srivastava bought access to the politicians he boasted of knowing, via donations, according to the complaint. And former NATO commander Clark told Politico that his work with Srivastava ended after 10 months, because he never got paid.\n\nAn exposé followed in the Financial Times, which the complaint says prompted Srivastava to alter his tactics in a bid to “rebuild political influence.”\n\n“After long aligning with Democratic figures, Srivastava shifted toward Republican circles following his exposure,” the complaint states. “He appeared on conservative podcasts. He presented a speech to a conservative audience at a political convention in Las Vegas. And, in June 2025, he even posted a photograph with Vice President J.D. Vance, claiming to be working with him.”\n\nIn August 2025, Srivastava spoke at the America First-Ground Zero conference in Las Vegas, where he was introduced by right-wing podcaster and conspiracy theorist Lara Logan. \n\n“Through his prominent appearance at the conference, as well as recent efforts to infiltrate those close to the current administration, Srivastava was continuing his enterprise, attempting to fortify its reputation, and trying to meet and impress wealthy potential new victims,” according to the complaint.\n\nBetween late 2023 and 2025, Troost was sanctioned by the UK, the EU, and Switzerland, the complaint says, adding: “Srivastava has publicly taken credit for causing this.” (Troost has not been sanctioned to date by the U.S., which requires a higher standard of evidence, according to the complaint.)\n\nIn the aftermath, Paramount was forced to shutter. Both men have set up dueling websites devoted to exposing their accusations against one another.\n\nSrivastava, whose wife has since left him, according to Troost’s new complaint, has since “engaged in at least two additional schemes in which [he] once again posed as a well-connected CIA ‘NOC’ to pursue profit and influence.”\n\nTroost’s suit seeks the return of all funds “wrongfully obtained” by Srivastava, plus compensatory, punitive, and treble damages, as well as court costs and attorneys’ fees. \n\nSrivastava has not yet formally responded to Troost’s allegations.","summary":"Exclusive: Gaurav Srivastava “is not a CIA operative and never has been,” an attorney for sanctioned Dutch oil trader Niels Troost told The Independent. “He’s not even a U.S. citizen.

In his usual chest-thumping style, Trump falsely claimed his policies and tariffs ushered in $18 trillion in investments. However, in reality, it is the American consumers who are bearing the brunt of his tariff war, while the US President seems to be pursuing a \"Make Trump Richer\" agenda. According to an NYT report, the real estate mogul amassed around $1.4 billion (nearly Rs 12,810 crore) since taking office a year ago, with his cryptocurrency ventures raking in the moolah.Since his January 2025 return to the White House, Trump saw his wealth surge by at least $1,408,500,000 amid renewed scrutiny of his business interests and charges that he was monetising the presidency. To arrive at the figure, NYT relied on analysis by various news organisations. However, this might be just the tip of the iceberg, as some of his profits are not publicly available.To put this in perspective, the average US household income, which has been in freefall, is around $83,000 (Rs 76,70,860). Thus, the wealth amassed by Trump in just 12 months is 16,720 times the US household income. TRUMP REAL ESTATE PROJECTS BOOMA significant amount, around $23 million, has been pocketed by the President by licensing the 'Trump' name for 20 different overseas projects. It includes a luxury hotel in Oman, a golf course in Saudi Arabia and an office tower in Maharashtra. The 'Trump World Centre' in Pune will be the first Trump-branded commercial real estate project in India. It is expected to bring in over $289 million for Trump. Interestingly, the same Trump, months ago, labelled India a \"dead economy\" as ties strained over his tariff and trade tantrums..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}While the President has weaponised tariffs to sign lopsided trade agreements, such real estate deals have also brought favours for some countries.A case in point is Vietnam, a country which depends heavily on the US for its exports, which was slapped with 46% tariffs last year. However, after Vietnam greenlit a $1.5 billion golf complex in Hanoi to be built by the Trump Organisation, the tariffs were lowered to 20%. In fact, reports said the government bypassed laws to fast-track Trump's project.In October, a video went viral where Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto was heard on a hot mic asking Trump if he could meet with his son Eric, who is looking after the family's businesses. While the details of the conversation were not clear, it pointed towards business deals.Last year, the first Trump-branded golf club opened in March in Indonesia. Another property in Indonesia and a resort in Bali are also listed on the Trump Organisation's website. The Trump Towers in Pune (Source: trumptowerspune.com) RAKES IN MOOLAH WITH CRYPTOHowever, real estate isn't the only way the US President has made money since assuming the presidency. The biggest moneymaker for Trump over the past year has been his cryptocurrency ventures. The President pocketed at least $867 million via his family-linked World Liberty Financial company and a meme coin.In 2025, a UAE-based firm funnelled $2 billion into a Trump firm, believed to be World Liberty Financial. It came weeks before Trump gave his nod to sell the country's semiconductor chips to the UAE.Trump 2.0 has shown that he cares little for geopolitics or allies in the face of his personal business interests. During his first term, Trump blasted Pakistan for giving the US nothing but \"lies\" and \"deceit\" in the name of counter-terror operations. But the same Trump has now warmed up to Pakistan with a massive crypto deal worth Rs 17,000 crore.In fact, Trump and his sons hold stakes worth more than $5 billion in World Liberty Financial, making crypto the most significant source of the family's fortune. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Zach Witkoff, a co-founder of World Liberty Financial FILMMAKING, LAWSUITS ADD TO WEALTHBesides, Trump and his wife, Melania, have also dipped into filmmaking, earning $28 million from Amazon for the rights to her upcoming documentary titled 'Melania'.Moreover, tech and media companies like X, Meta, YouTube and Paramount have collectively shelled out $90.5 million to Trump to settle lawsuits. While YouTube paid $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of Trump's channel, Paramount shelled out $16 million over an alleged distorted edit of an interview with Kamala Harris.Trump has also received luxurious gifts as well, like the $400 million aircraft, dubbed 'palace on wheels', from Qatar. The US President wants to use the jet as Air Force One and suggested that he would keep it with him after leaving office. Interestingly, Qatar's gift came weeks after the Trump Organisation struck a deal to build a luxury golf resort in Doha.This comes even as Americans struggle with a stagnant economy and a sharp uptick in grocery prices. However, Trump, back in office for a second term, seems to be more interested in piling up billions.

Kamala Is Back and in the Lead!","text":"I warned you! It’s kind of hilarious, but a lot of folks don’t realize that the current number one candidate to win the Democratic nomination in 2028 is… not Gavin Hairstyle… not Alfred E. Buttigieg… not Jupiter B. Pritzker… not even Josh “Yeah Right, Democrats Are Gonna Nominate A Jewish Guy Who Won’t Apologize For It” Shapiro. It’s Kamala Harris. No, really, I’m serious.\n\n“That’s crazy talk, Kurt. Why are you so crazy with your talking?”\n\nI’m not crazy. The Democrats aren’t crazy, either – they are stupid and evil. I’m not giving them the insanity out – they need to own the sorry and degraded state to which they have devolved. But as wacky as it would seem to an outside observer, Kamala is not just in the mix. She’s at the top of it – she’s the froth on a defeat latte, and Democrats are about to gulp it down.\n\nIf you have doubts, that’s because you’re normal. After all, a normal person looks at Kamala Harris and sees a Chardonnay-sodden, cackling quarter-wit with a proven track record of failure. She not only famously lost the last election, but did so in such a way that, in a sensible party, she would be exiled to the political equivalent of Greenland before it became part of the United States.\n\nHer first and most important decision in the 2024 election was legendarily dumb. She picked Tim Walz to be her running mate when she could’ve picked Josh Shapiro. I guess she had to nail down Minnesota for the Democrats rather than the swingiest of swing states, Pennsylvania. And more than that, her remarkable judgment led her to think that that mincing weirdo was going to win over all those male-identifying males who the Democrats have been disrespecting for the last few decades. Within the first couple of weeks, Governor Jazz Hands was revealed as a deployment-dodging, ChiCom-canoodling, show tunes-belting dork whose video antics trying to load a shotgun were the funniest thing to come out of his godforsaken freezer of a state until the recent video of Mogadishu West Mayor Jacob Frey pretending to enjoy forcing down a bowl of festering Somali swill. Of course, recently Tampon Tim was so wrapped up in the Somali fraud scandal he overlooked – putting it charitably – that he had to drop out of the race for reelection. That’s the guy she picked.\n\nYou had one job, Kamala, and you blew it – so to speak.\n\nHer general election gaffes were the stuff of legend, including her inability to list even one thing she would’ve done differently from the human eggplant prior president, who held on to the power for as long as he possibly could, at least in part, because he absolutely knew his understudy would fumble the general election. Further, her campaign strategy was built on the reasonable notion that the more exposure human beings had to her, the more repelled they would be by her. She therefore avoided normal human beings and avoided interviews, and while this definitely hurt her campaign – Trump was everywhere, talking to everyone and doing hilarious and fun things like driving a garbage truck and working the McDonald’s drive-thru – one wonders if Kamala would’ve performed even worse with more exposure.\n\nSigns point to yes. She comes off as stupid and annoying, which is a direct consequence of her being stupid and annoying.\n\nBut none of that matters because she’s a woman-identifying person of color. End of discussion. No, really, that’s it. That’s enough to win the election against the pale people o’ pallor who are her competition.\n\nEvery once in a while, somebody puts up a picture of her on Twitter and rants about how great it would be if she were president and not that mean old Donald Trump. This is either a result of people being stupid or thinking you are stupid. In fact, the biggest critics of Kamala Harris have always been other Democrats. They know she’s just an empty pantsuit that’s filled up with Franzia and commie nonsense. \n\nBut she’s got that black thing going, and that double X chromosome thing, too, and don’t underestimate those. After all, this is the Democrat Party. Besides her unequivocal willingness to perform any act of submission to the pagan pinko gods, those are the only things that matter. She’s black and female, and that gives her a massive advantage because that’s all her party cares about.\n\nGavin Newsom is a white guy, the Patrick Bateman of the West Coast. That’s not going to go over with the Democrat base real well, although there are professional Democrat voices who are pretty much saying, “Hey, we gotta stop this nonsense with the naggy chicks and get us a white guy, or we will never win again.” But you’ve got to understand who really matters in the Democrat Party. It’s not the pros; it’s the activists and black women, and neither of those groups is going to pass over a BIPOC uterus-haver in favor of a rich boy who is about as ethnic as a Romney.\n\nThe activists want somebody who’s literally too stupid and weak to oppose them when their idiocy gets too alienating for normal people. A guy like Gavin Newsom has an animal cunning that allows him to realize that there’s a line that regular people are not going to cross. He can fake moderation. Kamala can’t. She’ll recognize Hamas is the true government of Israel. She’ll give back Iran the bomb. She’ll hand over Taiwan to the Chinese and the Philippines, too. She won’t even bother with plausible deniability when she throws the border back open. When the activists rub the bottle, a gaseous Kamala floats out, manifests, and announces, “Your wish is my command.”\n\nThe black women, who have an outsized role in the party, just love her, and with South Carolina likely to be the first contest in the primary, they will be decisive in picking the nominee. Who’s going to compete with her gyn-noir bona fides? Pete Buttigieg is running about zero percent with black voters, a number that frankly seems a little high. The same with JB Pritzker – what’s the argument for this guy? “Sure, he’s not white, and he presumably has a penis in there somewhere, but on the plus side, he’s enormously fat?”\n\nAnd Josh Shapiro? Yeah, the activists are going to just love a guy who opposes “Holocaust II: Electric Boogaloo.” Likewise, I’m sure all those black Democrat women – as well as the sexually frustrated white wine women – would just love somebody who’s Jewish in the sense that he practices Judaism.\n\nIn case you don’t understand me, I’m saying that antisemitism is a key component of the modern Democrat Party. Our side may be stuck with the occasional dummies like Candace Owens, but their antisemites are the rule and not the exception.\n\nNow, according to one poll, Kamala Harris is leading at 33 percent, and in others, she’s also doing well. JD Vance seems to think she’s the likely nominee at this point, suggesting that it’s a fight between her and Brylcreem Boy to determine “the dumbest candidate.” Commentator Mark Halperin has her in the mix as well. But the most important take is from Kamala herself. She seems to believe that her book tour was a gigantic success and that she isn’t the ridiculous buffoon that she obviously is. Her ego and raw appetite for striving will push her into the race. Of course, this time she’s on her own. At every other juncture in her life, she’s been given political gigs by more powerful men pursuant to various arrangements. But no one will give her this one. She’s got to go take it, and that’s the problem for her. While she’s well-positioned to win the nomination thanks to her immutable genetic characteristics, she’s got a couple of big disadvantages.\n\nShe’s an idiot, and she’s a loser. But then, she’s a Democrat, so maybe they’re actually advantages.\n\nOrder Kurt Schlichter’s BRAND NEW bestseller in the Kelly Turnbull People’s Republic conservative action series, \"Panama Red,\" and follow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting and opinion?

But the disturbing part is that Democrats see freedom exactly as Lenin did — and that is why the Democrat Party is and has always been the worst threat to American liberty.\n\nFrom the time of the first Democrat president, Andrew Jackson, onwards, the Democrat Party has defined its platform on one or more explicitly anti-American and anti-Constitutional policies, on policies that limit and undermine freedom, whether that be slavery or segregation or abortion or censorship or \"gun control\" or preferred pronouns.\n\nDavos: Bessent Mocks ‘Ken’ Doll Newsom and ‘Sugar Daddy’ Alex Soros\n\nWhether reading the speeches of slavery’s 19th-century champion John C. Calhoun, listening to the more recent screechings of Kamala Harris, or scrolling the X posts of Gavin Newsom, we note a common theme. Calhoun, Harris, Newsom, et cetera, all believe that their \"freedom\" requires crushing the freedom of others. Just as slaveowners used to say it was their liberty at stake with abolition, so now Democrats say that a mother's liberty demands the murder of her unborn baby, a transgender-identifying individual's liberty requires that we affirm his mental illness, and an illegal alien's liberty demands that citizens and law enforcement submit to be robbed, raped, and replaced meekly.\n\nLike Lenin, Democrats want you and me to believe that rights and freedom are granted to us peasants, the lumpenproletariat, by the elites. As Lenin put it, liberty is rationed. A peon can own a gun, post on social media, travel, or have a baby only if the elites in their enlightened generosity allow him or her to do so, and only to the extent that he or she is allowed. And if the peon makes a statement or a life decision outside of the elites' approved narrative and parameters, the peon must expect to be punished.\n\nThe Founders wrote into the Declaration of Independence that rights come from God and are \"unalienable.\" Therefore, if government violates rights and freedom, the government should go. There is absolutely no sense from the Founders that liberty is \"rationed\" or a zero-sum game. They fought a Revolution to prove this truth. Lenin fought a different sort of Revolution to establish his lie.\n\nHere's food for thought — the Democrat Party has more ideologically in common with the men who fought the Bolshevik Revolution than the men who fought the American Revolution.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/21/dems-view-of-liberty-is-identical-with-lenins-n4948589","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/124/60aea577-9fd6-491c-8805-e6fa4a6da395.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 02:16:10","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":395064682,"title":"FCC says talk shows must offer equal time for candidate interviews","text":"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday that daytime and late-night TV talk shows featuring interviews with political candidates must comply with “equal time” rules that give airtime to views of opposing candidates and that the shows cannot rely on a 2006 decision that suggested they were exempt. Until now, talk shows have qualified for the equal opportunities exemption as genuine news interviews, ever since the FCC’s Media Bureau granted an exemption to the interview part of Jay Leno’s “Tonight Show” in 2006. Networks have relied on the ruling as a precedent for recent interviews with political candidates. The FCC’s Media Bureau said Wednesday, however, that networks should not rely on the 2006 decision, adding that it “has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify” for an exemption. The agency added that any program or station seeking assurances that the equal time requirements do not apply should “promptly file a petition for a declaratory ruling.” Democratic FCC member Anna Gomez said the guidance was at odds with the commission’s long-standing view that late-night programs and daytime news shows are entitled to editorial discretion based on newsworthiness, not political favoritism. She said the announcement was “an escalation in this FCC’s ongoing campaign to censor and control speech. ... The First Amendment does not yield to government intimidation. Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation.” President Donald Trump posted a link late Wednesday to a news story about the issue that said the FCC was taking aim at the ABC daytime talk show “The View” and the ABC late-night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live” over equal time rules for politicians.

Gavin Newsom jetted off this week to heckle President Trump at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Switzerland, ultimately failing spectacularly.\n\nIt’s yet another glimpse into the unserious, trolling, king-of-pulling-stunts pattern of his: grandstanding, slick preaching, hurling insults at Trump, and positioning himself as a global moral authority —- all while the state he governs descends deeper into chaos. \n\nAnd this guy wants to be president?\n\nNewsom seeks to damage America, swinging like a Barbie on a wrecking ball, rather than embracing our nation’s rise. \n\nHe tried and failed to coax world leaders over to his own misguided side instead of rallying for a unified American resurgence after four years of disaster under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking off the cuff at Davos’ forum, Newsom shamefully lectured and berated European leaders for “rolling over” on Trump’s national security, migration and trade policies, using demeaning sexual innuendo and demanding those heads of state “grow a spine,” accusing them of “complicity” in what he painted as authoritarian behavior.\n\nHe dismissed Trump’s speech (which recapped a year of dramatic improvements in America’s economy, getting a handle on crime, and tightly securing our borders) as “boring” and “insignificant,” likening the president to a “T-Rex” that world leaders must either “mate with” or be “devoured” by. \n\nHe told reporters that traditional diplomacy with Trump amounted to “stupidity,” claiming leaders were being “played.” \n\nHe couldn’t have been more wrong —- and his inflammatory heckling on foreign soil earned swift, and proper, condemnation.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent skewered Newsom as “Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,” calling him economically illiterate and perhaps less knowledegable than even Kamala Harris. \n\nIt’s notable, too, that Newsom attended Davos alongside billionaire nepo baby Alex Soros, who described him as a “close friend” and the “real star” of the Davos forum.\n\nConsider the contrast: Newsom, the wrecker, destroys things. Meanwhile, Trump, Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (who gave a brilliant talk at Davos) are builders, repairing the damage done across America under Biden-Harris’ open borders, pro-criminal, leftist agenda.\n\nThis is not Newsom’s first clown show at the World Economic Forum; it is well-trodden ground. He’s attended multiple times since his days as San Francisco mayor, earning the derisive nickname “Davos Democrat” for prioritizing elite global networking over crises at home. \n\nIndeed, thanks to his inside track with the Willie Brown machine, Gavin’s been honing his skills — or rather, his talk and his image —- for decades.\n\nBy design, his sharp attacks on Trump resonate in left-wing progressive media, where outlets frame his rhetoric as courageous resistance rather than the reckless divisiveness it is. \n\nThese platforms cast him as a defender of democratic values, conveniently ignoring the stark contradiction: a governor who rails against federal “chaos” while presiding over profound disorder in California and working to undermine the nation’s trajectory toward recovery and strength.\n\nCalifornia is not a sovereign nation-state, despite Newsom’s notorious 2020 claim. That boastful hyperbole revealed delusion and a flirtation with separatism — disregarding, with grandiose arrogance, the state’s constitutional subordination to federal authority. \n\nThe governor cannot conduct independent foreign policy, yet his Davos performance suggested otherwise by promoting California as an alternative to Trump’s America. \n\nThis opportunistic, blusterous theater fails to mask the truth: Newsom is a wrecker who excels at demolition, not construction.\n\nAnd then came Greenland, the subject of Newsom’s meltdown.\n\nAmerica protected the territory during World War II, then returned it to Denmark to administer. \n\nBut many now view the island as a sitting duck, and today the prospect of a Greenland in the hands of adversaries is not tolerable. Trump foresaw that for strategic purposes —- and to ward off advances from Russia or China —- Greenland cannot exist as-is in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\nTrump is building America’s defenses via his approach to the island; he said on Wednesday that the United States would essentially acquire Greenland by agreement, not by force. \n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, work on a framework for just such a deal was underway, and markets rallied nearly 600 points by closing. \n\nTrump won again, and Newsom’s entire “wreck Trump” narrative and outbursts to world leaders continued to unravel.\n\nWhile the governor brushes off critics with talk of “California Derangement Syndrome,” the evidence is undeniable: He is a wrecker who tears down, a heckler who shouts from the world stage, and an opportunist who exploits the spotlight.\n\nMeanwhile, his own state pays the steep price of his relentless destruction.\n\nRichie Greenberg is a political commentator based in San Francisco.","summary":"Gov.

After advising his father on how to reach young people during his 2024 presidential campaign, the 19-year-old is living his private life while he attends college at New York University's Stern School of Business, dabbles in the business world, and enjoys a low-key social life. \n\nHowever, on Wednesday he made a rare headline, and unlike the son from the previous administration, it was for doing something positive. \n\nA young, unnamed British woman appeared in a London court to testify against her 22-year-old abusive boyfriend this week, and she claimed that if not for Barron, she might not even be alive. \n\nShe was referring to a situation that happened on January 18 last year. The woman and Barron were friends, and he'd tried to call her a few times, but she didn't answer. According to her testimony, her boyfriend became jealous of her friendship with Barron and began to hit her. \n\nSomehow, she managed to make a FaceTime call back to the United States, and Barron picked up. He expected a normal, friendly call or a \"nice hello\" as he put it, but instead, he could only see the ceiling of the location. He could hear the woman screaming. Suddenly, she was in the picture, and Barron could see her crying as the boyfriend was beating her. \n\nThe call only lasted about 10 to 15 seconds, but Barron jumped into action. He contacted the police and said, \"I just got a call from a girl I know. She’s getting beaten up.\" He gave them her address in the United Kingdom and added, \"It’s really an emergency, please. I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.\" \n\nThe police eventually arrived on the scene, and, according to bodycam footage played in court, an officer asked the woman if she'd been \"streaming.\" \n\nShe finally told him that she'd been in touch with a friend. \"I am friends with Barron Trump, Donald Trump’s son,\" she said. \n\nThe police officer had her call Barron back to confirm that it was he who contacted authorities. He recounted what he saw and said, \"I called you guys — that was the best thing I could do. I wasn’t going to call back and threaten things to him because that would just make the situation worse.\" \n\nThe young woman testified, \"He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.\" \n\nWhen I was reading the court transcript about this earlier, all I could think was what a gentleman Barron is. He could have easily hung up and done nothing, but he made the call and saw it through until it reached authorities on another continent. \n\nI think that's a testament to our president and first lady and the good job they did raising their son. And it's refreshing after four years of Hunter Biden, who I guess was also a testament to his father and stepmother's parenting skills. \n\nRelated: Here's What Barron Trump Really Said to Joe Biden\n\nAs a matter of fact, as I reported back in November, Barron turned a lot of heads at his father's inauguration last year when he said something to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as he walked past them and shook their hands. Many thought he said something crude based on the look on Biden's face after, but it was more along the lines of \"Congratulations, and best of luck to you.\" \n\nFun fact: The White House released a list of 365 of Donald Trump's accomplishments in 365 days to mark the one-year anniversary of his presidency, and number 243 is \"Stripped notorious crackhead and grifter Hunter Biden of his taxpayer-funded Secret Service detail.\" \n\nI don't think any future president will have to say anything like that about Barron or any of the other Trump children. \n\nWant to support conservative media?

I mean, I was asked many questions by our security team before I got the security clearance as President Obama’s chief of staff.”\n\nShapiro revealed the questioning from Harris’s team in his forthcoming memoir, Where We Keep the Light. According to Shapiro, Dana Remus, a former White House counsel, asked him: “Have you ever communicated with an undercover agent of Israel?”\n\n“Was she kidding?” Shapiro wrote. “I told her how offensive the question was.”\n\nWalz was also reportedly questioned over the trips he took to China before he ran for office and whether he was an agent for the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nHarris ultimately chose Walz as her running mate over Shapiro, who is widely seen as a possible 2028 contender.

Between the ability to shape public policy and the trappings that come with inhabiting high office, political power is almost always an addictive drug that’s hard to kick. That said, it’s also one of the hallmarks and great strengths of American democracy that, for most of the last 250 years, politicians of all parties have accepted — usually honorably — the will of voters.\n\nTragically, however, this great tradition of honor and discipline was egregiously abandoned by Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election — an action that led directly to the infamous January 6, 2021, insurrection. And now, five years later, it’s clear that this new practice of, when necessary, taking every conceivable step to evade the will of the citizenry in order to cling to power, has become the new modus operandi of Trump’s party in North Carolina.\n\nWe, of course, should have seen this coming. That the fear of voter decisions and the willingness to subvert them had become a new Republican tactic of choice was first made blatantly obvious in 2013 when the GOP-dominated General Assembly began enacting election law changes (like the infamous Monster Voting Law) that went to extreme lengths to both suppress the vote of disfavored groups — most notably voters of color — and rig electoral outcomes through the use of extreme partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe practice continued in the weeks immediately following the 2016 election. That was the period during which the lame duck GOP-dominated General Assembly hastily convened to enact laws stripping the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of an array of basic powers long and logically attached to the office.\n\nNever mind that voters chose Cooper with the eminently reasonable expectation that he would wield authority — like numerous important appointment powers — long and naturally associated with the role of a state’s chief executive. Ignoring the obvious will of voters, GOP legislators moved quickly to remove them, and in most instances, seize them for themselves.\n\nAnd in recent years, sadly, this trend has only continued to metastasize and become even more ingrained.\n\nSee, for example, the ongoing effort to take gerrymandering to ever greater depths by, quite literally, rendering the results of almost all legislative elections foreordained and rigged to elect large Republican majorities. Late last year, the GOP took this practice to a new and truly preposterous level when, heeding the dictates of Dear Leader Trump, it further rigged the state’s congressional elections so that our deeply purple state will almost assuredly be represented by a U.S. House delegation of 11 Republicans and three Democrats.\n\nAnd then of course, there was the almost laughably bizarre move to, in the aftermath of Democrat Josh Stein’s landslide victory in the 2024 election, seize even more gubernatorial power — like appointing the state Board of Elections — and hand it to, of all people, the state’s accountant (i.e. the auditor). It was a move so blatant and utterly contemptuous of the will of voters that it left many observers to conclude that Republicans would have gladly handed the seized power over to whatever GOP office holder happened to be handy — the Labor Commissioner? Agriculture Commissioner? — if the new GOP auditor, Dave Boliek, hadn’t been so cynically ready and willing to play along.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported on Jan. 19, the governor’s office isn’t the only one from which Republicans have shown themselves more than willing to seize powers in contravention of the voters’ judgment. Newly elected Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is also a target.\n\nDespite ample evidence that Jackson has worked hard to approach the task in a nonpartisan manner guided by the letter of the law and the likelihood of demonstrable harm to our state, Republican legislators advanced legislation last year that would strip the AG’s office of one of its central and most important constitutional duties — to challenge unlawful presidential executive orders that harm the state. \n\nOne GOP lawmaker even promised he and his colleagues would wreak vengeance and render Jackson’s office “a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” if he dared to contest their action. Try to imagine that such a move could have occurred if Dan Bishop were AG and Kamala Harris in the White House.\n\nAll these moves come on top of many years of repeated legislative micro-aggressions toward Democrats elected to Council of State offices like the Superintendent of Public Instruction and Secretary of State via budget cuts and other power grabs.\n\nWill this trend continue in the New Year? It’s hard to imagine that it won’t. While gerrymandering and political power jockeying has always been a feature of American politics, the modern, Trumpified Republican Party has taken both phenomena to new and extreme levels never seen before in American history. The only question that remains at this point is how much longer voters will stand for the fear and contempt directed their way by politicians supposedly sworn to serve them.\n\nSenior contributor and award-winning journalist Rob Schofield authors regular commentaries and hosts the 'News & Views' weekly radio show/podcast.

Between the ability to shape public policy and the trappings that come with inhabiting high office, political power is almost always an addictive drug that’s hard to kick. That said, it’s also one of the hallmarks and great strengths of American democracy that, for most of the last 250 years, politicians of all parties have accepted — usually honorably — the will of voters.\n\nTragically, however, this great tradition of honor and discipline was egregiously abandoned by Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election — an action that led directly to the infamous January 6, 2021, insurrection. And now, five years later, it’s clear that this new practice of, when necessary, taking every conceivable step to evade the will of the citizenry in order to cling to power, has become the new modus operandi of Trump’s party in North Carolina.\n\nWe, of course, should have seen this com","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/north-carolina-2674916501/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/north-carolina-flag.jpg?id=55120736&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=187%2C0%2C188%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 21:37:02","author":"NC Newsline,Rob Schofield","authors":["NC Newsline","Rob Schofield"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.071},{"id":395001138,"title":"Trump says he has a top choice to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, but skips on a name","text":"Donald Trump said in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday that he has likely narrowed down his pick to replace Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, to one person.\n\nBut he declined to say who that person was as he spoke to CNBC’s Joe Kernen after his speech to the World Economic Forum, a rambling address where he attacked his domestic and international political foes while finally ruling out military action against a Nato ally in order to acquire the territory of Greenland.\n\nTrump spoke to Kernen on Wednesday afternoon and attacked Powell repeatedly over his refusal to cut interest rates to a greater degree, as well as for supposedly getting spooked when GDP numbers have a sustained rally.\n\nHe told Kernen “I’d say we’re down to three but we’re down to two, and I can probably can tell you we’re down to maybe one, in my mind.”\n\n“[Powell]’s too late, he’s always too late, except when it come to politics for the other side,” Trump complained in the interview. “Right now, if you announce great numbers, the stock market goes down. Because they think ‘Oh, they’re going to raise the [interest] rate. They’re going to kill it.’”\n\n“Which truly stops you from having any great runs, and we want to have a great run,” the president continued.\n\nTrump’s sustained criticism of Powell and threats to fire the chair of the Federal Reserve have caused fears on Wall Street and Capitol Hill both in the past. Most recently, senators including members of Trump’s own party expressed alarm after the Department of Justice, which is on a run of prosecutions targeting the president’s personal enemies, opened a criminal investigation into Powell.\n\nDuring his interview on Wednesday the president alluded to some of that criticism: Namely, his charge that Powell voted to cut interest rates during the 2024 election to benefit then-President Joe Biden and his running mate-turned-replacement, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe case even triggered a rare warning from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who advised the administration publicly: “I haven’t seen the case or whatever the allegations or charges are, but I’d say they better be real and they better be serious.”\n\nPowell’s investigation by the DOJ is likely to seriously complicate plans to replace him in May, when his term expires as chair. It could also encourage him to remain on as a governor, as which he is serving on a separate term thanks to the complicated leadership structure of the Fed. Typically, chairs of the Fed step down as governors when they retire from the top job, but it’s not unheard of for one to stay on.\n\nThe end of Powell’s term falls under the shadow of the greatest efforts by the White House to erode the Fed’s independence in recent history, and Trump’s own talent search to find a replacement.\n\nHis plans to do so could be further delayed by the Powell investigation launched by the DOJ, as two Republican senators (Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski) have resolved to place a hold on nominations for Powell’s replacement until the probe is concluded.\n\n“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” Tillis wrote on X.\n\nIn July of last year, Trump said it was “highly unlikely” that he would fire the Fed chair. But that only came after he reportedly polled Republican lawmakers on the question and even showed them a draft letter of a termination notice intended for Powell.\n\n“No, we're not planning on doing anything,” Trump said at the time. “So he's doing a lousy job. But no, I'm not talking about that. We get, fortunately, we get to make a change in the next, what, eight months or so, and we'll pick somebody that's good.”","summary":"Trump has flirted with firing Jerome Powell for months and recently his DOJ opened a criminal investigation into the Fed chair","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fed-chair-davos-replacement-b2905150.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/21/21/32/cnbc_youtube_126.jpg?crop=1162.5,775,x0,y0&trim=0,227,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zi86LATM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-21 21:31:36","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":395035350,"title":"Michelle Obama Still Believes America Isn't Ready for a Female President — And Claims There Are Men Out There Who 'Won't Vote for a Woman'","text":"Michelle Obama has addressed her controversial comment in which she said the U.S. was not ready for a female president, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe former first lady clarified in an interview on Wednesday, January 21, that she believed the country was progressing and moving toward the direction where one day a female could be voted into the White House.Michelle Clarifies Her Remarks About a Female PresidentMichelle, 62, broke down her past comment while chatting with Alex Cooper on the Call Her Daddy podcast. \n\nWhile promoting her 2025 book, The Look, Michelle quipped: \"That's why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running 'cause you all are lying.

Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.”...Trump told reporters after his post that he would release the specifics of the agreement shortly. He declined to answer when asked if it grants US ownership of Greenland, saying “it’s a long-term deal. It’s the ultimate long-term deal, and I think it puts everybody in a real good position.” He said it would last for an “infinite” period of time.In an interview with CNBC, Trump said he had not spoken directly with officials in Denmark about his “concepts of a plan” for Greenland, but added that he assumed Rutte had briefed leaders there.

It was during these private briefings – conducted on background with the condition that reporters wouldn’t directly attribute the information to Weiss – that she took the opportunity to criticize Sharyn Alfonsi, the 60 Minutes correspondent behind the piece.\n\n“Status has learned that during these conversations with reporters, Weiss expressed significant frustration with Alfonsi, who had declined to make changes to her piece at Weiss’ behest,” Status News’ Oliver Darcy reported.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to representatives for CBS News and Weiss for comment.\n\nThe broadside against Alfonsi in the background calls – like Darcy, this reporter did not take part in these discussions and learned about them independently – comes after Weiss has been on the receiving end of withering press coverage and internal criticism over her leadership of the Tiffany Network’s newsroom. \n\nThe relentless scrutiny of her approach as editor-in-chief – a position the anti-woke columnist was granted by Paramount chief David Ellison in October despite her dearth of experience in broadcast news – reached a fever pitch last month when she dramatically pulled the “Inside CECOT” segment at the last minute, even though it had been cleared by the network’s legal team and promoted on CBS airwaves.\n\nAmid widespread blowback both internally and externally, Weiss repeatedly defended her decision that the segment was “not ready” to air, citing the lack of on-the-record comments from the Trump administration defending their actions and legal justifications. Meanwhile, Alfonsi fumed in a memo to her 60 Minutes colleagues that Weiss's decision to spike the segment appeared to be politically motivated.\n\n“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she wrote. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now – after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAlfonsi also noted that if the White House’s “refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” adding that the network goes “from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nThe fiasco around the segment prompted network employees and insiders to suggest that Weiss could face a “revolt” from 60 Minutes staff, which was already suffering from plummeting morale following a year’s worth of controversies, such as Paramount paying Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over the program’s interview with rival Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, with Weiss coming under additional fire over the “MAGA-coded” reboot of CBS Evening News – which has suffered a rocky rollout replete with internal discord, technical mishaps, cringey pro-Trump segments and soft ratings – The Free Press founder has grown increasingly frustrated with the overwhelmingly negative media coverage she’s received.\n\nTherefore, after finally giving the “Inside CECOT” story the green light to run this past Sunday – with little promotion and up against the NFL playoffs – Weiss rang up several journalists to offer her own perspective on the controversy and “do her own PR,” as one Weiss associate explained to Status.\n\nIn general, this type of behind-the-scenes outreach by a network chief amid a media firestorm in which they are embroiled is unusual, as attempts at public relations spin are typically left to spokespeople and communications staff. Making it even more eyebrow-raising from Weiss, however, was what was said during those calls – namely, the criticism of Alfonsi.\n\n“While it is no secret that Weiss and Alfonsi are at odds, the fact that the network’s top editorial executive would voice irritation with one of her marquee correspondents to outside journalists is, to put it mildly, extraordinary. Sure, disputes with subordinates happen at virtually every organization,” Darcy pointed out. “But strong leaders keep disagreements within the house. They don’t complain to the press about them—especially when the subordinate is barred from advocating in the press on her own behalf.”\n\nIndeed, with morale sinking at CBS News as a whole amid the network’s conservative shift under Ellison, who has been accused of trying to curry favor with Trump as he seeks regulatory approval in his hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, Weiss’ criticism of Alfonsi in her reporter briefings isn’t going over well with staff.\n\n“She is so out of her depth it’s astounding. Her inexperience is on full display,” one network reporter told The Independent. “How long must we endure this fiasco?”\n\nAnother 60 Minutes staffer told Status that Weiss was “deflecting” the widespread backlash she has faced since joining CBS by “blaming us,” adding that she should have expected some pushback from the show’s staff due to their experience and accolades. \n\n“They know exactly what they’re doing, and they do it exceptionally well. That’s why the show has been No. 1 for as long as it has,” that staffer said.\n\n“Of course, there’s going to be friction when Bari walks in acting like she owns the place. These are the people who built it,” the staffer continued. “You don’t gain and build trust when you insult us, come in and say we’re biased, don’t learn the place [and] how we work, the fact-checking and research involved.”\n\nAnother network staffer, who spoke to The Independent on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, stated that it seemed pretty apparent who Weiss had spoken to over the weekend based on the stories that were published about the situation.\n\n“Clearly those lines in news reports about 'people who work with Bari say she admits she got involved too late in the 60 process and wasn’t aware of the effect a late decision would have on the 60 process' is from her private briefings with reporters that Status refers to,” the staffer stated.\n\n“Trying to show it’s an honest mistake and I’m learning - f*** that - it’s not a difficult thing to understand how your involvement can f*** things up,” they added. “Firstly, you don’t need to have worked in TV to get that and secondly, it reveals her arrogance because she could have asked what the ramifications were or listened when people protested.”\n\nIn the end, while she held the story for four weeks, Weiss ultimately allowed it to air largely intact. While the report itself remained unchanged from the previously submitted version, which briefly ran on a Canadian network before CBS News pulled it back, 60 Minutes added portions to the front and back of the segment. The bookended sections included additional comments from the Trump administration and details about an “offensive tattoo” that one of the Venezuelan migrants interviewed by Alfonsi had removed.\n\nAt the same time, though, Weiss’ push to have a Trump official sit down for the story proved unsuccessful in the end. Despite her making it a top priority for the report to air, and the biggest reason she claimed it needed additional work to be ready to run, the Trump administration rebuffed 60 Minutes’ efforts to score an interview.\n\nIn fact, as several outlets recently reported, Weiss reached out to the administration to get DHS chief Kristi Noem or border czar Tom Homan to speak with the program – with Alfonsi making her way to Washington to conduct the interviews. \n\n“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said during the aired segment on Sunday. “They declined our requests.”","summary":"‘She is so out of her depth it’s astounding.

Gavin Newsom and his connection to an infamous billionaire.\n\nIt would be difficult to be more radical than George Soros, the globalist billionaire who began his infamous career by collaborating with Nazis, but George's son Alex is doing his best to set a new record for sponsoring the worst leftist politicians. Among those, apparently, is Gavin Newsom, judging from a chummy photo of the two at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 conference in Davos, Switzerland. Or, as Bessent put it, \"Sparkle Beach Ken\" Newsom was palling around with his \"sugar daddy.\"\n\n🚨 HOLY CRAP!

Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, maybe the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris, [and] he's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros.\"\n\nThe treasury secretary eviscerated Newsom's record. \"Davos is a perfect place for a man who, when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having thousand-dollar-a-night meals at the French Laundry, and I'm sure the Californian people won't forget that. And I can tell my message to Gov. Newsom is: the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crackdown on waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\nBessent topped off his brutal takedown by stating, \"I was told [Newsom] was asked to give a speech on his signature policies, but he's not speaking, because what have his economic policies brought? Outward migration from California, a gigantic budget deficit, the largest homeless population in America, and the poor folks in the Palisades who had their homes burned down — he is here, hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless, shame on him.

The Numbers Don't Lie.\n\nNewsom has enriched himself and increased his own power, so from his perspective, he's a success. From the perspective of any sane person, either living in California or viewing the crisis that state is in now, Newsom is a catastrophic failure. From his aggressive COVID-19 lockdowns to his irresponsible expenditure of taxpayer money to his LGBTQ fanaticism to his freebies for illegal aliens, Newsom has sabotaged California over and over. \n\nHe banned schools from informing parents about child \"gender transitions,\" he refuses to hand murderous illegal aliens over to ICE, and he has built up an $18 billion budget deficit. Residents of California have left in droves since Newsom took over, including multiple billionaires currently packing up currently over a proposed wealth tax.\n\nGov. Newsom is all hair gel and no integrity.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of international events and other key news in this new year.

He's been in Davos for the last few days, buddying up to Alex Soros and hoping to reach into the deep pockets of the world's global elite to prop up his chances of winning the White House.\n\nHe was having so much fun being the belle of the Davos ball; the parties, the media attention – oh, it was swell. That is, until Team Trump came to town. The fun, indeed, seemed to come to a screeching halt for Newsom once President Trump and members of his Cabinet descended upon the snowy ski town in Switzerland. \n\nIt all started when Newsom was asked if he had any advice for those in the international community who had concerns over Trump's plans for Greenland. This led to a non-response from Newsom, who, while channeling his inner Kamala Harris, went on an extended ramble about backbones, Nobel prizes, and T-Rexes. Oh, and he also called U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent \"smug.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Bessent Eviscerates Newsom in Savage Davos Take-Down – 'Patrick Bateman Meets Sparkle Beach Ken'\n\nBessent, when taking to the stage at Davos on Wednesday, quickly reduced Newsom to a quivering mass of jello with an absolutely withering line of fire. Here's bit of what Bessent said, from our earlier reporting:\n\nI think it's very, very ironic that Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris. He's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is a perfect place for a man who – when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having thousand-dollar-a-night meals at the French Laundry – and I'm sure the California people won't forget that.And, my message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. \n\nYowza, that definitely left a mark.\n\nDuring his remarks, Bessent noted that Newsom was supposed to give a speech at Davos, but wasn't going forward with that plan because Newsom is \"too economically illiterate to know anything.\" More Bessent:\n\nAnd I was told he was asked to give a speech on his signature policies, but he's not speaking because what have his economic policies brought? Outward migration from California. A gigantic budget deficit. The largest homeless population in America. And the poor folks in the Palisades who had their homes burned down. He is here hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless.Shame on him. He is too smug, too self absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything.\n\nFresh from that humiliation, Newsom found out that not only wasn't he speaking at Davos, he was barred from entering the USA House pavilion. The pavilion was set up to \"celebrate the 250th anniversary of America in Davos in 2026, building on more than a decade of experience that Stromback Global brings to hosting independent gatherings in Davos and other global convenings.\"\n\nNewsom wasn't best pleased at the freeze out, claiming USA House sponsor Fortune had bowed to pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nAs of this writing, the Trump White House had not commented on the USA House development. We're left to wonder what other humiliations await Gavin Newsom in Davos has he avoids his duties in California. \n\nEditor’s Note: Help us continue to report the truth about corrupt politicians like Gavin Newsom.\n\nJoin RedState VIP and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your membership.","url":"https://redstate.com/terichristoph/2026/01/21/gavin-newsoms-davos-humiliation-tour-continues-as-hes-denied-entry-to-us-exhibit-n2198374","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/21/5c9c36e2-7764-4457-b22d-c66a09e9d6a8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 20:43:31","author":"Teri Christoph","authors":["Teri Christoph"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":394988000,"title":"Court lifts restrictions on immigration officers’ tactics in Minnesota","text":"An appeals court on Wednesday suspended a decision that restricts immigration officers’ aggressive tactics in Minnesota, while Maine declined a request for more undercover license plates for U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicles, citing “abuses of power” during the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was persuaded to freeze a judge’s ruling that bars officers from using tear gas and other steps against peaceful protesters while the administration pursues an appeal. Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, began in early December.\n\nAn injunction ordered last week by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez harms “officers’ ability to protect themselves and the public in very dangerous circumstances,” lawyers for the government argued.\n\nMinnesota remains a major focus of immigration sweeps by agencies under the Department of Homeland Security.

Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. A message seeking comment from CBP was not immediately returned.\n\n“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.\n\nPortland Public Schools, the largest and most diverse district in Maine, said it kept the doors locked at two schools for a few minutes Tuesday because of concerns about activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” the district said.\n\nGreg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration’s big-city immigration crackdown, said more than 10,000 people in the U.S. illegally have been arrested in Minnesota in the past year, including 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” in the last six weeks during Operation Metro Surge.\n\nBovino defended his “troops” and said their actions are “legal, ethical and moral.”\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge said he’s prepared to grant bond and release two men after hearing conflicting testimony about an alleged assault on an immigration officer. Prosecutors are appealing. One of the men was shot in the thigh last week.\n\nVice President JD Vance is expected to travel to Minneapolis on Thursday for a roundtable with local leaders and community members, according to sources familiar with his plans who spoke on condition on anonymity because the trip had not yet been officially announced.\n\nWhittle reported from Portland, Maine.

The rule covers individuals who have publicly announced their intention to run for office and qualify under applicable state or federal law to hold the office being sought.\n\nIn 2006, the FCC determined that “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” qualified for an exemption from the rule as a “bona fide news interview” — the first time that such an exemption had been applied to a late night talk show. \n\n“Concerns have been raised that the industry has taken the Media Bureau’s 2006 staff-level decision to mean that the interview portion of all arguably similar entertainment programs— whether late night or daytime—are exempted from the section 315 equal opportunities requirement under a bona fide news exemption,” the FCC’s new guidance states. “This is not the case. These decisions are fact specific and the exemptions are limited to the program that was the subject ofthe request.”\n\nThe agency said it has “not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” It added that any program that is “motivated by partisan purposes” would not be entitled to an exemption under longstanding FCC precedent. \n\nThe new guidance comes after ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was temporarily pulled from the airwaves back in September for remarks the late night host made following Charlie Kirk’s death. \n\nAt the time, FCC chairman Brendan Carr condemned Kimmel’s remarks and urged local broadcasters to take action. \n\n“When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in a YouTube interview at the time. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\nFollowing Carr’s remarks, Kimmel would get pulled from ABC affiliate stations owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting and the network would follow suit soon after. Kimmel was suspended for around a week before his show was ultimately restored. \n\nCarr’s remarks would lead to criticism from both sides of the political aisle and he was ultimately pressed further about the Kimmel situation and pressures the Trump administration may be placing on the regulator during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last month.\n\nIn addition to Kimmel, Carr has also previously threatened ABC’s “The View” about pulling the show’s bona fide news interview exemption. \n\nHe also previously reiinstated a dismissed complaint against New York’s WNBC-TV, which accused the network of violating the FCC’s equal time rule when former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on “Saturday Night Live” during the weekend leading up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Any program or station that wishes to obtain formal assurance that the equal opportunities requirement does not apply (in whole or in part) is encouraged to promptly file a petition for declaratory ruling that satisfies the statutory requirements for a bona fide news exemption,” the FCC’s guidance concludes. “It is important that both broadcasters and legally qualified candidates understand the FCC’s equal opportunities regulations and how they can result in broadcasters offering opposing legal qualified candidates comparable time and placement.”\n\nIn a statement, the FCC’s sole Democrat commissioner Anna Gomez said that “nothing has fundamentally changed” with respect to the agency’s political broadcasting rules.\n\n“The FCC has not adopted any new regulation, interpretation, or Commission-level policy altering the long-standing news exemption or equal time framework,” Gomez said in a statement. “For decades, the Commission has recognized that bona fide news interviews, late-night programs, and daytime news shows are entitled to editorial discretion based on newsworthiness, not political favoritism. That principle has not been repealed, revised, or voted on by the Commission. This announcement therefore does not change the law, but it does represent an escalation in this FCC’s ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.”\n\nGomez added that the First Amendment “does not yield to government intimidation.” \n\n“Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation. Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power,” she continued. “That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration’s desire to silence its critics.”","summary":"The agency added that any program \"motivated by partisan purposes\" would not qualify for a bona fide news interview exemption\n\n\nThe post FCC Says Talk Shows Must Adhere to Equal Opportunities Rule in Aftermath of Kimmel Scandal appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/business/fcc-talk-shows-equal-opportunities-rule-kimmel/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/carr.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 20:26:00","author":"Lucas Manfredi,Nexstar Media Group","authors":["Lucas Manfredi","Nexstar Media Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":394996998,"title":"US appeals court blocks lower court order limiting immigration agents’ use of force in Minnesota","text":"A federal appeals court on Wednesday paused a lower court order that had restricted US immigration agents from using force against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, giving a temporary victory to the Trump administration as it escalates immigration enforcement in the state.The 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals froze an injunction issued last week by US District Judge Kate Menendez, who had barred federal agents from using tear gas and other crowd-control tactics against nonviolent demonstrators and legal observers while a lawsuit moves forward. Protesters in the Minneapolis area sued the administration in December, alleging their constitutional rights were violated during mass immigration operations.Government attorneys argued the restrictions impaired officers’ ability to protect themselves and the public during dangerous situations. The appeals court agreed to suspend the ruling while the administration pursues its appeal.Minnesota has become a central focus of the administration’s immigration crackdown under “Operation Metro Surge,” a Department of Homeland Security initiative launched in early December targeting the Twin Cities. Federal officials say more than 10,000 people living in the US illegally have been arrested statewide over the past year, including about 3,000 individuals described as serious offenders in the past six weeks alone. Immigration advocates dispute those figures, saying there is little transparency surrounding arrests.Protests intensified following the January 7 killing of 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal officials said the agent acted in self-defence, alleging Good attempted to run him over with her SUV. However, that account has been challenged by eyewitnesses, journalists, local officials and Democratic lawmakers, who cite video footage suggesting she was trying to drive away when the agent fired.A political action committee founded by former Vice President Kamala Harris has urged donors to support Minnesota Gov.
