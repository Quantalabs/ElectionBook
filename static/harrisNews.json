And one person who has been front and center of a lot of it is JD Vance. Since 2016, the Republican has been providing laughter and confusion to the masses. When he isn’t writing memoirs about his s̶u̶b̶u̶r̶b̶a̶n̶ “hillbilly” upbringing, he’s making sensational U-turns regarding his allegiance to Donald Trump. He went from declaring he was a “never Trump Guy” to being announced as his running mate in the 2024 elections. Needless to say, this makes his bold statements about Trump all the more amusing. So here’s what you need to know about the “never Trump guy” remix that’s making waves all over TikTok. @casadimusic Replying to @cuntamphysics JD Vance – Never Trump Guy full version #jdvance #kamalaharris #donaldtrump #nevertrumpguy #viralsound ♬ original sound – CasaDi The sound The track begins with a woman asking: “So is this really who Donald Trump chose as his running mate?” Then, a second voice shouts to “drop the beat,” as a loop of Vance repeating he’s a “never Trump guy,” and “never liked him” takes hold: becoming an irresistably catchy earworm. So catchy, in fact, that the remix amassed 3.1 million views on TikTok. It also elicited a number of entertaining dance numbers across the app, including an “official” dance routine choreographed by Leigha VandenToorn At the time of writing, the sound has been used in 6,235 TikToks. @leighachrstine this is the official dance ♬ Never Trump Guy JD Vance House of Evo Remix – CasaDi Where’s it from? The woman from the start of the track is from a KamalaHQ TikTok from July 18. Team Kamala might not be responsible for the remix, and it’s not the offical Harris TikTok. But it’s fair to say the song wouldn’t have existed without the group. The TikTok then cuts to Vance during that infamous Charlie Ross interview, where he says:”I’m a never Trump guy. I never liked him.” “And I—but I noticed this willingness from people who think a lot like I do that, look, we told you so,” he added. “To all these white working-class voters, we told you so,” This TikTok and all its quips were mixed together by Carl “Casa Di” Dixon, a music producer from the House of Evo in Los Angeles. You might recognise the team as being of “One Margarita” fame. So this isn’t their first brush with virility—and we doubt it’ll be the last. @amandala11 Drop the beat! ? #dance #foryou #foryoupage #dancechallenge ♬ Never Trump Guy JD Vance House of Evo Remix – CasaDi Sound off In an interview with Newsweek, Dixon said: “The catchiness of the vocal by JD Vance caught our attention.” “We knew that the contradicting nature of Vance talking about Trump, especially as his VP candidate would get a lot of reactions. We also like to highlight the weird and crazy nature of Trump’s campaign.” And the rest, as they say, is history. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

The states are seeking to block the rule from taking effect Nov. 1 and providing people known as “Dreamers” access to tax breaks when they sign up for coverage. The Affordable Care Act’s marketplace enrollment opens the same day, just four days ahead of the presidential election. The states filed suit in North Dakota, one of the states involved. All have Republican attorneys general who are part of a GOP effort to thwart Biden administration rules advancing Democratic policy goals. The lawsuit argues that the rule violates a 1996 welfare reform law and the ACA. They also said it would encourage more immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally, burdening the states and their public school systems. Many economists have concluded that immigrants provide a net economic benefit, and immigration appears to have fueled job growth after the COVID-19 pandemic that prevented a recession. The lawsuit comes amid Republican attacks on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, as weak on curbing illegal immigration. Border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration but have dropped more recently. “Illegal aliens shouldn’t get a free pass into our country,” Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach said in a statement. “They shouldn’t receive taxpayer benefits when they arrive, and the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t get a free pass to violate federal law.” Kobach is an immigration hardliner who began building a national profile two decades ago by urging tough restrictions on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and he helped draft Arizona’s “show your papers” law in 2010. Besides Kansas and North Dakota, the other states involved in the lawsuit are Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials did not immediately respond Thursday to an email seeking comment about the lawsuit. But Biden said in May in outlining the rule that he was “committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed.” The Biden administration is shielding them from deportation. The “Dreamers” and their advocates have said they’re young people who had little or no choice in coming to the U.S. and years later are fully integrated into their communities. At least 25 states, including Kansas, Nebraska and Virginia, allow them to pay the lower tuition rates reserved for their residents, according to the National Immigration Law Center. In May, Biden said: “I’m proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country.” The “Dreamers” have been ineligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs because they did not meet the definition of having a “lawful presence” in the U.S. The states filing the lawsuit said declaring their lawful presence by rule is “illogical on its face,” given that they’d face deportation without Biden administration intervention. “Subsidized health insurance through the ACA is a valuable public benefit that encourages unlawfully present alien beneficiaries to remain in the United States,” the lawsuit said. In past lawsuits against the Biden administration, states have sometimes struggled to persuade judges that the harm they face from a new rule is direct, concrete and specific enough to give them the right to sue. Of the 15 states involved in the lawsuit, only Idaho and Virginia run their own health insurance marketplaces instead of relying on a federal one. But the states argue that they all face higher costs from increased illegal immigration. They rely on a 2023 report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which not only argues for stronger laws against illegal immigration but sharp curbs on legal immigration.","summary":"TOPEKA, Kansas (AP) — Fifteen states filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the Biden administration over a rule that is expected to allow 100,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to enroll next year in the federal...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/15-states-sue-to-block-biden-s-effort-to-help-migrants-in-us-illegally-get-health-coverage-273210.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24221811447806.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 00:00:06","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":253711074,"title":"Here’s Why Taylor Swift Fans Think She Just Subtly Endorsed Kamala Harris for President","text":"Taylor Swift, known for her chart-topping hits and passionate fanbase, has once again sent the internet into a frenzy. This time, it’s not about a new song or album, but rather a possible subtle endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The buzz started with a recent series of pictures Swift posted from her European tour. In an especially intriguing snap from her concert in Poland, eagle-eyed fans noticed a familiar shadow. The silhouette, flanking Swift on her right side as she stood in front of the iconic Lover house, bears a striking resemblance to Harris. The shadow is notably positioned in front of the blue room, adding another layer of symbolism to the speculation. Despite the shocking similarity, Swift has not officially endorsed Harris for the 2024 presidential campaign. However, her connection to Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, might provide some clues. Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, has previously exclaimed, \"Long story short, Taylor Swift has enchanted and inspired Minnesotans and people all over the world. Taylor Swift will forever & always be a positive influence, setting an example with her truthfulness, grace, creativity, and strength of character.\" As per Billboard, Swift’s fans were quick to jump on the potential political nod. Netizens were quick to cook up delusional stories as one user wrote, \"It really feels like it should be a bigger deal that Taylor Swift left a shadow of Kamala on her Instagram post but I don’t really see anyone talking about it.\" Another gushed, \"Taylor Swift casually dropped this photo to endorse Kamala Harris why is NO ONE talking about this #TaylorSwift #Kamala2024 #HarrisWalz2024.\" As per The Sun, this isn’t the first time Swift has dipped her toes into the political waters. During the 2020 election, she openly supported Joe Biden and Harris, highlighting the significance of electing leaders who prioritize safety, representation, and inclusivity. In an interview, she shared, \"The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included.\" She further added, \"Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first. The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them. I will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year’s presidential election. Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs.\" Back then, she also tweeted, \"I spoke with @vmagazine about why I’ll be voting for Joe Biden for president. So apt that it’s come out on the night of the VP debate. Gonna be watching and supporting @KamalaHarris by yelling at the TV a lot. And I also have custom cookies.\"","summary":"Swift said, &#34;The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/heres-why-taylor-swift-fans-think-she-just-subtly-endorsed-kamala-harris-for-president","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/709708/uploads/55fac060-5561-11ef-8cf8-d5f365db7b05_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 00:00:00","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.439},{"id":253711370,"title":"Venezuela's Maduro signs decree blocking X access for 10 days","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Sport court dismisses Canada's appeal in women's soccer case The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Canada's appeal of a six-point penalty against its Olympic women's soccer team.

The governor said that he particularly wanted more “urgency” from the leaders of Los Angeles County, home to nearly 10 million Californians, where unsheltered homelessness decreased last year at about half the rate as it did in the City of Los Angeles, its largest jurisdiction.“We need partners, not sparring partners,” Mr. Newsom said. “If we can’t move Los Angeles County, we’re not going to move the state.” These are strong statements that sound good on TV.

Bush where he held up a sign that read “Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran 4 Kerry” — referencing the US fight against terrorists in Afghanistan. The trouble is, in his 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard, Walz never deployed to combat zones in Afghanistan or Iraq. The closest he got was thousands of miles away in Italy. But it’s a label he used again and again — including in his official biography when he ran for Congress two years later in 2006. That photo shows just one way that Walz, Kamala Harris’ VP pick, has repeatedly exaggerated and embellished his military record. Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, accused the second-term governor of Minnesota of “stolen valor garbage.” At least one former member of Walz’s National Guard unit who was deployed to Iraq took a dim view of the haphazard way in which the VP candidate has spoken about his service. “It’s stolen valor,” said the former guardsman, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He used very specific phrases on his website that would suggest to a civilian that he had been to Afghanistan. He carried signs protesting at a rally for George W. Bush saying he was part of Operation Enduring Freedom, which would signal that he had seen combat in Afghanistan when he hadn’t.” The Harris-Walz campaign seemed to acknowledge the critics on Thursday when it scrubbed another contested claim about his service record from his official biography on its website — that Walz had retired as a command sergeant major. (In fact, Walz actually retired from the military with the rank of master sergeant because he hadn’t completed the required additional coursework, the military said.) That, too, was a claim he made repeatedly. A newly surfaced video from 2009 shows then-Congressman Walz delivering a televised farewell message to a group of soldiers deploying for Iraq in which he calls himself a “retired Command Sergeant Major.” While far from the worst elision, it demonstrates how the questions being asked are forcing the campaign to do some editorial damage control. Here is the latest on VP pick Tim Walz’s time in the military National Guard vet claims Walz went above him to secure retirement: ‘He knew I would have told him, “Suck it up”’ Tim Walz falsely claimed he carried weapons ‘in war’ in resurfaced clip: ‘Absolutely false’ Tim Walz left National Guard battalion ‘hanging,’ ‘slithered out the door’ before Iraq deployment: vets Tim Walz a ‘coward’ and ‘traitor’ for retiring from military before Iraq, says Guardsman who replaced VP pick The most egregious — which CNN’s own fact check labeled “absolutely false” — came during a 2018 campaign appearance when Walz was running for governor. While trying to burnish his pro-gun control bona fides before a small crowd at a campaign event, Walz said, “We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.” When pressed, Walz conceded later that year that he did not “carry weapons of war” in the field of battle. Iraq vet and former Republican congressman from Michigan Peter Meijer also criticized Walz’s choice of words, but stopped short of agreeing fully with Vance’s assessment that he was guilty of “stolen valor” — lying about military service or achievements to get ahead in civilian life. “I think Walz played fast and loose with his military bio to stay above water as his congressional district drifted right,” Meijer wrote in a thread on X addressing the accusations against Walz. “He let audiences paint in their minds a deceptive picture. It was shady, but not stolen valor.” Alex Plintsas, a decorated Iraq War army veteran and Atlantic Council fellow, called Walz’s choice of words about being a veteran of “Operation Enduring Freedom” “true but misleading” — indicating they deliberately lack context in an attempt to make people believe he fought in Afghanistan. “Why misleading? When you ask a fellow veteran where they deployed or if they offer first, it’s ‘Iraq,’ ‘Afghanistan,’ ‘Syria’ etc. No one says ‘Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran.’ That goes on the hats you wear to the VA for doctors appointments. I don’t make the rules,” he wrote on X. In 2009, David Thul, a National Guard veteran and constituent of Walz, marched the protest photo into his campaign office to confront a staffer about the “Operation Enduring Freedom” claim. “Is there any question in your mind what Enduring Freedom is?” the veteran asks in a viral video of the encounter. “No,” the staffer said. “Ok, so I guess most people, yourself included, associate Enduring Freedom with Afghanistan?” he pressed. “Right, I think his audience understands it encompasses a great deal,” the staffer offered. The veteran then asked, “My concern, other than this picture, is that the congressman’s website, his official biography, says simply that he [was a veteran] in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Without any other details, don’t you think it’s reasonable people might assume he served in Afghanistan?” The staffer muttered in reluctant response, “perhaps, I guess.” The vet than said the photograph “could get the congressman probably thrown in jail for a violation of the [2005] Stolen Valor Act,” which made it “a federal misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal.” In fact, Walz has also been criticized for putting in for retirement from the Minnesota National Guard before his unit deployed to Iraq for the first time in 2005. Two men in his unit — Sgt. Kyle Miller, 19, and Sgt. 1st Class David Berry, 37, — were killed by IEDs. The Harris campaign and its supporters downplay these discrepancies as nitpicky, but Meijer said he believes, “it’s fair to hold him to a higher standard as a senior noncommissioned officer,” given Walz’ high-ranking status at the National Guard. “[It’s] equivalent of Lieutenant-Colonel, that’s a position of great responsibility. That’s a senior position, and there are more expectations of the conduct within the service from somebody in that position,” he said. The Harris campaign had no comment.","summary":"Kamala Harris' VP pick has repeatedly exaggerated his military record.

So The Post spoke to rally-goers there to find out why they’re turning out for the newly-minted Democrat ticket. What’s moving Wisconsin Democratic voters this cycle? The answers are: fear of Project 2025 policies, protecting abortion access, and a desire for bipartisanship, The Post learned. Dave Jacoby, a 65-year-old from Trego, told The Post he’s supporting Harris-Walz for what he sees as common sense policies and civil politics. “I think their policies make a lot of sense. We’re tired of the hate that’s been sown by the Republican Party. And we’re here for common sense.” Born and raised in Minnesota before settling in Wisconsin, Jacoby said he’s been following Walz’ career for quite some time — and he’s impressed. “The country’s going to fall in love with Tim Walz. He’s a hunter like I am. And I’ll say, ‘Gun owners for Harris. Hunters for Harris/Walz. White guys for Harris.’ We’re not all Republicans out here but we’re really concerned about a lot of issues,” he said. Jacoby also said he’s concerned about Project 2025, a laundry list of policy proposals from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which President Trump has rejected. “That Project 2025 is horrible. It doesn’t work for anybody but a small minority of billionaires who want to control our politics… The rich and corporations need to pay their fair share and get over it,” he said. Ellen Lipinski, 75, of Thorpe is also concerned about Project 2025 — and democracy. “I just really want democracy to survive and I’ve been reading about Project 2025 since January and it makes me sick,” Lipinski told The Post. “I just want our country to become unified and not have people who are bullies, and can be good examples for our children. And I want common sense. And I think Walz and Harris can bring common sense and bipartisanship back.” Madison native Cheryl Duerst, 68, told The Post she’s excited to head to the polls this November to vote in favor of policies benefiting women. “I really am very sensitive about women’s issues. I feel like there’s an attempt to diminish our rights and curb our influence in the government. And that’s one of the things that I really am focusing on,” Duerst said. 20-year-old Elaina Plonis is a Michigan native attending college in Eau Claire. She told The Post that she was looking forward to seeing Washington, DC affect real change. “I think the last couple of presidencies, just in general, there hasn’t been that much changed,” added Plonis, a Michigan native. “Some not so great things have been happening, in terms of policy change and overturning Roe v. Wade, so I really hope we’ll see some real changes moving forward.” Polling released by Marquette University Wednesday shows a virtually tied race in Wisconsin, where 50% of registered voters back former President Trump and 49% support Harris in a head-to-head race. Among likely voters, those numbers flip, with 50% backing Harris compared to 49% for Trump.","summary":"\"I really am very sensitive about women’s issues.

She talked to the media on the tarmac at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport after a campaign event in Michigan and after former President Trump held a lengthy news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Thursday afternoon. Harris responded to criticism about not doing a formal press conference or a wide-ranging interview since she became the presumptive nominee. \"I've talked to my team. I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month,\" Harris said. 18 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS NOT HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE The vice president also touched on an agreement with Trump to conduct three presidential debates prior to Election Day Nov. 5. \"Well, I'm glad that he's finally agreed to a debate on Sept. 10,\" she said, adding she would be willing to schedule additional debates with the former president. The pair agreed to three debates next month hosted by Fox News, NBC and ABC. JD VANCE ROASTS HARRIS ON WISCONSIN TARMAC FOR AVOIDING PRESS, CALLS AIR FORCE 2 HIS 'FUTURE PLANE' Trump previously indicated he may back out of the ABC debate, which was scheduled before Harris replaced President Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate nearly three weeks ago. \"I am beyond trying to speculate about how he thinks,\" Harris said when asked about Trump backing out of the debate. Harris also addressed Republicans who questioned Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military record after she named him her running mate Tuesday. \"Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country,\" she said. \"And I think that we all should.\" The controversy came after Republicans accused Walz of engaging in \"stolen valor garbage\" with respect to his military credentials. Harris' stop at the tarmac came after Trump attacked the vice president for not taking on-the-record questions from reporters on the campaign trail since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. \"Kamala refuses to do interviews because her team realizes she is unable to answer questions, much like Biden was not able to answer questions, but for different reasons,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. She also failed to appear at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention in Chicago, where former President Trump made headlines last week for a question-and-answer session.

The charges range from state-level racketeering accusations in Georgia to violations of the Espionage Act related to his handling of classified documents found at his personal estate in Florida.Trump is also accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, and he made history in May by becoming the first former U.S. president to be criminally convicted in the Manhattan hush-money case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and claims the indictments are an attempt to \"interfere\" with his reelection campaign.In a post to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, Weissmann, a law professor at New York University and a former FBI general counsel, said that Trump's plethora of legal woes were likely adding pressure ahead of November, and warned that the stress would lead to a \"more violent\" version of Trump.\"GIVEN THE DISTINCT PROSPECT OF JAIL, TRUMP IS GOING TO GET UGLIER, MORE RACIST, MORE VIOLENT, MORE CRIMINAL,\" Weissmann wrote, who said he was writing in all caps in order to make his point \"emphatically.\"\"FOR HIM, IT IS NOW 'NO HOLDS BARRED' TIME,\" he added. \"THE MEDIA AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED TO BE ON ALERT!\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.It is unclear if Trump will face jail time for any of the charges against him. In his felony conviction in Manhattan, where he was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to a hush money payment to a porn star during the 2016 election, each charge is a class E felony, which under New York law carries as maximum prison sentence of four years. Trump is currently set to face sentencing in the case on September 18.Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek on Thursday that he expects Trump will be sentenced to probation in the hush money case, noting, \"Home confinement is unlikely during a presidential election, and incarceration with Secret Service protection is even less likely and a logistical nightmare.\"Rahamani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, added over email that it was also unlikely for Trump to face jail time for his classified documents case, where presiding Judge Aileen Cannon \"appears to be biased in Trump's favor.\" That case was dismissed by Cannon last month, and special counsel Jack Smith has appealed that decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"Bottom line is, it's far from certain or even likely that Trump will be jailed,\" Rahmani said.Jailed or not, other legal experts agree with Weissmann that Trump is likely to be on the \"offense\" in response to his pending cases.\"Donald Trump's strategy for his legal troubles—criminal and civil—has been that the best defense is an aggressive offense,\" said Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and elected state attorney. \"That approach has brought some victories, but it also has resulted in felony convictions and hundreds of millions of dollars of civil liability.\"McAuliffe noted over email that Trump wasn't just facing pressure inside the courtroom as well. In recent weeks, Vice President Kamala Harris has held the momentum in the 2024 race and closed the gap that Trump once enjoyed with President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\"Layered over all that is a changed presidential campaign,\" McAuliffe said. \"His [Trump's] position is demonstrably weaker than when Biden was the likely nominee. His lack of campaign momentum combine with his legal exposure to create a new kind of chaos—one he can't control.\"\"His history of counter-attack when he is being pushed back is predictable,\" he continued. \"What's changed is that his aggressiveness is starting to be viewed as weakness, not strength. That creates a perverse incentive for Trump to engage in even more extreme conduct to keep the public's attention.\"McAuliffe added that one recent example of Trump attempting to re-engage attention on his campaign was his attacks against Harris' racial background during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week.\"Trump's almost inexplicable attack about Harris's multiracial background is an example of an all words, no thought move,\" McAuliffe said. \"And the country should worry about not just more vitriolic actions by Trump, but similar extremist conduct by his most committed loyalists.\"","summary":"Attorney Andrew Weissmann said that the former president is under pressure from his pending legal battles while also running for reelection.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analyst-warns-donald-trump-violent-1936786","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2446374/legal-analyst-warns-trump-getting-more-violent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:45:08","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":253710190,"title":"‘Generation Jones’ theory shakes things up in Baby Boomer world — here’s how to find out which group you belong to    ","text":"Okay, Boomer — are you keeping up with the Joneses? A new generation has landed — but they weren’t born yesterday. That’s according to a resurfaced theory from the 1990s suggesting that Baby Boomers, said to have been born between 1946 and 1964, would be better off broken down into two groups. Cultural critic Jonathan Pontell suggested back in 1999 that the younger members of the cohort, the ones born between 1954 and 1965, are different enough from their older peers to deserve their own title. Pontell, himself a proud member of this possible microgeneration, suggested Generation Jones as a label — referencing both the idea of “keeping up with the Joneses,” as well as the slang term “jonesing,” popularized by the generation, meaning craving more. Joneses, for instance, are said to be too young to have been drafted into war — unlike their older peers. That would be one striking example of the cavernous differences within the 18-year birthdate span, the longest of any generation since. Gen X is said to span 15 years (1965-1980), Millennials 14 years (1981-1996), Gen Z 15 years (1997-2012) and Gen Alpha 14 years (2010-2024). “It comes down to identity. Fact is, most Jonesers simply don’t feel like Boomers,” generational trends expert Daniel Levine recently told Newsweek, noting that those born on either end of the range would have “very different experiences.” “I continuously see that people in this generation who become aware of it are attracted to the concept and feel like it fits quite nicely,” he added. While those born between 1946 and 1965 were in fact part of the same population spike that came after World War II, the pivotal events that occurred during their lifetime have impacted them in unique ways. “The first half were in their teens and twenties during the Summer of Love. Whereas Jonesers came of age during Watergate, and they relate to music of the 80s more than the 70s,” Levine explained. “Boomers were active in the protests of the 60s, but by the time Jonesers went to college, protests had died out.” Experts suggest that Generation Jones possesses both the idealism of Baby Boomers and the pragmatism of Gen X. “What makes us Jonesers also makes us uniquely positioned to bring about a new era in international affairs,” Pontell wrote in Politico in 2009 shortly after Barack Obama — the first president of Generation Jones — was elected. (Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, born in 1964, would be second.) “Our practical idealism was created by witnessing the often unrealistic idealism of the 1960s. And we weren’t engaged in that era’s ideological battles; we were children playing with toys while Boomers argued over issues. Our non-ideological pragmatism allows us to resolve intra-Boomer skirmishes and to bridge that volatile Boomer-GenXer divide. We can lead,” he said. And they’re not alone in wanting to distinguish themselves. According to a poll by YouGov, about 27% of people don’t identify with their generation and 15% said they aren’t even sure which one they technically fall into, Newsweek reported. Despite the many nuances within Baby Boomer culture, 86% claimed to match the official definition of their generation. That’s in stark contrast to Gen Z, where a whopping 45% said they felt misrepresented by the title. Which could explain the rise of the term Zillennials, a popular term for anyone born between 1992 and 1998.","summary":"Are you keeping up with the Joneses?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/lifestyle/generation-jones-said-to-be-more-accurate-title-for-some-boomers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87359838.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:44:36","author":"Adriana Diaz","authors":["Adriana Diaz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":253710240,"title":"Texas Gov. Abbott instructs hospitals to collect patients' immigration data","text":"Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered hospitals in the Lone Star State to ask patients about their immigration status in order to ascertain the costs of providing medical care to people living in the U.S. illegally.Through an executive order, Abbott directed Texas hospitals to compile data on inpatient discharges and emergency visits by immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization, as well as on the costs of providing medical services to this population.Abbott instructed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to require hospitals to start collecting the information on Nov. 1 and to provide regular reports to state authorities.To justify the move, Abbott cited the record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, claiming that Texas was shouldering the economic burden of providing medical services to migrants entering the country illegally.\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott said in a statement.Abbott's directive said hospitals should tell patients the new information collection \"will not affect patient care.\" He noted in his order that federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency treatment to any individual, irrespective of their immigration status.Still, Abbott's order is likely to be decried by immigration rights advocates, who have said similar policies have had a chilling effect on immigrants, discouraging them from accessing medical care out of fear of legal repercussions.In his order, Abbott suggested Texas would seek to get the federal government to reimburse the state for these expenses, though it is unclear how, or if, that would happen.Thursday's action by Texas is the latest example of Republican-led states enacting stricter immigration laws and measures. Last year, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a harsh immigration state law that, among other things, requires hospitals to collect information on patients' immigration status.Led by Texas, several red states have also passed laws that seek to criminalize unauthorized immigration at the state level and empower state officials to prosecute suspected violators. Those state laws have been challenged in federal court by the Justice Department, which has noted that immigration policy has long been the responsibility of the federal government.At Abbott's direction, Texas has mounted an aggressive political and legal challenge to the Biden administration on immigration. The state, for example, has filed lawsuits against virtually every major immigration action by President Biden. Abbott has also ordered state officials to bus tens of thousands of migrants to Democratic-led cities, tasked the state National Guard with fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and instructed state troopers to arrest migrants on trespassing charges.","summary":"Texas Gov.

The former president said the ‘honeymoon period’ will soon end as he lamented that the media refuses to acknowledge the impressiveness of his audience sizes. ‘Oh, give me a break,’ Trump exhaled during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday before thanking the reporter for giving him a chance to tout how many supporters go to his rallies. He insisted that there are up to 30 times more people at his campaign stops than at those for the vice president and if he garnered her crowds people would say his campaign is ‘over.’ The press conference comes as the Trump team continues to hit Harris for her refusal to speak with the media since entering the presidential race last month. In the 18 days after announcing, Harris has not taken a single question from the media, sat down for a single interview or held a single press conference – leading to questions on how she will perform off script. Meanwhile, Trump thinks media outlets are trying to turn Harris into a media darling and has deployed his vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance to go after her for refusing to speak with reporters. ‘Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey, you didn’t report it. I’m so glad you asked, what does she have in your city? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2000 people, you’d say my campaign is finished,’ ‘It’s dishonest – the press,’ Trump alleged. ‘And here’s a great example. I had in Michigan recently, 25,000 people and 25,000 people we just couldn’t get them in. We had in Harrisburg, 20–25,000 people, and 20,000 people couldn’t get in. We had so many – nobody ever mentions that.’ ‘And when she gets 1,500 people – and I saw it yesterday on ABC, they say, ‘oh the crowd was so big’ – I have 10 times 20 times, 30 times the crowd size,’ Trump said. ‘And they never say the crowd was big. That’s why I’m always saying, turn around the cameras.’ ‘I’m so glad you asked that.’ But Trump says the biggest crowd he ever spoke to was those gathered in Washington, D.C. on January 6 to hear him speak during certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The former president claimed his crowd was as big as those attracted by Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. – but said he was fine if people said the assassinated leader had more than him because he respects him. ‘The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to was that day, and I’ll tell you, it’s very hard to tell. It’s the biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to and I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody spoke to crowds bigger than to me,’ Trump told reporters at his Florida golf club. ‘When we look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more,’ he said. ‘And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.’ ‘My crowd, we actually had more people,’ he continued. ‘They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I’m okay with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.’ Earlier on Thursday morning, Trump posted on his Truth Social account that Harris ‘pays’ for people to show up at her campaign events.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump shot back an agitated response when asked if he is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump denies being concerned about the size of Kamala&#8217;s crowds and argues that he attracts crowds similar in size to MLK. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-denies-being-concerned-about-the-size-of-kamalas-crowds-and-argues-that-he-attracts-crowds-similar-in-size-to-mlk/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/08/21/88325633-0-image-m-12_1723147281216.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:41:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":253710172,"title":"The dubious GOP attacks on Tim Walz’s military record, briefly explained","text":"In a bid to undercut Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record. The charges, which a closer look suggests are misleading or exaggerated, are a notable escalation against the Democratic ticket by the Trump campaign. The attacks began in earnest on August 7, when Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, President Donald Trump’s running mate, sought to tout his own military experience compared to Walz’s. Prior to running for Congress, Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, while Vance served for four years in the Marine Corps. Neither has seen combat. “When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service,” Vance said. “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.” But Vance’s sweeping statement contains some key omissions. For instance, Walz retired in 2005, two months before his unit received formal notice it would be sent to Iraq. Another Republican attack on Walz’s service — that he misrepresented himself as a retired command sergeant major — is also more complicated: While he held that rank at one point, his rank was changed after retirement because he did not complete the required coursework. Yet another claim by Republicans is that Walz misrepresented his service by implying in a past statement that he once served in a combat zone. In that case, the language he used appears to have been imprecise. There is precedent for these types of attacks: Republicans appear to be resorting to the same “swift-boating” tactics that they once levied against former Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. A reference to the small speedboats used in the Vietnam War where Kerry served, the campaign sought to impugn his character by casting doubt on his account of military service in Vietnam. Notably, the architect of that campaign against Kerry was Chris LaCivita — now a prominent staffer on former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. Walz has faced questions about his military service before, including when he ran for Minnesota governor in 2018. And in that instance — and this one — he’s had several veterans defend him as well. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the National Guard, told the Minnesota Star Tribune in 2022, “He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.” The Harris campaign for its part has responded by stressing Walz’s tenure and policy record. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. The campaign also pointed to Walz’s time as a ranking member on the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his support for funding and mental health resources for the military. The claims, and the information we know, briefly explained The claims that Republicans have made about Walz focus on three issues: his decision to retire from the Army National Guard in 2005, his rank upon retirement, and a comment he made about carrying weapons “in war.” Here’s what we know about each of them. Claim 1: Walz retired from the Army National Guard to avoid serving in Iraq. What we know: Notably, Walz retired in May 2005, two months prior to his unit receiving an official deployment order to Iraq. He stated in 2009 that his reasons for retiring were to pursue a run for the House of Representatives, which he won the following year, and to avoid conflicts under the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. Walz filed for his run for office before the National Guard had notified his unit of the possibility of a deployment to Iraq. It’s unclear if, at the time, he already knew that a deployment could be a possibility. Below is a more detailed timeline of how this all unfolded. February 10, 2005: Walz files paperwork with the Federal Election Commission declaring his candidacy for the House seat in Minnesota’s First Congressional District. March 17, 2005: The National Guard informs members of the possibility of deployment to Iraq within the next two years. The public affairs office notes that 2,000 members could be sent from the Minnesota National Guard, which could include part of, or the entirety of, Walz’s battalion. March 20, 2005: Walz issues a statement responding to the National Guard notice, saying he intends to continue to serve, and to continue his run for Congress. “I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” he said. “As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.” May 16, 2005: Walz retires from the National Guard, according to a comment the Minnesota Army National Guard provided CBS News. July 14, 2005: Walz’s battalion receives an alert order for mobilization to Iraq. March 2006: Walz’s unit is deployed to Iraq. Claim 2: The Harris-Walz campaign misrepresented his title by stating that he’s a “retired Command Sergeant Major.” On the Harris campaign website and a Minnesota government website, Walz had been listed as a “retired Command Sergeant Major,” according to CBS News. Republicans have argued that this is an inaccurate description of his title. That phrase has now been changed on the Harris campaign website to note that this title was the highest rank he earned. What we know: Walz did, in fact, attain the position of Command Sergeant Major. However, after he retired, his title was changed to Master Sergeant, because he did not finish the coursework required to retire under the promoted title. As a result, it’s accurate to say that he was once a Command Sergeant Major, but not that he was a “retired Command Sergeant Major.” Claim 3: Walz misrepresented his involvement in combat in a speech about gun control. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in remarks about an assault weapons ban in 2018. [Media: https://twitter.com/KamalaHQ/status/1820918063966962143] Vance argues that Walz’s statements imply that he was in combat when he wasn’t. What we know: Walz was deployed as part of the National Guard to Vicenza, Italy, in August 2003 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom but was not in a combat zone. The phrasing of the statement in his gun control remarks, suggesting that he carried the weapons “in war,” was imprecise. While technically correct given the operation he was part of, it appears to suggest an experience he didn’t have. Walz has openly acknowledged in other interviews that he hadn’t seen combat while deployed. The Harris campaign has stressed Walz’s training with firearms in response. “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.”","summary":"In a bid to undercut Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record.

Battleground state polls are showing similar results, with Harris cutting into Trump’s lead by anywhere from two to five points.” The site also found that the projected election results were within the margin of error in the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If the Harris-Walz campaign were able to win the states, it would build on the unlikely success of the Biden campaign, which flipped Arizona and Georgia in 2020. Other election monitors have shown similar results in recent days. The RealClearPolitics poll average has Harris over Trump by less than one percent, while the 538 poll aggregate has Harris leading by more than two percent. On Thursday, Donald Trump held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, seen as an attempt to recapture some of the spotlight from a surging Democratic side that’s seemed to have all the attention since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the ticket.

This issue specifically relates to the property easement through Golden Eagle Estates, which was designated as a public easement when it was built. This change imposes an unnecessary burden on visitors from neighboring communities and could deter many from enjoying this public space. This is a popular trail entrance as it provides easier access to the main trail for mountain biking and for those who may not be able to hike up the steeper areas at other entrances. While I understand the need for maintaining the park, it’s important to note that other access points to Pleasanton Ridge Regional Park do not require payment. The Pleasanton Ridge should remain accessible to all, regardless of residency. These new fees create an economic barrier, disproportionately affecting those with limited financial means. I urge the authorities to reconsider this decision and seek alternative solutions that promote inclusivity and equitable access to our natural landscapes. Greg Nagy San Ramon Harris book puts race question to rest Per the author, Kamala Harris, on Page 11 of the 2019 paperback version of her book, “The Truths We Hold”: “My mother, grandparents, aunts and uncle instilled in Maya and me pride in our South Asian roots. … But my mother also understood that she was raising two Black daughters.” May this settle any confusion on this subject. Ignorance is bliss. George Fulmore Emeryville Mourning terror leaders hurts cause for peace The grief shown by the citizens of Iran for the targeted assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders raises questions. These were targeted strikes on leaders of terrorist organizations. These leaders reportedly masterminded the wholesale slaughter of children playing soccer and the Oct. 7 slaughter of families and music concert attendees. They took hostages to bargain with. Yet, these “leaders” are mourned in Iran and the West Bank by thousands. Israel has been trying to make peace since 1948. The peace efforts have been met with numerous invasions and terrorist attacks that target schools, shopping districts and soccer fields. Israelis are expected to conduct themselves with reactions that the world deems moral. Meanwhile, Hezbollah and Hamas are taking hostages, raping, torturing and killing children playing soccer. The world they want is not a world for the civilized or of peace. Norm Weiss Orinda Questioning years of research in bad faith Re: “Deep-sea mining could lead to greener future” (Page A9, Aug. 4). How typical. After a decade of study, scientists draw tentative conclusions, and prime for additional study. Meanwhile, those whose greed drives them to strip mine every corner of the Earth, quickly hire their own employee to post a “rebuttal” to the scientists’ work. They will claim that every sample the scientists had was “contaminated.” Really? Over ten years? Every sample? Contaminated by what? Were they there? Media then presents us with two different potentials: one based on years of laboratory study, and another cobbled together from lies.

The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before. Here’s a look at some of those claims. ___ CROWD SIZES CLAIM: “The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken — I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.” THE FACTS: Trump was comparing the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd that attended Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But far more people are estimated to have been at the former than the latter. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Moreover, Trump and King did not speak in the same location. King spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which looks east toward the Washington Monument. Trump spoke at the Ellipse, a grassy area just south of the White House. ___ JAN. 6 CLAIM: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” THE FACTS: That’s false. Five people died in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and its immediate aftermath. Pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol that day amid Congress’ effort to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Among the deceased are Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter shot and killed by police, and Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died the day after battling the mob. Four additional officers who responded to the riot killed themselves in the following weeks and months. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego, was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot. Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who attended a rally outside the White House that day and then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police. ___ DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION CLAIM: “The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan, but I tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away.” THE FACTS: There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents the Democratic Party from making Vice President Kamala Harris its nominee. That process is determined by the Democratic National Committee. Harris officially claimed the nomination Monday following a five-day online voting process, receiving 4,563 delegate votes out of 4,615 cast, or about 99% of participating delegates. A total of 52 delegates in 18 states cast their votes for “present,” the only other option on the ballot. The vice president was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by the party’s deadline following President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race on July 21. ___ THE ECONOMY CLAIM: Suggesting things would be different if he had been in office rather than Biden: “You wouldn’t have had inflation. You wouldn’t have had any inflation because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems. Now they’ve gone back to the Trump thing because they need the votes. They’re drilling now because they had to go back because gasoline was going up to 7, 8, 9 dollars a barrel.” THE FACTS: There would have been at least some inflation if Trump had been reelected in 2020 because many of the factors causing inflation were outside a president’s control. Prices spiked in 2021 after cooped-up Americans ramped up their spending on goods such as exercise bikes and home office furniture, overwhelming disrupted supply chains. U.S. auto companies, for example, couldn’t get enough semiconductors and had to sharply reduce production, causing new and used car prices to shoot higher. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March 2022 also sent gas and food prices soaring around the world, as Ukraine’s wheat exports were disrupted and many nations boycotted Russian oil and gas. Still, under Biden, U.S. oil production reached a worldwide record level earlier this year. Many economists, including some Democrats, say Biden’s $1.9 trillion financial support package, approved in March 2021, which provided a $1,400 stimulus check to most Americans, helped fuel inflation by ramping up demand. But it didn’t cause inflation all by itself. And Trump supported $2,000 stimulus checks in December 2020, rather than the $600 checks included in a package he signed into law in December 2020. Prices still spiked in countries with different policies than Biden’s, such as France, Germany and the U.K., though mostly because of the sharp increase in energy costs stemming from Russia’s invasion. ___ IMMIGRATION CLAIM: “Twenty million people came over the border during the Biden-Harris administration — 20 million people — and it could be very much higher than that. Nobody really knows.” THE FACTS: Trump’s 20 million figure is unsubstantiated at best, and he didn’t provide sources. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports 8.2 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through June 2024. That’s arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests. In addition, CBP says it stopped migrants 1.1 million times at official land crossings with Mexico from January 2021 through June 2024, largely under an online appointment system to claim asylum called CBP One. U.S. authorities also admitted nearly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under presidential authority if they had financial sponsors and arrived at an airport. All told, that’s nearly 8.7 million encounters. Again, the number of people is lower due to multiple encounters for some. There are an unknown number of people who eluded capture, known as “got-aways” in Border Patrol parlance. The Border Patrol estimates how many but doesn’t publish that number. ___ CLAIM: Vice President Kamala Harris “was the border czar 100% and all of a sudden for the last few weeks she’s not the border czar anymore.” THE FACTS: Harris was appointed to address “root causes” of migration in Central America. That migration manifests itself in illegal crossings to the U.S., but she was not assigned to the border. ___ NEW YORK CASES CLAIM: “The New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice.” THE FACTS: Trump was referring to two cases brought against him in New York — one civil and the other criminal. Neither has anything to do with the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil case was initiated by a lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Trump was ordered in February to pay a $454 million penalty for lying about his wealth for years as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a state-level prosecutor, brought the criminal case. In May, a jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. ___ Associated Press writers Melissa Goldin and Elliot Spagat and economics writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this article. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.

The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before. Here’s a look at some of those claims. ___ CROWD SIZES CLAIM: “The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken — I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.” THE FACTS: Trump was comparing the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd that attended Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But far more people are estimated to have been at the former than the latter. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Moreover, Trump and King did not speak in the same location. King spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which looks east toward the Washington Monument. Trump spoke at the Ellipse, a grassy area just south of the White House. ___ JAN. 6 CLAIM: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” THE FACTS: That’s false. Five people died in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and its immediate aftermath. Pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol that day amid Congress’ effort to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Among the deceased are Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter shot and killed by police, and Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died the day after battling the mob. Four additional officers who responded to the riot killed themselves in the following weeks and months. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego, was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot. Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who attended a rally outside the White House that day and then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police. ___ DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION CLAIM: “The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan, but I tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away.” THE FACTS: There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents the Democratic Party from making Vice President Kamala Harris its nominee.

We want to go back to when inflation was reliably low, and working-class wages were steadily rising — for minorities, at the fastest pace in generations. We want to go back to affordable mortgages and car loans. We want to go back to when gas was cheap and America was an energy exporter, not dependent on the monsters who run nations like Venezuela, Russia and Iran for fuel. We want to go back to when the border was under control, when our president wasn’t waving millions of economic migrants into the interior because of clearly bogus “asylum” claims, when terrorists couldn’t waltz through because the Border Patrol was too overwhelmed to catch an endless tide of “gotaways,” when cities like New York weren’t stuck paying for tens of thousands of public charges. We want to go back to a world that wasn’t aflame, with Vladimir Putin on the march in Ukraine and Iran’s proxies attacking Israel on all sides — when America’s allies knew we had their backs and its enemies knew to watch out. We want to return to a foreign policy that doesn’t enrich Tehran, or tell Moscow to take new US hostages whenever it wants some of its spies and arms dealers freed from Western prisons. We want to return to a government that doesn’t mandate noxious DEI racism in our classrooms, that doesn’t seek to force boys into girls’ high-school sports — and doesn’t sic the FBI on parents who speak out at local school-board meetings. We want to get back to leadership that doesn’t gaslight us nonstop, claiming our economic woes are “transitory” or just “rich people’s problems,” that a president in obvious, deep decline is “sharp as a tack,” that a porous border is somehow “under control.” We want leaders who won’t make taxpayers who never went to college (or paid off their loans) bail out students so they’ll vote for the party of giveaways. We want to go back to a government that works — that gives workers the chance to do better, companies the chance to grow, families the right raise their kids as they see fit. We want to undo all the “progress” of the Biden-Harris years, not keep digging the country even deeper into the hole at home and abroad. We can go back, and we must.","summary":"“We're not going back,” Kamala Harris tells her crowds, which chant, “We can’t go back” — yet most of us do want to go back.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/opinion/cant-go-back-kamala-heres-why-most-americans-do-want-to-go-back/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-w970szdvd-1723154510716.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723140168&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:28:08","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":253709080,"title":"Trump, Harris agree to Sept. 10 debate on ABC","text":"Former U.S. President Donald Trump and incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC, the network said on Thursday, reported Xinhua.

The 90-minute debate is expected to be held in Philadelphia, and the ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will serve as moderators, according to The New York Times.

The announcement followed a Trump news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, during which he proposed three debates with Harris. Trump had previously agreed to debate President Joe Biden on Sept. 10, but pulled out after Biden withdrew from the Democratic ticket. Trump also said that he would debate Harris on two other occasions, at events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. But the Harris campaign has not agreed to those debates, which were not part of the original debate schedule that Biden and Trump had agreed upon in May.

Earlier, Trump held a rare press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, where he expressed his eagerness to participate in multiple debates with Harris. “I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump stated. He also addressed his health, mentioning that he was “pretty much recovered” from a recent assassination attempt that left him with a wound to his ear.

The former president cited three separate debates with Harris by three different television networks, which prompted the Harris campaign to quickly send an email correcting Trump on the dates. \"I think they'll be very revealing,\" he said. A September 4 debate will be hosted by Fox, followed by an NBC debate on September 25 and then a September 10 debate hosted by ABC. The hosting networks, Trump says, are \"very anxious awaiting those dates.\" He said he spoke with network heads, adding that \"fairly minor details\" await -- such as city of location and audience rules and requests, which Trump said \"will be settled very easily.\" He also used the event to turn his invective on Harris. The vice president, Trump said, is \"a bad debater\" who is \"worse than Biden\" and \"not as smart\" as him. He said that, since Biden dropped his campaign for another four years in the Oval Office, \"I haven't recalibrated policy at all\" to better take on Harris. He went on to call Harris the \"worst admired, least respected, most unpopular vice president\" in American history. \"I'm very happy to run against her,\" he added, taking aim at Harris' newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling him part of the \"radical left.\" \"He doesn't want to have borders, he doesn't want to have walls,\" Trump claimed as he also briefly mentioned his own running mate. \"JD Vance has really stepped up,\" he says. \"He's doing a fantastic job.\" The ex-president also spoke at length about campaign crowd sizes in response to questions about a perceived lack of enthusiasm for the Republican ticket, which some say is evidenced by sparsely attended crowds at some Trump rally events. \"We have the enthusiasm; the Republican Party and me as a candidate, we have the enthusiasm,\" he responded. Trump also faced questions about his thin campaign event schedule. He is not making many campaign swings, Trump said, because he is \"winning by a lot\" despite recent contradictory polling that would suggest otherwise. He said he will step up his campaigning after the Democratic National Convention later this month. Tramp also said he is \"doing commercials to a level never done before\" at Mar-a-Lago and creating \"a lot of recording.\" The former president also said that abortion, which will be a top ballot concern this fall, is \"much less of an issue\" now, despite the overturning of abortion access protections formerly offered by Roe vs. Wade, something of which Trump takes credit. \"Democrats, Republicans, everybody,\" he said, wanted the federal issue to revert to the purview of state courts and state laws. \"I did that. Now states are voting\" on their own abortion polices, he said. Later on Thursday, former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham suggested in a social media post that the former president is \"panicking\" with his \"self-announced\" press conference, which prompted the Trump team to issue a response personally criticizing her.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday held a self-announced press conference in which he said he is looking forward to upcoming debates with Vice President Kamala Harris, now the official Democratic nominee.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/08/Donald-Trump-press-conference-Kamala-Harris-presidential-debates/8321723136079/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8321723136079/2024/upi/3eef8a4e99cccf24f2eeea485fda872f/v1.2/At-self-announced-press-event-Trump-says-hes-eager-for-debates-with-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:15:53","author":"Chris Benson","authors":["Chris Benson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":253708930,"title":"Tim Walz proudly turned Minnesota into a transgender haven — and a danger zone for kids","text":"As the rest of the world pumps the brakes on gender transition services for kids — with the UK and Sweden restricting puberty blockers — Minnesota is proudly hanging out a shingle as a haven for the medicalization of confused young people. Last April, Tim Walz — the Minnesota governor turned Democrat Veep hopeful — signed the so-called “trans refuge” bill, turning the Midwestern state into a legal sanctuary for children seeking “gender affirming care” like puberty blockers, cross sex hormones and surgery. The controversial bill was sponsored by trans Minnesota State Rep. Leigh Finke who, in a March 2024 speech at the United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities, talked about building a trans utopia for all ages in the Northstar State — using the progressive law to incentivize people to move there. (There are 25 states who have banned gender interventions for minors.) “If you promise trans refuge, then we need to increase the number of people who are offering gender affirming care because we already had a shortage. And now more people are coming … ,” Finke said. “If [you are a provider and] you live in Missouri and all your clients can no longer access care, well, if they are leaving you might also be interested in coming with your clients.” Notice these are clients to Finke, not patients. Just people swiping a credit card. Not kids altering their bodies. “We want to do internship programs and fellowship programs with Children’s Minnesota [Hospital] and other places where people can learn gender-affirming care,” Finke said — speaking about “gender-affirming care” like it’s a time-honored martial arts discipline or a type of massage. But it’s not some soft, cuddly therapy. It’s barbaric, experimental medicine being practiced, in the most extreme cases, on people who aren’t even old enough to get tattoos or legally drink. These are children who are genuinely in mental distress but likely suffering from a litany of comorbidities such as depression, anxiety or trauma, but have been led to believe that, if only they can change their gender, these issues will disappear. They should have mental health interventions and parental guidance — not to have their bodies pumped with puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, which wreak havoc on bone and cardiovascular health. This is Walz’s Minnesota nice. And this bill, critics charge, infringes on parental rights. Where does Walz’s running mate, Kamala Harris, stand on this? Since she has refused to speak about her policy stances or even list any on her campaign website, we can only revert to the policy of the Biden-Harris administration — which opposes legislative bans on youth gender transition and supports “gender-affirming care for minors, which represents a continuum of care.” One can only assume Walz’s blind support for child transition was a plus for Harris during the selection. From my experience reporting on this issue, it blurs partisan lines. A lot of resistance comes from voters who once considered themselves on the left, but it’s only politicians on the right challenging it. Earlier this month, Republican VP candidate J.D. Vance tweeted a clip of his interview on the “Full Send” podcast, writing, “I think it’s pretty weird for adults to sterilize little kids by giving them hormone therapy. I know Kamala Harris disagrees with me on this and considers it to be totally ‘normal.'” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left’s standard bearer of middle-school slam-book politics, chimed in — but not with any substance or defense of Harris. Instead, she commented on the photo of Vance sitting in a chair: “Why are you sitting like that?” She was suggesting he was manspreading. Unserious pols like AOC can continue to lob distractive attacks to avoid engaging on the actual substance of the matter. But they do so at their own peril. We’re seeing an increasing number of detransitioners coming forward with regrets — sharing their grim medical realities and filing lawsuits against the doctors and therapists who pushed them through this permanently damaging course. On Wednesday, the Free Press reported on Cristina Hineman, a detransitioner and the plaintiff in the first lawsuit against Planned Parenthood for medical malpractice. At 18, she sought testosterone from her New York State Planned Parenthood clinic, a process that, she claims, took less than 30 minutes. She took the hormones and had her healthy breasts removed — only to realize that she, like many other females who radicalized online, had made a grave mistake. There are about a dozen more lawsuits around the country, with more sure to come. We should agree that experimenting on kids is a fundamentally bad thing — but for Walz, it will be his legacy.","summary":"Gov.

As he has previously, Trump said the people who have been arrested as a result of storming the Capitol have been treated unfairly. Then, unprompted, he compared the “Stop the Steal” rally he had before the protesters marched towards the Capitol to King’s “I have a Dream” speech, which was held at the same location. Trump acknowledged that official estimates put his crowd size as smaller than King's, but he said he thought he had \"more people.\" “But when you look at the exact same picture and everything is the same — because it was the fountains, the whole thing all the way back to go from Lincoln to Washington — and you look at it, and you look at the picture of my crowd…we actually had more people,\" he said. The congressional Jan. 6 committee pegged Trump’s crowd at 53,000 people, about one-fifth of the 250,000 who were estimated to be at King’s famous address from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump advisers and supporters alike have urged him to focus on the record of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, rather than on her race, which he has explicitly done over the past week. That tendency to go off-message, like comparing himself to a civil rights icon, was again on full display Thursday during a wide-ranging hour-long press conference in which he said Harris has been “disrespectful” to Black and Indian-American voters by identifying as both. He again baselessly questioned whether Harris has always identified as Black, called her “barely competent” and attributed her surge in the polls to her gender. At the same time, Trump acknowledged that Harris’ presence at the top of the ticket might hurt him slightly with Black voters, a demographic his campaign has heavily focused on. “It changes around a little bit. I’m getting other voters,” Trump said of the Black vote from the ornate living room of his Mar-a-Lago club. “Perhaps you know, I was doing well with Black voters and I still am. I seem to be doing very well with Black males.” “It’s possible that I won’t do as well with Black women, but I do seem to do very well with other segments,” he added. Trump was quick to focus on the race of Harris, who has a Black father and an Indian mother, when it was clear she was going to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. That dynamic was highlighted last week by comments he made during an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists. At that event in Chicago, Trump baselessly suggested that Harris had only started identifying as Black because it was politically advantageous. Later that night at a rally in Pennsylvania, his campaign posted on the arena’s big screen a headline that called Harris the first “Indian American senator.” When asked why Harris is doing better in most public polling than Biden, Trump said she “represents certain groups of people” and said the bump can also be attributed, in part, to the fact that “she’s a woman.” “I see her going way down in polls now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed the state of California with Governor Gavin Newscum,” Trump said, giving a pejorative nickname to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Harris’ campaign responded to the press conference in a press release with the headline, “Donald Trump’s Very Good, Very Normal Press Conference.” “Split screen: Joy and Freedom vs. Whatever the Hell That Was,” read the release. The press conference came during a relatively quiet week for Trump, who is holding just one event in Montana — which is heavily Republican-leaning — and has found himself in the rare position of being overshadowed by Harris’ emergence. “What a stupid question,” Trump said glibly when asked about his lighter schedule. “This [is] because I am leading by a lot.” Trump went on to say that while he is holding fewer events ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month, his campaign is in heavy rotation with TV ads, and he is meeting with the press publicly, unlike Harris. “I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here. We have commercials that are at a level I dont think that anybody has ever done before,” he said. “I see many of you in the room where I’m speaking to you on phones. I’m speaking to the radio. I’m speaking to televisions. Television is coming here.” “Excuse me, what are we doing right now?” Trump added, referencing the press conference. “She is not doing any news conferences….she’s not smart enough to do a news conference.” Trump’s advisers have emphasized the importance of contrasting his record versus Harris, which they have routinely framed as outside of the mainstream, criticizing even supporters who sometimes deviate from their desired message. “Sometimes our allies don’t do us any favors, clarifying the differences,” a senior Trump advisor said. “So for us as a campaign, we have to make clear where each candidate stands on the issues that matter to the persuadable voters so they have the real information and we have to spend money across all of the means necessary to do that.” Asked whether Trump always helps himself by making those contracts clear in his messaging, the adviser dodged. “I won’t comment on that,” they said.","summary":"Donald Trump has long boasted about crowd sizes at his rallies, but on Thursday, he used an unexpected comparison: Martin Luther King Jr.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-compares-jan-6-crowd-audience-mlk-dream-speech-rcna165894","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-donald-trump-conference-wm-346p-d0e4de.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:11:04","author":"Jonathan Allen,Matt Dixon","authors":["Jonathan Allen","Matt Dixon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":253709864,"title":"House Republicans Pivot Scrutiny From Biden to Harris","text":"Good evening.

Preserve America, a pro-Trump super PAC, is releasing a new TV and digital spot in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as part of an eight-figure ad campaign running from the opening ceremony of the Olympics until Labor Day. The ad, titled “Damage,” features the testimony of Julie Ann Willoughby, an emergency room nurse and Republican State representative in Arizona, discussing the toll of the border crisis on the healthcare system. “I’ve seen firsthand the damage that Kamala Harris caused as our country’s borders czar,” Willoughby charges in the new ad, showing her wearing scrubs and appearing to be at a hospital. “Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and American patients are paying the price.” “My patients are covering the healthcare costs for people here illegally while their own care is jeopardized,” Willoughby says, looking straight into the camera. “Kamala Harris is weak and dangerous.” The ad, shared first with the Washington Examiner on Thursday, is the latest attack against Harris for her role in the administration’s handling of the U.S. southern border, which has seen unprecedented levels of migrants. The issue has been a major political liability for the Biden administration as Republicans have sought to use the border crisis as an example of President Joe Biden’s failures as president and now Harris’s after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee last month. Since Biden made his exit and endorsed Harris, the vice president has largely not mentioned the crisis on the southern border and her role in immigration policy, which is now in the spotlight. However, she has begun reflecting on her time prosecuting transnational gangs and drug traffickers as the attorney general of a border state during her rallies. “In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico,” Harris said during a rally in Atlanta last week. “I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.” Harris also continues to point to a border bipartisan compromise bill that Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and officials from the White House put together in February, which ultimately died under political pressure from Trump. “It was all set to pass, but at the last minute Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,” Harris said.

The president tried to project confidence in front of the 2,000 people gathered in the school's gym, insisting he was the only one who could beat Donald Trump and that he wasn't dropping out of the race. Less than four weeks later, Biden had been replaced as his party's candidate, and Michigan's biggest city was hosting a very different kind of campaign event. Beyonce's lyrics \"Who run the world? Girls\" blared from the speakers as the vice-president's plane, Air Force Two, pulled up in front of an airport hangar packed with 15,000 of Kamala Harris's supporters. \"We are doing this,\" she told the crowd as it chanted her name. \"The path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November.\" Harris is riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, officially clinching the party's nomination ahead of its national convention later this month and unveiling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. The pair are now speeding through a tour of the handful of closely fought states, including Michigan, where the election is likely to be won or lost. Opinion polls suggest the vice-president's elevation to the top of the ticket has made the contest against Trump more competitive. Some suggest Harris currently holds a narrow lead over the former president. But there are still three months to go until election day – and in a campaign that's already had more twists and turns than one of Simone Biles's gold-medal winning routines, major tests lie ahead. Recession risks and war threats hang over the campaign Harris might have reinvigorated Democrats who'd been uneasy with Biden, but she's still very much tied to his administration and its policy challenges. The economy and the rising cost of living were already huge issues for many voters, even before worse than expected jobs figures sparked fresh fears of a US recession. Trump seized on the biggest stock market sell off in nearly two years, labelling it a \"Kamala Krash\" and mocking the vice-president's previous support of her boss' \"Bidenomics\" plan. The markets have since rebounded, and opinion is divided over how serious the threat of a recession remains. But the economic nervousness creates further ammunition for Trump, and potential headaches for Harris. \"We cannot win if people think we're headed into a recession,\" a Democratic National Committee member was quoted as writing in an email to the Harris campaign. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East also creates major uncertainty, with tensions again spiking following the killings of senior figures within the Iranian-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. The White House has made a point of including the vice-president in Situation Room briefings, and on a recent call between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Harris has struck a somewhat different tone to the president on the war in Gaza so far, reaffirming US support for Israel but arguing she would \"not be silent\" on the suffering of Palestinians. In Detroit, she also met briefly with activists who'd encouraged Democrats to lodge protest votes against Biden in the party primaries over his handling of the conflict. However, Harris's campaign rejected suggestions she could be receptive to their demands for an Israeli arms embargo. And when pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted the vice-president's speech at the rally, she was quick to shut them down. \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,\" she told the protesters. \"Otherwise, I'm speaking.\" Debating debates and pressing for press conferences One of Trump's main lines of attack against Harris is that when she does speak publicly, it's mostly to deliver pre-prepared remarks. The vice-president has largely avoided taking questions from reporters since Biden withdrew from the race, leaving her campaign speeches and staged social media videos to do the talking. Harris is currently enjoying a stream of free publicity and there's risk involved in sitting down for interviews – especially when some of the most memorable moments of her vice-presidency up until recently were high-profile stumbles. But her reluctance to engage with the media has opened her up to criticism from Trump's campaign, with his running mate JD Vance approaching Air Force Two on the tarmac after their campaigns crossed over in Wisconsin. \"I just wanted to check out my future plane,\" he said. \"I also thought the press gaggle following her might get a little lonely.\" Trump also held a rare press conference of his own, arguing Harris wasn't \"smart enough\" to do the same. And he challenged his opponent to a total of three debates next month, on US networks Fox, ABC and NBC. Shortly afterwards it emerged that Harris's team had agreed to ABC's proposal, for September 10, which is when Trump and Biden had been scheduled to face off for the second time this year. Their first debate changed the course of the campaign, with the president's poor performance setting off the frenzy that eventually ended with his withdrawal. You can imagine how much scrutiny this next show stopper will attract. In case you missed it: A Central Park mystery solved by RFK Jr The reshaped race is likely bad news for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr, whose campaign was banking on support from Americans unhappy with both Biden and Trump. But dwindling poll numbers are not why the 70-year-old has once again made news. The man who'd already attracted headlines for having a worm in his brain, and for refuting claims he'd eaten a dog, has revealed he was behind a mystery that had confounded New Yorkers for years: How did a dead bear cub end up in Central Park? It turns out, according to his telling of the story, RFK Jr came across the carcass on the side of the road in upstate New York in 2014. He's said he decided it would be funny to dump it in the park along with an old bike, to make it look as though the animal had been killed by a cyclist. RFK Jr tried to get ahead of an article in the New Yorker, which would expose his involvement, by posting a video of himself recounting the story to the actor Roseanne Barr. As if the story wasn't bizarre enough, the reporter who'd originally covered it for New York Times, Tatiana Schlossberg, is the daughter of RFK's cousin – and current ambassador to Australia – Caroline Kennedy. But the final word belongs to the magazine article's author, Clare Malone, who included this anecdote about a photo showing the now-presidential candidate with his fingers inside the dead bear's mouth. \"When I asked Kennedy about the incident,\" she wrote, \"he said, 'Maybe that's where I got my brain worm.'\"","summary":"Kamala Harris is riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, and polls suggest the election has become more competitive.

It turns out now what they meant was that the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. In Minnesota we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make,” he prattled, referring to abortion. “We still believe in freedom,” Pat corrects. “We believe in the baby’s freedom too.” “Here's a person who's had five born-alives from failed abortions” that he allowed to “lay there and die,” Pat condemns, referring to Minnesota’s lack of born-alive protections. “And then they’re going to lecture us on freedom?” To hear more, watch the clip above.

Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, Trump said he accepted debate invitations from NBC News, ABC News and Fox News. ‘I think it’s very important to have debates,’ said the Republican nominee. The ABC News debate set to take place on September 10 had been a hot topic as Trump said he might not participate because the then-presumptive Democratic nominee switched from President Joe Biden to his second-in-charge, Harris. Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump announced the three debates during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday (Picture: Getty Images) Harris on Thursday wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ‘I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10. I look forward to it.’ Her campaign did not respond to Trump’s two other debate proposals. The Trump campaign said the debates will be hosted by Fox News on September 4, ABC News on September 10 and NBC News on September 25. ‘So we have those three dates and those networks, they’re very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates,’ Trump said. Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to one debate against ex-President Donald Trump but her campaign did not immediately remark on the other two dates (Picture: Getty Images) ‘We have spoken to the heads of the network and it’s all been confirmed.’ The 2024 race took a dramatic turn last month when Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris, who has been polling better than he did against Trump. Some surveys show a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris. Trump has predicted that Harris’ ‘honeymoon’ in the polls will soon end. Trump also doubled down on his controversial remark last week that Harris ‘happened to turn black’ from Indian when asked about it Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday (Picture: Getty Images) ‘You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it. I didn’t say it,’ he said. ‘You’ll have to ask her about that. But to me, it doesn’t matter. But to her from her standpoint, I think it’s very disrespectful to both really, whether it’s Indian or Black. I think it’s very disrespectful to both. To me, it doesn’t matter.’ The first debate of the 2024 cycle, between Trump and Biden, proved to be monumental as the latter’s disastrous performance led him to drop out of the race and created a new dynamic with only several months before Election Day.

Walz’s Midwestern “aw shucks” persona, they say, is a politically savvy maneuver to mask his true colors as a lefty progressive who won’t be afraid to go on the attack on behalf of Harris. Walz played well to the western Wisconsin crowd in his first rally in the critical swing state on Wednesday, joking, “Isn’t it nice to have a candidate who knows how to pronounce Eau Claire?” His Midwestern savvy was in full swing for the mostly middle-aged Wisconsin crowd, a notable shift from his speech in Philadelphia the night before. But his home state critics say he isn’t your typical “Minnesota Nice” guy. “Tim Walz is the embodiment of Minnesota passive-aggressive,” Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota Republican strategist told The Post. “He will smile to your face, then when you turn around he will stab you in the back and drag the blade down.” Samsundar lived in Minneapolis when it was engulfed in flames from the George Floyd riots. Walz waited days for the city to burn before calling out the National Guard, the Minnesota native said. “You could smell smoke everywhere from all the burning,” she said. “Reporters on newscasts at the time actually said, ‘Where’s the governor? Why isn’t he doing anything?’” Walz’s support for Minnesota’s sanctuary state bill and handling of illegal immigration is particularly troubling to Samsundar. “He got free driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. That’s what you need to vote!” she said, exasperated. Walz’s list of handouts for illegal immigrants includes state-funded health care and free college tuition. The Midwestern governor has a reputation for friendliness and charm that are useful distractions from his policies. “Yeah, he’s so friendly he’s welcoming all those illegals into our state,” Samsundar noted ironically. “He is ‘JD Vance’ liberal,” Samsundar concluded, comparing the two vice presidential picks. “[Walz] has a ‘folksy’ background with the story of growing up in rural America but at the heart of it he’s a true-blooded LA liberal.” Jen DeJournett is the president of Ballot Box Strategies in Minnesota, and she says Walz is the perfect package for Harris, with a veneer of Midwest nice but the heart of a California progressive. “Bring some popcorn to the debate with J.D. Vance,” DeJournett joked to The Post, predicting that the vice presidential debate would be much more interesting than the Trump-Harris matchup. “Walz likes to roll up his sleeves and fight back,” the small business owner said, with grudging appreciation. DeJournett is not convinced of Walz’s much-advertised electability, noting the millions in support his campaign received in 2022. His Republican opponent, by comparison, did not garner nearly as much outside support as Walz, who was the leader of the Democrat Party — known in Minnesota as the Democratic-Farm-Labor Party. “We don’t actually know about his electability,” DeJournett mused. Walz touts his background as a hunter, but one former Minnesota Republican state legislator warned: “Hunting and fishing have nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. He will take our guns.” The former legislator, who spoke with The Post anonymously, said Republicans fought the red flag and expanded background check laws for years before Walz and a Democratic legislature got the restrictions signed into law. Cal Brink, a retired Minnesota businessman told The Post that Walz is basically a cookie cutter Democrat who is just like Harris. Brink also said his policies “mirror California,” referring to Walz’s strict tail-pipe emissions standards and zero-emission vehicles mandate. “We’ve seen businesses shut down and move to other states,” Brink said, “You can’t be pro-business if your [policies] hurt profitability. You can’t pay employees more if you’re not being profitable.” Under Walz’s leadership Minnesota has become a high tax state for businesses, raising taxes even while the state benefited from a $17.6 billion surplus. Brink shared a warning for Republicans this election cycle, echoing his fellow Minnesotans: “He’s a good speaker, good debater. I wouldn’t take [him] lightly that’s for sure.”","summary":"Kamala Harris’ choice of Tim Walz as her running mate may have taken some by surprise, but not these Minnesotans who spoke with The Post in the days that followed his rise to the Democratic presidential ticket.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/fed-up-minnesotans-warn-tim-walz-uses-midwest-charm-to-drive-far-left-policies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-2gtosrjyc-1723157029490.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723142684&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:58:48","author":"Amy Sikma","authors":["Amy Sikma"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":253708464,"title":"Trump goes after Harris, Biden and Walz in speech","text":"Trump goes after Harris, Biden and Walz in speech Former President Donald Trump made his first public appearance Thursday since rival Kamala Harris picked her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

D. Vance are adapting in very different ways. First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Two Models of Attack Tim Walz introduced himself to the American public with a wide grin this week. On a rally stage in Philadelphia, he complimented Vice President Kamala Harris and the “joy” she brings to her work; praised his wife, Gwen, a longtime teacher; and talked lovingly about his kids. Then he went on the attack. “Violent crime was up under Donald Trump. That’s not even counting the crimes he committed,” Walz quipped. He accused J. D. Vance of trashing his own community in his book, Hillbilly Elegy, before throwing in a crude joke about the senator not wanting to get “off the couch” to debate him (a reference to a false claim that circulated on social media recently). Walz, the governor of Minnesota, has long projected the energy of a friendly Middle American dad. He was a high-school football coach; he wears a camo hat; he riffed with his teenage daughter at a state fair about whether turkey is vegetarian and posed with piglets. When Walz insulted Trump and Vance on Tuesday, that “midwestern nice” persona served him: Sandwiched between moments of good cheer, his blows sounded snappy but not cruel—like a normal guy telling you plainly what he thinks. Walz is just getting started on the campaign trail, but his approach so far is in sharp contrast to that of his opponent. In his public appearances, J. D. Vance has appeared almost solely in “battle mode,” so much so that he seems at times incapable of basic campaigning. Take his response yesterday to a softball question from a reporter (who prefaced the question noting that Vance is often criticized for being too serious and angry): “What makes you happy?” Instead of delivering one of many plausible responses—“my family,” “sports,” “movies,” even “Donald Trump’s vision for America” if he wanted to keep things campaign-focused—Vance snapped at the reporter, called the question bogus, and ranted about Harris. His attempts at appearing relatable have landed awkwardly: Answering another reporter’s question about why someone in Wisconsin should want to have a beer with him, his response quickly devolved into a critique of how the media “slanders” Trump, a guy who he says “likes normal people.” The whole thing came off as unnatural and, again, somewhat hostile to the questioner. Vance may appear so embattled because he is; he was met with a deluge of bad press after Trump announced him as the Republican VP pick, and he’s not seeing strong support from Trump’s allies or from Trump himself. A running mate who fights too hard can risk seeming unbefitting of the office—recall Sarah Palin’s over-the-top quips that drew attention away from John McCain’s campaign—and Vance may appear unserious to some voters if he keeps this up, Charles Holden, a historian at Saint Mary’s College of Maryland, told me. It doesn’t help that he’s now facing off against what Holden called Walz’s “happy warrior” strategy. Since at least the 1970s, the American vice-presidential candidate has been expected by strategists and party leaders to serve as an “attack dog” on the trail. The term was initially used critically, to describe an overly aggressive candidate, Holden explained. But by the ’80s, parties began to feel that having an attack dog on retainer was an asset—the running mate could go out and scrap with opponents, while the presidential candidate stayed above the fray. This dynamic was not brand-new: The historians I spoke with pointed to Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate, Richard Nixon, as an early case—he was known as the “hatchet man”—as well as Nixon’s own 1968 running mate, Spiro Agnew. By the ’90s, the “attack dog” label was so entrenched that some vice-presidential candidates, including Jack Kemp and Joe Lieberman, explicitly pushed against it. (Their tickets both lost; by 2008, both VP picks, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, were seen as ready to fight, Holden noted.) In the Trump era, this concept, like so much other conventional political wisdom, seems dated. Trump himself, of course, has shown no desire to stay above the fray; getting down in the mud with opponents is no longer the specific purview of the vice president. During the 2016 and 2020 elections, Mike Pence served as the “respectable” foil to Trump’s own attack-dog approach. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, went head-to-head with Trump at certain points during that race, her “basket of deplorables” comment being the most notable example. The political universe that Trump helped create presents both an opportunity and a risk for the Democratic ticket: Harris and Walz likely “have a certain amount of leeway” to “engage in discourse that maybe in the pre-Trump world” they would not have, Joel Goldstein, a historian of the vice presidency and professor emeritus at Saint Louis University School of Law, told me. Some level of disagreement and self-defense is fair game in an election, he argued (for that reason, he’s skeptical of overusing the “attack dog” trope). Still, going too far carries its own dangers—particularly for Harris, who may face more scrutiny for throwing harsh jabs as a Black woman than Walz would as a 60-year-old white man. In the first few weeks of this campaign, Harris has focused on policy attacks more than ad hominem insults. When Walz made his couch joke, she looked on with what seemed like a mixture of a wince and a laugh. But as Aaron Blake noted in The Washington Post today, her campaign’s social-media accounts amplified the couch line, so Harris is not distancing herself all that much. And her campaign sent out a press release today, responding to the claims Trump made in his press conference, that began: “Donald Trump took a break from taking a break to put on some pants and host a p̶r̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶f̶e̶r̶e̶n̶c̶e̶ public meltdown.” Vance’s and Walz’s approaches may morph depending on the extent to which Trump and Harris do their own dueling. But so far, they’re presenting two diverging models of the modern vice-presidential candidate. For now, the VP campaign looks like a contest between the happy warrior and the resentful fighter. Voters will decide which line of attack they prefer. Related: Today’s News Dispatches Explore all of our newsletters here.

Before examining that record, let’s note that until just recently, it was uncontroversial to label the vice president as the “border czar.” She was officially tasked by President Biden on March 24, 2021, “to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle . . . in stemming the movement of…migration to our southern border.” The Washington Post reported that Biden was “giving Harris the lead role on the overall border and regional issue,” while outlets like Axios even actually labeled her the “border czar.” Understanding, then, that Harris has long held responsibility for ending this self-inflicted crisis, Americans deserve answers on whether she followed through on her charge. The answer is a resounding no. On her watch, Customs and Border Protection has recorded approximately 10 million illegal immigrant encounters nationwide, and more than 8 million encounters at the Southwest border. Additionally, roughly 2 million known gotaways have evaded Border Patrol agents since fiscal year 2021. Encounters at official ports of entry have exploded, from just under 20,000 in January 2021 to more than 117,000 in June 2024. From fiscal year 2021 through mid-July 2024, the Border Patrol had recorded 52,058 arrests of illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds, compared to 21,936 between fiscal years 2017 to 2020. Apprehensions between ports of entry of individuals on the terrorist watchlist have increased from just 14 in the previous three-year period to 380 since fiscal year 2021. These numbers are not surprising considering Harris’ past anti-enforcement advocacy. In 2015, she declared, “An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal.” That’s a shocking statement from the then-state attorney general, who either did not know or did not care that illegally entering the country is a federal misdemeanor, and a felony for repeat offenders. Furthermore, the statement continues to define her approach to immigration enforcement. As a US senator, Harris advocated abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying “We need to probably think about starting from scratch.” She introduced legislation to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from ICE enforcement operations, and called the construction of new border wall system, a move supported by the overwhelming majority of Border Patrol agents, “just a stupid use of money.” But she has done her worst damage from her “border czar” position. Many of the policies Harris supported as a senator have been implemented on her watch, including cutting ICE beds, stopping border wall construction and ending Title 42, the Trump-era expulsion measure ordered during the COVID pandemic. On her watch, illegal crossings by those from Mexico and Northern Triangle countries currently exceed those seen during the Trump administration by an incredible 140%. After dismissing border visits as “grand gestures,” she has only made one highly scripted and sanitized trip to the Southwest border, in what a member of her own party called a “politically safe,” “check the box” tour. And just recently, we learned she has never spoken with current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens or his predecessor. Our border czar has repeatedly lied to Americans about the crisis. In September 2022, she falsely claimed on national television, “The border is secure. . . . We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.” That month, there were 272,338 encounters at our borders nationwide, the worst September in decades. She also viciously slandered mounted Border Patrol agents in Del Rio in furtherance of the fake “whipping” scandal. She has become a punchline to the cartels. In July 2021, after she warned would-be border crossers not to make the journey, more illegal aliens were apprehended at the Southwest border than any other month in decades — and millions more followed. According to former Border Patrol Chief and CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan, “Vice President Harris has overseen the worst, unmitigated border security crisis in our lifetime. Her performance has negatively impacted every aspect of our country’s safety and national security and can only be described as a complete failure.” That’s why the House, on a bipartisan vote, passed a resolution condemning the Biden-Harris administration’s open-borders policies, and Harris’ failure to do her job. We were told that her role was to find the “root causes” of the crisis. It turns out that to do so, all Harris had to do was look in the mirror: Her extreme open-borders policies are why Americans are suffering. Harris may want to be “unburdened by what has been,” to quote her favorite aphorism, but the families who have lost loved ones to fentanyl poisoning and illegal alien crime do not have that luxury. Don’t let the media change the subject. Harris has embraced and led on this administration’s failed border policies, and minimized the horrific consequences they have created. She owes the American people an explanation. And we should demand one. Rep. Mark E. Green, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, represents Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District.","summary":"Harris has long held responsibility for ending self-inflicted migrant crisis — Americans deserve answers on whether she followed through.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/opinion/border-czar-kamala-harris-unburdened-herself-of-responsibility-to-secure-the-country/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-3wuadij56-1723152460101.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723138099&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:45:46","author":"Mark E.

The former prosecutor has been endorsed by Joe Biden as the Democratic party's presidential candidate against Republican rival Donald Trump. However, sources are saying she's \"worried\" about being deceived by her once cheater husband. Daily Mail reported the potential First Gentleman's first marriage broke because he got his children's nanny pregnant. Now, Harris is afraid he might cheat her or have already cheated as a high-placed source revealed, \"You know what they say, 'once a cheater always a cheater.' Of course, Kamala is worrying, not just that he might do it again, but could he have already done it again?\" Emhoff, an American lawyer, was previously married to film producer Kerstin Mackin from 1992 to 2008 and has two children Cole and Ella. When the second gentleman was introduced in the public during his wife Harris' presidential campaign, a report surfaced he cheated on his ex-wife Mackin with the kids' blonde school teacher cum nanny Najen Naylor. After the allegations became public, Emhoff accepted the affair in a statement saying, \"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" as per CNN. Also, the attorney informed Harris about his infidelity before the VP got married to him and according to a close friend of the nanny, she [nanny] \"did not keep the child.\" Meanwhile, his marriage with Mackin ended years before he began dating Harris. In her statement, Emhoff's ex-wife said, \"Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids, [and] continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.\" They divorced in 2008. Despite knowing about Emhoff's cheating scandal, Harris was left \"unnerved\" and \"humiliated\" after she realized she'd be leading the Democratic party in the November elections after Biden dropped out of the race. An insider added, \"She's trying to focus on rebranding her image and this is the last thing she wanted right now. The Democrats' convention is just around the corner and the election is less than three months away, so any distraction has to be bad news.\" While the news was still under wraps, VP Harris and her team are worried it could negatively affect their campaign, \"Put bluntly it's not a good look and Harris and her team know it. News of the affair has dominated coverage of the candidate over the weekend and sparked panic in her camp.\" Although the damage has been done, the former prosecutor tried to distract Americans from the cheating coverage by announcing her running mate Tim Walz. However, according to some experts, Republicans could \"capitalize on [Emhoff's cheating scandal] as everyone knows Trump's history, and he wears it almost like a badge. But the Democrats claim they're above this,\" per Fox News.","summary":"Some experts think Doug Emhoff&#39;s cheating scandal news could help the Republican rival Donald Trump in the November elections.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-husband-dougs-past-cheating-scandal-has-left-her-worried-he-might-do-it-again","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/709758/uploads/86054c80-557a-11ef-986d-536606e82931_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":253709214,"title":"Pelosi has ‘never been that impressed’ with Biden’s political operation","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had a less-than-complimentary assessment of President Joe Biden’s political acumen as the Democratic Party moves on from his struggling reelection bid. Pelosi was widely rumored to have encouraged Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. Although the California Democrat has demurred over whether she directly talked to Biden about stepping aside, Pelosi told the New Yorker she did have concerns that the Democratic president didn’t have what it took to run a winning campaign. “I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,” she said during an episode of the New Yorker Radio Hour released Thursday. “They won the White House. Bravo,” Pelosi said. “But my concern was: This ain’t happening.” The former House speaker emphasized the word as she referenced Biden’s reelection campaign, which many Democrats warned was destined for failure. “I really wanted him to make a decision for a better campaign because they were not facing the fact of what was happening,” Pelosi reflected. After Biden withdrew his bid for a second term in the White House on July 21, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, and Pelosi followed suit the next day. The speaker emerita continued to insist she didn’t systematically gather Democratic support against the president while refusing to rule out direct communication with Biden over the state of his campaign. “I never called one person,” she claimed, adding that “any conversation I had, it was just going to be with him.” Pelosi’s comments came after she refused to tell reporters on Wednesday if she had directly told Biden he needed to drop out. “I won’t answer that question,” she said. The California Democrat also confirmed that she has yet to speak to Biden since he withdrew from the presidential race nearly three weeks ago.

Star Tribune August 8, 2024 at 10:43PM Mursal Jama votes in the presidential primary at Brian Coyle Center in Minneapolis on Tuesday, March 5, 2024. (Leila Navidi/Star Tribune) Minnesota’s August primary election is Tuesday, and voting is already underway. Under state law, early voting began 46 days before the primary, which will determine which candidates land on the state’s general election ballot in November. Already more than 85,000 Minnesotans have had their absentee ballots accepted by the Secretary of State’s office. “This is the opportunity for every voter in Minnesota to help determine who or what is on the menu,” Secretary of State Steve Simon said as early voting started, encouraging eligible voters to cast a ballot. Recent law changes allow Minnesotans with felony convictions who are no longer incarcerated to vote in the primary and all state elections, and voters can now opt to be placed on a permanent absentee voting list. Here’s what you need to know about the primary and how to cast your ballot. What is the primary election? Primary elections determine which candidates from each party will appear on the Nov. 5 general election ballot for federal, state and local offices. The presidential primary in Minnesota was held in March, but there might be more than one Republican running for Congress in your area, or several DFL candidates running for the state House. Only one from each party can be on your ballot in November. For voters in Minnesota’s Fifth Congressional District, there will be a DFL primary race that includes U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels. In Minnesota’s U.S. Senate race, there’s a Republican primary between endorsed GOP candidate and former NBA player Royce White and Joe Fraser, a businessman and former Navy intelligence officer. In nonpartisan races, the top vote-getters advance to November’s election. Can I vote in primary races for both major parties? No. Once you get your ballot, you can only vote for candidates from one political party. If you vote for candidates from more than one political party, your votes will not count. Each party has a separate column on the ballot. What about party registration and privacy? Minnesota does not have political party registration, and your party preference in the August primary is not made public. I want to vote early by mail. How do I request a mail-in ballot? You can apply for an absentee ballot on the Secretary of State’s website if you’re eligible to register and vote in Minnesota. To apply online, you must provide a valid email address and either your Minnesota-issued driver’s license number, a state ID card or the last four digits of your Social Security number. You can also print out a paper application and mail it to your local election office. I received my ballot in the mail. Now what? You can vote now, but a few extra steps are required when voting by mail. You’ll need a registered Minnesota voter or a notary to act as a witness as you complete your ballot and vote. That witness must then sign a signature envelope included with your absentee ballot and list that person’s address. Notaries need to write down their name and title and sign the signature envelope.

Tim Walz Elections Tim Walz’s military record, National Guard departure get new scrutiny How much time do I have to mail in my absentee ballot? You can mail in your ballot any time during the 46-day window before the election, as long as your ballot is received by 8 p.m. on Election Day, when polls close. Otherwise, it won’t be counted. Give your mail carrier a few days to get your ballot to your local election office. Can I drop off my mail-in ballot in person? You have up until 8 p.m. on Election Day to return your ballot to the office that sent it to you. Remember: do not go to your polling place to drop off your ballot — it must be returned to your local election office. What if I make a mistake on my ballot? If time allows, contact your local election office to ask for a new ballot. If there’s not enough time, the Secretary of State’s office recommends completely crossing out the name of the candidate you accidentally marked and then marking your ballot for the candidate you prefer. What if I voted early but want to change my vote? You can spoil your ballot and submit a new one through July 25. Each mail-in ballot has its own ID number that will be invalidated if you submit a new ballot, so you won’t be voting twice. Can I check to make sure my ballot made it to my local election office? The status of mail-in ballots can be tracked on the Secretary of State’s website. Can I vote early in person? Yes. You can cast an absentee ballot at your county elections office through Aug. 12. You can do this during the office’s normal business hours, and some might offer extended hours or additional locations for early voting. Offices will be open for extra hours closer to Election Day. You can find where you can cast your ballot early on the Secretary of State’s website. What if I’m not registered? You had until July 23 to register to vote ahead of the primary, but if you missed that deadline, you can provide proof of residence at an in-person voting location on Election Day. What about voting on Election Day? Polls are open on Aug. 13 from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. If you are in line before polls close you are still allowed to cast a ballot. You can use the Secretary of State’s poll finder to figure out your Election Day voting location. How can I get added to the automatic absentee ballot list? Starting June 1, Minnesota voters can sign up to be automatically sent an absentee ballot before every election. Eligible voters can choose to join the permanent absentee voter list by checking a box when registering to vote or updating their registration application online at the Secretary of State’s website.

Josh Shapiro (D-PA) ripped the bark off the tree in his speech at Temple University’s Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, where he told the crowd he “loved being their governor” and endorsed the Harris-Walz Democratic ticket, the Pennsylvania chief executive was in tiny Washington County, Pennsylvania. His venue was a training center highlighting the investments in vo-tech training included in the bipartisan budget he signed into law last month. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Shapiro said he wanted to speak from the heart during his Temple University speech, which was met with thunderous applause, and he did. “I gave that speech off the top of my head,” said a smiling Shapiro, who had no preparation and no need for a teleprompter to deliver his poignant and aspirational stemwinder. Shapiro said throughout the entire vetting process and press scrutiny while he was being considered by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate, he still showed up in the places many politicians don’t go. “Even throughout the whole process, I was still showing up at Shippensburg University and in Hollidaysburg talking about how we reform the pharmaceutical industry to help the people who are getting screwed over by big drug companies,” he said of visits to rural counties in the middle of Pennsylvania. “I kept focusing on my job, and honestly, the best thing I could do the day after this was just get right back out and do what I absolutely love, which is being governor.” Shapiro looked around and said a line he repeats often: “I’m in Washington County today, and you’ve heard me say this before, and it’s true. I take my cues from Washington County, not Washington, D.C., and that’s never changed. And I think being out here with folks that we’re helping, making a difference in their lives, learning from them, listening to them, it’s the most important thing I can do.” Shapiro, for now, is keeping conflicting reports about whether he turned down Harris’s offer to be her running mate or she chose Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) over him close to his chest. “I’m not going to get into my private discussions with the vice president,” he said. “What I will say is, I said for two weeks, she had a deeply personal decision to make about who she wanted to be a running mate. And in the end, I had a deeply personal decision to make as well.” “I’m really, really pleased that I can stay here in Pennsylvania and do my job as governor, and I think Tim Walz is a great choice and will fill the role that she wants filled really effectively,” Shapiro said. Shapiro didn’t say if he is at peace with where things stand, but he is adamant that he is in a good place. “Oh, I’m really good,” he said. “I love what I do. I just left the union apprenticeship training facility in Greene County, where I said every Pennsylvanian should have the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed. And I’ve always lived my life in a way where I get to chart my own course, and I’m going to continue to do that as governor.” Shapiro discussed the charming, tiny village of Prosperity, Pennsylvania, and the fish-fry dinners that are served there every Lent, the nearby Harvey coal mine, and the training center. Shapiro, who is of Jewish faith, immediately dismissed speculations, which are floating around the country, specifically in Jewish communities, that antisemitism within his party was the reason he wasn’t chosen by Harris. “I can tell you that antisemitism had no impact on the dialogue between the vice president and me, period,” he said. Outside of the decision-making process, he admits antisemitism in general is a deep concern. “I want to characterize this more broadly,” Shapiro said. “I don’t want what I’m about to say to reflect in any way on the vice president, but antisemitism is a real concern here in Pennsylvania and across this country, and leaders need to speak and act with moral clarity and condemn hate in all of its forms.” “I’m going to continue to do the work that’s been passed down to me from William Penn to build a Pennsylvania that is tolerant and welcoming for all,” he said of Pennsylvania’s Quaker background and its design as a haven for religious freedom. Shapiro, known for his “get sh** done” mantra and showing up in crisis, as well as in places like Prosperity or Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where he kicked off his campaign for governor in 2022, said that despite all of the attention that surrounded the Democratic vice presidential selection, he never lost sight of the corners of Pennsylvania he fights for every day, ones that are oftentimes ignored. “I don’t pay attention to the chatter on TV or online. I don’t get too high from the people who say nice things, and I definitely don’t get too low from the people who say mean things. It doesn’t really impact me. What impacts me are communities like this one that I’m in right now, in Washington County, that need help, and I just always want to be in a place where I can have a tangible impact on their lives, where I can bring meaningful change to their lives and make a difference,” he said.","summary":"PROSPERITY, Pennsylvania — Just under 48 hours after Gov.
