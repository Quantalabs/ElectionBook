Elise Stefanik on Friday announced she was ending her run for New York governor after 1 1/2 months and won't seek another term in Congress.\n\nOn Nov. 7, On Nov. 7, Stefanik launched a campaign bid in an effort to challenge Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in November 2026.\n\n\"While spending precious time with my family this Christmas season, I have made the decision to suspend my campaign for Governor and will not seek re-election to Congress,\" Stefanik, 41, wrote on X. \"I did not come to this decision lightly for our family.\n\n\"I am truly humbled and grateful for the historic and overwhelming support from Republicans, Conservatives, Independents, and Democrats all across the state for our campaign to Save New York.\"\n\nStefanik is married to Matthew Manda, who works in marketing and communication, and they have a 4-year-old son.\n\n\"And while many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,\" she wrote. \"I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\"\n\nHer main primary opposition was Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who announced his run 10 days ago.\n\n\"However, as we have seen in past elections, while we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York,\" Stefanik wrote.\n\nThe last Republican governor in New York was George Pataki, who served three terms from 1995 to 2006.\n\nThe last time a Republican presidential candidate won New York was in 1984, when incumbent Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Walter Mondale.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris won the state by 13 points, down from former President Joe Biden's 23-point victory in 2000.\n\n\"Elise Stefanik has finally acknowledged reality: If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose,\" Hochul spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki told Politico. \"As Donald Trump raises costs on New Yorkers and targets this state relentlessly, Governor Hochul has cut middle-class taxes, put money back in New Yorkers' pockets, and fought this administration and won when New York has come under attack.\"\n\nStefanik has represented the rural conservative upstate New York district since 2014, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at that time.\n\nThe 21st Congressional District covers the northernmost part of the state, bordering Canada to the north and Vermont to the east. Major cities include Plattsburgh, Watertown, Glens Falls, Ogdensburg and Rome.\n\nIn November 2024, she was overwhelmingly re-elected by 24 percentage points as Trump carried the conservative region by more than 20 points.\n\nWhen President Trump was elected president last November, he nominated her to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. But the nomination was pulled because of the narrow Republican edge in the House, with Trump saying it was \"essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress.\"\n\nHochul would have called for a special election.\n\nRepublicans now have a 220-213 advantage with two vacancies in seats by Democrats who have died.\n\nStefanik rose in House leadership, serving as the fourth-ranking House Republican, a position she first attained in May 2021 by replacing Liz Cheney. She was succeeded in this specific role by Lisa McClain for the 119th Congress.\n\nAfter her nomination was pulled, Speaker Mike Johnson named her chairwoman of House Republican Leadership.\n\nShe originally was a critic of Trump but became one of his most vocal allies.\n\nStefanik fell a little out of favor with the president after she called New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani a \"jihadist.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with Mamdan in the White House, the president reduced to label the Democratic socialist that description. He is a Muslim and South Asian.\n\nTrump hadn't endorsed either candidate, including when Stefanik was in the White House's Oval Office when he signed legislation awarding the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team the Congressional Gold Medal. The teams won the gold medal in Lake Place, which includes Stefdanik's district.\n\nEd Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party, endorsed Blackman after Stefanik's decision. In a statement, he also said Stefanik would \"remain a leader in our party and a powerful voice for our principles. We respect her decision and thank her for her efforts.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt served as Stefanik's communications director from 2020-23.\n\n\"Elise Stefanik has been an incredible advocate for the people of her district in Upstate New York, and she will always be a true friend to President Trump,\" she posted on X. \"On a personal note, Elise is my former boss.

Why It Matters The release of the Jeffrey Epstein files under the Epstein Files Transparency Act represents a pivotal moment in a case that has gripped public attention for years and has threatened the reputations of many famous people. President Donald Trump signed a mandate into law requiring the release of the files, and advocates argue that the historic release will offer Americans new insight into one of the most significant scandals involving sex trafficking and abuse of underage girls by powerful figures in business, science, politics, and entertainment. What To Know On Friday, the Department of Justice began releasing hundreds of thousands of files linked to Epstein, the financier whose connections with prominent individuals and criminal activities led to multiple federal probes and global headlines. The initial tranche includes emails, photographs, flight logs, and estate records. The law requires public disclosure of all unclassified Epstein-related records, with redactions for victims' identities and material tied to ongoing investigations. It should be noted that individuals named in the documents are not necessarily accused of wrongdoing. The files contain correspondence, travel logs, and social interactions, much of which has already been referenced in previous investigations or court proceedings. Many of those revealed as Epstein's associates have denied any knowledge or participation in his criminal activities. Among the public figures and celebrities named in the documents are: The inclusion of these names reflects a range of connections, from socializing and professional correspondence to private meetings. Many names, including Clinton and Trump, have appeared repeatedly in litigation and press coverage of the Epstein case. Epstein’s ties with high-profile figures span decades. Flight logs and emails reference attendees and guests at gatherings at his various properties. Documents include testimony from survivors, depositions with associates, and email exchanges with politicians and entrepreneurs. Some disclosures, such as photographs showing Trump, Clinton, and others, have been made public through Congressional committees and media investigations. Many of those named have issued prior statements denying any involvement in Epstein's crimes or knowledge of his activities. What People Are Saying Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, told CBS News: “The fact they are even releasing hundreds of thousands of these is a historic moment for survivors across our nation.“ Former Vice President Kamala Harris voiced skepticism about the completeness of the release, telling Jimmy Kimmel: “The agency has been treated 'like a personal law firm.'” Angel Ureña, spokesperson for former President Clinton, told The Guardian: “President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.” What Happens Next The Department of Justice plans to continue releasing additional documents in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Survivors’ advocates continue to call for full transparency, while several named individuals may face renewed scrutiny regarding the nature of their interactions with Epstein. Congressional oversight committees are expected to review the redaction process and may call additional witnesses. The Justice Department is required by law to submit to Congress a list of any redacted or withheld documents within 15 days of public release and is prohibited from withholding records exclusively for reasons of ‘embarrassment or political sensitivity.’ Update 12/19/25 5:50 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.","summary":"Several celebrities were mentioned in the new Epstein documents released on Friday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/list-of-celebrities-mentioned-in-new-jeffrey-epstein-files-11246115","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/michael-jackson.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 22:52:20","author":"Jenni Fink,Peter Aitken","authors":["Jenni Fink","Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":387721114,"title":"The Millennial Manifesto","text":"An amazing 8,000-word essay entitled The Lost Generation surfaced Monday in Compact Magazine by Jacob Savage, and is one of the most illuminating pieces I've read in years. I'm 59-years-old. I'm at the very front edge of the Gen X'ers, but I identify as a Baby Boomer. I missed the cut-off by about two years. I fully recognize that every generation, by the time they get to my advanced years, begins telling stories about how the generation following them just aren't the same as they were when they were growing up. With Millennials, I've discovered that this generational axiom has the added benefit of being true. Millennials have become the punchline of a lot of jokes. The rap on these current 28-44-year-olds are that they're lazier than the generation before them, not too motivated to make their own way in the world, very self-centered, and generally gloomy about what the future holds for them. My son is 35-years-old, right in the heart of this cohort of Americans, and just provided me with a year's worth of stand-up material with his pre-Thanksgiving trip to see me alone.After reading this Savage article, complete with tons of stats and anecdotes accumulated from tons of first-person interviews, I now understand why Millennials in general are the way they are. And there is a ton of opportunity for J.D. Vance in 2028, assuming he's the Republican nominee after Secretary of State Marco Rubio all but cleared the field. The article is about the incredible damage DEI policies have had on the employment prospects, and the resulting psychological impact, on Millennial white males trying to make their mark writing in the world of media. It's obviously a niche industry, but it's a microcosm of the ongoing devastation of DEI policies that took root during the Obama presidency and crescendoed after the death of George Floyd in 2020. Savage, a fledgling writer trying to break through writing television pilots and pitching them to studios to turn into series, tells this story. \n\nBut of course, by 2016, we were already too late. The showrunner emailed us back apologetically. “I had initially thought I might be able to bring you guys on,” he wrote, “but in the end it wasn’t possible.” We met with the executive anyway—a Gen-X white guy—who told us how much he loved our pilot. But the writers room was small, he explained apologetically, and the higher-level writers were all white men. They couldn’t have an all-white-male room. Maybe, if the show got another season, they’d be able to bring us on. They never did. The doors seemed to close everywhere and all at once. In 2011, the year I moved to Los Angeles, white men were 48 percent of lower-level TV writers; by 2024, they accounted for just 11.9 percent. The Atlantic’s editorial staff went from 53 percent male and 89 percent white in 2013 to 36 percent male and 66 percent white in 2024. White men fell from 39 percent of tenure-track positions in the humanities at Harvard in 2014 to 18 percent in 2023. In retrospect, 2014 was the hinge, the year DEI became institutionalized across American life.\n\nBefore you dismiss this as a lefty writer complaining that DEI policies he probably supported backfiring on him, this is a much, much bigger story than this one job market. Countless white males coming out of college or high school in the mid-10's, regardless of their political ideology, if they held any ideology at all, ran into a brick wall where career opportunities, and ultimately their chance at the American dream, were taken away from them for the sake of diversity hires. In 1974's Blazing Saddles, there was a scene where the railroad workers were brought in to cut a deal with the all-white residents of Rock Ridge to build a fake city in order to thwart the evil Hedley Lamarr, played by Harvey Korman. I'll clean up the language to make it FCC-compliant, but the offer by the townfolk was, \"All right, we'll give land to the Blacks and the Asians, but we don't want the Irish.\" That wasn't an acceptable deal, and finally, everybody was included in the opportunity of a stake of land. That's what's happening here, except the Democrats who implemented DEI policies across education, law enforcement, law, and much of corporate America, still don't want the Irish. Whites need not apply. \n\nThis may be how Boomer and Gen-X white men experienced DEI. But for white male millennials, DEI wasn’t a gentle rebalancing—it was a profound shift in how power and prestige were distributed. Yet practically none of the thousands of articles and think-pieces about diversity have considered the issue by cohort. This isn’t a story about all white men. It’s a story about white male millennials in professional America, about those who stayed, and who (mostly) stayed quiet. The same identity, a decade apart, meant entirely different professional fates. If you were forty in 2014—born in 1974, beginning your career in the late-90s—you were already established. If you were thirty in 2014, you hit the wall.\n\nTo those of us on the right, DEI was an issue that became a political bludgeon for Donald Trump, and as president, signed two executive orders to end wasteful DEI programs and preferences in government agencies, and another one to end illegal discrimination based on race and restroring merit-based opportunities in states and entities like colleges and universities that receive federal funding. It was a principled fight that Donald Trump campaigned on, and it was a promise on which he delivered. DEI certainly hit its peak in 2020 after George Floyd, but is sadly still far too entrenched in way too many sectors of the economy. What I failed to understand is not just what discrimination it did to conservatives trying to make their way in the world, but what it has done to disillusion 30-something males who might otherwise be liberals, but not so much anymore. From the tail end of Savage's piece, which I would recommend you read every word and share it with others: \n\nMost of the men I interviewed started out as liberals. Some still are. But to feel the weight of society’s disfavor can be disorienting. We millennials were true believers in race and gender-blind meritocracy, which for all its faults—its naïveté about human nature, its optimism in the American Dream—was far superior to what replaced it. And to see that vision so spectacularly betrayed has engendered a skepticism toward the entire liberal project that won't soon disappear. “What troubles me is that a lot of thriving white millennial men have had to follow the Josh Hawley path, where you have to leave liberal America,” an old friend, the father of two biracial children, told me. “I don't want to do that. Liberal America is my home. But if everyone says, this is not the place for you, what are you supposed to do?”\n\nMost of the men he interviewed started out as liberals. Some still are. My gracious, but what an opportunity that provides to expand the base. Donald Trump made huge inroads with labor union workers, with Blacks, Hispanics, surburban women, lots of voting blocs that typically vote Democratic, but got very turned off by Joe Biden's regency and Kamala Harris' ridiculous 107-day word salad tour. Inflation was killing them, and there was no one else to blame but Biden-Harris policies. And Trump, X and Truth Social warts and all, at least demonstrated he could generate a pretty prosperous economy the first time around, so he was the better choice in 2024. In all likelihood, Vice-President Vance is going to be the nominee. Secretary Rubio told Vanity Fair he's not running in 2028, and outside of a possible run by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the field is pretty open for Vance to get the nomination without too much trouble. On the Democratic side of the aisle, a knife fight is developing that should be hugely entertaining to watch. Former Transportation Secretary, Pothole Pete Buttigieg, wants a shot. Former Hillary Clinton and Obama senior staffer Rahm Emmanuel is going to get in. Gavin Newsom is running, both away from California and for the White House. There will be others. And as I wrote about earlier in the week, Axios is reporting that Kamala Harris is definitely gearing up for another run. Polling shows that among the Democratic potential contenders, Harris has a 11-point lead over her closest rival, Gavin Newsom. If the general election in November of 2028 turns into a Vance V. Harris contest, it will literally be a Millennial white male with the ability to articulate and communicate policies, and a vision for the future in a way the Republican Party hasn't seen since...ever. Ronald Reagan could communicate, he certainly had a vision for the future, but he wasn't in the age cohort of a field of voters Millennials make up that are currently available for harvest. Who would Vance be running against? Kamala Harris, who is literally and figuratively the embodiment of a DEI hire. She was chosen by Joe Biden to fulfill a promise of picking a Black female as his number two. Harris was not a merit-based pick. She was picked because she was thought by the Biden team to be the Black female that would do them the least harm. And she failed to cross even that low bar.\n\nJob number one for whomever is running nationally for the Republicans, whether it's a Senate or House candidate in the midterms, or anyone running for the White House in '28, is to talk about the economy and affordability, and counter the narrative media and Democrats are spinning that we're in the worst economic environment ever becuase of Trump policies. Trump spoke to the nation Wednesday night and reeled off facts about job growth, lower energy costs, and how the housing market is improving now that illegal immigration is no longer creating an artificially high demand for units, driving up prices. All that is very good. But there's more that the next Republican for president, presumably Vance, needs to add to the agenda. The disillusionment on the left after what they believed in failed them makes these Millennial white males willing to listen, if Vance can resonate how the best way to achieve the equality they really want is equal access to opportunity, not government and corporations picking winners and losers based on skin color or gender in order to achieve equity. Replace the lost opportunies with words and actions to expand opportunities will reap electoral benefits to such a degree that Democrats won't know what hit them on Election Night. The Late Charlie Kirk used to be very, very good at that messaging to college-aged kids all over the country. He may have been the best in the conservative movement ever to be able to reason with young people, but a close second is Vance. When he spoke at a TPUSA event at Ole Miss a couple days before Halloween, it was a masterclass performance. The big question is will Vance, or someone around him, show him this Savage article, and will Vance grasp the political upside available to him and the skill set for communication he possesses? The good news is yes, he does. \n\nA lot of people think \"DEI\" is lame diversity seminars or racial slogans at NFL games. In reality, it was a deliberate program of discrimination primarily against white men. This is an incredible piece that describes the evil of DEI and its consequences:https://t.co/fMiIfvz0qz— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 17, 2025\n\nThere are lots of doomsayers on the right who think Republicans are headed for disaster in the midterms unless they get back to talking about the core issues of economics and affordability. That certainly needs to be the primary message. But there are millions of potential voters out there that the Democratic Party kicked to the curb who are persuadable, if somone just gives them attention, an ear, understanding, and most of all, hope for the future.","url":"https://hotair.com/generalissimo/2025/12/19/the-millennial-manifesto-n3810034","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/0006e4e7-e3ee-4a3c-9c25-30a6ae936660.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 21:00:00","author":"Duane Patterson","authors":["Duane Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":387705436,"title":"The Top 10 Wildest Music Moments That Defined Pop Culture in 2025","text":"Skip to main content\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nA lot happened this year.

While Harry Styles didn’t perform or release music this year, he did make headlines repeatedly for popping up in the most random locations, including Tokyo and Berlin to run the casual marathon and Vatican City to watch the very first American Pope formally ascend to the top of the Catholic church. Cardi B started dating NFL star Stefon Diggs and had a baby with him in the span of months, while BTS finally reunited on camera after its seven members finished their respective military enlistments, and LeAnn Rimes’ teeth fell out on stage.\n\nPlus, Donald Trump crashed out over unsubstantiated theories regarding Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé’s involvement in Kamala Harris’ campaign, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo finally finished their two-year promotional run for the Wicked movies — encountering an aggressive prankster on the Singapore premiere red carpet along the way — and Diddy’s federal trial ended with the disgraced Bad Boy Records founder getting sentenced to four years in prison for prostitution charges.

It was one of the biggest moments in the making in Recording Academy history, as the superstar’s lack of recognition in the major categories continued even as she became the institution’s winningest artist of all time in 2023.\n\nBut while the AOTY win was certainly Bey’s biggest feat of the night, her shocked reaction to hearing her name read off as the winner of best country album ended up being the most viral moment — one that remains a frequently used meme online as 2025 draws to a close.\n\nKaty Perry Goes to Space for 11 Minutes\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIn April, Katy Perry joined Blue Origin’s very first all-woman flight crew, launching into space alongside Gayle King, Lauren Sanchez and more for a mission that lasted just 11 minutes or so. Their craft reached approximately 62 miles above Earth to fly through an area called the “Kármán line,” aka the imaginary boundary that divides our planet’s atmosphere and outer space.\n\nThe idea of a pop star traveling to the final frontier was wild enough on its own for the internet to go crazy over the mission, but Perry unveiling her Lifetimes Tour setlist in zero gravity and dramatically kissing the ground once she landed also fueled many posts and memes for weeks after the fact.\n\nMorgan Wallen Goes Back to ‘God’s Country’\n\nImage Credit: Will Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIt seemed that Morgan Wallen was eager to leave New York City after serving as musical guest on a spring episode of Saturday Night Live. The country star abruptly exited the final shot before cameras even cut, then proceeded to share a photo of his private plane with “Get me to God’s country” written over it shortly after his sudden departure.\n\nThe phrase spread rapidly through posts online from bemused onlookers and meme-makers alike, a cultural phenomenon Wallen quickly capitalized on by releasing a line of “God’s country” merch.\n\nJustin Bieber Stands on Business\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIn telling off a group of paparazzi, Justin Bieber created one of the biggest memes of the year. “It’s not clocking to you that I’m standing on business, is it?” he says in a clip that went crazy viral in June, aggressively tapping his temple to show he wasn’t messing around.\n\nThe phrase immediately became a staple in the 2025 lexicon, with the singer’s wife, Rhode founder Hailey Bieber, writing on Instagram Stories after the release of Justin’s Daisies album, “Is it finally clocking to you f–king losers?”\n\nSabrina Carpenter Gets on All Fours\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nWhen Sabrina Carpenter announced less than a year after dropping Short n’ Sweet that she’d be releasing another album, Man’s Best Friend, in August 2025, one element of the project quickly temporarily overshadowed the rest: its cover. The image of the pop star down on all fours with a man grasping her by the hair polarized audiences, sparking dramatic debate as to whether the image was empowering, degrading, or simply not that deep.\n\n“I was actually shocked, because I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it just wasn’t even a conversation,” she later told CBS Mornings of the backlash. “For what the album is, [the cover is] perfect for what it represents, and everything about it to me just felt so opposite of, like, the world ending.”\n\nColdplay Concert Gets Awkward\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nOne of the most inescapable moments on the internet this year was when two Coldplay concertgoers were caught on video reacting quite suspiciously to a kiss cam showing them looking cozy on the big screens at Gillette Stadium in Boston. After the pair turned away and ducked out of sight once their image flashed in front of the entire crowd, frontman Chris Martin joked, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy.”\n\nTurns out, the two individuals were Astronomer CEO Andy Byron — who has since resigned — and his company’s then-HR executive, Kristin Cabot, both of whom were married to other people at the time. In a New York Times piece published many months after the fact, Cabot explained that she had already been separated from her husband by then, and that nothing physical had gone on between herself and her boss before the concert.\n\n“I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,” she told the publication. “And it’s not nothing. And I took accountability and I gave up my career for that.”\n\nTaylor Swift Says ‘Yes’ to Travis Kelce\n\nImage Credit: Aeon/GC Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nAfter years of writing love songs, Taylor Swift finally got her own happy ending when Travis Kelce proposed to her in August. “Your English teacher and gym teacher are getting married,” the couple wrote on Instagram while announcing the news, leaving Swifties everywhere overjoyed.\n\nAs we learned later, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end popped the question right after he and Swift recorded their record-breaking New Heights podcast episode, during which the pop star had no idea a team of people was setting up their rose garden proposal backdrop right outside their house while she was discussing her The Life of a Showgirl album on the show.\n\n‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Slays the Charts\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nNothing could have prepared the world — or the Billboard charts — for KPop Demon Hunters, the animated Netflix children’s film that absolutely took over with its music. In addition to its corresponding album becoming the first movie soundtrack to ever have four songs simultaneously chart in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, “Golden” ruled atop the ranking for two weeks and spent 18 at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200.\n\nPlus, “Golden” earned a historic Grammy nomination for song of the year and closed out 2025 as Billboard staff’s No. 1 song of the past 12 months, while KPop Demon Hunters remains the most-streamed flick of all time on Netflix.\n\nBad Bunny Enrages MAGA\n\nImage Credit: Will Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nThe backlash to the announcement of Bad Bunny as 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show was absolutely bonkers, infuriating people who weren’t keen on having a predominantly Spanish-speaking musician headline the gig. Even President Donald Trump had something to say about the choice, which he called “absolutely ridiculous,” and Turning Point USA announced plans to host an alternative halftime show featuring “anything in English.”\n\nBenito, however, has remained unfazed ahead of his showcase on Feb. 8, 2026. “I’m very happy,” he said in his opening monologue when hosting Saturday Night Live in October. “Especially for all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world and here in the United States. The people who have worked to open doors. More than my accomplishment, it’s an accomplishment of all of us, demonstrating that our mark and our input in this country cannot be thrown out or erased.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”\n\nTMZ reported that their bodies were “butchered” and that sources described the scene as being the crimes of a “mad man.”\n\nThe New York Times reported that investigators are still trying to determine the time of death, and that the Reiners may have been killed on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025, or in the very early hours on Sunday.\n\nTMZ reported that when the Reiners’ bodies were discovered, rigor mortis had already set in, which usually begins between two and six hours after death.\n\nRelated: We Ranked Every Rob Reiner Movie—Here’s the One That’s Still a Perfect 10\n\nWho found Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer?\n\nAccording to PEOPLE, Rob and Michele’s daughter Romy Reiner found her parents after they were murdered.\n\nMore details emerged in a report from the New York Times, which revealed that a massage therapist who was scheduled to be at the house called Romy when she couldn’t get in. Romy then went to the Reiners’ family home, where she found her father’s body. She immediately left the premises and reportedly didn’t know her mother was also dead inside. She called police, then family friend Billy Crystal, who lived close by and came over to say a final farewell to his longtime collaborator and Michele.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025, Romy and her brother Jake Reiner released a statement about the slayings.\n\n“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they said. “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends.”\n\nThey continued, “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”\n\nRelated: Why Rob Reiner Rejected the Title of ‘Hero’ Months Before His Death\n\nWhat time were police called to Rob Reiner’s house?\n\nMultiple reports state that paramedics and police were called to the Reiners’ home between 3:30 p.m. and 3:40 p.m. PT on Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025.\n\nWhere did Rob Reiner and Michele Singer live?\n\nThe Reiners lived in the wealthy enclave of Brentwood, located in the west side of Los Angeles county.\n\nAbout 42,000 people reside in the neighborhood, including LeBron James, Gwyneth Paltrow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dr. Dre and Disney CEO Bob Iger, as well as former vice president Kamala Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff.

I spoke to him last night for over an hour,” Idle wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after 1 a.m. PT on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. “I always enjoyed his company. I met him at his Dad’s in 1975. He was telling me about fiming [sic] at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future. This is so awful. I shall miss him. A clever, talented and very thoughtful man. So awful.”\n\nCinematographer Barry Markowitz told Page Six that he was likely one of the last people to see the Reiners alive, as he’d recently been staying with them in their Brentwood home. Markowitz said that the Reiners invited him to stay at their house when he was in town to promote one of his projects in November, and that at the time, it appeared Nick was “on the upswing” with his health.\n\n“He looked great. He was sitting and talking with the family,” Markowitz recalled. “They eat dinner together, old school, and a lot of love, always a lot of love … He helped out, he took out the garbage, he watched TV, he washed dishes. He’d bring me something to drink. He was just normal in that sense.”\n\nMarkowitz said he didn’t notice anything unusual and that the family was loving and normal. When asked about what he thought of Nick’s alleged behavior and if he believed he could murder his own parents, he replied, “It’s just a sickness. That’s my verdict.”\n\nRob, Michele and Nick Reiner all attended pal Conan O’Brien‘s holiday party on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025, TMZ reported. The three of them reportedly had a “very loud argument” at the soiree, after which Rob and Michele went home. Sources claimed that Michele was lamenting to friends that she and Rob were struggling for several months to get Nick treatment for his addiction and mental health problems.\n\nRelated: The Chilling Message Rob Reiner Told the World Months Before His Murder\n\nWho is Nick Reiner?\n\nNick Reiner is the son of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. He was a screenwriter and worked with his father on the 2015 film Being Charlie, which was loosely autobiographical. He reportedly periodically Nick lived at home with his parents, and TMZ reported that Nick left the family home on his own accord before the slayings.\n\nAt one point, Nick worked as an intern for the long-running Seth Macfarlane animated comedy Family Guy.\n\n“He was an intern on the show Family Guy for around three to six months. His father helped him get the gig,” a source told Page Six, adding that Rob “would drop him off” and “pick him up” from the job daily. The insider claimed that Nick would work for about four hours a day, but that he did little actual work, instead spending the bulk of his time “shooting the s**t” with his colleagues.\n\n“He did not work hard and he wasn’t a hard worker,” the insider claimed. “He was 100 percent entitled. There was really no responsibility for him because we didn’t have interns. It was a favor for Rob.”\n\nThe source called Nick “captivating” and said he had a dark sense of humor.\n\n“He was a funny kid. He was charismatic in a dark, introverted way. He was a goofy 20-year-old,” the insider said. “He was the black sheep. He felt like a f**k up. He knew that. He was self-aware of how his family was doing and how he represented them in a negative space. But none of that felt offensive or scary.”\n\n“He was coming off rehab, so he was sober,” the source added. “This was part of his path to recovery. His whole identity was being sober.”\n\nIn terms of the allegations that Nick murdered his parents, the insider said, “I am not that shocked. He is a troubled person. Nick had an aura of darkness around him with his addiction issues. When you have addiction and mental health, there is room for emotional murders … It doesn’t seem unfounded. He was a troubled kid from a young age and had issues. But that’s not the Nick I knew.”\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Nick struggled to find his own identity in the shadow of his famous father and grandfather (Carl Reiner, who died in 2020).\n\n“Nick wanted to live a life that didn’t exist. He was entitled,” the insider said. “He didn’t want to do any work but expected to be loved the way the rest of his family was.” The source added that Michele and Rob “felt enormous guilt for so long that they couldn’t help Nick get his life together … they could never reach stability with Nick. They tried everything—giving him space, keeping him close—but his struggles are so deep. It’s just a parent’s worst nightmare. They were such lovely people and tried in every way to help their son.”\n\nRelated: Does Nick Reiner Have Instagram? See the Private Account His Siblings Follow\n\nWhat did Nick Reiner suffer from?\n\nNick struggled with mental illness and addiction for much of his life, TMZ reported which at times left him homeless and often in and out of various rehabilitation centers and programs; his count as of 2016 was reportedly 17 stints. His substance abuse, and his family’s responses to it, deteriorated his relationship with his parents. Sources alleged to TMZ that prescription drugs especially “messed with [Nick’s] head.”\n\n“I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas,” Nick told PEOPLE in 2016. “I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun … If I wanted to do it my way and not go to the programs they were suggesting, then I had to be homeless.”\n\n“When Nick would tell us that it wasn’t working for him, we wouldn’t listen,” Rob recalled to the Los Angeles Times in September 2015. “We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”\n\n“We were so influenced by these people,” Michele added at the time. “They would tell us he’s a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”\n\nFor his part, Nick said in a 2016 interview with Build Studios that he “didn’t really bond a lot” with his father when he was young. He also admitted (via the Los Angeles Times), “I had no identity, and I had no passions. I think the reason I had no identity was because I have a famous dad and a famous grandpa, and that fame sort of informs who you are. So I wanted to edge out my own identity with a more rebellious, angry, drug-addicted sort of persona.”\n\nIn 2018, Nick revealed that on the Dopey podcast that he’d once gotten so high that he completely trashed his parents’ guest house.\n\n“I got totally spun out on uppers,” he said. “I think it was coke and something else—and I was up for days on end. I started punching out different things in my guest house … started with the TV and then I went over to the lamp … everything in the guest house got wrecked.”\n\nIn September 2025, Rob told NPR that Nick was doing well and had been sober for about six years at that point in time.\n\nSources told PEOPLE that at O’Brien’s holiday party, “Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous.” According to TMZ, Nick arrived underdressed for the “ritzy” event (he wore a sweatshirt while everyone else wore suits and fancy dresses). Insiders alleged that he was behaving erratically, roaming around the property aimlessly and barely interacting with other guests. According to NBC News, one of those guests was Barry star and Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader: Nick reportedly interrupted Hader during what Hader told him was a “private conversation,” then stoood still, stared blankly and finally stormed off.\n\nSources alleged that Rob and Michele were embarrassed at Nick’s behavior at the party and that they’d “tried everything” to get their son to be healthy.\n\n“They had had an argument at Conan’s holiday party, and Rob had been telling people that they’re scared for Nick and scared that his mental state was deteriorating,” a source told the New York Post. A friend of the Reiner family claimed that Rob and Michele were urging Nick to get treatment at a facility for a drug relapse, but that he refused.\n\nMarkowitz concurred that the Reiners worked extraordinarily hard to get Nick healthy.\n\n“They gave him everything, they tried a million things with him,” he told Page Six. “Not giving him money but sending him to top-of-the-line places. Rob never gave up. He tried everything. If you knew Rob, he was just a bundle of love.” He added that he and Rob never suspected Nick could be violent with them, explaining, “[Rob] never had fears for his safety. I’m not in his head, but we talked. [Nick] wasn’t a violent type. I slept in the same house as Nick. There was never a thought, I believe, in Rob’s head [that Nick was a danger]. If he would have thought his life was in peril at any point, he would have handled the situation.” He added, “When somebody is mentally disturbed, you don’t need a reason. There’s no rhyme or reason. Mental illness, that’s the reason.”\n\nHowever, a source told The Daily Mail that Nick’s family was “scared” of him because of his alleged “violent outbursts,” and described Nick as “violent and super aggressive.” They claimed that his behavior was often disturbing, but was “magnified to horrific levels” when he was using substances. Sources alleged that Nick was a “ticking time bomb” and prone to “meth-fueled outbursts” that often included destroying property. An insider alleged that Rob and Michele “threatened to call authorities multiple times, but in the end didn’t.”\n\n“If they thought he was violent, things would have been very different,” a source told PEOPLE. “At the worst of it, it hadn’t been like this. I don’t think anyone could have ever seen anything like this coming.

The movie was a semi-autobiographical look at a successful filmmaker eyeing a run for political office (played by Cary Elwes, who also starred in Reiner’s classic The Princess Bride) and his strained relationship with his son Charlie (Nick Robinson), who suffers from addiction.\n\nRob and Nick said that one particular line in the movie, when the father character tells his son, “I’d rather you hate me and be alive,” came directly from their real-life conversations.\n\n“I mean, we did get into fights over things, but ultimately it forced us to make the film better,” Rob Reiner said in 2016. “The whole process for me—I can just speak for myself—it did make me understand him a lot more, and it did make me a better father. Hopefully it did.”\n\nRelated: Watch Rob Reiner and Nick Reiner Talk About Being Charlie a Decade Before the Director’s Murder\n\nHow old is Nick Reiner?\n\nBorn Sept. 14, 1993, Nick Reiner is 32 years old as of this writing.\n\nHas Nick Reiner been arrested?\n\nNick Reiner was arrested without incident at about 9:15 p.m. PT on Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025, hours after his parents were found dead.\n\nRelated: LAPD Releases Photos of Nick Reiner’s Arrest\n\nWhere was Nick Reiner found?\n\nPolice arrested Nick Reiner close to Exposition Park and near the University of Southern California campus, PEOPLE reported. Footage obtained by ABC7 Eyewitness News showed that Nick bought a drink at a gas station moments before police apprehended him. He was wearing a black, green and white striped track jacket, a black cap and blue jeans and was carrying a red backpack at the time.\n\nTMZ reported that Nick had checked into the Pierside Santa Monica hotel, 20 miles from where he was arrested, at about 4 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2025, using his credit card. Spies alleged that Nick was “tweaked out” when he checked in, but that he didn’t have any blood visible on his person. His room after he left, however, was a horrifyingly different story: Police who went to the room to investigate reportedly found blood in the shower and on the bed and bedsheets covering the windows.\n\nSources told TMZ that police told front desk staff at the hotel they were there to do a welfare check on Nick, and ultimately performed a search for the murder weapon on the premises.\n\nTMZ later obtained footage of Nick walking towards the hotel minutes before he checked in (and hours before Rob and Michele Singer Reiner’s bodies were found in their home). In this footage, Nick carries a black backpack, not a red one like he did when he was arrested, so it appears he switched bags at some point after getting to his hotel room and before police apprehended him.\n\nRelated: Rob Reiner’s When Harry Met Sally Confession Goes Viral After His and Wife Michele’s Death\n\nWhat is Nick Reiner charged with?\n\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, Nick Reiner was formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Michele and Rob Reiner.

These platforms let people wager on everything from elections and award shows to the most trivial internet ephemera, framing bets as tradable “shares” that rise and fall like stocks. With billions in weekly trading volume, massive new funding rounds, and even a CNN partnership with the prediction-betting platform, Kalshi, prediction markets are quickly moving from niche curiosity to mainstream-media fixture—openly touting ambitions to financialize everything.\n\nWarzel is joined by writer Max Read, who argues that prediction markets sit at the intersection of gambling, finance, and a broader “suckerification” economy aimed at young men. Together they unpack whether the markets actually reflect the “wisdom of crowds” or whether they’re little more than a meta-game of vibes, ideology, and misvalued dumb money. The pair explore the culture of these platforms and offer a diagnosis of the attention economy: When it’s hard to sell anything directly, it’s easier to sell derivatives of everything. Prediction markets may promise clarity, Warzel and Read suggest, but what they really offer is another way to feel excitement in a world that feels rigged.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nMax Read: When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money, though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of both commercial and political kind of apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money.\n\nCharlie Warzel: I am Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. A few weeks ago on this podcast, the journalist Pablo Torre told me this.\n\nPablo Torre: It feels like, you know, we’re living at a time in which lots of young people were promised things they were not delivered. Perhaps because of the generations that continued to wield power in our government, economy, et cetera, the Boomers—and the way to, like, Chutes and Ladders your way to the American dream is gambling on shit. And in that casino premise, I think you just see again a through line across all these sectors of American life now. Sports being one that has so naturally taken to it. Because, my gosh, here’s an unlimited menu. I mean, literally.\n\nWarzel: Today we’re going to explore another part of that unlimited menu of gambling in the casino-ification of the American economy: prediction markets. Chances are you’ve been hearing a lot about prediction markets lately. At their core, prediction markets are online spaces where people can place wagers on the outcome of events.\n\nThey share similarities with sports books except, unlike a traditional bed at a casino, your wager is a futures contract—the value of which fluctuates based on the market value of the outcome of any given event. Right now, people use the markets to bet on sports, events like the Oscars, whether Elon Musk will tweet a specific number of times in a given month, or about the outcome of an election.\n\nThe top platforms now for prediction markets collectively report several billion dollars’ worth of weekly trading volume. Kalshi, one of the biggest prediction markets in this space, announced this month that it raised a billion dollars from many of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture-capital firms.\n\nRecently, CNN announced it was partnering with Kalshi to integrate the company’s prediction-market data in the news coverage. The company’s CEO, Tarek Mansour, has big ambitions. At a conference in October, he said this about Kalshi’s future:\n\nTarek Mansour: The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.\n\nWarzel: “Financialize everything.”\n\nThat’s essentially the quiet part out loud. That is the blueprint for the actual casinoification of the world, brought to you by one of the more ascendant companies that’s moving everything toward gambling. So what’s really going on here? How do prediction markets work? Is there some truth to what boosters allege: that people putting their money where their mouths are is actually a good way to tap into the wisdom of crowds?\n\nOr is this just a dystopian development? An example of companies preying on a society with a burgeoning gambling addiction? Today I am joined by Max Read, author of the Great Substack Read Max. Read covers culture and power on the internet and has this really intuitive understanding of platforms and people.\n\nRecently he wrote a great piece titled “Prediction Markets and the Suckerification Crisis.” Max and I talk about where all this is going and why everyone is gambling and no one is happy. Now, my conversation with Max Read.\n\nWarzel: Max Read, welcome to Galaxy Brain.\n\nRead: Thanks for having me, Charlie.\n\nWarzel: Yeah. So we’re going to talk about prediction markets. Hopefully come up with some grand theory as to why they are ascendant and why everything feels a little bit broken. But I want to just first—for the normies out there who aren’t, you know, using them.\n\nHow would you describe them? How are they different from straight-up gambling or a sports book?\n\nRead: Yeah, well, the first time I wrote about them, I described them as sports books that allowed you to place wagers on non-sports events. But I think the extra sort of bit that’s important to understand about them—because at the end of the day, that is what they are, and it’s the way a lot of people use them. And I should note, by the way, that when I say they’re not: They’re sports books that allow you to place bets on non-sporting events. Many of them are actually also sports books. Kalshi in particular allows you to place wagers on games.\n\nBut what they do is really emphasize the wager as a security that you can purchase and sell the way you would a share on the stock market, say. So if you believed, say, that there would be a Democratic sweep across New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City back in November, you could have bought shares. Or you could have bet on that outcome for, you know, what, like 30—like, they’ll do it as prices, right? You bet, you wager 30 cents for the return of a dollar, right? So you could buy the shares at 30 cents. You buy 10 shares at 30 cents; you get $10 back. If that comes off.\n\nNow, I mentioned 30 cents, say, because a couple weeks—I’m not sure if that’s the exact price—but a couple weeks before this election, it was kind of unclear what Democrats’ chances were going to be in any of these elections. There’s a lot of polls coming out saying that Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey was running dangerously sort of close in the race against … I can’t even remember the name of her opponent at this point.\n\nBut, you know, it was a fairly low probability according to the betters on the app. Right? But as the returns start to come in on Tuesday night—and it becomes clear that actually the chances that this is going to be a sweep across all these elections get higher—all of a sudden the price of a given wager rises. Or the price of a given share, so to speak.\n\nSo at 30 cents—suddenly it’s 40 cents, suddenly it’s 60 cents. The way you would think about that if you were just talking gambling odds is, all of a sudden, you’re getting less return on your wager, basically. Your odds are getting significantly easier.\n\nAnd, you could have, say—let me give a slightly different example of election. So recently in Tennessee, this woman, Aftyn Behn, was running for a congressional seat. And, she was absolutely not the favorite. It was a “Trump plus 30” congressional district or whatever, and you could buy shares for her victory at like, you know, 20 cents, something like that, the week before the election. The night of the election, as returns start coming in, she’s looking actually kind of good for it. The early returns are quite good for her. And I watched as the price of her shares climbed up. I’m not going to say whether or not I had any horse in this race, any money on this. But I was watching it closely, let’s just say.\n\nAnd there was a point where if you had bought shares at 30—and again, who knows who I’m talking about here—but if you had bought shares at 30, you could have sold them for a 100 percent profit. Sold them at 60 cents. Only for those shares to come crashing down as the results continue coming over the night, and it becomes clear it’s not happening.\n\nSo—sorry, this is a sort of complicated explanation—but I think it’s useful to understand how you use it. Right? That when you go on these sites, what you’re doing is: You’re doing this kind of thing that’s kind of a hybrid. Like stock-market day-trading activity and a betting activity. And I do think it’s worth saying, as much as they emphasize the sort of security, quality of these wagers.\n\nYou can do this at a sports book too, right? That odds will change at a sports book depending on who’s taking which side of the bet, and you can cash out. Most sports books will allow you to cash out various times, you know, after you’ve placed your wager. And if the odds of the wager have changed in between the period where you placed your wager and you’re cashing out, you could make a small profit just from cashing out, right?\n\nIf you wager a team is going to win, and then you could cash out with five minutes to go and they’re up by 20 points, you’re not going to get as much as you would if you saw the whole thing out. But you can cash out at a fairly high profit. So in that sense, you know, it’s sort of another way of looking at, or another way of thinking about, gambling that emphasizes the sort of up-and-down nature of odds. And I think that’s how most people kind of approach it when they’re on the site placing these wagers—they’re thinking about it like betting. But I think it’s also important to understand why [these sites] have become so ubiquitous in media is that they are exciting to a lot of economists and libertarians. especially libertarian economists. It’s that they offer a kind of semi-accurate—accurate depending on the liquidity of the market, accurate depending on the size of the market—accurate picture of what you might think of as the conventional wisdom. Right? Because there’s all these people collectively saying how much [they’re] placing their own odds, so to speak, on a given outcome.\n\nWagering their own actual money, so they have skin in the game. So nobody’s doing this just for propaganda purposes, or whatever. You can say, Conventional wisdom has the chances of this event happening at 50 percent, 30 percent, whatever. Now, these markets are still fairly small, and many of them are not very liquid at all.\n\nSo it is not like there’s millions of people betting a couple bucks at a time to make them, you know, as sort of accurate as possible. You’ll have a couple whales who are placing large wagers, which makes them interesting in what they tell you. Because it’s not saying, necessarily, the conventional wisdom according to the kind of person who places a bet on this kind of a thing.\n\nBut that’s the other side of it. The nonuser side, the media side, the philosophical side of this is: Prediction markets allow us to start to look at the future in this way that allows us to set probabilities about things.\n\nWarzel: I’m curious what you make of the “wisdom of crowds” bit, because this is the part of me that stops and feels a little insane sometimes with this. Because I think about, like, this is essentially a meta-game, right? Where you have this system that produces outcomes and incentives for certain outcomes that arise in it, and you wrap that system in an apparatus that is also concerned with influencing those outcomes.\n\nIt’s this second-order thing like you have with poker—where good poker players can technically predict the outcome of hands, but that is also influencing the outcomes of the games. It just feels to me like what you’re doing is: Prediction markets aren’t what people think will happen. It’s what people think other people think will happen, right? So it feels to me it’s confusing.\n\nRead: I do think there’s a use for that. You could come up with reasons. And from a financial sort of market perspective, one way of thinking about it is that these are effectively tools. Instruments for hedging, right?\n\nThat you have a sense of—you think something’s going to happen, but you also want to place some wagers on the side in case it doesn’t happen to limit your losses. And for that, you don’t need it to be wholly accurate, right? You just need it to sort of approximate a given outcome that allows you to make money off of that.\n\nI think there’s sort of two ways to go with what you’re saying. One is that, until recently, prediction markets have largely been a sort of theoretical idea, right? I mean, we could talk about the stock market—or a sports book, for that matter—as a prediction market. But this sort of all-encompassing marketplace to make wagers on.\n\nI mean, recently there were wagers on the Time magazine “Person of the Year” cover, all the Oscars, all the award-season stuff. You can wager on who’s going to get nominated and who’s going to win. We’ve talked about elections already. There’s even, often, marketplaces for words getting mentioned by prominent figures in—what’s the word I’m looking for—in speeches or in, you know, earnings calls. If you believe really strongly in the idea of the wisdom of crowds, it’s very exciting.\n\nBut the theoretical model of the prediction market is, as I was sort of emphasizing before, is one that everybody is participating in. The market is fully liquid. Everybody has a stake in it. Everybody is placing wagers there. And these markets are fairly far from that, right? On Election Night, there tends to be enough money, and enough people, to sort of approximate what we’ve been talking about as the conventional wisdom about who’s going to win and who’s going to lose.\n\nBut that’s not always the case, and certainly not the case for stuff like these culture categories that I’m talking about. I wanted to ask—without you having to divulge whether you are, or are not, actively participating in these markets—what’s the culture like on these? I think it mirrors some of the culture on X/Twitter in the Musk era.\n\nBut when you go either to try to place some wagers, or for reporting purposes,what’s the culture like?\n\nRead: So, I can talk about the culture in the comment sections—which I wouldn’t want to suggest is wholly reflective of the culture of these places in general.\n\nAnd I think there is a wide range. There is smart money. There are sharks out there who are running programs and bots to identify. Especially on an election night, you’ll get guys who are pulling results all doing this automated, basically HFD—like high-frequency traders pulling results from The New York Times or Decision Desk or whoever. And, like, immediately placing orders on shares to take advantage of that. Like, you don’t have to do it in the milliseconds the way you do on Wall Street, but you can do it if you just do it in a couple seconds. We’ll still make it advantageous.\n\nAnd you have people who are quite good—for example, the Time magazine cover leaked before it was announced. And a bunch of people made a tidy little profit, because it took a while for the market to catch up. So I say that just to say that there are smart people. Just as a to be sure thing before I get into the comments—which are really stupid. I mean, there’s just a lot of stupid people there. And there’s a funny mix of just really obviously stupid people—you know, Free Republic–commenter type, X, like bottom-of-the-barrel, Trumpist X types. And then there’s stupid, just guys who have sort of wandered in. Every wager, if you scroll far enough, you’ll find a guy who took the stupid side of the wager because he didn’t read the terms until after he’d put his $50 down.\n\nHe is like, Oh, I didn’t realize that I was actually betting, you know, against this. I thought I was betting for it. Oh, well, now I’m out 50 bucks. The tone reminds me a lot of—I think the closest thing I can think of online, or the two closest things, are the: If you play fantasy football in Yahoo, every player has their own little comment section. And you can pull it up as you’re deciding who’s to start and who to bench.\n\nAnd it’s just filled with people just clinging to the most desperate of threads. You know, citing articles they read somewhere. Nobody’s linking to anything. Everyone’s like, Oh, I heard he is going to play. Oh, I heard he is injured. Oh, I heard he’s, you know, he’s not going to be the first QB.\n\nHe’s not going to get any catches. He is not going to get any throws this game. Whatever it is. And the comments on the bets kind of remind me of this on all the markets. It’s somebody being like, Oh, you know, there’s one market that’s which member of Trump’s Cabinet is going to leave first.\n\nAnd everyone’s like, Well, okay, well here’s this thing I read about [Pete] Hegseth. And somebody else will be like, Well, I read this about Pam Bondi. And people doing their theories. It’s a message board. It’s not the dumbest place I’ve ever read, but it’s of a basic kind of politics message-board stupidity.\n\nIt’s just that there’s all this money going on in the background. All of which is to say, when I say it’s similar to the fantasy-football chats is: It’s very male. Obviously it’s very young. Obviously, I mean—I think most of the guys are sort of in their 20s. It’s sort of confident, but Ill-informed in the way you would expect a lot of guys who to gamble in their 20s basically are.\n\nWarzel: There’s also—and I don’t mean this in a pearl-clutching way—but it’s a little reactionary. Right? Because part of what I see in the elevator pitch from some of the founders of this—it’s trying to court people who have some skepticism about the way that institutions behave, right? Kalshi’s co-founder, Tarek Mansour, I think is how you say his name. He’s really positioned this as the “wisdom of crowds,” because regular institutions have failed us, right? Because there’s this plethora of information out there, because reporters aren’t actually very good at telling, or getting, the story the way it is—come here. Not only is this a helpful tool, but that seems to recruit, just generally, people who a little bit more edgelord-y, or whatever. Yeah. Is that accurate to you?\n\nRead: I think so. I mean, I think—certainly, not to sort of underline this point—but I do think it’s worth thinking about the prediction markets in two phases.\n\nThere’s, especially, the ones around politics. There’s the long phase before the election, whatever election is being bet on, happens. Which, I think, there is a—I don’t want to put a number on it, but I think that the markets tend to lean right? They just tend to overestimate Republicans. They tend to—not by a significant amount, not by the amount that you can make a ton of money off of unless you’re gambling a lot—but generally they tend to give Republicans better odds and Democrats worse odds. That’s phase one. And then, phase two is closer to the actual election. And that’s, in my experience, at least, when the smart money starts to roll in. And people come through just to pick up—basically, they take the transition from “the market’s tilting Republican” to reality setting in, and they make a quick profit off of that.\n\nAnd then, by the end of the night, we know who won, and the markets are settled. They’re mostly settled. So I think that: Yes, the culture, in that sense, tilts right. I think that there’s also sort of two aspects to why that is. The first is exactly as you’re saying: that there is a deep and longstanding philosophical affinity between predictions markets, the wisdom of crowds, so to speak.\n\nThe idea that markets, in general, can calculate things better than institutions or humans can. That dates back to [Friedrich] Hayek and [Ludwig von] Mises. And this is sort of foundational to, you might say, neoliberalism in some broad sense. But also to a lot of the way that Silicon Valley has thought about the world since the ’90s.\n\nRight. You know, there’s this idea that we don’t want top-down people in charge. We want this sort of collective, anarchic mass of humanity working together. And a market or a quasi-market format will pull these together. So I think there is this kind of highfalutin, let’s say, philosophical background here that probably pushes the prediction markets—the people who use them and certainly the people who build them—to the right. To the kind of libertarian, hard-libertarian, market-worshiping right. But there also is a particular sort of base, reactionary nest to a lot of what goes on there, that I think is more tied in with—to some extent takes its cues from—the sort of intellectual draws that I’ve just been talking about. But is more tied into one being young and male. And gambling—young men like to gamble; young men tend to be more right wing.\n\nSo I think that’s just sort of a basic demographic and sociological fact of 2025. They’re also pulling in a lot of people from X, which is just significantly more right wing than it was five years ago. And, as I was saying, they also are—without wanting to be too smug about it—they’re trying to pull in, through their marketing campaigns, pull in a lot of dumb money. To make it attractive for smart money to come in.\n\nAnd they do that by advertising to the biases of the reactionaries on X, basically. So, I decided to write about this because, around the time of the November elections when Zohran Mamdani was running high in New York City, but as is often the case, there’s a lot of people in New York who hated him. Who were sort of, Well, I don’t think he’s going to win.\n\nYou know, I think people there [were], as you were saying, The mainstream media is ignoring all my neighbors that hate him. All my neighbors are going to vote against him. And Kalshi started running. And Polymarket, too, started running all of these. They own these, um. They run these sort of newswire accounts, that are depending on both the official accounts. But also they have their own news accounts that they don’t link to the betting sites, really. They just do these blanket, one-line, almost like a Bloomberg-terminal news thing that tends to be very misleading. Very right wing.\n\nYou know, in one case Kalshi tweeted—sometimes they’ll tweet about the prediction markets. And they’ll be like, Zohran Mamdani’s position is tumbling. And that kind of thing is obviously going to bring in … you know, you could do that with liberals. I don’t wanna pretend that liberals in America are so much better at picking out misinformation and scams and whatever else. But it’s very clear who they want to appeal to on Twitter. And it’s low-social-trust gamblers, basically.\n\nWarzel: Yeah. And also, just even beyond the political part of it. Some of these accounts that are run by these prediction markets—like Kalshi, Polymarket—are just trolling, right? There’s this one image of 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey with the caption “Loves receiving balls,” right?\n\nAnd it was just this big sort of trade, or “on the disabled list”–style, graphic. But again, as you said, they don’t link to it. But it’s almost just kind of like, We’re having fun on here, too. Why don’t you come have fun on our place, and, you know, take advantage of this?\n\nBut, you talk about this dumb money. And you described it, in this great Substack post that we’ll link to, as the part of the male “suckerification crisis.” And can you elaborate a little more on that? I think that’s sort of your corollary to the male loneliness crisis they’re in. But what are you saying here?\n\nRead: I feel like one of the big stories on the internet—and in society at large—over the last five years or so has been the extent to which young men have fallen under the spell, or the sway, of a variety of different kinds of scammers, hucksters, fraudsters. When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money. Though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of—both commercial and political—apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money.\n\nAnd I think that there’s something about, I don’t have a grand … you know, this is more of a corkboard-and-red-yarn theory than an equation, right? Warzel: We love that. Read: But I see these connections. I see these sort of basic dynamics play out in straight old-fashioned sports gambling, which has sort of taken over sports media. That was legalized a few years ago and now kind of dominates the way we talk about sports in the country. At least, in the media that has written about sports and filmed about sports. I see it in prediction markets as well. Talking about this, sort of, Kalshi and Polymarket Twitter feeds that we’re talking about. You know, the sense that This is gambling kind of creeping into even more layers of life, layers of social life.\n\nI see it in the kind of manosphere-influencer guys. These sort of perennial subjects, objects of moral panic. But, you know—the main sort of dynamic I see there is not necessarily even kind of ideological, radicalization on the part of somebody like Andrew Tate. But the way that they are selling a particular story and a particular product to a bunch of young men that kind of cultivates them as suckers, that turns them into suckers.\n\nAnd I think that Trumpist politics—by which I mean both the Republican Party under Donald Trump, but also all kinds of right-wing, reactionary politics—emerge out of the same sort of soup. You know. This highly emotive insistence that—as you sort of put it earlier—Institutions are failing you, but we’ve got the cure. We’ve got the ticket; you can participate in this movement. You can show everybody that you’re smarter than everybody else. Here’s the secret to making money. Here’s the secret to, you know, winning in politics. Here’s the secret to getting girls. Whatever it is. It’s funny to me how much you can sort of see that same dynamic across what should, theoretically, be these quite different kinds of spheres. But seem to, in fact, kind of be converging on this one sort of business model, more or less.\n\nYou know, just to provide some historical perspective—Rick Perlstein, the historian, has a really wonderful essay in The Baffler from maybe 10 or more years ago that I think about all the time in terms of this. I think it’s called “The Long Con.” And it’s about the origins of the conservative movement in the 1950s and the extent to which the conservative movement has always been deeply tangled up with, basically, snake-oil mailing lists.\n\nThat a huge part of what powers the conservative movement is access to mailing lists of low social trust. Reactionary voters who are willing to buy what you’re selling if you speak the right language, more or less. And, as I was saying before, I think Twitter feels sort of like a really sophisticated version of that.\n\nAnd I think that this whole complex of businesses are finding new ways to sort of exploit that particular dynamic. And, to some extent, I think this is a sort of layered process, right? That you go on Twitter—it’s a social media site. It’s, you know, highly volatile. You’re constantly feeling like everybody else is getting more views than you.\n\nYou’re constantly sort of feeling you’re in this strange space that you don’t necessarily understand. You know, you’re surrounded by people who are expressing that same strange feeling. It feels a lot like being in the economy, too, doesn’t it? And isn’t politics also this strange, volatile space?\n\nSurely there’s a way we can all make a little extra money off of it. We’re constantly in competition. It’s not a hard-and-fast theory. It’s this set of affective triggers, right? These sort of—this vibe that’s out there that seems to be quite inescapable. In particular for, you know, recent college graduates. Kids in college, even in high school,\n\nWarzel: Right. And there’s this way that it’s this reinforcing system, right? If you do fall into those, into that mindset, you enter into a place that sort of embraces the chaos, embraces the precarity therein, right? And then feeling all that gives you. The only possible way out, right?\n\nThe only possible latch onto a kind of, you know, new version of the American Dream. Which is just like, I buy this memecoin low, I sell high. Right? I get in this place here, and it’s—but that usually doesn’t work out well for most people, right? A lot of the dumb money. And then you get back in this cycle of precarity resentment.\n\nOkay, now we have the antidote to that. And the cycle just repeats over and over again.\n\nRead: One thing I would add, that I didn’t really write about in this piece—but that has been something on my mind for a long time, because I feel it too—is a sort of increasing sense in American society that everybody else is getting one over on you and/or the system.\n\nAnd that in fact, if you let everybody else get one over on you, you are weak, and you have made a mistake. You know, you are a sucker. When, in fact, I think in many ways it’s sort of the reverse. That it’s like, if you’re constantly trying—if you’re the one who’s constantly trying to get one over—you probably are a sucker yourself.\n\nAnd, you know, I think there’s—I mean, the root cause here, I would say, is sort of society-wide breakdown of trust in institutions. You know, in the sense that institutions are in it for themselves, and they are, you know, corrupt. And giving handouts to their people and not to you.\n\nAgain, this is also this sort of vibe that seeps out and powers a lot of the kind of activity around predictions markets. But also around a bunch of these other businesses and figures.\n\nWarzel: I wanna test out a theory on all this that’s maybe another side of it. Or maybe it’s just this in a different skin, but which is, very broadly, this idea that it’s exceedingly hard in a mature attention economy to sell something, right?\n\nAnd it is because of all the competition for attention. And it’s much easier to sell a derivative of that thing. I read this post a couple weeks ago that was talking about movie marketing, and how it’s kind of just gone haywire. And this idea that stars are doing things that aren’t like a traditional junket, where they’re talking about the film with a hundred different people. But they’re going on a hundred different podcasts or, you know, video shows or whatever.\n\nAnd basically doing viral skits, right? You can kind of start at Hot Ones. But then you can trace this to Jennifer Lawrence and her co-star Robert Pattinson doing lie-detector tests, right? A lot of celebrities doing lie-detector tests for Vanity Fair or whatever. And it’s good content. People watch it. People are interested in it. It’s good for the timeline. But it historically is not selling these movies, right? Because they’re not talking about the film. They’re talking about themselves in the hope that they’re going to garner enough attention to sell a film.\n\nRight? And, I think of that idea of a derivative of something. I think about it, very obviously, with sports gambling, right? Leagues are interested in having this, because it does draw attention to the games, right? Adam Silver, the NBA’s commissioner, wrote this op-ed 10 years ago or so, kind of advocating to legalize sports gambling.\n\nAnd there’s this idea that it will draw in interest and attention to this event. But it’s interest and attention essentially to, you know, a game within a game. Right? People are interested in hitting the over; they’re interested in, you know, how many free throws so-and-so gets. Or, you know, misses. Or whatever, right?\n\nAnd I’m curious if you feel this too? That—we see it with elections, right? It doesn’t matter so much about the outcome as much as it is getting the edge. And this idea of financialization of everything. Just creating derivatives of everything to the point where it’s almost impossible to sell a thing.\n\nRead: Yeah. I mean, I think that this is part of the attraction of the prediction market over the regular sports book, too. I guess it’s not just derivatives; it’s securitization. And that you create this object that you can sell and resell at whatever.\n\nYou know, I don’t want to drive the metaphor off a cliff or whatever. But one of the interesting things about those viral videos of, say, Pattinson and Jennifer Lawrence doing the lie-detector test, as you say—probably not very useful for marketing the movie. But that video is now useful to Vanity Fair, or whoever it was that filmed it. And will be useful to them for 10 years, because those are going to be famous people that people will wanna see for 10 years.\n\nLord knows, there’s no time limit for anything on the internet. You now have this thing that just kind of exists in the world. And I think that there’s a real difficulty to find ways to have those derivatives, to maintain their relationship to the bigger project that’s supposed to be pushing forward. The other thing, I would say, that sports thing—what you were saying about sports makes me think is that part of this is about media in general. Right? That we’re increasingly difficult to figure out how to pay for the media that exists, and that we think of presumably as sort of integral to democracy. To our liberal democratic system. And sports arguably runs a little bit ahead of political media, news media, in terms of business models and whatever else. And one of the big reasons that Adam Silver has been an advocate for legalizing gambling—and one of the reasons why all of the media companies, ESPN chief among them, have so enthusiastically embraced sports betting—is that we sort of have reached peak sports.\n\nWe’re a little bit over the hill in peak sports. Basketball is a very good example, because—you know, Mark Cuban was talking about this just last year—nobody thinks the next few TV deals are going to be anywhere near as lucrative as the last few TV deals are. Where the question is: Who is making money and how are they making money?\n\nAnd that’s not just the question for the team owners, who will always make money from the stadium, right? And from the actual games themselves. But how is ESPN going to make money? And the answer, right now, seems to be gambling. We’re going to take gambling sponsorships; we’re going to talk about gambling all the time.\n\nSo when we talk about, like Kalshi and Polymarket. You know, why is CNN so enthusiastic about bringing them on? I mean, they already are, in fact, partnering with Kalshi to, I think—or maybe with Polymarket—to produce odds for them on Election Night. And presumably elsewhere during the political season.\n\nAnd so I think there’s the other part of it, in addition to the kind of structural. The way we think about marketing and attention is to break things off into these little pieces that can be bought and sold. In the last 10 years, it’s that we are facing a crisis for how we pay for these things. And gambling is a traditionally fairly lucrative industry to be in. And, you know, that’s a way that CNN could take itself.\n\nWarzel: You don’t want Cousin Sal to moderate Meet the Press going forward. I feel like that’s a great idea. The partnership is between Kalshi and CNN, and I think that, you’re absolutely right about the “paying for it” part of it. Which is obviously the most important part.\n\nI also think that there is this attentional quality that injects a little bit of—I’m trying to think about this. You know, it feels so dystopian having CNN’s Harry Enten, the polling guy, is going to be the one who’s going to be doing the big board and looking through the Kalshi odds, what they’ve said.\n\nAnd it feels a little dystopian to have that partnership. But also, it injects, I think—for them trying to rationalize it in some way—some excitement into something. That, when you said we’ve reached peak sports a while back, we’ve reached peak politics too.\n\nWe are well beyond peak politics, where everyone is just sort of ground down by, you know, how this works. But also kind of strangely, terminally addicted to it at the same time. You can’t quit it, but there’s nothing in it. And this is sort of—whatever derivative, a securitization. It’s some element that I think also injects … people joke about horse-race coverage. And it’s like, no: We’re actually making a horse race now.\n\nRead: The problem with horse-race coverage was that we didn’t have the horse race yet.\n\nWarzel: Our mutual friend and fellow tech writer John Herrman wrote a thing for the Neiman Lab’s year-end predictions here for 2026—that the media will become addicted to gambling, follow the path of sports media.\n\nIt’s very smart. Do you feel like this is just going to get worse? Where do you see this all moving? Is it just increasingly lawless, like we’re just going to, you know, fall victim to all this? Do you think this is a kind of a fad? Do you think this is maybe something that actually is the injection of capital that these places need? How do you sort of project it going forward?\n\nRead: I am not necessarily as pessimistic. I think that the forces are arrayed in favor of the prediction market becoming a sort of dominant means by which we interpret and understand the world around us.\n\nThere’s a lot of money behind that—and there’s a lot of powerful philosophical and political ideas that want to see something like this, you know, take a larger role in society. And the truth is, in addition to … I don’t even mean to make it sound that sinister. Like, from a banker’s point of view, a stock trader’s point of view, having all these extra hedging instruments is useful. From the point of view of CNN on Election Night, setting aside this sort of question of how much gambling is going to dominate CNN, the prediction markets give us something to talk about that is not that different in terms of its relationship to reality—from polls, say.\n\nSo all this stuff is the money, the philosophy, the use. All that stuff is lined up in a way that gives prediction markets, I think, a big sort of runway to find themselves. To become more and more prominent. And to intermediate more areas of life. That being said, we’ve seen, since 2022—when, I think, sports gambling was legalized in New York—we’ve seen how much sports gambling has taken over sports media. How much sports betting has sort of become this ubiquitous thing in coverage. But my impression—and I think this bears out in most of the polling that’s been done recently—so people actually hate this. Even the young men who are supposed to be the customers don’t really like it very much.\n\nAnd I think that same quality is going to be true of prediction markets. I think there’s a very particular—this is just baseless theorization right here; this is my own version of astrology—but I think there’s a certain kind of person whose brain works in this particular, let’s say Bayesian way. Where they are constantly thinking about things in terms of odds. Where they are calculating in their own heads, you know, arbitrage opportunities and what kinds of bets they’re willing to, you know. They’re doing Kelly criterion bets and whatever calculations in their heads.\n\nAnd I think for those people, these things are incredibly exciting. I think those people are also really heavily concentrated in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, basically. Those are the places you go if that’s the kind of brain you have. I think a lot of the rest of us find it … I mean, I could speak for myself alone, but I know I’m not alone. That kind of way of being in the world—way of thinking about the world—is exhausting. You’re not really thinking about the game. You’re thinking about the over; you’re thinking about the props that you’ve put together.\n\nYou’re thinking about the parlay across the three different games. I think that prediction markets being inserted everywhere else has a very similar kind of quality to it. I wonder if there’s a happy medium? I think with sports betting, what many people sort of now these days believe is that there should not be apps for it.\n\nIt shouldn’t really be legal. There should be a guy that if you have the social wherewithal to find, you can place a bet with, right? But it shouldn’t be the kind of thing where they just roll out the red carpet, and there’s a lubricated path to losing all of your money.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sympathetic to that. I don’t know if that makes me an old man.\n\nWarzel: I think what you’re saying is: Friction is a good thing, right? Friction is helpful here. And a lot of these betting apps … I actually can’t speak to Kalshi or Polymarket, but like the the DraftKings, FanDuel—they’re literally sending push notifications. Of like, This is about to happen. You know, whatever it is.\n\nIt’s not even neutral, in the sense that it’s easily accessible. It’s like the bookie is sitting on your couch, you know? Asking you if you’d like to get in on this. Right? So you have that element; you have the idea that gambling itself in all things—whether it’s on elections, whether it’s on whatever—gambling is not a static thing, right? Every different type. There’s so many different types of gambling, of ways to bet, that can give you slightly better odds. Or that are, you know, based off of skill instead of blind luck. And the idea that the closer you get to the slot machine, right? Just pull and, you know, a couple of things have to line up—that’s the worst part of gambling. And that’s what we are moving toward; this tech-enabled stuff tends to resemble that more than it resembles, you know, betting on who’s going to win in a golf match, with your friends or whatever. And then I think you’re right about the exhaustion of it all.\n\nAnd it reminds me of the nature of these companies, right? This focus and need on scaling. A lot of these companies—like Kalshi just raised a billion dollars earlier in December from some of the major tech venture capitalists. They’re obviously going to need to scale. Their CEO said now, infamously, the goal is to financialize every single difference of opinion in the world. Which, as you put, is patently the most exhausting thing you could imagine.\n\nNo disagreement goes unmonetized is like—just end it all now. I think, unlike you, I do feel it’s a little sinister. Listening to you talk about the relationship of the risk, the volatility, you know, the gambling, the sort of reactionary poking and prodding and trolling on X to get you in the funnel, to put you into this precarious situation.\n\nAll of that, to me, actually feels it is bad. And that feels dominant to me, over “This is a really great way to get a bird’s-eye view of a situation.”\n\nRead: I probably am being too kind. I do think it is sinister. And I think that it’s bad in an absolute sense. But I am, also—I feel like it’s good to be conscious of the uses that it has. And the kinds of forces that are arrayed in its favor. And that it’s not a cash grab, and it’s not a kind of, necessarily, a pure philosophical dispute—that there are serious institutions for whom this represents a windfall or a new method of doing what they do.\n\nI wonder a little bit. Let me preface this by saying this, as a sort of depressing thought that I’m not necessarily endorsing. But, you know, one reason I think that sports gambling has taken off so wildly—and one reason I think even stuff like fantasy football, which is in some ways quite similar to gambling, but obviously also very different in important ways—is the extent to which sports as a pastime, or as an entertainment, represent a kind of … I’ll take baseball for an example.\n\nSay that baseball is kind of a solved game. You have a pretty good sense at the very beginning of the season. You know people are very good at projecting who’s going to win, how many wins there’re going to be. What you’re waiting for is injuries. And then, the playoffs.\n\nIt’s not luck, but it’s basically luck. I say that, you know—it’s probably the greatest World Series of my lifetime, this past year. But one thing that I think that gambling allows us to do in in a world—in, like, the NBA, when a third of regular-season games, most of the stars just flat out aren’t playing. Which I know that the NBA hates, but is also exactly what you need to do, because that’s a problem that has now been solved by resting people.\n\nWhat you find yourself wanting to get: the sense of volatility—the sense of unexpected delight and whatever else gambling becomes—the way you get out of sports. That what feels harder and harder to get as more and more money gets applied to, like, figuring out the secrets to winning each one of these.\n\nAnd I’m not sure what the way to apply that is as a metaphor to the rest of the world out there. But I think that part of what the attraction here, too, is taking things that have been optimized to hell. Like, whatever it is. The things that no longer give you the same kind of burst of enjoyment because you know what to expect from them, at all times.\n\nAnd the gambling—you know, the prediction market, the gambling, the wagers. They give you that little extra burst of dopamine, energy, enjoyment, excitement. Because all of a sudden you’re attaching some money to something that isn’t the necessarily even the main point of the game. And I think, to me, that’s depressing. Because I’m sympathetic to it. Right. Though I’m sympathetic to that desire to try and find the same kind of enjoyment. But also because that’s the thing that, I think, hooks people—more than the sort of sense that, Oh, I can find the edge by doing my calculations in my head. And every dispute is going to be financialized, and we’re going to figure that out.\n\nIt’s more like: I just wanna take a little risk somewhere. Like, a fairly safe risk. Just to give myself … just to feel something, somewhere. Just to feel something.\n\nWarzel: The thing that makes me think about with sports—especially in baseball, where we’re about to go into, a year from now, these major labor disputes with the unions—is this inequality, right? There is this fundamental inequality in baseball between the haves and the have-nots. And the big-market teams and the Cincinnati Reds. Or like, you know, what have you. And in that, you do have that situation often in a fanbase of Okay, well, if we make the playoffs, we’re going to get, you know, absolutely destroyed in the first round. And that’s a good year. And “enjoy the ride,” right? But it’s getting something else there. And then when I try to think—does that apply broadly out to politics?\n\nOf course, maybe not exactly, right? It’s not a total inequality thing. But it is this sort of feeling like the system isn’t going to move, right? Like it’s sclerotic in this way. Like you’re not going to get a candidate that’s just going to come out of nowhere, unless you have, you know, these instances like Mamdani.\n\nRead: I mean, look at how much energy, I mean, even Kamala Harris’s emergence—in 18 hours as the Democratic nominee, after [Joe] Biden [dropped out], had that burst of energy. Because it was such an unexpected historical event. Even if she was, you know, not the most exciting candidate to young people in the world, or whatever. She was a sort of—exactly who you would’ve “expect the unexpectedness” about. It gave that extra bit of energy.\n\nWarzel: I think that that is such a good way to frame all of this in a world that’s feeling a little bit locked, right? Where everything seems a little locked, this is injecting a kind of chaos that allows people to feel.\n\nRead: I think that’s real. Well, the other thing—and I would say two things on top of that. One is: I think—just to reconnect some of the stuff we were talking about before—I think it is relatively similar to some of the appeal of social networks, which have a volatility to them. And I think that one of the reasons that Twitter is less—and Facebook too, are less and less, and Instagram even—become less and less interesting to people is probably because they become sort of solved games. And, you know, what does well in the algorithm. What does well. It’s much harder to have that pop of the thing that you get really early on a social network—always like, I’ve never seen something like this before. This is so weird. This kind of person, you could still sort of find it there. But those that like volatility, it’s there in a certain limited way. But not in the same way. The other thing, I would say, is that this feeling we’re talking about—I think what’s at stake is a sense that there’s very little to surprise us anymore.\n\nAnd this is, again, a sort of a vibe more than it is a fact. But there is this vibe of, like, Everything’s optimized to hell. Everybody, for the most part, acts really cautious in their given settings, the domains in which they’re playing. It’s hard to find surprise. Gambling at least gives us some level of, you know—allows us to feel something, as we put it.\n\nBut what prediction markets effectively do, over the long term, is even eliminate that from gambling. Because what you’re doing—once the market is big enough, once enough people are betting—all of a sudden all the surprises are kind of gone. Except for weather events, right?\n\nIt’s the last thing that you could bet on: where there’s some possibly there won’t be rain, despite the 90 percent–chance forecast the next day. And I think it’s self-defeating. I suppose. I don’t like … that’s a science-fiction story more than it is something that we really have to worry about at this point.\n\nBut I think that ultimately the point of the prediction market is to reassert the primacy of locked-in predictions. Even if what makes it interesting right now is the enjoyment of risk and novelty and surprise.\n\nWarzel: I love the idea that eventually the prediction market, it eats its own young at the end of it. I think that’s a great place to leave it. Max Read, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain.\n\nRead: It was absolutely my pleasure.

Their Decision on Releasing Their 2024 Autopsy Report Says It All","text":"As we reported, new polling brought some bad news for congressional Democrats. \n\nThey hit their lowest rating ever, with only 18 percent approval, 73 percent disapproval in a new Quinnipiac poll.\n\nAs CNN data guru Harry Enten explained, they were \"-55 net approval, an all-time low & lower than the Dead Sea.\" \n\nWhat was worse for them was that even amongst their own party, they were underwater, with only 42 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving. Their party approval had taken a nosedive since October, after they failed in the government shutdown fight. \n\nDespite that, they were ahead on the generic ballot by about four points. But as Enten noted, this should be much higher normally for the midterms, where the party out of power usually has the advantage. It showed how weak they were. \n\nREAD MORE: Make It Make Sense: Dem Approval Rating Falls Off a Cliff, but Voters Have Baffling Reaction\n\nNow, on Friday, two new polls, Emerson and Quantus Insights, show Democrats only up by two points in the generic ballot, which is even better than the numbers Enten had mentioned. Quantus has it at 43 to 41 percent, and Emerson has it at 44 to 42 percent. \n\nThen, on top of that, the DNC's Ken Martin announced that they wouldn't be releasing the autopsy report on why they lost in 2024. \n\nKen Martin, the chairman of the D.N.C., said on Thursday that he had decided not to publish a report that he ordered months ago into what went wrong for the Democratic Party last year. Party officials have conducted more than 300 interviews with Democrats in all 50 states to create a document that Mr. Martin had once pitched as crucial to charting a path forward. Mr. Martin will instead keep the findings under seal. He believes that looking back so publicly and painfully at the past would prove counterproductive for the party as it tries next year to take back power in Congress, according to a D.N.C. spokeswoman who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the thinking behind his decision. “Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” Mr. Martin said in a statement. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”\n\nTranslation? The report shows how bad their issues are; it will hurt and embarrass them. So, like typical Democrats, they just wasted all that time and money because they don't like the reality of what they were told. \n\nThey haven't answered the question, for example, of how Kamala Harris' team threw $1.5 billion down the sewer and didn't even manage to win one swing state. \n\nSimon Bazelon, a Democratic researcher, noted how this decision doesn't help them solve their issues and was \"reflective of a broader problem within the party.\" You can say that again. This is \"hide your head in the sand\" behavior. \n\nThey appear to want to return to their strategy of 2024, just yelling about President Donald Trump. \n\nRepublicans have a real chance here; they need to focus on the economy. They need to remind everyone what a mess things were under the Democrats, going up to 9 percent on inflation, and what they are doing to make things better, as Trump did during his economic address on Wednesday. \n\nREAD MORE: Trump White House Address Touts Administration's Domestic Wins, Announces Christmas Bonus for Troops\n\nThursday's inflation number was good, at 2.7 percent.

Why are Republicans rebutting those charges in much the same way Democrats did?\n\nHypocrisy and double standards in political discourse are not new, but they blur the lines that supposedly fuel our political blood feuds and boost voter cynicism about a rigged game. Those sentiments need no further help to blossom.\n\nThere’s a long list of issues that Democrats didn’t have much to say about up to Jan. 19, Joe Biden’s last full day as president, but have portrayed as four-alarm fires under Donald Trump. Three have dominated: inflation, the president’s health and energy for the job, and hunting down anyone who ever spent time with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump’s hands aren’t clean, either. He has downplayed Americans’ concerns about rising prices, hidden information about his medical fitness for office and governed as if his close victory was a landslide replete with a mandate for rapid, even radical, change — all things he blasted Biden for.\n\nBlame populism for some epic partisan flip-flops\n\nPopulism is a culprit. In a campaign, it’s easy to reflect anger and promise action or retribution. When the time comes to address complex problems such as grocery prices, it can be hard to move quickly or effectively.\n\nWe’ve also come to expect, even accept, that the parties will flip-flop on certain issues based on whether they hold the White House. Democrats loved it when Barack Obama rewrote immigration policy without Congress. When Trump acts unilaterally, they yelp about autocracy. Republicans base their concern level about federal deficits or debt on the outcome of each election. And don’t even try to make sense of what each party truly thinks about partisan redistricting.\n\nThat’s politics. But these latest examples — if you’ll indulge a quick tribute to the late “This Is Spinal Tap” director Rob Reiner — go to 11.\n\nDemocrats scoffed when anyone during Biden’s presidency suggested that maybe Democratic policy of pouring more borrowed federal money into a flush economy could spike prices. Now, they suddenly can’t talk enough about “affordability.” Housing, groceries, cars — Democrats blame Trump for persistent inflation without even acknowledging that layers upon layers of government regulation they championed makes goods more complicated to make and thus more expensive.\n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, announcing her run for Senate, said with a straight face that prices had tripled in a year under Trump. If that were remotely true, it would rank among the all-time inflation disasters, the kind that requires wheelbarrows to carry enough devalued cash to buy a meal.\n\nDemocrats denied Biden’s decline but dwell on Trump’s health\n\nBiden’s four years in office were marked by a steady deterioration of his speech, mobility and clarity. White House aides insisted he was fine, even robust. It wasn’t until Biden’s disastrous performance in a debate that they reacted to what anyone could see.\n\nEven then, they did so not out of concern over whether the country was in steady hands but over the prospect of losing an election. They insisted that while Biden should no longer seek another term, he was fine to stay in office for six more months. His incoherence seems to have been contagious.\n\nNow, some Democrats see a stubborn bruise on Trump’s hand and a 79-year-old man nearly nodding off in a long meeting and declare it’s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office.\n\nTrump plays the same kind of games with his health information. When the president goes for an unscheduled medical exam, as Trump recently did, the country deserves the full story. We don’t even know what caused Trump’s doctors enough concern to order an MRI.\n\nAnd then, there’s Epstein. To hear Democrats over the last few months, there was no higher priority than finding out exactly who might have indulged in heinous crimes with him or helped cover them up. Lawmakers who couldn’t bring themselves to ask if Biden was functional decided transparency was suddenly the nation’s highest priority.\n\nWhat happened during the years in which the Biden administration could have revealed much of the same information? Sure didn’t hear much out of Democrats, then. That’s because for every Trump reference in the much ballyhooed “Epstein files,” there’s probably something to implicate a Democrat or one of the party’s important donors.\n\nBack to Trump for one final example. Biden’s administration tried to pin high food prices on grocers, who typically have low profit margins. Kamala Harris campaigned on a promise to ban “price gouging” in food production. Republicans rightly scoffed that it was a distraction for bad policies. Trump called Harris’ idea “communist.”\n\nNow, Comrade Trump has ordered up an investigation of … wait for it … “price fixing” in the food industry. He’s aiming primarily at foreign companies, but then, the Soviets loved to blame their failed economies on other countries’ meddling, too.\n\nIt’s too much to expect purity in politics. Even a strain of basic consistency is more than some partisans can manage.\n\nBut it fuels the costly cynicism that has Americans throwing up their hands at politics and turning to impossible populist promises. That’s a kind of inflation we can ill afford.\n\nThis story was originally published December 19, 2025 at 10:39 AM.","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/article313820498.html","image":"https://www.star-telegram.com/public/latest-news/1y2aum/picture313820946/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2251913094-GI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:39:44","author":"Andrew Harnik","authors":["Andrew Harnik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":387639264,"title":"Christian Datoc says Trump needs to change his messaging on economy","text":"Datoc said Trump entered office with “some of the highest” approval ratings, but they have steadily decreased. \n\nDatoc emphasized the “most frightening” number for the president, the White House, and Republicans’ hopes of maintaining their majority in Congress is Trump’s economic polling. \n\nJust 33% of adults in the United States approve of the president’s handling of the economy, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll.\n\nDatoc highlighted that this is a 12-point dip from when Trump entered office. \n\n“This is supposed to be the issue, along with immigration, that really sets him apart.

That&#8217;s a mistake.","text":"When Ken Martin was elected chair of the Democratic National Committee in February, he promised a report investigating what went wrong for his party in 2024. “The reality is what we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened last election cycle,” he told reporters. “We know that we lost ground with Latino voters, we know we lost ground with women and younger voters and of course working-class voters. We don’t know the how and why yet.”\n\nTen months later, Martin has made a remarkable reversal. He will not release the long-awaited autopsy, he announced on Thursday, even though it’s done. Despite months of work — including hundreds of interviews with party operatives in all 50 states — and a pledge to use the report to drive the party forward, Martin appears to have decided that publishing it would be a “distraction.” \n\nThat the DNC is mothballing whatever audit it could bring itself to conduct underscores that the party remains petrified of its own reflection.\n\n“In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future. Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission,” Martin said in a statement explaining his decision.\n\nStrangely, Martin doesn’t seem to perceive the conflict in deeming “learning from the past” important and then torpedoing his party’s attempt to do so. \n\nShelving the document isn’t exactly a disaster: Leaks to the press as the DNC autopsy was being assembled suggested that the report would be a comically superficial analysis, mostly thanks to the committee’s narrow scope of investigation. But combine the less-than-rigorous postmortem and the about-face on releasing it, and Democrats should be embarrassed. \n\nTo understand how allergic the party remains to any serious introspection, consider that in July, The New York Times, citing people briefed on the process of the DNC audit, reported that it was “expected to avoid the questions of whether former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should have run for re-election in the first place, whether he should have exited the race earlier than he did and whether former Vice President Kamala Harris was the right choice to replace him.” The audit also wasn’t expected to revisit important Harris campaign decisions, the Times reported, including “framing the election as a choice between democracy and fascism, and refraining from hitting back after an ad by Donald J. Trump memorably attacked Ms. Harris on transgender rights.”\n\nApparently the DNC was terrified from the outset of any serious reckoning with the many things it got wrong last year. (The Times’ July article had this great zinger: “Party officials described the draft document as focusing on the 2024 election as a whole, but not on the presidential campaign — which is something like eating at a steakhouse and then reviewing the salad.”) It could, of course, be divisive to reconsider the biggest decisions defining the election. But that is precisely the kind of thing a party has to endure when it has record-low approval from its own voters and voters have handed the keys to the republic over to a narcissistic and self-enriching demagogue for a second time. \n\nWe don’t know what the unpublished report ended up concluding, but the Times reported Thursday that the “prescriptions were more tactical than strategic,” citing DNC officials’ summary of the findings. Among other things, the audit reportedly questioned the efficacy of peer-to-peer text messaging in influencing voters, as well as door-knocking quotas. This is an entirely different universe of self-scrutiny than the reflections suggested by those of us who have long argued that the party had no real policy vision or that Biden’s age was a threat to his candidacy.\n\nTo be sure, a party autopsy wouldn’t preclude future mistakes. And the reality is that a strong Democratic candidate could disregard its lessons and still win, as President Donald Trump did in 2016.\n\nStill, the fact that the DNC is mothballing whatever audit it could bring itself to conduct underscores that the party remains petrified of its own reflection. The document might have been weak sauce, but releasing it would have at least created a record of how the party viewed itself and laid out the parameters of how the establishment was and wasn’t willing to change to meet the challenges of our era. It would have become a potential source of accountability — even if primarily through criticism from progressives in and outside the party about how the self-assessment didn’t go far enough. \n\nThe Democratic establishment, trying to save face, is sweeping some hard truths under the rug. Doing so all but ensures that it won’t evolve into a party worthy of the country’s trust.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/dnc-autopsy-report-2024-ken-martin","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766089486/251218-ken-martin-es/251218-ken-martin-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:21:27","author":"Zeeshan Aleem","authors":["Zeeshan Aleem"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":387639270,"title":"Ocasio-Cortez has a ‘real shot’ at the presidency by following Trump 2024 model","text":"Many of the political pros think she may be on to something, especially since no Democrat has seized the 2028 mantle.

If you attack the Philippines, it is like attacking the US itself and the latter will respond correspondingly, in accordance with its constitutional processes. Under Donald Trump, that defense guarantee was upgraded to “ironclad.”\n\nIn 2022, then vice president Kamala Harris told President Marcos Jr. that “an armed attack on the Philippines armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US Mutual Defense commitments.”\n\nIn September 2024, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III reaffirmed America’s “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines after China’s latest effort to assert its naval presence in the South China Sea\n\nOn Oct. 30, 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. They announced the creation of “Task Force Philippines” – a joint initiative aimed at improving US-Philippines cooperation and interoperability. \n\nAccordingly, the U.S. Pacific Fleet announced that the task force would increase preparedness for contingencies so that “we can decisively respond to crisis or aggression and reestablish deterrence in the South China Sea,” said Hegseth. He also assured the US would not introduce new US combat forces, conduct offensive operations or result in permanent military basing in the Philippines. The US has nine EDCA (or bases) sites in our country.\n\nAn Inquirer editorial of Dec. 18, 2025 sneered at so-called “ironclad” defense commitments of the US. It cited a December 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) published by the White House which seems to undercut sweet “ironclad” talk. Donald Trump’s 33-page paper does not mention Manila at all.\n\nThe NSS, frets The New York Times, “describes a world in which American interests are far narrower than how prior administrations – even in Mr. Trump’s first term – had portrayed them. Gone is the long-familiar picture of the United States as a global force for freedom, replaced by a country that is focused on reducing migration while avoiding passing judgment on authoritarians, instead seeing them as sources of cash.”\n\nSays the NYT: “China is cast as a competitor, but mainly in the familiar commercial terms often repeated by Mr. Trump. The document says a war over Taiwan needs to be deterred because of what would be its ‘major implications for the US economy.’ It calls for ‘a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing,’ echoing the conciliation of the trade truce that Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, announced in October.”\n\nToday, the US won’t just go to any war, for any reason. Before waging any war, America must first use diplomacy and economic leverage.\n\n“A world on fire, where wars come to our shores, is bad for American interests. President Trump uses unconventional diplomacy, America’s military might and economic leverage to surgically extinguish embers of division between nuclear-capable nations and violent wars caused by centuries-long hatred,” says the NSS.\n\nOn burden-sharing and burden-shifting, the NSS says: “The days of the US propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over. We count among our many allies and partners dozens of wealthy, sophisticated nations that must assume primary responsibility for their regions and contribute far more to our collective defense.”\n\nThe 32 NATO countries must now spend for their own defense, by raising their defense spending to five percent of GDP. The US will help, but only if it can do business, but not to buy guns for the use of allies.\n\n“The United States will stand ready to help – potentially through more favorable treatment on commercial matters, technology sharing and defense procurement – those counties that willingly take more responsibility for security in their neighborhoods and align their export controls with ours,” says the NSS.\n\nPeace is Trump’s priority, not war. His concept of war is not about weapons, but economic warfare.\n\n“Seeking peace deals at the President’s direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate core interests, is an effective way to increase stability, strengthen America’s global influence, realign countries and regions toward our interests and open new markets,” says the NSS.\n\nGoing forward, relates the NSS, “we will rebalance America’s economic relationship with China, prioritizing reciprocity and fairness to restore American economic independence. Trade with China should be balanced and focused on non-sensitive factors.” \n\n“If America remains on a growth path – and can sustain that while maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing – we should be headed from our present $30-trillion economy in 2025 to $40 trillion in the 2030s, putting our country in an enviable position to maintain our status as the world’s leading economy. Our ultimate goal is to lay the foundation for long-term economic vitality.”\n\nAdds the NSS, “the US must work with our treaty allies and partners – who together add another $35 trillion in economic power to our own $30-trillion national economy (together constituting more than half the world economy) – to counteract predatory economic practices and use our combined economic power to help safeguard our prime position in the world economy and ensure that allied economies do not become subordinate to any competing power. \n\n“We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan and the United States (‘the Quad’). \n\n“Moreover, we will also work to align the actions of our allies and partners with our joint interest in preventing domination by any single competitor nation.”\n\nMeanwhile, the US Senate has approved a $2.5-billion security assistance to the Philippines. Trump will sign the bill into law.\n\nThe bipartisan Philippines Enhanced Resilience Act (PERA Act) extends $500 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant to Manila from 2026 to 2030, or $2.5 billion over five years.\n\nEmail: biznewsasia@gmail.com","url":"https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2025/12/20/2495539/us-interest-asia-business-not-war","image":"https://media.philstar.com/images/filler/opinion-logo-filler-thumbnail.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:00:00","author":"Tony Lopez","authors":["Tony Lopez"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.116},{"id":387718176,"title":"As America Turns 250, Here's How One Content Creator Is Making Patriotism Shareable Again","text":"As 2025 winds down, 2026 is not just a new year — it marks the 250th anniversary of the United States of America. That means patriotism and American history will be front and center as we inch closer to the Fourth of July. We couldn't be happier that President Trump will be leading the nation on that momentous day instead of Kamala Harris, and we're sure the celebrations will be ones to remember.\n\nFor one social media content creator, 2026 is also an opportunity to help spread the messages of American history and American patriotism both on- and offline.\n\nMatt Stanton started the USA and American Flag accounts on Instagram. Townhall recently spoke with him about his social media efforts and his vision for the future.\n\n\"I'm trying to build a pocket in the social media universe, connecting people through patriotism and the American flag,\" Stanton said. \"The way America is right now, if you post patriotic stuff, people just assume you're aligned with Trump.\"\n\nStanton says the America-flag type patriotism should be the \"north star,\" and his focus is to \"give people shareable content that's not overly in support of a candidate.\"\n\n\"It's effective,\" Stanton said. \"If I just got a patriotic message out there, it'll help bring people in and unify people.\"\n\nStanton said he'd also like to help champion other content creators like Teag \"Pure Joy\" McCoy, Staton sees it as a way to springboard patriotic content creators. \n\n\"Going into 2026, building a core audience around patriotism and trying to use it as a launchpad for individual creators to really amplify their voice and provide a platform for their voice,\" Staton said, will help \"grow their content and bring people together under the flag and patriotism.\"\n\nStanton noted the Townhall readership embraces this patriotism, and when readers share content like a crowd chanting \"USA\" at a sporting event, he said, \"It helps bring people together and indirectly elevates patriotism.\"\n\nDeveloping that patriotism is important. During the conversation with Townhall, Stanton discussed Alec Penstone, the 100-year-old British World War II veteran. Penstone joined Good Morning Britain on Remembrance Day and tearfully said the sacrifices his generation made during that war weren't worth it.\n\n\"My message is, I can see in my mind's eye those rows and rows of white stones and all the hundreds of my friends who gave their lives, for what? The country of today? No, I'm sorry - but the sacrifice wasn't worth the result of what it is now,\" Penstone said. \"What we fought for was our freedom, but now it's a darn sight worse than when I fought for it.\"\n\nStanton said he found the interviewer's demeanor off-putting. \"Her reaction was so elitist and so dismissive of him,\" Stanton remarked. He added that it was important to pay attention to things across the pond. \"What happens in Europe generally migrates to the U.S. in terms of governmental policies and all that stuff.\"\n\nAfter the July assassination attempt against President Trump, Stanton said he saw a rise in patriotism. \"A lot of hidden Trump supporters came out of the woodwork,\" he noted. \"Elon Musk was probably the most influential of those.\"\n\nStanton, who has worked closely with the entire Turning Point USA organization for years, was also deeply impacted by the assassination of founder Charlie Kirk in September.\n\nHe described the Turning Point staff as \"absolutely great people\" and said, \"After the Charlie Kirk assassination, it really kind of mobilized the youth and everyone like that to take the reins and start smaller accounts, which have grown and seen more shares, especially in patriotic content.\"\n\nBut that outspoken patriotism also comes with risks. Stanton said the recent shooting at Brown University, where sophomore Ella Cook, vice president of the school's College Republicans, was killed, along with MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Uzbekistan. Stanton said that the shooting was just as scary as Kirk's.\n\nHe noted that many conservative influencers are facing increased threats to their safety. \"The Left always likes to say the right is the side of violence, but if you’re a Kamlaa Harris or a Democrat influencer, you’re not paying money for security,\" Stanton said.\n\nDespite that, he's hopeful and optimistic for the future. When it comes to building social media, he says there's a lot of strategy, including having certain \"content pillars.\"\n\n\"There are certain phrases that I lean into, like 'The European mind cannot comprehend' or 'Share with a patriot,'\" Stanton said. Those things make content that's designed to be shareable and relatable. He also said staying abreast of news and things that are trending on X, Google, and Facebook can help drive content and sharing.\n\n\"Have a plan, if you want to be a social media creator...have a plan and stick with it,\" Staton said. \"You're not going to grow thousands of followers overnight, but if you're consistent with it...you have to make sure you stick to that plan. I stuck to a plan and I was able to grow this thing.\"\n\nThe USA Instagram account has 1.3 million followers, and the American Flag Instagram account has more than 225,000 followers.\n\nWhen asked about burnout, Stanton said, \"Burnout does exist, and you have to figure out a way to cope with the burnout.\"\n\n\"I work 24/7,\" Stanton said. I post basically every single day. It can be exhausting at times. You just really have to be passionate for the subject matter you're building these pages around.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Townhall, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.\n\nHelp us continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration and its successes.

That’s the theory. The Philippines is the only and oldest defense and treaty ally of the US in Asia. \n\nUnder the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951, an attack on one is an attack on the other. If you attack the Philippines, it is like attacking the US itself and the latter will respond correspondingly, in accordance with its constitutional processes. Under Donald Trump, that defense guarantee was upgraded to “ironclad.”\n\nIn 2022, then vice president Kamala Harris told President Marcos Jr. that “an armed attack on the Philippines armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US Mutual Defense commitments.”\n\nIn September 2024, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III reaffirmed America’s “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines after China’s latest effort to assert its naval presence in the South China Sea\n\nOn Oct. 30, 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. They announced the creation of “Task Force Philippines” – a joint initiative aimed at improving US-Philippines cooperation and interoperability. \n\nAccordingly, the U.S. Pacific Fleet announced that the task force would increase preparedness for contingencies so that “we can decisively respond to crisis or aggression and reestablish deterrence in the South China Sea,” said Hegseth. He also assured the US would not introduce new US combat forces, conduct offensive operations or result in permanent military basing in the Philippines. The US has nine EDCA (or bases) sites in our country.\n\nAn Inquirer editorial of Dec. 18, 2025 sneered at so-called “ironclad” defense commitments of the US. It cited a December 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) published by the White House which seems to undercut sweet “ironclad” talk. Donald Trump’s 33-page paper does not mention Manila at all.\n\nThe NSS, frets The New York Times, “describes a world in which American interests are far narrower than how prior administrations – even in Mr. Trump’s first term – had portrayed them. Gone is the long-familiar picture of the United States as a global force for freedom, replaced by a country that is focused on reducing migration while avoiding passing judgment on authoritarians, instead seeing them as sources of cash.”\n\nSays the NYT: “China is cast as a competitor, but mainly in the familiar commercial terms often repeated by Mr. Trump. The document says a war over Taiwan needs to be deterred because of what would be its ‘major implications for the US economy.’ It calls for ‘a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing,’ echoing the conciliation of the trade truce that Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, announced in October.”\n\nToday, the US won’t just go to any war, for any reason.

Marketing did.","text":"I oppose Zohran Mamdani’s Democratic Socialist agenda. But if Republicans are serious about winning elections next year and in 2028, they need to take a hard, unsentimental look at how he just won one of the most consequential mayoral races in the country.\n\nThis was not an ideological earthquake. New York did not suddenly “discover” socialism. What happened was a marketing and mobilization breakthrough. Mamdani’s campaign understood attention, simplicity, participation, and distribution better than anyone else in the race.\n\nRepublicans often confuse seriousness with stiffness. Mamdani showed that message discipline does not require lifelessness.\n\nJoe Perello, the city of New York’s first chief marketing officer, noted in PRWeek after Mamdani’s victory that the campaign did more than communicate a message. It built an engine that converted online engagement into real-world turnout.\n\n“For marketers and strategists alike, the implications are clear,” Perello wrote. “Growth hacking, iterative testing, and data-driven amplification can convert digital sentiment into real-world behavior. In Mamdani’s case, that meant converting hearts, clicks, and hashtags into ballots.”\n\nHere is the part many on the right do not want to hear: Mamdani did not spend his time lecturing working-class voters about the virtues of socialism or defending failed economic theory. He focused on immediate, kitchen-table concerns and paired them with simple, slogan-ready answers.\n\nIs halal food expensive? Make it cheaper. Struggling to get to work? Free buses. Grocery bills too high? Government-run grocery stores.\n\nHe took Bernie Sanders’ 2016-era talking points and filtered them through a polished, Obama-style optimism that voting-age New Yorkers were willing to engage with.\n\nMost voters do not have the time — or patience — to think through how these promises would actually work. They just want to hear that someone intends to make their lives easier.\n\nAs Citizens Alliance CEO Cliff Maloney observed during Mamdani’s surge in the polls, the public’s lack of understanding about how government operates — and how socialism consistently fails — created the political environment Mamdani exploited. He did not create that environment. He mastered it.\n\nRepublicans’ digital blind spot\n\nFor years, Republican campaigns have treated digital media as messaging rather than infrastructure. Social platforms are used as megaphones for press releases, fundraising tools, or dumping grounds for cable-news clips. The underlying assumption is that persuasion happens elsewhere — on TV, at rallies, through mailers — and that digital simply amplifies those efforts.\n\nMamdani reversed that logic. Social media was not an accessory to his campaign. It was the campaign.\n\nHis approach drew praise even from outlets like the Guardian, where journalist Adam Gabbatt noted that Mamdani “has won social media with clips that are always fun — and resolutely on-message.”\n\nHis team treated TikTok and Instagram like serious growth channels. Short videos were not vanity content; they were experiments. Different neighborhoods, different faces, different tones, different pacing. What held attention? What sparked comments? What traveled across boroughs? Each post generated data, and each data point informed the next iteration.\n\nThis was politics run as a full-funnel acquisition strategy. Awareness led to engagement. Engagement led to identification. Identification led to turnout. Republicans can mock the aesthetics, but the mechanics work.\n\nEnergy is a signal\n\nOne of the most underrated elements of Mamdani’s campaign was how it looked. He was constantly in motion — walking Manhattan, running a marathon, bouncing between boroughs. Rarely behind a lectern. Rarely static. Always visible.\n\nThat energy communicated youth, optimism, and confidence in the same way John F. Kennedy outperformed Richard Nixon on television in 1960. A similar contrast appeared in 2024, when Donald Trump’s unscripted, high-visibility media strategy stood in sharp contrast to Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ tightly controlled appearances.\n\nThe predictable response on the right is dismissal. ‘That’s just TikTok nonsense.’ ‘Our voters aren’t like that.’ Those excuses are comforting — and dangerously wrong.\n\nIn an age of low trust and low information, energy reads as competence. Movement suggests effort. Visibility substitutes for familiarity. Mamdani’s omnipresence created the impression — fair or not — that he was accessible and engaged with everyday life.\n\nRepublicans often confuse seriousness with stiffness. Mamdani showed that message discipline does not require lifelessness.\n\nRELATED: When Bernie Sanders and I agree on AI, America had better pay attention\n\n Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrom supporters to fans\n\nThe most uncomfortable lesson for traditional campaigns is that Mamdani did not just mobilize voters. He activated fandom.\n\nMuch of the campaign content that flooded social media did not come from official accounts. It came from supporters remixing clips, creating fan art, cutting moments to music, and sharing them within their own networks. The campaign made Mamdani easy to clip, easy to celebrate, and then got out of the way.\n\nWired magazine described it as a rare case of participatory political culture usually reserved for celebrities.\n\nThis matters because peer-to-peer persuasion scales faster and carries more credibility than anything a campaign can manufacture. Fan-made content travels further, feels more authentic, and costs nothing. Republicans, by contrast, tend to over-police their messaging, choking off organic enthusiasm in the name of control.\n\nYounger voters understand fandom instinctively. They grew up online. Mamdani did not lecture them about politics; he gave them something to belong to.\n\nThe wrong reaction\n\nThe predictable response on the right is dismissal. “That only works for Democrats.” “That’s just TikTok nonsense.” “Our voters aren’t like that.”\n\nThose excuses are comforting — and dangerously wrong.\n\nTrump understood this dynamic in 2024 when his campaign was largely shut out of legacy media. Figures like Charlie Kirk reached millions of Gen Z voters by blending serious political content with the humor and energy of youth activism.\n\nAlgorithms do not have ideologies. Participation is not a left-wing monopoly. Visibility, simplicity, and community are not progressive inventions. In a low-information, high-attention environment, the side that understands distribution wins.\n\nThe real danger is not Mamdani’s policies alone. It is a Republican Party that keeps confusing being correct with being effective.\n\nRELATED: How anti-fascism became the West’s civil religion\n\n Blaze Media Illustration\n\nWhat Republicans should learn — now\n\nFirst, treat digital as organizing, not advertising. Stop thinking in posts and start thinking in systems. How does attention become action?\n\nSecond, simplicity wins. Republicans often pride themselves on being right — and then lose because they are incomprehensible. Clarity scales. Long explanations do not.\n\nThird, loosen control. Let supporters remix, clip, and share. Reach matters more than perfect phrasing.\n\nFinally, build communities, not just campaigns. Email lists decay. Ad budgets run out. Communities endure.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI do not agree with Zohran Mamdani’s politics, and I do not want his policies implemented anywhere. But ignoring how he won would be malpractice.\n\nHe demonstrated how power is built today — not through party machinery or television dominance, but through attention, participation, and relentless simplicity. Republicans can learn from that reality, or they can keep losing to it.\n\nDisagree with his ideology. But study his marketing. Ignore the lesson at your own risk.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/socialism-didnt-win-new-york-marketing-did","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/socialism-didnt-win-new-york-marketing-did.jpg?id=62607537&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:00:00","author":"Remso W.

But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow’s troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it’s not the lightning advance many expected.“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.Putin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.This year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.While the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.Putin praised Trump’s peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn’t elaborate.He wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.The Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn’t accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”Putin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\"The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,” Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”Commenting on Zelenskyy’s statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn’t made such a move.Putin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.He particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin’s aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump’s recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn’t consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.He alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump’s Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.As it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.On Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.The leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.Using Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”Putin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.But the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.Asked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.The news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.Also Read- 'Olga, Will You Marry Me?': Man Proposes To Girlfriend During Putin's Live Presser | VIDEO","summary":"President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine.

Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump’s peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn’t elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn’t accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language -- demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n“The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,” Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy’s statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn’t made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin’s aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump’s recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn’t consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump’s Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved -- a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheatre as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend.

Honig said on “CNN News Central” that Attorney General Pam Bondi does not have to go into specific details on why certain documents are being withheld from the public.\n\n“DOJ can withhold information relating to ongoing criminal investigations. Now, what criminal investigations are out there? We don’t know. DOJ knows they’re going to be able to redact out information relating to that. And third, any information that might undermine or impact national security or foreign policy. A lot of play there, a lot of wiggle room, a lot of discretion in Pam Bondi’s hands,” Honig said. \n\n“So, so how will we know if we’re getting everything? How will we know if anything’s being withheld?” CNN host John Berman asked. \n\n“We won’t know, nor will Congress,” Honig responded. “The law does require the AG to provide written notification to Congress of anything they withheld, but that’s sort of vague. That’s subject to interpretation. I mean, it could be enough under the law for Pam Bondi to say, ‘dear Congress, dear world, be advised, I have withheld certain materials because they relate to criminal investigations because they relate to national security,’ period. And then there’s not a heck of a lot we can do to get underneath that.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Goes To Bat For Biden Administration Over Not Releasing Epstein Files)\n\nHonig previously criticized Bondi in July over her handling of the files, stating that she made “grandiose promises” that she had failed to fulfill.\n\n“Are there others where the FBI or DOJ has evidence that could have led to criminal charges? I’m not so interested in, in sort of just all the atmospherics, but are there people who evaded meaningful criminal liability here?” Honig said. \n\nThe files gained national attention after the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded in July that Epstein committed suicide in his jail cell and that he never possessed a client list. The memo was an abrupt end to the investigation after Bondi stated that she had the client list on her desk for review.\n\nTrump initially opposed releasing the files, but later changed his tune by saying that he had nothing to hide. Ghislaine Maxwell, the former business partner of Epstein serving a 20-year prison sentence, told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that she never witnessed Trump engage in any inappropriate acts during his friendship with Epstein.\n\nVictims of Epstein’s sex trafficking ring also told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in September that they never witnessed or had any knowledge of Trump committing any wrongdoing.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Pero la lucha pronto degeneró en batallas desgastantes, y las tropas de Moscú han logrado un avance lento pero constante a lo largo de los años. Putin frecuentemente alardea de este progreso, aunque no es el impulso relámpago que muchos esperaban.\n\n“Nuestras tropas avanzan a lo largo de toda la línea de contacto, más rápido en algunas áreas o más lento en otras, pero el enemigo retrocede en todos los sectores”, dijo Putin en la conferencia de prensa en vivo, que se combina con un programa de llamadas a escala nacional que ofrece a los rusos de todo el país la oportunidad de hacer preguntas a su líder.\n\nPutin, de 73 años, ha gobernado el país durante 25 años y utiliza el evento para consolidar su poder y expresar sus opiniones sobre asuntos nacionales y globales.\n\nEste año, la conferencia de prensa tuvo lugar en el contexto de un plan de paz en Ucrania propuesto por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump. A pesar del amplio despliegue diplomático, los esfuerzos de Washington se han topado con demandas fuertemente conflictivas de Moscú y Kiev.\n\nAunque anteriormente el evento se centraba fuertemente en cuestiones nacionales —y daba a Putin la oportunidad de explayarse sobre temas que iban desde el precio de los huevos hasta los cortes de agua—, Ucrania fue el tema dominante este año. Dado que el programa está perfectamente coreografiado, eso podría reflejar el deseo del Kremlin de tranquilizar al público después de casi cuatro años de lucha.\n\nLas demandas rusas permanecen sin cambios\n\nPutin reafirmó que Moscú estaba listo para llegar a un acuerdo pacífico donde se aborden las “causas fundamentales” del conflicto, una referencia a las duras condiciones del Kremlin para un acuerdo.\n\nEl líder ruso quiere que todas las áreas de cuatro regiones clave capturadas por sus fuerzas, así como la península de Crimea, anexada ilegalmente en 2014, sean reconocidas como territorio ruso. También ha insistido en que Ucrania se retire de algunas áreas del este del país que las fuerzas de Moscú aún no han capturado. Kiev ha rechazado públicamente todas estas demandas.\n\nEl Kremlin también ha insistido en que Ucrania abandone su intento de unirse a la OTAN y advirtió que no aceptaría el despliegue de tropas de miembros de la alianza militar y los consideraría como un “objetivo legítimo”.\n\nPutin también ha dicho repetidamente que Ucrania debe limitar el tamaño de su ejército y dar estatus oficial al idioma ruso, demandas que ha hecho desde el inicio del conflicto.\n\nEl presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy ha expresado su disposición a abandonar el intento de Ucrania de unirse a la OTAN si Estados Unidos y otras naciones occidentales le dan a Kiev garantías de seguridad similares a las ofrecidas a los miembros de la alianza. Pero al mismo tiempo, ha enfatizado que Ucrania cree que la membresía en la OTAN sigue siendo la mejor garantía de seguridad.\n\n“Estados Unidos no nos ve en la OTAN, por ahora”, dijo Zelenskyy esta semana. “Los políticos cambian”.\n\nAl hablar sobre la declaración de Zelenskyy de que estaba listo para convocar una elección presidencial si se establece un alto el fuego, Putin respondió que Rusia ha celebrado elecciones sin exigir una tregua. Dijo que Moscú estaba listo para considerar el tema y podría acordar detener los ataques en el interior de Ucrania el día de las elecciones, pero señaló que millones de ucranianos que viven en Rusia deben tener derecho a votar.\n\nPutin rechazó las afirmaciones occidentales sobre supuestos planes rusos para atacar a naciones europeas calificándolas como “puras tonterías” destinadas a desviar la atención pública de los problemas internos.\n\nSeñaló particularmente al secretario general de la OTAN, Mark Rutte, por sus declaraciones sobre las intenciones agresivas del Kremlin, mencionando la estrategia de seguridad nacional recientemente publicada por Trump, en la que no se nombra a Rusia como un adversario directo. “¿Cómo puedes preparar a la OTAN para una guerra con Rusia si el principal miembro de la OTAN no nos considera un enemigo?” dijo Putin.\n\nAlegó que las élites europeas respaldaron “descaradamente” a la rival demócrata de Trump, Kamala Harris, en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 y ahora esperan que el panorama político de Estados Unidos cambie después de las elecciones intermedias para el Congreso, ayudando a aumentar la presión sobre la Casa Blanca.\n\nPutin advierte que cualquier incautación de activos rusos tendrá consecuencias\n\nMientras enfrenta los constantes avances rusos a lo largo de la línea del frente y los implacables ataques a sus instalaciones energéticas, Ucrania está al borde de la bancarrota y necesita desesperadamente más dinero de sus aliados occidentales.\n\nEl viernes, los líderes de la Unión Europea acordaron proporcionar un gran préstamo sin intereses, pero no lograron superar las diferencias con Bélgica que les habrían permitido usar activos rusos congelados para recaudar los fondos.\n\nLos líderes intentaron asegurar a Bélgica, donde se encuentran la mayoría de los activos congelados, que la protegerían de cualquier represalia de Moscú si apoyaba el plan, pero finalmente optaron por pedir prestado el dinero en los mercados de capitales.\n\nPutin dijo que usar activos rusos para ayudar a Kiev habría equivalido a un “robo”, y agregó que la medida habría ahuyentado a los inversores, “causando no solo un golpe de imagen sino socavando la confianza en la eurozona”.\n\nPutin dice que el número de soldados es sólido\n\nPutin dijo a la audiencia que el flujo de soldados voluntarios se ha mantenido fuerte, superando los 400.000 este año. No fue posible verificar de manera independiente esa afirmación, ya que se sabe poco sobre el esfuerzo de reclutamiento.\n\nPero el gobierno ofrece salarios relativamente altos y amplios beneficios que han ayudado a aumentar las filas del Ejército. El Kremlin dice que emplea exclusivamente voluntarios para luchar en Ucrania, pero algunos informes de medios y grupos de derechos han dicho que los oficiales militares a menudo coaccionan a los reclutas para que firmen contratos con las fuerzas armadas.\n\nCuando la viuda de un soldado le preguntó sobre la lentitud en el pago de una pensión, Putin se disculpó y prometió que el problema se resolvería rápidamente, un diálogo típico del evento anual, que el líder ruso utiliza a menudo para mostrar su dominio de una amplia gama de temas y su capacidad para resolver problemas.\n\nEn la conferencia de prensa se incluyeron preguntas de periodistas en el anfiteatro Gostinny Dvor, así como a través de un enlace de video desde toda Rusia. Un joven con una pajarita roja que sostenía un cartel diciendo que quería casarse usó su pregunta a Putin para proponerle matrimonio a su novia. Más tarde, uno de los presentadores del evento informó que ella había respondido “sí”, y Putin bromeó sobre recaudar dinero para la boda.\n\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.","summary":"Por HARRIET MORRIS MOSC&#218; (AP) &#8212; El presidente ruso Vlad&#237;mir Putin enfatiz&#243; el viernes que las tropas de Mosc&#250; avanzan en el campo de batalla en Ucrania y expres&#243; su confianza en que el Kremlin lograr&#237;a sus objetivos militares si Kiev no acepta las condiciones de Rusia en las conversaciones de paz.

He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin warns any seizure of Russian assets will backfire \n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy — and it desperately needs more cash from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nPutin said using Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong \n\nPutin told the audience the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year.

But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal.\n\nThe Russian leader wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members.

Smith locked horns with Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., on Thursday, arguing that then-Vice President Kamala Harris' gender is not the reason why she lost to President Donald Trump. Clyburn condemned Trump during his appearance on Smith’s \"Straight Shooter\" podcast, describing him as a man who \"looks for opportunities to insult Black women\" day in and day out. \"That's one of the categories,\" Smith replied. \"Because, to me, he insults everybody.\" \"Well, nobody should be voting for him,\" Clyburn argued. When Smith highlighted that, nonetheless, millions of people did, Clyburn responded by arguing that the American people are confusing boisterous behavior with leadership. STEPHEN A SMITH LOCKS HORNS WITH WHOOPI, SAYS DEMS MUST FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AND SAFETY, NOT CULTURE WAR \"Is it possible that that's not what they did?\" Smith asked. \"That instead, what they did was look at the Democratic side, and say they didn't like what they were getting, because the Democratic side didn't represent what James Clyburn stands for. It didn't represent what others have stood for that are traditional members of the Democratic Party. They saw a change shifting within the Democratic Party that leaned a bit further left that were deemed to be just as unreasonable as folks on the far right and as a result they chose what they deem to be the best of two evils per se.\" \"Well, the question is why they didn't see it,\" Clyburn said. \"Maybe they couldn't get beyond gender and our nominee happened to have been a Black or an African American, Asian American woman.\" In the clip flagged by The Daily Caller, Smith locked horns with Clyburn on this, warning, \"Well, let me say this, because I'm not going to say this behind your back and not say it to your face.\" NANCY PELOSI RESPONDS TO MICHELLE OBAMA'S CLAIM THAT AMERICA ISN'T READY FOR WOMAN PRESIDENT, ASKS 'WHY NOT?' \"I'm sitting right here in front of you,\" Smith continued. \"I emphatically disagree with what you just alluded to in terms of ‘it might be gender-driven.’ I think about Hillary Rodham Clinton getting 2.9 million votes more than Trump in 2016. I think about Kamala Harris getting nearly 75 million votes… I think about governors in New York, governors-elects in Jersey and recently Virginia. I think about former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was considered one of the most influential figures in our nation's history.\" He went on to argue that if it were so obvious that there is a clear bias against having a female president, Harris would not have been chosen as Biden’s successor with only 107 days to campaign.

AI tools have made it easy for anyone to make fake photos and videos that can fool many people into thinking they’re real. The tech has now advanced sufficiently that you shouldn’t necessarily feel bad if you fall for one that pops up in your feed. OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Nano Banana Pro are both getting very good.\n\nBut you don’t need AI to trick unsuspecting masses of people on sites like Instagram, Threads, Facebook, and X. Sometimes, you can do the same with good, old-fashioned Photoshop techniques. And we saw plenty of that with fake tweets that went viral over the past year.\n\nDid you see that tweet about the botched surgery on Elon Musk’s penis? There were several tweets, actually, but they were all fake. Same with the tweets about President Trump claiming the World Series was rigged and another about far-right influencer Andrew Tate calling any man with a girlfriend “gay.”\n\nBelow we’ve got some of the viral tweets (or Truths, as they’re called on Truth Social) that caught our attention over the past 12 months. And none of them are real.\n\n1) Rob Reiner never tweeted ‘fuck all of you MAGA assholes’\n\nComedy legend Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were murdered last weekend in their Los Angeles home, prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes to the director’s incredible body of work. But fans of President Donald Trump took the opportunity to spread a tweet that appeared to come from Reiner calling Trump supporters “assholes.” The tweet is fake.\n\n“Until Trump goes to prison I will no longer be posting on Twitter. I’ve had it with the insults and put downs. Fuck all of you MAGA assholes,” the fake tweet reads.\n\nThe image, purporting to show a screenshot from 2023, spread far and wide on social media and was often used by Trump fans to attack anyone who was mourning the beloved director. Reiner, a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party, deleted his X account sometime around the 2024 presidential election, but the AFP notes that he addressed the fake tweet in January 2023 after it had gone viral for the first time.\n\n“This is not my account,” Reiner tweeted Jan. 23, 2023, in a post that was archived.\n\nThe fake post looks like it was probably modified from an authentic Reiner tweet that read: “Until Trump is Indicted for leading a Deadly Insurrection to Overthrow the United States Government, our Democracy will not be restored.”\n\nPresident Trump attacked Reiner in an unhinged screed the day after the director was found dead, calling him “tortured and struggling, but once very talented.” The president even made the killing about himself, claiming with no evidence that Reiner was murdered “due to the anger he caused others” by being anti-Trump.\n\nTrump fans clearly took that as a signal to besmirch Reiner’s memory, and the fake tweet spread widely as a justification to attack the director. Reiner’s 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and charged with murder.\n\n2) Joe Rogan fell for a fake tweet about the No Kings protests\n\nJoe Rogan is America’s most popular podcaster, averaging about 20 million listeners per week. But Rogan consistently falls for fake images and videos online, even after they’ve been widely debunked. The latest example? Rogan fell for another fake tweet on Wednesday that was supposedly from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an episode from October, Rogan had guests Francis Foster and Konstantin Kisin, both conservative British political commentators, and the three men talked about the No Kings protests that happened Oct. 18. The demonstrations saw millions of people take to the streets in opposition to Trump, and Rogan tried to belittle the efforts, insisting that people were being paid to be there and those who weren’t being paid were just “geriatrics.”\n\nRogan also claimed that if the protests were being allowed to happen at all, that must be evidence that Trump couldn’t possibly be a king. And that’s when he promoted the fake tweet he saw—a post made to look like it was from the president on Truth Social.\n\n“No, he didn’t send the troops to stop the protests,” said Rogan. “In fact, he congratulated them on doing a great job, and he said I’m still your president. Tweet’s fucking hilarious. It’s very funny.” One of Rogan’s guests chimed in to say, “yeah, I saw that,” with a laugh.\n\nRogan told his producer to pull up the tweet, though it seemed clear he was having trouble tracking it down. “Try Truth Social,” Rogan told his producer, who was just off-screen. “You can probably find an image of it since it was posted everywhere.”\n\nThe fake tweet Rogan seemed to be talking about reads, “A HUGE THANK YOU to all the ‘No Kings’ protesters yesterday! I was very concerned a king was trying to take my place, but thanks to your tireless efforts, I am STILL YOUR PRESIDENT! Great job all!!!” But there’s nothing about it that’s real.\n\nThe producer never did seem to find the post, probably because he didn’t want to tell Rogan it was fake. It wasn’t even a recent fake tweet. It first started circulating around the first No Kings Day on June 14. The screenshot went viral back in June on platforms like X and Instagram. As the Daily Beast notes, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared the fake tweet but acknowledged it was fake. Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo shared the fake post in June as well, though she didn’t know it wasn’t real.\n\nRogan droned on and on about the protests during his show and claimed they were identical to what happened with Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign. The podcast host insisted that the Harris campaign “filled up stadiums” with people who were paid to be there, a claim with no basis in fact. Rogan said that it “became a job” for the people at Harris rallies and that “should not be legal” because it’s “deception.”\n\nIncredibly, Trump’s actual commentary on the No Kings protests is somehow more aggressive than the fake version Rogan highlighted on Wednesday. In reality, Trump shared an AI video on Truth Social showing himself flying a fighter jet and dumping literal shit on protesters.\n\nRogan is not a particularly bright man. But, again, he has an enormous audience in the millions. And he’s always falling for fake shit, whether it’s AI videos of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz or tweets about “Jewish tunnels,” sourced to fake accounts with characters like Dick Stroker.\n\n3) Charlie Kirk never tweeted about scratching his anus\n\nThere was a tweet that went viral back in July, before Charlie Kirk’s killing in September, that appeared to show the MAGA influencer criticizing New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for eating with his hands.\n\n“I have so many thoughts on this that it literally keeps me up at night, Zohran Mamdani eating rice with his HANDS during an interview,” the tweet read. “I very sincerely doubt he has to scratch his anus any less than the rest of us which makes that whole display unbelievably disgusting.”\n\nThe image appeared on sites like Reddit, X, and Bluesky, and it seemed plausible enough. Right-winger users on X hurled racist comments at Mamdani about it. Even elected Republicans got in on the act, with Rep. Brandon Gill, a Republican from Texas, writing, “Civilized people in America don’t eat like this. If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the Third World.”\n\nThe tweet that looked like it was from Kirk was believable, though it seemed like it was accidentally admitting that Kirk really dug in to scratch his anus. But this one was fake.\n\nKirk’s real commentary on the issue mostly centered around the idea that Mamdani didn’t actually want to eat rice with his hands. The late commentator suggested it was actually all for show: “It’s a calculated stunt, just like him constantly changing his accent. Honestly, that’s a lot worse and more disturbing than if he just authentically ate that way. One is backwards. The other shows his contempt for our culture.”\n\nAnother tweet in the same style also spread, appearing to show Kirk doubling down on the idea that he frequently is digging into his asshole: “To all the people making fun of me for scratching my itchy asshole… keep coping! This is something that happens to everybody and that’s why it’s disgusting to eat with your hands like Zohran Mamdani.”\n\nThe image was made to look like it had been deleted, even though X doesn’t show that notice for recently deleted tweet anymore. That tweet was also fake.\n\nMamdani has since won his election and will be sworn in as the mayor of New York next month.\n\n4) Elon Musk didn’t tweet about his ‘botched penis’\n\nBack in April, all anyone could talk about was President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The president had dubbed April 2 “Liberation Day,” and he announced a wide swath of tariffs on every country across the globe.\n\nThe next day, a tweet that appeared to have been sent by Elon Musk started spreading on social media. The tweet read, “I want a 90% tariff on Canada because Grimes told everyone about my botched penis.” Grimes is the mother of two of Musk’s many children, and she was born in Canada.\n\nHowever, the tweet is fake.\n\nThe tweet appears to have been created by an account on X called @marionumber4, which also has the name 679 Enthusiast. The pseudonymous account has a long history of creating fake “deleted” tweets of right-wing figures like Musk, Candace Owens, and Grimes. And this one is no different.\n\nThat same creator made several fake “botched penis” tweets about Elon Musk in 2025, including one made to look like it came from Ashley St. Clair but had been deleted. St. Clair has a child whom she says was fathered by Musk.\n\nThe fake tweet that appears to have been from St. Clair reads “the fucked up botched penis is real.”\n\nBy putting the words “this post was deleted” at the bottom of the fake tweet, it signals to the reader that any attempt to find the tweet on the person’s timeline is going to be a futile effort. And that appears to be part of the appeal for hoaxsters who create these kinds of fake viral tweets, as we saw with the Charlie Kirk tweet. But accounts like @marionumber4 have been doing this for so long, it’s easy to check with the usual photoshopping suspects whenever one of these is circulating online. The person behind that account has previously confirmed to Gizmodo that they make these fake tweets.\n\nAs the fake tweet gets shared outside of the original creator’s circles, it circulates with people wondering if it’s real. And X users now have the ability to ask Grok about the veracity of various tweets like a real-time AI fact-checker. That’s what people did in the replies to various tweets about the supposed botched penis surgery. One user asked Grok, “Is this real,” and they got an interesting reply.\n\n“Ashley St. Clair likely broke an NDA by posting about Elon Musk’s ‘botched penis,’ given their relationship and typical NDA use,” Grok responded. “She may face financial fallout, as seen in custody and support disputes, but the claim of a specific penalty for penis comparisons is likely exaggerated, not standard in NDAs.”\n\nThe reference to an NDA appears to have been a joke by the X account UAE Exotic Falconry and Finance. But Grok’s fixation on some kind of non-disclosure agreement looks like a product of the leading question rather than something that actually exists. Neither Musk nor St. Clair appears to have discussed an NDA about their relationship, and it’s not publicly known if one actually exists.\n\nThat ambiguity speaks to one of the major flaws in technology with generative AI. If you feed it enough garbage, you’re just going to get garbage back. And X is nothing if not a flaming garbage dump in 2025. Musk bought the platform in late 2022 and did everything he could to scare off normal people with his far-right ideology. Fringe figures who had previously been banned on Twitter, like white supremacist Nick Fuentes and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, were welcomed back with open arms. And that’s made X a mess of misinformation and extremist activity.\n\n5) The fake Epstein tweet that went viral before the identical real ones\n\nThere were some rather unbelievable developments in the news about Jeffrey Epstein in 2025. We finally saw some surveillance camera footage from the jail where Epstein died, even if it all seemed extremely irregular. And a small group of elected politicians came together to force a vote on getting government files about Epstein released. Those are due out Dec. 16, though it remains to be seen how many redactions the Department of Justice might make.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been at the center of the controversy, considering the fact that he was president when Epstein died in a federal jail, and many people don’t believe Epstein actually killed himself. Trump was reportedly best friends with Epstein for at least 15 years, and the Wall Street Journal even obtained a letter that Trump wrote to Epstein for his birthday, which included a drawing of a naked female figure.\n\nTrump has been incredibly defensive about the release of the Epstein files. But that defensiveness has made the topic a frequent subject for people joking on the internet. Like in the case of this tweet, which was widespread on Instagram, X, and Facebook over the summer. But it’s not real.\n\nThe funny thing about this fake tweet is that it’s extremely close to things Trump would actually write on social media about the case. This fake tweet went viral on July 12, and less than a week later, he wrote on Truth Social: “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker.'”\n\nTrump has repeatedly called the Epstein story a hoax, and he was reportedly pressuring elected politicians not to vote for releasing the Epstein files, even calling them directly. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, even had a falling out with the president over the issue, and she’s retiring early because he turned his back on her.\n\nSometimes fake tweets go viral before they capture a sentiment that already exists. Trump never tweeted “STOP TALKING ABOUT EPSTEIN!!!!” but he may as well have.\n\n6) Andrew Tate didn’t say a man with a girlfriend was “gay”\n\nAndrew Tate, the far-right manosphere influencer, regularly tweets the most bizarre bullshit around. But if you saw a tweet that having a girlfriend in 2025 made you gay, that one was fake.\n\nThe fake tweet was picked up by outlets like Pink News and Australia’s Star Observer, but there’s no evidence it was real. Gizmodo checked Tate’s X feed shortly after the tweet started to go viral on social media, and it wasn’t there.\n\nOddly enough, the sentiment of this fake tweet is actually something Tate has posted many times. Back in July, Tate tweeted, “I don’t want a relationship, I don’t wanna talk girl shit, I don’t wanna put up with her moods, I’m not gay.”\n\nMuch like viral fakes featuring Trump, the real thing is often just as absurd.\n\n7) Ian Miles Cheong didn’t tweet ‘get out of my country’ to Mamdani\n\nIan Miles Cheong is one of those Elon Musk fans that you’ll come across frequently if you spend time on X. Cheong, who’s originally from Malaysia but lives in Dubai, has built a name for himself whining about wokeness and pushing a right-wing worldview long before Twitter became X.\n\nBut Cheong’s prominence and generally annoying presence have made him the target of photoshoppers. And even though Cheong has previously interjected into U.S. political debate like he actually lives in the country, one tweet in particular got a lot of pick-up this year.\n\n“I refuse to be governed by a Ugandan named Zohran Kwame Mamdani. Get out of my country,” the fake tweet reads.\n\nThe post, as you’ll notice, features the “this post has been deleted” text at the bottom. But it’s another one created by pranksters, made to look like it was deleted.\n\nCheong often writes about U.S. politics. But he’s never claimed to actually be an American.\n\n8) Trump didn’t tweet about the World Series being rigged\n\nBack in October, a tweet that appeared to come from President Donald Trump said he’d refuse to invite whoever wins the World Series to the White House. The post said it was because he believed the game was rigged, either by the mafia or the Democrats. But the tweet isn’t real.\n\nThe post was made to look like it was coming from President Trump’s official Truth Social account, the platform he owns and the first place where he posts all his most unhinged messages.\n\n“NO MATTER WHO WINS I WILL REFUSE TO INVITE EITHER BASEBALL TEAM TO MY BALL ROOM AS THEY ARE BOTH RUN BY HIGHLY INEPT OFFICIALS FROM CALIFORNIA AND ONTARIO CANADA,” the fake tweet reads.\n\n“I DON’T HOST LOSERS. WE ARE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING MLB. THIS WORLD SERIES IS RIGGED, PROBABLY BY THE DEMS & THE MAFIA,” the fake tweet continues.\n\nThe screenshot spread far and wide, showing up on Threads, X, Bluesky, Instagram, and Facebook. But Trump never wrote this one.\n\nThe reaction to the viral post was about what you’d expect, especially among fans of the Toronto Blue Jays. Many Canadians made fun of the fake Trump tweet, since they didn’t think a Canadian team would even be invited to the White House in the first place.\n\nThere were many red flags in the fake post from Trump, but the reference to the ballroom might be one of the most glaring. The president demolished the East Wing of the White House, and he’s building a ballroom with “donations” from private companies and individuals who have given him millions. But even on the most ambitious timeline, the ballroom won’t be completed by the time a White House visit by the 2025 World Series champions might take place.\n\nTrump hasn’t announced a completion date for his ridiculous monstrosity, but the administration has said it will be done before his second term is up in Jan. 2029.\n\n9) Trump didn’t call the Toronto Blue Jays un-American\n\nAnother fake post that was popping up here and there on social media specifically called out the Blue Jays.\n\n“WE WILL BE INVESTIGATING THE UN AMERICAN BLUE JAYS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO STEAL OUR BELOVED WORLD SERIES,” the fake tweet reads. “THEY WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.”\n\nAt the end of the day, all of these fake tweets go viral because it’s impossible to tell which screeds from President Trump are authentic. Trump has always been off his rocker, but he’s gotten increasingly weird during his second term, posting some of the oddest things that a president has ever expressed in public.\n\nAs just one example, Trump posted an AI video of himself last month talking about “medbeds,” a bizarre conspiracy theory that claims there are real beds being hidden from the public that can heal all diseases. The video even includes a fake Trump touting these miracle cures and insisting they were going to be available soon to “restore every citizen to full health.”\n\nIn a world where the president is posting about medbeds—to say nothing of the Department of Homeland Security posting Nazi propaganda—it can be extremely difficult to tell what’s real. And that’s not going to change as long as the Trump regime remains in power. In fact, it’s likely to get much, much worse.\n\n10) Trump didn’t announce 15-year car loans\n\nAn announcement from the White House went viral this year, claiming that President Donald Trump is working on making 15-year car loans available to all Americans. The announcement is fake. But it’s a joke based on something very real.\n\n“As he continues to work hard to make the American Dream accessible to everyone, President Trump today has asked the Departments of Transportation and Commerce to make vehicle ownership for all a reality by introducing 15 year car loans! Secretaries Duffy and Lutnick are already working on it! Delivering for America!” the viral screenshot reads.\n\nWhile the announcement has been circulating widely on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Bluesky, and TikTok, it’s not real.\n\nWhere did this announcement actually come from? It appears to have originated with a satire account on X called TheRealThelmaJohnson. The tweet included a joke, along with the photoshopped announcement, that reads: “If you want to pay 100 grand for a 2009 Chevy Equinox this is the way…”\n\n If you want to pay 100 grand for a 2009 Chevy Equinox this is the way… pic.twitter.com/ZfQBKgJs8e — TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) November 9, 2025\n\nAnd that joke gets close to what’s funny about a 15-year car loan. The longer the car loan, the more the borrower is ultimately paying for the car, thanks to interest payments. The original tweet from “Thelma Johnson” only has about 150,000 views, a very humble number for something that’s gone “viral.” That’s because it has been widely shared on other platforms (including X, though without attribution to the original creator) and people think it’s real.\n\nThe reason many people think it’s real is that President Trump actually proposed something just as ridiculous as a 15-year car loan recently. On Nov. 8, Trump posted a graphic to Truth Social comparing himself to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who helped popularize the 30-year mortgage during the 1930s. The graphic shows a photo of Trump with the words “50-year mortgage” underneath without further explanation.\n\nPolitico reports that the graphic actually came from a man named Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte reportedly visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago with a 3×5 posterboard in hand. Roughly 10 minutes later, the graphic was posted to Trump’s Truth Social account, according to Politico. That apparently angered Trump’s aides, with Politico characterizing it as “bad politics and bad policy.”\n\nThe idea of the 30-year mortgage was that it allowed people to live in and “own” their homes, even if it took a significant portion of someone’s life to pay it off. At the end of the mortgage, the person would at least have ownership of a property, even if they paid much more than it was worth in the end. The idea of the 50-year mortgage takes this to the extreme, especially with the median age of first-time home buyers in the U.S. currently at 40. And the only people who would be taking out 50-year mortgages would be the people in the most precarious financial positions, which means they’d be most likely to default. Even if a borrower made good on their loan agreement, the prospect of them ever actually owning the property would be slim.\n\nTrump was asked by Laura Ingraham on Fox News about the proposal, and he didn’t back down from the idea. “All it means is you pay less per month,” Trump said. “Pay it over a longer period of time. It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.”\n\nAnd all of this ridiculousness brings us to the idea of the 15-year car loan. It’s a joke, but plenty of high-profile X accounts seemed to think it was real, including Unusual Whales and Polymarket. When one account racked up 1 million views and faced skepticism from other users, she linked to a tweet from AF Post that she suggested was some proof the White House was considering it.\n\nIn reality, AF Post (America First Post) isn’t a real, credible news outlet. It’s affiliated with white supremacist Nick Fuentes, and it posts fake garbage all the time. But AF Post has a blue checkmark, which anyone can buy for $8 from Elon Musk, and some people are under the illusion that it still carries some weight of “verification.”\n\nThe “Thelma Johnson” account often shares fake White House announcements, so the next time you see something like that, which sounds too good to be true, maybe check that specific account to see if they were the first one to post it. That’s what we do here at Gizmodo whenever we see a ridiculous tweet that reads “this post has been deleted.” There’s one particular prankster who likes to do that one, and we always check their account when something similar goes viral.","summary":"Fake tweets from Rob Reiner, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump all made the rounds this year.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/viral-tweets-that-were-completely-fake-in-2025-2000695941","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/Viral-Posts-Year-in-Review-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 12:50:30","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":387578034,"title":"DNC Reveals Why They're Keeping Their 2024 Autopsy Under Seal.

The Democrats are nixing their 2024 autopsy because it might be too painful to bring up all the reasons why their party sucks. I’m not kidding, that’s essentially what DNC chair Ken Martin said regarding why they’re keeping this report under seal. Voters already view Democrats as weak, and the party chairman just reinforced that criticism. Second, you know it must be awful, possibly a line-by-line brutalization of how this party is so wrong on numerous issues.

No pain, no gain, but they’d rather go the ostrich route and ignore everything (via NYT): \n\nThe Democratic National Committee is killing its autopsy of the 2024 election. Ken Martin, the chairman of the D.N.C., said on Thursday that he had decided not to publish a report that he ordered months ago into what went wrong for the Democratic Party last year. Party officials have conducted more than 300 interviews with Democrats in all 50 states to create a document that Mr. Martin had once pitched as crucial to charting a path forward. Mr. Martin will instead keep the findings under seal. He believes that looking back so publicly and painfully at the past would prove counterproductive for the party as it tries next year to take back power in Congress, according to a D.N.C. spokeswoman who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the thinking behind his decision. “Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” Mr. Martin said in a statement. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.” \n\nWell, accepting what went wrong is part of that process, Kenny. Also, by distraction, we know you mean things we don’t want to hear, because it delivers a blow to our snobby, self-righteous dispositions as Democrats. \n\nI bet the report cooks Kamala Harris alive, and you can’t have that airing out with all the money and fake activism that buoyed her fake candidacy. \n\nAbsolute loser move.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

The survey result published on Wednesday by The Argument/Verasight concluded that if the two prominent political figures face each other in the election, AOC would beat Vance 51%-49%.\n\nThough neither Ocasio-Cortez nor Vance has confirmed their participation in the 2028 Presidential election, both of their names have been floated as potential candidates. Following the poll, Ocasio-Cortez was asked Wednesday about the result. “Listen, these polls from years out are, you know, they are what they are,” she told Substack’s Migrant Insider’s Pablo Manríquez outside Capitol Hill.\n\n“But let the record show: I would stomp him. I would stomp him,” added Alexandria. Later, she took to X (formerly Twitter) and shared the poll results with her followers. “Bloop!” AOC wrote in the caption.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez leads JD Vance 51%-49% in hypothetical 2028 poll — Verasight pic.twitter.com/4Jj1D2Xs5E\n— NewsWire (@NewsWire_US) December 17, 2025 \n\nAnother survey from the Yale Youth Poll found Ocasio-Cortez to be the top candidate among other Democrats for the 2028 Presidential election. She rose as the ticket winner against former Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and others.\nOn the other hand, JD Vance seems to be the only potential candidate for the upcoming Presidential election, as the Constitution bars Donald\n\nTrump from running for a third term. However, the POTUS has expressed his strong willingness to run for the election a third time.\nBack in November, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon solidified those rumors by revealing that Donald Trump is in talks with “one of the top constitutional lawyers” in America to change something about the 22nd Amendment that puts a two-term limit on Presidents.\n\nThe Republican leader himself shared a video on Truth Social that had a simple message “TRUMP 4EVA.” As the talk about his third term intensifies, White House is claiming that America would be “lucky.”\n\n.@PabloReports: Do you think you could beat JD Vance in a head-to-head race for president, as polling suggests?\nAOC: I would stomp him. pic.twitter.com/Kvh31kgwbD\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 17, 2025 \n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Axios on Thursday, “There has never been an administration that has accomplished as much in less than one year as the Trump Administration. The American people would be lucky to have President Trump in office for even longer.”\n\nAlan Dershowitz, Trump’s former impeachment lawyer, explained the legal possibility of challenging the 22nd Amendment. He believes it might not be as easy as many think. “It’s not clear if a president can become a third-term president, and it’s not clear if it’s permissible,” Dershowitz previously told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhether or not Trump could run for a third time should be the least of Republican worries now, so think the experts. In particular, the recent rise of Blue states and GOP losses indicate that Democrats might witness massive success in the upcoming midterms. This means, if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is to get the ticket, she might actually have a chance to beat JD Vance, as the poll predicts.","summary":"AOC strongly believes that if she is to get the ticket, she would absolutely beat JD Vance.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-says-she-could-stomp-jd-vance-in-2028-presidential-election","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AOC-is-Determined-to-Stomp-JD-Vance-in-2028-Presidential-Election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 11:03:21","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.037},{"id":387645518,"title":"Lower prices sound great, but deflation would spur economic headaches","text":"Such electoral results threaten the political viability of President Donald Trump’s final two years in office — particularly if Democrats can win a House majority next Nov. 3. The economy has much to do with Trump’s political peril in his second term.\n\nTrump persistently claims the economy is in excellent shape, even giving himself a grade of “A+++++” in a recent interview. It’s a dubious political approach, as former President Joe Biden and his 2024 stand-in as the Democratic nominee, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, found out. The Democratic pair never boasted of the economy on their watch to the degree Trump does now. But they repeatedly — and unconvincingly — argued the sputtering U.S. economy was solid.\n\nYes, the macroeconomic data at the time showed inflation subsiding, good jobs reports, and low unemployment. However, voters still felt the economy was doing poorly due to persistent inflation and higher prices.\n\nTrump himself capitalized on that during his campaign. While many people think the “Kamala is for they/them, Trump is for you” ads were all about transgender issues, it was an overall theme that played into the campaign Trump ran. According to Trump, Harris only cared about the select few, not concerning herself with the struggles of everyday people.\n\nThe strategy worked: Trump won back all the states he lost in 2020, added Nevada to the list, and captured the popular vote.\n\nThe problem for Trump now is that he made specific promises to lower prices when he got into office. In August 2024, during a campaign stop in Montana, he said, “Starting on Day One, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods.” A week later in North Carolina, he said, “Prices will come down. You just watch: They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast, not only with insurance, with everything.”\n\nTrump continued to make those promises throughout the remainder of the campaign, and while it became a useful political rallying cry, voters wanted results and thus far, have not gotten them. As a result, Trump’s job approval languishes in the low 40s according to the latest averages at RealClearPolitics.\n\nPrice paradox doesn’t bode well for the Trump administration\n\nVoters shouldn’t expect much change in prices the next year or beyond. While commodities such as beef, eggs (prices skyrocketed due to Avian flu), and oil (which affects gasoline prices) are subject to much greater volatility due to external factors, overall grocery and retail prices will not come down. If they do, it will spell trouble for Trump because it would signal a weak economy rather than any policy that gets businesses to lower prices.\n\nAlthough nominal wages (raw wage growth) increased with inflation after the COVID-19 pandemic, real wages (purchasing power) declined until 2023, when nominal wage growth surpassed inflation, restoring real wages to inflation levels. The result? Little to no incentive to lower prices, since people are still spending money.\n\nConsumer spending, known as Personal Consumption Expenditures, accounts for 70% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product. People drive our economy by making purchases.\n\nIf retailers suddenly began reducing prices to pre-pandemic levels, would that make people spend more? Not necessarily. However, lower prices are what consumers say they want. That is deflation. And that is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nLisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (who Trump tried to dismiss but still works while the legal process plays out), said in a November speech, “If the economy is doing better, if this disinflationary process that we keep talking about is actually in process, then why are people so upset? Most Americans are not just looking for disinflation. You and I, as macroeconomists, are looking for disinflation. They’re looking for deflation. They want these prices to be back where they were before the pandemic.”\n\nWouldn’t that be a good thing? Not according to Raphael Bostic, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, who in 2023 wrote, “Deflation might sound appealing. After all, who wouldn’t want to pay less for groceries next week? But it can be economically destructive. Consumers may delay purchases because they expect prices will keep falling. That can curtail overall consumption, which can prompt businesses to cut production, which in turn can mean lower profits, cost-cutting, and layoffs.”\n\nAnd which retailer will signal lower prices? If Ford announced it would cut the price of 2027 F-150s by $15,000 compared to 2026 models, why would anyone buy now? They would merely wait until the 2027 models are available. Even if retailers didn’t signal lower prices, should they begin to fall, it is natural for people to wait and hope prices continue to drop.\n\nIt creates a serious dilemma for Trump and congressional Republicans, especially those in the House aiming to keep their slim majority. Currently, Trump is pushing back on Democrats’ claims of the affordability issue as a “hoax,” and insists prices are coming down.\n\nThe “reality distortion field” originally described Steve Jobs’s ability to persuade others that the impossible was possible, thanks to his charismatic and persuasive powers. It also applies to Trump, who believes that simply stating something like “prices are coming down” makes it true. The real issue is that those around him are expected to go along with the illusion, no matter how far it is from reality. \n\nSENATORIAL COURTESY: BAD PRACTICES IN POLITICAL POWER CAN BE CHALLENGED AND CHANGED\n\nPeople have a much more pessimistic outlook. A recent Politico poll shows nearly 30% of people are delaying medical checkups to save money. Nearly 40% are not attending any professional sports events, and almost 50% say they cannot afford a vacation that involves flying. Only 22% believe Trump’s tariffs, which he claimed would boost economic growth, have positively impacted the economy. \n\nThat signals a major problem for Trump and congressional Republicans as they head into 2026. They are in control, and Trump has made promises. Prices won’t drop unless the economy falls, and such a downturn could worsen the GOP’s situation. Either scenario could lead to a crushing midterm election defeat. \n\nJay Caruso is a writer living in West Virginia.","summary":"Republicans have good reason to worry about their prospects in the 2026 midterm elections after a string of recent defeats.

Trump has often signaled he supports the marijuana industry, promising to look at reclassification if reelected and supporting Florida’s marijuana legalization ballot measure in 2024. But he earlier called Colorado’s marijuana legalization “bad,” correctly noting that it has led to more traffic accidents in the state and adding that the drug “does cause an IQ problem.”\n\nThe evidence against marijuana liberalization is strong, and as the regulatory process moves forward, Trump would be wise to listen to its critics.\n\nMarijuana is far more addictive than its proponents claim, especially because its average potency has quadrupled since 1990. Everywhere marijuana has been legalized, use and abuse have gone up, including the hospitalization of children, who often ingest the candy-like edibles many users enjoy. Marijuana use is strongly associated with increased cases of schizophrenia, heart attacks, laziness, lower educational attainment, higher rates of unemployment, higher rates of welfare use, higher crime, reduced brain activity, and reduced memory. Of particular importance for Vice President JD Vance, who wants Americans to have more babies, marijuana also causes miscarriages and premature birth in women, and infertility in men.\n\nWhile Trump’s proposed rescheduling of marijuana would not fully legalize the drug, it would unlock tax benefits and allow the future commercialization of a highly addictive and harmful product. Marijuana proponents say rescheduling would allow more research to be done on the so-called medical benefits of marijuana, but plenty of research has already been completed, and the results are not encouraging. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a comprehensive review of the available research and concluded, “Evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most conditions for which it is promoted, such as acute pain and insomnia.” The only benefit the study found was “a moderate effect on increasing body weight” for some HIV/AIDS patients, and even then, many other real medicines are available.\n\nIt’s true that the public supports legalizing marijuana, but as its dangers have become apparent, support has declined, particularly among Republicans. While 68% of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s supporters between the ages of 18 and 45 say marijuana legalization has led to more social benefits than costs, 59% of Trump voters the same age say the opposite. Opposition to marijuana legalization is even stronger among older Republican voters. The bottom line is that the people who support marijuana legalization are hardcore Democrats who will never vote for Republicans, while those who support Trump’s anti-drug law and order message would be betrayed.\n\nThe dangers caused by marijuana legalization, including lost brain function, lower educational attainment, higher unemployment, and laziness, would all affect young men the most because they are the most frequent marijuana users. Throughout his campaign, Trump promised a healthier and safer America. He has shut down the southern border and deployed the National Guard to high-crime cities to fulfill that promise. Rescheduling marijuana, thus allowing the further commercialization and use of the drug, would undermine both those goals while benefiting no one but drug pushers.","summary":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Dec. 18 directing relevant federal agencies to begin the process of rescheduling marijuana from the more restrictive Schedule I classification to the more lenient Schedule III listing.

If victorious, Villegas would add to progressive’s power in Washington while simultaneously reducing the number of representatives amenable to bipartisan compromise.\n\nRedistricting aside, CA-22 figures to be a slightly Republican-leaning district, thus Bains may have a real shot at flipping a seat – whereas Villegas likely does not. Boosting Villegas at the expense of Bains may cost Democrats a potentially winnable seat.\n\nOutside of California, the hole Democrats are digging for themselves by letting progressives drive the party is even more apparent. \n\nIn Texas, former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred was “pressured out of a Senate run, to clear the decks for uber-progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett.”\n\nNever mind that Allred outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6% in 2024 or that Crockett trails every GOP challenger according to 270toWin. \n\nAlso disregard that Texas hasn’t had a Democratic senator since 1995. For progressives, the point is to make noise, regardless of whether Democrats are putting forward the candidate with the best chance to win.\n\nOf course, in a democracy, whoever gets a majority of the votes in a single state or district is the rightful winner. However, progressive dominance of Democrats’ grassroots organizations means that more often than not, the party is advancing the least electable politicians in a general election.\n\nIn that same vein, progressive dominance ensures that Democrats’ Congressional caucus is populated by far-left ideologues, not the moderate Democrats who are most likely to find common cause with the GOP in bipartisan solutions to the problems we face as a country. \n\nA recent report from center-left group Welcome emphasizes the vulnerability this poses. It cites that seven-in-ten (70%) voters find the Democratic party to be “out of touch” and too focused on progressive issues.\n\nAdditionally, the report states that most voters believe the party does not care enough about securing the border or lowering crime rates – two key issues that significantly contributed to Harris’ 2024 defeat and threaten to reemerge as major vulnerabilities for Democrats, especially in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPlainly, Welcome’s report should be a deafening alarm to Democrats. \n\nIt makes clear that the voters who decide presidential elections want Democrats to abandon their extreme, progressive ideology in favor of moderate Democrats, with the side effect of reorienting the entire Democratic Party towards the center. \n\nAnd yet, Democrats appear poised to do the opposite. \n\nWhether out of fear of the far-left or unwillingness to confront the most vocal part of their base on issues like DEI, immigration, the economy, and social issues, moderate Democrats are running the risk of ceding the party to the most unelectable major party platform in modern history.\n\nThat being said, some Democrats have already opted to take this centrist approach, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who seemingly has his eye on a 2028 bid for the Oval Office.\n\nNewsom, one of President Trump’s loudest opponents, has moved to the center in the last few years. \n\n on transgender athletes in sports, and – arguably most importantly – \n\n his fellow Democrats to be “more culturally normal” and “less judgmental” earlier this month.\n\nIn bucking progressive orthodoxies, Newsom is attempting to appeal to the national electorate Democrats need to return to the White House, which is much more moderate than the far-left.\n\nRegrettably, as the Welcome report makes clear, the effects of the progressive surge have already begun to eat away at the Democratic brand, making the party seem narrow-minded, less practical, and ineffective at a time when they should be solidifying their platform.\n\nUltimately, if Democrats prove unable to shake off the rise of the progressives, then they will have nobody to blame for their self-sabotage aside from themselves. For the party to be competitive beyond relying on “we’re not Trump,” they will have to find a way to separate themselves from the extremists in their party. \n\nConversely, if Democrats decide to follow the lead of progressives like Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and will cost themselves another election.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"If Democrats decide to follow the lead of progressives like Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and will cost themselves another election.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/12/18/heading-into-2026-democrats-are-on-the-brink-of-success-and-self-sabotage/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SUT-Z-Mamdani-AP25325767592712-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 07:38:45","author":"Douglas Schoen,Gqlshare","authors":["Douglas Schoen","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":387381326,"title":"Expert Raises Grave Fears of a ‘Christmas Massacre’ in Nigeria","text":"In Nigeria, Christians living in the country’s Middle Belt region are under constant threat of attack from Fulani militants and Islamic terrorist groups. Unfortunately, the risk of attack only increases around major Christian holidays, as militants time their attacks to inflict maximum terror and make known their message that Christians are not welcome in the region.\n\nTwo years ago, at least 140 Christians were massacred by Fulani militants wielding guns on Christmas Eve in Nigeria’s Plateau state. Timothy Nuwan, the vice president of Church of Christ in Nations, told AFP, “Many people were killed, slaughtered like animals in cold blood.” The militants torched people’s homes and burnt down eight churches, again demonstrating the religious motive behind the attack. (RELATED: Defending Nigeria’s Christians from Islamist Genocide)\n\nAnd this year, 72 people were killed during the Easter Triduum in Benue state. Following the attack, Father Moses Aondoanenge Igba, a Catholic priest in the area, noted to Catholic New Agency’s Africa division the reason why the attack was timed to the most sacred period of the Christian liturgical year.\n\n“I ask myself, why is it always during Christian festive periods that these killings take place?” Igba said. “Either Christmas or Easter, they come to disrupt our celebrations. It points to a conquest ideology. It is more than just terrorism; it is about land occupation and Islamization.”\n\nFor Nigerian Christians in the Middle Belt region, the upcoming Christmas holiday is putting them on high alert. According to Judd Saul, the founder of Equipping the Persecuted, an organization that aids Christians facing persecution, Fulani terrorists are preparing to attack a number of villages on Christmas Day.\n\n“We got very reliable information that they are weaponizing for a Christmas Day massacre,” Judd said at a meeting convened by the International Committee on Nigeria and the African Jewish Alliance last week. “I am imploring the Nigerian government and President Donald Trump to do something so we don’t have a bunch of dead Christians in Nigeria.” (RELATED: What Is America’s Role in Africa?)\n\nJudd went into specifics on what he says is being planned by Fulani militants.\n\n“We have intelligence right now, as of today, before this meeting, I’ve talked to my contacts,” Judd said at the Emergency Summit on Crimes Against Christians last week on Capitol Hill, also last week. “The Fulani are gathering on the border of Nasarawa and Plateau. They’re gathering up on the border of Nasarawa and Benue. They’re gathering up on the border of Nasarawa and Kaduna. They plan on hitting these villages. They plan on hitting Bokkos in Plateau. They plan on hitting Barkin Ladi. They plan on hitting Riyom in Plateau. They plan on hitting the community of Agatu in Benue, and they plan on hitting Kafanchan in Kaduna, all on Christmas.”\n\nJudd founded a media organization, Truth Nigeria, which maintains a staff of journalists who report on violence against Christians in the country. (RELATED: Media Denies Christian Genocide in Response to Trump’s Threat of Military Action in Nigeria)\n\nReporters on the ground for Truth Nigeria have documented movements by Fulani terrorists as well as a buildup of weapons that suggest a preparation for violence over the Christmas season. Judd says that the organization has an 89 percent accuracy rate for its terrorist alerts.\n\nThe Nigerian government has dismissed Judd’s predictions. A special assistant to Nigeria’s president told a Nigerian news outlet, “We should be very careful how we digest and process some of these doubtful reports by external organizations who are setting a stage for internal crisis in our country. We should not be providing oxygen for reports that heighten a sense of insecurity in our country.”\n\nThe assistant added, “What is the motive and agenda of this organization in raising this kind of alarm about a likely terror attack in the three states and on Christmas Day?”\n\nThis member of Nigeria’s government is far removed from the reality on the ground. Over 7,000 Christians have already been targeted and killed this year in Nigeria alone, according to Franc Utu, a researcher at the University of Central Oklahoma. And over 100,000 Christians have been killed in Nigeria over the past decade, according to Stephen Enada, who leads the International Committee of Nigeria. (RELATED: Ted Cruz and the Specter of ‘Roland, the Headless Thompson Gunner’)\n\nJudd’s warnings, therefore, are hardly heightening “a sense of insecurity” in Nigeria, not when Christians are being systematically killed by the thousands. “[A] culture of denial persists to this very moment,” said New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith at the International Committee on Nigeria last week.\n\nDespite the death toll, Nigeria’s media still largely maintains that there is no persecution of Christians in the country. Instead, the narrative is that there is merely a conflict between farmers and herdsmen that is exacerbated by climate change.\n\nBut there are some signs that this widespread attitude of denial, particularly among Nigeria’s media and government classes, has begun to abate following President Donald Trump’s threat of an American military response in reaction to the crisis.\n\nAccording to Truth Nigeria, a senior editor at a major Nigerian newspaper recently said, “We used words to soften reality: ‘bandits,’ ‘unknown gunmen,’ ‘farmer-herder clashes.’ But after Congress called it ‘religious cleansing,’ we cannot unsee the data.” The Nov. 21 mass kidnapping of 253 children from St. Mary’s Catholic School, which made major national headlines, has forced some Nigerians to see the persecution of Christians that is so endemic in the country.\n\nIn Kogi state, authorities have already ordered an early curfew as a response to the Christmas threat. And Christians in the area are already wavering on whether they will attend Christmas church services, fearing that they will lose their lives by doing so.\n\nPressure on the U.S. to do something is increasing, and certainly will all the more so if even some of what Judd is predicting befalls Nigeria’s Christians.\n\nStephen Enada said last week, in a meeting that gathered several U.S. congressmen: “If the United States does nothing — God forbid — millions will be killed by jihadists.”\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes:\n\nGavin Newsom’s Democrat Fangirls\n\nPope Leo Named to Vogue’s Best-Dressed List\n\nKamala Harris’s Sad Book Tour Will Now Be Longer Than Her Campaign","summary":"In Nigeria, Christians living in the country’s Middle Belt region are under constant threat of attack from Fulani militants and...","url":"https://spectator.org/expert-raises-grave-fears-of-a-christmas-massacre-in-nigeria/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gracious-adebayo-_cdI8MkfkVI-unsplash-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 03:04:54","author":"Ellie Gardey Holmes","authors":["Ellie Gardey Holmes"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":387430040,"title":"Struggling American Workers Call ‘Bullsh*t’ On Democrats’ Bid To Keep H1-B Tap Flowing ","text":"American workers struggling to find employment in the tech industry are ripping Democrats for protecting the massive flow of cheap, foreign labor into the country.\n\nA coalition of Democrat-led states announced a lawsuit earlier in December to block the Trump administration’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, claiming that U.S. employers are in need of the “highly skilled” labor provided by the H-1B visa system. American tech workers — many of whom are unable to find employment or have left the industry entirely out of frustration — say the lawsuit is the latest sign that the Democrat Party is no longer representative of the everyday working man. (RELATED: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme)\n\n“This is liberal states itching to ‘stand up to Trump,’ married by convenience to the Indian lobby and Big Business,” John, a cybersecurity professional in the Seattle area who has struggled to land a job for a year, told the the Daily Caller News Foundation about the lawsuit. John said Democrat claims about labor shortages in higher education are “crap” and that American citizens could “easily” be hired for these positions.\n\nLike all five of the current and former tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, John wished to only go by his first name out of fear of reprisal from potential employers.\n\n‘That’s Total Bullshit’\n\nA coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 20 different states filed a lawsuit on Dec. 12 challenging President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a $100,000 price tag on all new H-1B visas. Filed in federal district court in Boston by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell and other liberal prosecutors, the lawsuit alleges the fee to be outside its congressionally authorized bounds. (RELATED: Trump Admin Escalating Denaturalizations Of Americans Who Fraudulently Scored Citizenship)\n\nThe Democratic attorneys general — who argued the fee places too hard a burden on elite universities in need of foreign labor — also appeared to sidestep concerns that these visas take jobs away from Americans, noting in at least one press release that employers must certify that the employment of a foreign worker would not negatively affect the wages of a similarly employed American worker.\n\n“That’s total bullshit,” Kevin Lynn, the founder of U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group for American tech employees displaced by foreign labor, told the DCNF.\n\nLynn argued that federal regulators aren’t remotely capable of ensuring that Americans aren’t hung out to dry by foreign workers.\n\n“So imagine you’re at the Department of Labor and you get over a quarter million [Labor Condition Applications], and at the same time, according to the statute, you have only seven days to view that application,” the tech worker advocate stated. “All they have time to do is make sure the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed, so there is no time to effectively evaluate the application.”\n\n“This definitely tells you the Democratic Party is not the party of labor,” he stated, noting that many of the uber wealthy congressional districts heavily favored Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. “It’s obvious that the wealthy donor class are represented now by the Democratic Party, and also a lot of Republicans.”\n\nA spokesperson for Campbell did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.\n\nCongress created the H-1B program in 1990 with the intent to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually chart a path to legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the U.S. indefinitely.\n\nThe tech industry dominates the use of these visas, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a website dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in various countries.\n\nIndia stands well above every other nation as the top source of foreign labor to the U.S., making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report compiled by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe H-1B program is incredibly popular among U.S.-based employers, with new visas capped at 85,000 a year and a lottery system that decides which foreign nationals obtain them.\n\nHowever, the visa program has long been criticized by Trump and others in the White House for allegedly employing foreign workers at cheaper wages to the detriment of American workers. In September, Trump took a major step reining in the program by signing a proclamation that restricts entry under an H-1B visa unless accompanied by the $100,000 payment.\n\nThere is currently no fee for existing H-1B holders or those who submitted applications before Sept. 21, according to the administration.\n\n“President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H-1B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the DCNF.\n\n“The Administration’s actions are lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program,” Rogers continued.\n\nAttorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin are now challenging the order in federal court, claiming that there are nationwide labor shortages.\n\nThe Democrat attorneys general lawsuit isn’t the first court challenge against the $100,000 fee.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce — the world’s largest business lobby representing hundreds of thousands of different employers — sued over the proclamation in October, where the case is currently being litigated in federal district court in Washington, D.C., and presided by Obama-appointed Judge Beryl Howell. The massive business lobby argues that the order unlawfully overrides provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act and makes it “cost-prohibitive” for companies to utilize foreign labor.\n\n“This is about the corporate donor class versus the worker class,” Joseph, another tech worker who has struggled to find gainful employment, told the DCNF. “Corporate donors, the large billionaires and millionaires and people making a lot of money off globalization, don’t want it to end.”\n\n“These corporations buy these politicians to bring in this cheap foreign cheap foreign labor, illegal and legal, to depress American wages,” Joseph continued. “It’s a worker issue, not a MAGA issue, so that’s the biggest thing.”\n\nSean O’Brien’s speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention was a pivotal moment cited by Joseph and the other American workers who spoke to the DCNF about the changing political landscape. As president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the largest labor union on the continent, O’Brien made history as the first union leader to address the GOP convention and has since forged closer ties with national Republicans.\n\nMany struggling tech workers said they aren’t looking for handouts from either party, but simply want political leaders to give them a chance to earn an honest day’s work.\n\n“The H-1B program was created in order to cheapen the value of tech labor,” Riley, who left the tech industry entirely due to issues finding work, told the DCNF. “We’ve never had a shortage of tech labor in the United States, and so I don’t see the program continuing to be a good thing.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Both interviews were just another window into why Harris would be a terrible candidate for 2028, given the comments that she made. \n\nHarrison asked Harris about 2028, and she left the door wide open. Meanwhile, the interviewer cried when asked by his wife when the time would come for black women [to be president].\n\nUm, guys? She didn't lose because she was black, any more than Hillary Clinton lost because she was white. They lost because they were lousy candidates. \n\nKamala continued to prove her lack of judgment by praising the dissents of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Harris claimed they were \"brilliant.\" \n\nI'm not sure that's the conclusion that most people would draw from Jackson's dissents. Indeed, here's what Justice Amy Coney Barrett had to say about her colleague's dissent in Trump v. Casa. (Click on the opinion to enlarge.) \n\nREAD MORE: Hot Takes: Amy Coney Barrett's Stinging Rebuke of Ketanji Brown Jackson in Injuctions Ruling LIghts Up X\n\nDecisions are also supposed to be about what is constitutional, not about the \"heartbeat\" like what Harrison said, or whatever Kamala said about \"equity.\" Yes, please read the decisions, but not for the reason Harris says. \n\nThen, on Kimmel's show, the host asked Harris if she and her husband, Doug, drank after the 2020 loss. She looked a bit uncomfortable with that question, and acknowledged it took them \"some time\" [to recover].\n\nAmong the softball questions, Kimmel did ask one good question about the Epstein files and why the Biden/Harris team never released them. That's been a big albatross around their necks for years. Yet her answer was seriously lacking. She claimed it was because they wanted to keep an independence from the Department of Justice and not tell them what to do, that the DOJ should be \"independent\" of politics. \n\n“To give you an answer that will not satisfy your curiosity, I will tell you, we, perhaps to our damage, but we strongly and rightly believed that there should be an absolute separation between what we wanted as an administration and what the Department of Justice did. We absolutely adhered to that and it was right to do that. “The Justice Department would make its decisions independent of any political or personal vendetta or concern that we may have, and that’s the way it worked.”\n\nI think Ed Morrissey at our sister site Hot Air has the best response to this one, if I might quote him here: Bwa-hahahahahahahahaha.\n\nThere are so many things we could talk about, but let's talk about the \"independence\" of the DOJ when they proceeded to raid Mar-a-Lago, the private home of Joe Biden's political opponent, even when the FBI was reportedly raising questions about probable cause. \n\nThen, too, maybe Democrats being all over the Epstein records might have factored into the matter, too.

Meanwhile, it was the Trump administration that actually was prosecuting Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 before he died. \n\nBut perhaps the most unbelievable comment from Harris was what she said happened when she called Trump to see how he was after the assassination attempt in September 2024, the incident at the golf course with alleged wannabe shooter, Ryan Routh. \n\nShe claimed she heard Trump in the background talking about selling his book. This sounds like an entry for \"things that I don't believe really happened,\" and a shot to make him look bad, even after an assassination attempt.

It fulfills a 2024 campaign promise he made in North Carolina.\n\nThe White House media pools were not permitted into the room when the bill was signed. The measure was part of a larger bill called the National Defense Authorization Act, that sets the policy and spending levels for the Department of Defense.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Southern Pines, posted a photograph of himself with Lumbee Chairman John Lowery at the White House for the moment.\n\n“It was a historic day, and long overdue,” Hudson wrote on social media. “Grateful to President Trump for finally delivering full federal recognition and fairness for the Lumbee people.”\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina has 60,000 members and is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River. They’re located in Robeson, Scotland, Hoke and Cumberland counties.\n\nSince 1888, they’ve been fighting for federal recognition, but have faced strong opposition from other tribes, including the Eastern Band of the Cherokee, located in Western North Carolina. The Eastern Band pumped an enormous amount of spending into lobbying efforts against the Lumbee, arguing the tribe should have gone through the Bureau of Indian Affairs for recognition. And the Cherokee have questioned the legitimacy of the Lumbee Tribe’s heritage, culture and race.\n\nDespite that, the Lumbee has had strong bipartisan support from Trump, former Sens. Richard Burr and Elizabeth Dole, Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, all Republicans, and former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and the late Sen. Kay Hagan, all Democrats.\n\nAll of North Carolina’s U.S. House members supported recognition, with the exceptions of Republican Reps. Chuck Edwards and Virginia Foxx. Both represent areas of Western North Carolina that the Eastern Band call home.\n\nCongress ignored requests from the Lumbee for federal recognition until 1956, when lawmakers acknowledged the tribe but added policy into law that they were not eligible for federal benefits.\n\nThe tribe believed it would take an act of Congress to undo the 1956 law.\n\nAt Trump’s Wilmington campaign rally he announced that he believed the Lumbee Tribe had been “wrongly denied federal recognition.”\n\n“Today I am officially announcing that if I am elected in November, I will sign legislation granting the great Lumbee Tribe the federal recognition that it deserves,” Trump said.\n\nOne of Trump’s first acts in his second term in office was to order a study on a legal path forward for the tribe to get federal recognition.\n\nThe report has never been publicized, and a Freedom of Information Act request from McClatchy went unfulfilled. But many speculated that the report also found a congressional act was needed.\n\nNow, 70 years after the 1956 bill passed, Tillis wrestled with how to ensure the tribe was recognized before he retires in 2027. He knew a single senator could block a stand-alone bill.\n\nSo Tillis worked with Budd and Rep. David Rouzer, a Republican from Wilmington, to get the measure into the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n“President Donald Trump pledged to get this done, and he kept that promise,” Tillis said in a news release after the signing. “By signing the Lumbee Fairness Act into law, a historic injustice has been corrected, and the Lumbee people can finally access the full federal benefits they have long earned and deserve.”\n\nSenators had passed the NDAA Wednesday afternoon, while 80 members of the tribe watched from the chamber’s gallery.\n\nThey offered each other fist bumps and high-fives, then went to Tillis’ office to celebrate what took 137 years to get done.\n\nThis story was originally published December 18, 2025 at 7:11 PM.","url":"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article313815946.html","image":"https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/x9yetw/picture304768971/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/lumbee4%20copy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 00:11:17","author":"Danielle Battaglia | Kevin Keister","authors":["Danielle Battaglia | Kevin Keister"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":387705136,"title":"Central Valley Republican nabs endorsements from Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson","text":"A Republican hoping to unseat Rep. Adam Gray, D-Merced, in a Central Valley swing district won endorsements from both President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday.\n\n“It is my Great Honor to endorse Kevin Lincoln, who is running to represent the incredible people of California’s 13th Congressional District,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nHe nodded to Lincoln’s experience serving in the U.S. Marine Corps and as mayor of Stockton. “As your next Congressman, Kevin will work tirelessly to Grow our Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Great Military/Veterans, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump wrote. Johnson, R-La., echoed the praise for Lincoln in his own endorsement on X. “Kevin Lincoln has served our country in uniform and will help us continue to deliver safer streets, secure borders, lower costs, a strong economy, and peace through strength,” the Republican Speaker wrote.\n\nLincoln initially planned to run in a rematch against Rep. Josh Harder, D-Tracy, but switched districts to face Gray last month after California voters approved Proposition 50. The proposition redrew the state’s congressional districts to help Democrats flip five House seats in retribution for Republican-led redistricting in Texas and other states.\n\nThe endorsements from top national Republicans underscores the 13th District’s status as one of California’s few remaining competitive House races after the voter-approved redistricting.\n\nGray won the seat in 2024 from Republican John Duarte by just 187 votes. After Prop. 50, the 13th Congressional District shifted slightly northward into Stockton, which Lincoln represented as mayor from 2020-2024. While it now has a 15-point Democratic registration advantage, Kamala Harris would have beaten Trump by only half a percentage point in 2024.\n\nThe new Prop. 50 map has been challenged in court but is expected to stand after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Texas to use its own gerrymandered lines for the 2026 midterms.\n\nLincoln reports salary from California Republican Party\n\nLincoln received more than $51,000 in income from the California Republican Party this year, according to financial disclosures filed last month.\n\nParty officials and a Lincoln campaign aide confirmed the Stockton Republican was on the state GOP’s payroll for several months this spring but that he left the job before announcing his congressional reelection campaign. Both declined to comment further.\n\nDemocrats equated the salary to Lincoln’s working as a party operative.\n\n“Republicans are clearly in shambles if they’re throwing $50,000 at an unpopular repeat loser,” said Anna Elsasser, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman. “Central Valley voters deserve to know who failed mayor Kevin Lincoln works for — his party bosses or them?”\n\nAccording to the disclosure, Lincoln and his wife reported more than $113,000 in salary income for the first 10 months of this year, including from an advisory business they co-own.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article313817044.html","image":"https://learn.mcclatchyinteractive.com/public/incoming/sffhc5/picture313494356/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2250433024-GI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 00:03:37","author":"Nicole Nixon","authors":["Nicole Nixon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.045},{"id":387492438,"title":"Kimmel, Harris Mourn 'Swift Implementation' Of Conservative Agenda","text":"ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel helped former Vice President Kamala Harris revive her late night book tour on Wednesday as the pair lamented President Trump’s “swift implementation” of a plan that is allegedly about “deconstructing government's ability to have checks and balances on abuse of power.”\n\nKimmel began to wonder, “Do you think that—it's so crazy.

With the House out of session until next year, the clock will resume once it begins again.\n\n“Because you cannot fast-forward the consideration on the floor of a discharge petition,” Johnson said. \n\nOf course, the speaker could easily keep the House in session to allow the legislative calendar to resume. Instead, he’s sending the House home for Christmas without any solution. \n\nUnderstandably, many Republicans are not happy about it. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) criticized Johnson for keeping the House out of session for almost two months during the government shutdown. \n\n“It was definitely a mistake for him not to bring one of these compromise measures to the floor,” Kiley told The Independent. \n\nKiley has been angry at Johnson for a while, given how he handled the government shutdown, but also for the fact that Johnson did not come up with a congressional solution for redistricting, which allowed for Texas to redraw its map to favor Republicans. That led to California voting for Proposition 50, which allows a one-time partisan redraw of its congressional map, which now means Kiley could lose his race.\n\nKiley also torched Jeffries for the way he handled the health care premium crisis.\n\n“But you could equally say that Jeffries didn't meet him halfway, because he said, ‘No, I'm going to support this one and only one uncompromising, rigid proposal with no reforms that the Senate has already rejected and so has no chance of becoming law.’”\n\nIn Kiley’s defense, a three-year extension will not pass in the Senate. Republicans killed it last week. Kiley signed separate discharge petitions from a bipartisan coterie of lawmakers to force a vote. \n\nInstead, the House voted only on a grab-bag list of health care policies cobbled together on Wednesday evening that did not include an extension of the health care premiums. \n\nBut Johnson prevented even a vote on amendments to extend the subsidies on the health care bill, driving those four moderates into the arms of Democrats and Jeffries. But that is cold comfort, as Americans fear their premiums will be unaffordable\n\n“It's also like the administration giving the middle finger to the American people,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) told The Independent.\n\nBut while Democrats are understandably steamed about the expiration of the tax credits, so are many of the Republicans in tough races. Letting the tax credits expire and letting premiums skyrocket is political suicide.\n\nThis explains why Reps Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Lawler of New York, both of whom represent districts that voted for Kamala Harris, signed the discharge petition. Reps. Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania flipped two toss-up seats in 2024. \n\nAnd Sen. Susan Collins, the only Republican from a state that voted for Harris, told The Independent that she’s working on a bill. But Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune–as well as President Donald Trump–seem perfectly content to sacrifice these frontliners and let the tax credits expire.\n\nIt’s another piece of evidence of how Johnson has ruled the House with the dual focus of maintaining his own power by avoiding a conservative revolt against him and pleasing Trump. And Trump opposes an extension. \n\nRather, Republicans spent their last day in Washington passing anti-trans messaging bills that would criminalize providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth and ban Medicaid from covering care for transgender people younger than 18. \n\nThese bills will likely fail in the House or never receive a vote. But it shows that Johnson and Republicans care about throwing red meat rather than solving actual problems. \n\nAs Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) told The Independent last week, “They're going to be sending huge lumps of coal home in stockings for people, and that's a big problem for them.” And it will be a crisis of Republicans’ own making.","summary":"Sending the House home without a solution on health care is career suicide for many Republicans, Eric Garcia writes.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) could win the presidency in 2028. But that perception is shifting. A new poll from The Argument/Verasight found that Ocasio-Cortez would receive 51% of the vote in a hypothetical matchup against Vice President JD Vance, the presumptive GOP frontrunner. Shortly after, Ocasio-Cortez shared the results on X with the caption: \"Bloop!\" While some analysts quickly dismissed the poll, Fox News Radio host Guy Benson, one of the more objective voices in political commentary, did not. \"I can’t see [AOC] winning the presidency,\" Fox Business host Stuart Varney told Benson on Thursday. \"Can you?\" \"Yes,\" Benson replied. \"I would not bet on it, but I think it’s absolutely possible. If she ran for president, she’d have at least a decent fighter’s chance to win the nomination. I don’t think she’d be the front-runner, and I’m not sure she’d win it, but I do think there’s a real possibility.\" Benson added that in the United States, presidential elections typically come down to a binary choice. \"In a normal election cycle, I don’t think she could win. But if the public were fed up with Republicans or the incumbents and she represented major change, I could absolutely see her winning,\" he concluded. He is right. Considering that Democratic primary voters appeared to prefer Bernie Sanders in both 2016 and 2020 until party leaders intervened, it is not far-fetched to suggest that Ocasio-Cortez could win the nomination in 2028. At that point, in theory, the general election is a 50-50 race. Still, like Benson, we would not bet on Ocasio-Cortez becoming the next President of the United States. Internal Democratic polling last year found that swing voters had largely rejected Kamala Harris because they felt her policies were too far to the left of the median voter. Ocasio-Cortez is, by definition, more radical than Harris. Furthermore, polling this far out (or even a week before the election) is hardly bulletproof. As was the case with Sanders, party leadership would likely prefer a candidate such as Gavin Newsom, whom they can more easily package as a moderate. However, as former California residents can attest, his record suggests otherwise. Regardless, the prospect of an Ocasio-Cortez presidency should be taken seriously, however concerning that may be for the foundation of America.","summary":"A new Verasight poll shows Rep.

Democrats also won in other local elections, including by big margins in areas with significant numbers of Latino voters. Now, that's a big change from the 2024 presidential election, when those same parts of Virginia shifted slightly toward Republicans. Margaret Barthel of member station WAMU reports on what's behind those changing margins.\n\nMARGARET BARTHEL, BYLINE: Virginia's House of Delegates District 22 is about an hour west of D.C., where suburban sprawl gives way to farms. It's a political battleground. President Trump won it in 2016 and lost it to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024 by about a single point.\n\nLast month, though, the margin between the political parties looked different. Delegate-elect Elizabeth Guzman, a Democrat, won the seat by 10 percentage points, ousting incumbent Republican Ian Lovejoy, a moderate conservative. Guzman thinks part of the reason for her win is the district's Latino voters - some of whom supported President Trump just last year - are now wary of giving their vote to a GOP candidate again. That's something she heard out door-knocking.\n\nELIZABETH GUZMAN: The first thing, they would look at me, it's like, you a Republican or Democrat? And I said, I'm a Democrat. OK, because we don't want to vote for any more Republicans anymore. They betrayed us and we are not happy.\n\nBARTHEL: Data shows 14% of the population here identifies as Hispanic. The shifting opinion Guzman heard on the campaign trail is reflective of what happened in other major races in November, and it comes at a moment when 70% of Latinos disapprove of the job Trump is doing. That's according to a recent Pew Research poll.\n\nGUZMAN: No. 1, we are under attack here.\n\nBARTHEL: Guzman, who is a social worker in her day job, says the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement is causing widespread fear where she lives, including in her own family. She said she'd made sure that her kids had real IDs to prove that they are citizens if they get stopped by ICE. Republicans ignore those worries at their own peril, she says.\n\nGUZMAN: Our president is hurting the country and is hurting us. And none of them wanted to recognize that.\n\nBARTHEL: In neighboring Loudoun County, voter Jose Ramiro Cruz has similar concerns.\n\nJOSE RAMIRO CRUZ: I am really upset about the label that we Latinos have been given in terms of being criminals or being, you know, uneducated and all that.\n\nBARTHEL: Cruz said he volunteered this year for Democrats because of his anger at Republicans for that rhetoric. He's also worried about the economy. Marvin Hernandez managed the Virginia campaign for CASA in Action, a progressive national political group that organizes Black and Latino voters.\n\nMARVIN HERNANDEZ: We came across some voters that they said, they stated - right? - I voted for Trump 'cause I thought that the economy will improve. But that hasn't changed.\n\nBARTHEL: Hernandez said CASA in Action and other Democratic-aligned groups capitalized on voter frustrations with Trump, spending money on Spanish-language ads. Srilekha Palle, a conservative political consultant in Northern Virginia, admits that investment paid off.\n\nSRILEKHA PALLE: I think what Democrats does well is they would go to, let's say, Telemundo and advertise like there is no other day. Republicans will not even have one ad in there.\n\nBARTHEL: She says her own party missed an opportunity to emphasize Virginia's economic strength under a Republican governor. Sam Shirazi, a Virginia political analyst, points out Democrats' focus on affordability as the core of their campaign comes just a year after Republicans did the same thing to win the presidential race.\n\nSAM SHIRAZI: We're kind of entering an era where perhaps some of those voters will go back and forth and they aren't necessarily loyal to either party.\n\nBARTHEL: But for now, Shirazi said the swing left among Latino voters in Virginia is a warning sign for Republicans in the midterms next year.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Margaret Barthel in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TENDAI SONG, \"TIME IN OUR LIVES\")\n\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.
