Kamala Harris — raised more than $41 million during the unrest, pledging to support protesters jailed during demonstrations.\n\nBut a FOX 9 investigation found the fund spent most of its money in 2020 bailing out defendants accused of murder, kidnapping and sexual assault, rather than low-level protest offenses.\n\nAmong them was Christopher Boswell, a twice-convicted rapist freed pending new kidnapping and assault charges after the fund posted $350,000 in cash bail.\n\nThe group also paid $100,000 to release Darnika Floyd, charged with second-degree murder, and $75,000 for Jaleel Stallings, who allegedly fired at a Minneapolis SWAT team before being acquitted at trial. Stallings has claimed he fired in self-defense.\n\n“The last time we were down there, the clerk said, ‘we hate it when you bail out these sex offenders,’” Greg Lewin, then the fund’s interim executive director, told FOX 9 at the time.\n\n“I often don’t even look at a charge when I bail someone out,” Lewin said. \n\n“I will see it after I pay the bill because it is not the point. The point is the system we are fighting.”\n\nCritics have accused the fund of enabling violent offenders to reoffend while hiding behind social justice rhetoric.\n\nIn one case, the group posted bail for George Howard, a career criminal later charged with fatally shooting a man in a Minneapolis road rage attack weeks after his release.\n\nThe Free Beacon report said Mavis Jones’s donation resurfaced as her husband campaigns to become Virginia’s top law enforcement officer — a post that oversees state prosecutions and police oversight. It has reignited questions about the couple’s views on criminal justice and public safety.\n\nJay Jones’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news follows a damaging month for the 35-year-old Norfolk Democrat.\n\nEarlier this month, text messages surfaced in which Jones wrote that then–House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican, “deserved to be shot in the head” and that he wished Gilbert’s wife could “watch her children die.”\n\nJones later apologized, saying he was “ashamed” of the texts though he has refused to withdraw from the race.\n\nHis Republican opponent, Attorney General Jason Miyares, seized on the latest controversy, saying Jones’s repeated lapses show a pattern of contempt for law enforcement and victims.\n\nThe backlash has already taken a toll. A Trafalgar Group poll released Oct. 17 showed Miyares leading 49.5% to 44.6%, a reversal from earlier surveys that had Jones up six points before the text scandal broke.\n\nFurther complicating matters, court records show Jones was convicted of reckless driving in 2022 for driving 116 mph on a Virginia highway.\n\nHe was fined $1,500 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service, but a state ethics review is examining whether half of those hours — spent volunteering for his own political action committee — should count toward the sentence.","summary":"The report follows a string of damaging stories about violent text messages, reckless driving and an ethics probe into his community service hours.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/us-news/virginia-ag-candidate-jay-joness-wife-donated-to-fund-that-bailed-out-accused-rapists-murderers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/114120167.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/aqGviTND-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:03:58","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":372315116,"title":"Anti-Woke New CBS Boss Eyeing Fox News' Bret Baier for Key Position... as Bari Weiss 'Quietly Canvassing' for Top Conservative Amid Major Revamp","text":"The anti-woke new boss at CBS News is reportedly looking towards right-wing Fox News for their next top talent, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nBari Weiss has her eye on FOX star Bret Baier, who anchors the cable network's 6 p.m. hour Monday through Friday, as CBS Evening News continues to see an exodus of viewers following an even more left-leaning slant it has taken in recent months.'Quietly Canvassing' for BaierWeiss, 41, was brought aboard to shake things up at CBS News and its programs, such as the stalwart 60 Minutes, by right-leaning David Ellison, the Chairman and CEO of Paramount, the network's parent company.\n\nAccording to Olivier Darcy in his Status newsletter, Weiss has been \"quietly canvassing” for a major makeover of their flagship nightly news show, with Baier's name mentioned as a potential anchor.\n\nHowever, the longtime FOX personality is under contract with the network until 2028, which would make his immediate availability nearly impossible, Darcy noted.Both Sides of the AisleBaier has been a familiar face to Fox News viewers since joining the network in 1998 as its Atlanta bureau chief and correspondent.\n\nAfter serving stints as Fox's Pentagon and White House correspondent, respectively, he has been anchoring Special Report with Bret Baier since 2009.\n\nBaier received widespread kudos for a tough 2023 interview with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, where he pressed the Republican hard on many issues, including the tycoon's claims that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen. \n\nThe journalist also proved his interviewing chops with Trump's 2024 Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, giving the press-shy politician one of her few challenging sit-downs. It was branded \"contentious\" as the two went at it over immigration and border security.A 'Champion of Principled Journalism'Moderate Weiss was given the mission to restore balance to CBS News when Ellison announced her hiring on October 6, after the Tiffany Network had been accused of going overly woke. \n\n\"We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home,\" Ellison said about Weiss's big task, calling her a \"proven champion of independent, principled journalism.\"\n\nWeiss worked as an opinion writer at the New York Times before quitting in 2020 amid claims of \"constant bullying\" in an \"illiberal environment.\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native went on to grow her voice in online journalism, co-founding the newsletter The Free Press in 2021. She grew it into a formidable media company, which was purchased by Ellison's Paramount Skydance for $150million earlier this year. \n\nWeiss has been tasked with righting the ship at the network's flagship nightly news program, which saw a major overhaul in January before her arrival. \n\nNorah O'Donnell was booted from her anchor seat, which she had held since 2019, and replaced by the team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois in January. The show took on a more magazine-style format, also featuring Washington D.C. correspondent Margaret Brennan and weather reporter Lonnie Quinn.\n\nThe revamp was a major miss with viewers, who fled in droves. \n\nO'Donnell departed CBS Evening News with 4.8 million viewers, which has since dropped to 4.1 million.'Bias' at '60 Minutes'Weiss is already rattling cages at 60 Minutes after a staff meeting, asking, \"Why does the country think you're biased?\" leaving the venerable correspondents reeling..\n\nThe New York Times reported the question left a “stunned awkwardness” in the room. \n\nTrump sued the longtime news magazine show in October 2024, claiming \"deceptive conduct\" for allegedly editing an interview with Harris during the campaign to make her answers appear more articulate.\n\nCBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, famously agreed to pay Trump $16million in August to settle the lawsuit.","summary":"Bari Weiss was brought aboard to restore balance and is taking a look to longtime anchor Bret Baier for the 'CBS Evening News' seat","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/anti-woke-cbs-boss-bari-weiss-eyeing-fox-news-bret-baier-key-position/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/2U67vanYk/0x0/bari-weiss-bret-baier-1761338740127.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 21:30:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":372322570,"title":"Dems Probably Won’t Be Able To Govern If They Win Big In 2026, House Dem Says","text":"Democratic California Rep. Josh Harder made a striking admission about his party this week: Democrats might not be able to govern effectively if they retake House control during the midterms.\n\nHarder, a results-oriented Democrat who wants to slash regulations to build more housing and energy projects, voiced concern about his party’s ability to make progress on key issues if Democrats win back the House in 2026. Harder said it is paramount for Abundance-pilled Democrats to achieve breakthroughs on their policy priorities in the current GOP-controlled Congress because those issues could become more difficult to solve under Democratic leadership. (RELATED: Democrat Matt Bennett Warns His Party ‘In Terrible Shape’ And Won’t Recover For Years)\n\n“We’ve got to get stuff done right now even under a Republican trifecta,” Harder said during a panel appearance at the New Liberal Action Summit on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, there are so many parts of the Democratic Party that are still very opposed to this agenda that if we flip the House some of these problems may be more difficult to solve, which is a little frustrating to say as someone who wants to do that.”\n\nThough a growing number of Democrats have embraced the center-left Abundance movement following a string of high-profile governing failures in blue states and cities, Harder voiced frustration that many Democrats still oppose cutting red tape and making it easier to build housing and infrastructure projects.\n\n Democrats In Disarray!

Democrats have largely focused their messaging on combating President Donald Trump roughly ten months into his second term.\n\nHouse Democrats have largely avoided putting forth concrete policy proposals of how they would govern in the majority since the beginning of the new Congress in January.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Wendy first arrived in the USA at three years old, although she has not given concrete information on when she became a naturalized citizen. \n\nEddie came to the country when he was older than Wendy, but he was still a child.

If she called Democratic members, those members could later disclose that they had spoken to her and misrepresent the purpose of the call.”\n\nBiden went on to endorse Harris just 27 minutes after ending his own campaign — after the vice president warned that waiting longer, as the president’s advisers initially planned, could trigger competition for the party nomination.\n\n“It needed to come immediately,” Karl writes of the then-veep’s insistence. “Otherwise, she argued, Biden would be opening the door to an ugly fight for the nomination.”\n\nHarris went on to lose to Trump in an Electoral College landslide, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate in 20 years to lose the popular vote.\n\n“Retribution” hits bookstores Oct. 28.","summary":"President Joe Biden spurned former President Barack Obama's calls in the two weeks before Biden dropped his re-election bid last July.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/us-news/biden-refused-to-speak-with-obama-for-weeks-before-and-after-dropping-out-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/biden-obama-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/aqGviTND-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-24 20:28:07","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":372325682,"title":"Jean-Pierre refuses to tell CNN whether Biden should be president now, won't read book about his decline","text":"Former Biden White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wouldn't directly say if Joe Biden should be president right now during an interview on CNN, arguing with an anchor about why she wouldn't read the bestselling book about a cover-up of his decline in office. \"Do you think he should be president right now?\" Keilar asked. \"Do you think that he is capable right now of being president?

The percentage of Hispanic adults who say the country is going in the wrong direction has also increased slightly over the past few months, from 63% in March to 73% now.The shift could spell trouble for Republicans looking to cement support with this group in future elections. Many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year's election, and the new poll shows that despite Trump's promises of economic revitalization, Hispanic adults continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans overall. Hispanic voters made up 10% of the electorate in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters, and the number of eligible Hispanic voters has been growing rapidly in recent decades.Alejandro Ochoa, 30, is a warehouse worker in Adelanto, California. He identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump last year, but he’s now unhappy with the president. He criticized some of Trump’s budget cuts, adding that the cost of groceries is too high and buying a home is still unattainable for him.RELATED STORY | Americans grow anxious about jobs and inflation under Trump, new poll shows“He was kind of relying on essentially the nostalgia of, ‘Hey, remember, before COVID? Things weren’t as expensive,’” Ochoa said. “But now it’s like, OK, you’re in office. I’m still getting done dirty at the grocery store. I’m still spending an insane amount of money. I’m trying to cut corners where I can, but that bill is still insanely expensive.”Declining approval on economy and immigrationHispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the last election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris: 43% of Hispanic voters nationally voted for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.But the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump's handling of the economy and immigration — two issues that were major strengths for him in last year's presidential campaign — and their views of his overall presidential performance have slipped a little as well.In March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.Over the past few months, Hispanic communities have also been a target of the president’s hard-line immigration tactics. The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March.Some see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.RELATED STORY | Most Americans fear rising health care costs as shutdown drags on, poll saysFel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioral specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates. He said he appreciates Trump’s views on transgender issues, including restroom access for transgender women.But he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration policies leave many people living in fear, with negative effects on the economy.“A lot of people rely on immigrants to do labor in certain areas,” Echandi said. “When that gets affected, all prices go up. Our food costs more because of the costs to get people to do that work.”The poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared with the rest of the country. More Hispanics say the cost of groceries, housing and health care and the amount of money they get paid are “major” sources of stress, compared with U.S. adults overall.Favorability among Hispanic Republicans drops slightlyViews of Trump have even soured a little among Hispanic Republicans.In the latest poll, 66% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Trump. That's a slight shift compared with where Trump stood in an AP-NORC poll from September 2024, when 83% of Hispanic Republicans viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably. About 8 in 10 white Republicans had a favorable view of Trump in the new poll, which was unchanged from the year before.In another potentially worrying sign for the president, younger Hispanics and Hispanic men — two groups that swung particularly dramatically toward him in last year's election — also see him a bit more negatively.About two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll. That's a slight uptick from September 2024, when about half in both groups had a negative opinion of him.Other concerns about Trump's chaotic second term emerged in interviews.Teresa Covarrubias, a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, feels things are going in the wrong direction and said she was troubled by how some of Trump’s actions have defied norms and may impact social safety net programs.“My major concern is the disregard for the Constitution and the law, and then also the level of cronyism,” said Covarrubias, who is an independent voter. “The people at the top are just grifting and taking, and then there’s the rest of us.”Hispanic adults are more likely to prioritize immigrationThere are signs in the poll that Trump's tough immigration approach may be alienating some Hispanic adults. Over the past few months, the president has doubled down on his pledge of mass deportations, with escalating crackdowns in Latino neighborhoods in cities including Chicago.The poll found that, in general, Hispanic adults are more likely to say immigration is an important issue to them personally. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults.And although their views on immigration enforcement aren't uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. About one-quarter of Hispanic adults support this policy, the new poll found, while roughly half of them are opposed and the rest don’t have an opinion. Among U.S. adults overall, about 4 in 10 favor deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, while 34% are opposed and about 2 in 10 don’t have an opinion.Rick Alvarado, 63, a Republican who lives in San Diego, says he still supports Trump and praised his actions to cut public spending. Alvarado, a property manager, is behind Trump's immigration crackdown in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, saying he believes some immigrants are involved in organized crime.But he added that he would like to see a solution for those without criminal records to obtain legal residency status.“The people who are productive should have a pathway to stay here somehow,” Alvarado said.","summary":"President Donald Trump's favorability has fallen among Hispanic adults since the beginning of the year, a new AP-NORC poll shows.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/hispanics-views-of-trump-have-changed-since-january-new-poll-says","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/283b2e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+51/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F47%2F41%2F9bdf45a644a596f0df1326d3618f%2Fap25294487822568.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 19:09:25","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":372295106,"title":"'On the wrong side': White House rages at Trump donors for supporting PAC that helps Dems","text":"A new political action committee formed by some of Silicon Valley’s wealthiest to spearhead a $100 million midterm strategy to back candidates of both parties who support a national framework for artificial intelligence regulations has infuriated the White House, according to MSNBC.\n\nLaunched in August, the PAC called Leading the Future has angered President Donald Trump because of its bipartisan nature and its plans to back AI-friendly candidates from both political parties — which could potentially help Democrats win back control of Congress, MSNBC reports.\n\nOne the super PAC's leaders is a former top staffer to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), which isn't sitting well with the White House.\n\nThat staffer, Josh Vlasto, is Schumer’s former press secretary, who during the 2024 election cycle helped advise Fairshake — a $130 million tech-led effort to elect candidates who support cryptocurrency, MSNBC says.\n\n“Any group run by Schumer acolytes will not have the blessing of the president or his team,” a White House official familiar with Trump's thinking on the matter told NBC News. “Any donors or supporters of this group should think twice about getting on the wrong side of Trump world.”\n\n“We are carefully monitoring who is involved,” the official added.\n\nOther members of the PAC include private equity giant Andreesseen Horowitz, whose billionaire co-founder, Marc Andreesseen, is a close Trump adviser;

Bennett pointed to the party’s weak polling on the show to argue Democrats are “in terrible shape” and asserted they have not yet worked on solving their issues.\n\n“We’re in terrible shape. Like, we just have to be very honest with ourselves — the Democratic Party is in really, really bad shape,” Bennett told Halperin. “The fact that our approval rating is, depending on the poll you believe, somewhere in the 20s or the teens, while [President] Donald Trump is busy kind of vandalizing the government — that ain’t good.”\n\n“And I think there are many reasons for that, which we can discuss, but we have not begun to address those problems. I do think we will not be able to fully address them until we have a leader, and that won’t be for like three years, when we nominate somebody for president,” he continued. “Because parties ultimately are defined by their leaders — and defined by them almost entirely.”\n\nMoreover, a July 16 Quinnipiac University poll found that just 19% of voters approved of Democrats in Congress, an all-time low for the polling outlet.\n\nBennett said the party would flounder until it selected its nominee, which he noted would take years.\n\n“[T]he nominees and the presidents make the party brand, and for the next few years, we won’t have that. So it’s going to be a tough couple of years deep in the wilderness for us,” he said. “And I think there are some things we can do to set the table for the nominee. But right now, I don’t feel like we’re doing it.”\n\nThird Way urged Democrats in an August memo to avoid using woke language that it warned could repel voters. The think tank advised Democrats to refrain from using 45 words and phrases that it argued “no ordinary person would ever dream of” saying, asserting certain terms make the party sound like “extreme, divisive, elitist, and obfuscatory enforcers of wokeness.”\n\nA New York Times analysis of voter registration data released in August also found that the Democratic Party experienced a decline of around 2.1 million registered voters between the 2020 and 2024 elections.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom led the pack of potential 2028 Democratic contenders with 21% among registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris at 19% and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 12%, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Andrew Cuomo’s bid and early voting will begin in a matter of days.\n\nJeffries, D-N.Y., who represents part of Brooklyn, had refused to weigh in on the mayoral race for months. As late as Friday morning, Jeffries shirked the opportunity to endorse a candidate.\n\n“I have not refused to endorse,” he told reporters. “I have refused to articulate my position, and I will, momentarily, at some point, in advance of early voting.”\n\nMamdani won the Democratic mayoral primary on June 24, and early voting begins on Saturday ahead of the Nov. 4 election.\n\nEarly on, Mamdani picked up support from fellow democratic socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Mamdani has also received endorsements from other prominent Democrats, among them New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, the lack of an endorsement from Jeffries or from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., suggests many national Democrat leaders have been hesitant to support him. Van Hollen has accused New York Democrats of “spineless politics” for not backing Mamdani.\n\nMamdani has passed on opportunities to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” has defended Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, and has called for city-run grocery stores and a freeze on rents as ways to address the city’s affordability crisis. \n\nHe has also released a policy proposal to budget $65 million for “gender-affirming care” for “both transgender youth and adults.”\n\nJeffries is endorsing Mamdani at a time when he is also attempting to deliver a message on the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nMamdani will face off against Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa and Cuomo, who is running as an independent. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, was elected as a Democrat in 2021, but chose to run as an independent in 2025 before ultimately dropping out.\n\nAdams has endorsed Cuomo, while Trump has told The Daily Signal that Mamdani “should be able to win,” given his lead in the polls.\n\nThe president has, however, indicated his preference for Cuomo over Mamdani, telling The Daily Signal, “I would rather have a Democrat than a communist.”\n\nA RealClearPolitics aggregation of October polls shows Mamdani leading Cuomo 47% to 29.8%, with Sliwa at a distant third place with 16% support.

The White House has moved to fire federal workers and slash funding for projects in areas governed by Democrats, which have drawn legal challenges.\nAttempting to pay US military troops during the shutdown could prove to be politically popular – and also highlight congressional Democrats’ refusal to approve a government spending bill. But federal law generally forbids individuals from making earmarked gifts to the government.\n\nWhile individuals can make unconditional gifts to the US Treasury, they are credited to the general fund or used to pay down the national debt. The money cannot be spent without a congressional appropriation – and it is that lack of an appropriation that has shut down the government.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether using the money to pay the troops would violate the law.\nThe US$130 million total would cover only a small portion of the payroll for the nation’s roughly 1.3 million active-duty military members – averaging about US$100 per person.\nThe government spent US$9.8 billion on military personnel in September, according to the Treasury Department. The next pay date for troops is on October 29.\nTrump on Thursday said that an unnamed “friend” of his wrote a check for US$130 million to pay for shortfalls within the military. Federal civilian employees and military service members generally aren’t paid during the shutdown.\nNonetheless, Trump earlier this month directed the Pentagon to find any available funds to pay the troops.\nThere are exceptions to federal restrictions on the government accepting donations. The National Park Service is one, allowing Trump to accept donations to fund his renovations to the White House, which sits in a national park.\nUnder laws dating to 1956, the military also has limited authority to accept private donations – but only for two specific purposes: to support military schools, hospitals, libraries, museums, cemeteries and similar institutions, and to help service members and civilian employees who are wounded or killed in the line of duty, and their families.\n\nThe White House has expanded its authority over federal budgetary measures during the shutdown.\nTrump’s budget director Russell Vought has claimed that he can unilaterally pause spending or lay off federal employees during a shutdown, prompting legal fights. The cuts have largely been concentrated in jurisdictions that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.\nThe Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment about what authority the government has to accept gifts for military pay.\nThe shutdown, which began on October 1, shows no signs of ending soon with Republicans and Democrats at an impasse over funding the federal government.\nDemocrats have insisted that any spending bill must also include an renewal of expiring healthcare subsidies.","summary":"The Pentagon said it received an anonymous US$130 million donation to pay the military during the US government shutdown, a move the Trump administration might not legally be able to carry out.\n“On October 23, 2025, the Department of War accepted an anonymous donation of US$130 million under its general gift acceptance authority,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement on Friday.\n“The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3330283/anonymous-trump-friend-gifts-pentagon-us130-million-pay-us-troops-during-shutdown","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/25/0082e451-1b9a-4fe9-9b4a-c5432e42a6e0_eaf7ff1b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 18:04:14","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":372285236,"title":"House Republicans Blunt ‘Blue Wave’ Hopes As Democrats Falter In Fundraising","text":"Nearly a year out from the midterms, House Republicans are touting a notable fundraising edge that could help the party maintain House control in 2026.\n\nFor the first time since 2015, the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm, has outraised its Democratic counterpart in the first three quarters of an election cycle. Though midterm elections tend to go poorly for the party in power, lackluster fundraising for Democrats and a relatively poor performance on the generic ballot show the party in a weaker position than in previous election cycles. (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says GOP’s Odds Of Keeping Control Of House ‘Up Like A Rocket’)\n\nThe NRCC has reported roughly $720,000 more in year-to-date fundraising than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\nIn stark contrast, the DCCC held nearly a $9 million advantage after the first three fundraising quarters of 2017. Democrats would go on to win 41 seats in the 2018 midterms and reclaim control of the House.\n\nIn the first three fundraising quarters of 2025, the NRCC reported a $20 million uptick in contributions compared to the same period in 2017. The House Republican campaign arm also has $7.5 million more in the bank at the end of September 2025 than it had in September 2017.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie: House Republicans have the momentum, the message, and the money while Democrats are broke, divided, and out of gas,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement.\n\n“The NRCC is grasping at straws because poll after poll shows House Republicans are sinking in battleground districts,” DCCC spokesman Aidan Johnson said in a statement to the DCNF. “At the end of the day, voters are what matter, and it’s clear they’re done with Republicans’ broken promises and ready to send Democrats back to the majority next November.”\n\nThough the DCCC reported slightly more in Q3 receipts than the NRCC’s $24 million haul, House Democrats’ campaign arm has reported less in year-to-date fundraising in 2025 compared to the last cycle in 2023. The DCCC had a $23 million edge over the NRCC at the end of September that year.\n\nRepublicans have also maintained a financial edge among their most vulnerable incumbents compared to their Democratic counterparts.\n\nHouse Republicans on the NRCC’s Patriot list — the party’s most endangered incumbents — raised an average of $763,000 in the third fundraising quarter, which runs from July to September.\n\nThree NRCC Patriots, Reps. Young Kim of California, Mike Lawler of New York, and Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin, reported fundraising hauls over $1 million in the third quarter.\n\nVulnerable Republican incumbents also maintained a significant cash-on-hand advantage over their Democratic counterparts through the end of September.\n\nThe DCCC’s Frontliners — considered to be the most vulnerable Democrats running for reelection — reported an average fundraising haul of $664,000 during the year’s third fundraising quarter, according to the NRCC’s analysis. Four Democrats, including Maine Rep. Jared Golden, reported more than $1 million in receipts during the third quarter.\n\nDemocrats have also not been able to keep up their polling performance on the generic ballot compared to 2017.\n\nDemocrats hold just a 2.6-point lead on the RealClearPolitics polling average as of Friday. On Oct. 24, 2017, Democrats led Republicans in the generic ballot by 10.3 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats’ weaker performance in the generic ballot comes as the party’s approval rating has fallen to historic lows. A July Wall Street Journal poll found a net favorability rating of -30 for Democrats — the worst figure for the party since the pollster began asking the question in 1990.\n\nMatt Bennett, co-founder of liberal think tank Third Way, argued Thursday that the Democratic Party’s weak approval rating signals the party could remain in dismal shape through the midterms.\n\n“We’re in terrible shape. Like, we just have to be very honest with ourselves — the Democratic Party is in really, really bad shape,” Bennett told Halperin.\n\n“We have not begun to address those problems,” Bennett continued. “I do think we will not be able to fully address them until we have a leader, and that won’t be for like three years, when we nominate somebody for president.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC) also continues to trounce its Democratic rival in fundraising and cash on hand. The RNC has $86 million in the bank compared to the DNC’s $12 million at the end of September — a $74 million gap.\n\nThe DNC notably doled out $1.6 million in September alone — and has paid out more than $20 millon in total — to cover former Vice President Kamala Harris’s leftover campaign debt from her failed presidential run.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Owens’ request has not yet been approved, pending additional medical documentation, McLellan said, but he expects he will need to recommend appointing an interim fire chief during the Nov. 10 City Council meeting.\n\nBoth McLellan and Mayor George Lapointe declined additional comment, saying it was a personnel matter.\n\nOwens, reached Friday, said he was frustrated that city officials released information about his request.\n\nOwens said he has had the medical issues, which he declined to specify, for years and had been considering taking medical leave for a while.\n\nOwens’ request came days after he made disparaging comments on social media about No Kings protesters in Augusta, frustrating dozens of Hallowell residents, with some calling for his dismissal.\n\n“Drove past the Augusta rally. You could identify the attendees easily,” Owens wrote on Facebook. “Old white hairs, young purple hairs with lots of nose rings, young men with man buns drinking their Starbucks. Didn’t see any guys in work boots who were missing work. Is there anyone who believes this will make any difference? I wore my mask driving by so I wouldn’t catch (Trump Derangement Syndrome).”\n\nOwens said his request for indefinite medical leave had no relation to his comments on social media.\n\n“I’m not that weak of a person to let them push me out like that,” Owens said. “I’ve been doing this for 50 years, so I’m not going to tuck my tail between my legs and run away crying over somebody’s hurt feelings.”\n\nOwens has been the subject of ire from Hallowell’s famously liberal residents before. Only four municipalities in Maine — Portland, South Portland, Camden and Bar Harbor — voted more heavily in favor of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nIn 2023, city officials investigated the fire department’s training and public safety protocols after Owens denied a request for additional security and traffic control support at the city’s Pride Parade. Leaders of the Hallowell Pride Alliance also expressed concerns about his non-response to support requests during Pride events in years prior.\n\nIn 2022, Owens oversaw the opening of a new fire station in Stevens Commons in 2022 — a process that spun a yearslong controversy over the fate of the historic station on Second Street.","summary":"James Owens, who has been Hallowell's fire chief since 2017, made disparaging social media comments about No Kings protesters in Augusta days prior to requesting the leave.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/10/24/hallowell-fire-chief-seeks-indefinite-medical-leave/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/35034140_20230314_HallowellTrucks_9782-1679341193.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 17:15:52","author":"Ethan Horton","authors":["Ethan Horton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":372265072,"title":"Fetterman Criticizes Kamala Harris for Use of ‘Fascist’ Rhetoric Against Trump","text":"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., made headlines this week by chastising his party’s 2024 presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, over her campaign rhetoric.\n\n“When Vice President Harris referred to President Trump as a ‘fascist,’ and I knew, absolutely, we lost the plot at that point,” Fetterman told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday. \n\nThe senator, who comes from a swing state that Trump won in the 2024 presidential election, noted that portraying the president in that way was essentially mischaracterizing the tens of millions of Americans who supported him.\n\n“If you call the president or someone like a ‘fascist,’ you are effectively calling the people who are going to vote for him [the same thing] and then they must be fascist, too … or they support fascism and those things. And that is just not true,” the Pennsylvania senator added.\n\nThe senator’s comments come days after the nationwide left-wing “No Kings” protests, which featured at least one attendee publicly celebrating the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. During a Piers Morgan interview published this week, left-wing political commentator Harry Sisson dared his conservative co-panelists to cite an instance in which Harris called the president “Hitler.”\n\n“When did Kamala Harris call Donald Trump, Hitler?” Sisson asked, to which conservative commentator Isabel Brown replied: “October of 2024, Kamala Harris said on the campaign trail, ‘Donald Trump vowed to be a dictator on Day One. His former chief of staff said he wanted generals like Hitler’s. Donald Trump openly admired dictators, including Adolf Hitler.’ Last October, that was said on the campaign trail, from the Democrat nominee.” \n\nConservative political activist Jack Posobiec added, “So, Kamala Harris said this during the campaign, during the closing days of the campaign. It was her final campaign pitch.” \n\nWhen asked during a CNN town hall in October 2024 whether she considered Trump to be a fascist, Harris replied, “Yes, I do. Yes, I do.”\n\nFetterman’s comments critiquing Harris are just the latest remarks the senator has made where he has broken with his party over its tactics. The Pennsylvania lawmaker has also opposed his party on the federal government shutdown, which is now the second-longest in U.S. history. \n\nIn early October, Fetterman told The Daily Signal, “We shouldn’t be having this conversation. You shouldn’t be shutting our government down.”\n\n“When the Republicans were doing it, we rightly criticized them, attacked them for doing that … . Don’t shut it down. It’s fundamentally wrong,” the Pennsylvania senator added.\n\nFetterman voted Thursday to pay active-duty military members and essential federal workers. The senator explained on the social media platform X on Wednesday. \n\n“Shut our government down and America loses. 2 MILLION Pennsylvanians depend on SNAP to feed their families.

The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March.\n\nSome see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.\n\nFel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioral specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates.

About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults.\n\nAnd although their views on immigration enforcement aren’t uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Bush redesigned \n\nthe rug; Obama adopted taupe tones and \n\na quotation-woven carpet.

She linked them to a \n\nwider pattern of drones, cyberattacks, and \n\nsabotage, with Russia as the likely threat. \n\nDenmark has strengthened anti-drone \n\ndefences and will send unarmed troops \n\nto Ukraine for drone training, legitimate \n\ntargets according to its Russian ambassador. \n\nDenmark has given €9bn in military aid and \n\n€1bn in civic support as well as some F16s to \n\nUkraine since its war started. By comparison, \n\nIreland has committed €350 million in non-\n\nlethal military support though it has taken in \n\nabout twice as many Ukrainians as Denmark.\n\nDonald Trump claims to have ended “six or \n\nseven wars,” presenting himself as a singular \n\npeacemaker. Independent analysis is far less \n\ndenitive. Israel–Iran did see a US-backed \n\nceasere, but rocket re and covert attacks \n\ncontinue.

The current figure is substantially lower than the average of 35% of voters who prioritize the economy during a midterm election cycle.\n\n“Look at this, 43 percent at this time, 43 percent of Americans said the top problem was economic,” Enten said. “Come to this side of the screen, it’s just considerably different. We’re talking about 24 percent. We’re talking about a drop of near 20 points and more than that, we’re talking about across all of the different political groups, right. Democrats, independents, Republicans. We see that the percentage who say the top problem is economic has been falling, has been falling, has been falling through the floor.”\n\n“And more than that, you know, we’re talking about inflation, the percentage of Americans who say that the top problem is inflation has also been falling which is I think very much surprising given all the news that we are hearing about the economy,” Enten continued. (RELATED: ‘Boy, I’m Surprised!’: CNBC’s Rick Santelli Blown Away By ‘Progress’ In New Inflation Report Under Trump)\n\nAhead of the 2026 midterm elections, Congressional Democrats have been using the economy to attack Trump, particularly stating that Americans cannot afford the prices of his tariffs. They have also claimed that inflation is rising during Trump’s administration.\n\nInflation fell to a four-year low in April as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 2.3% year-over-year. The prices of gas and eggs have significantly decreased after facing record-high costs, while the costs of groceries and energy have continued to climb.\n\nLess than half of Americans, 48%, believe that the government shutdown is having an effect on the economy, Enten said while citing CNBC and NBC News.\n\n“[The] harm the shutdown is having on the economy, a great deal or quite a bit. Back in 2013, the last time we had this measure during a shutdown, it was 65%. You come over to this side of the screen, again, it’s significantly lower. It’s 48%. It’s less than a majority. So what we’re talking about here is again, fewer Americans are saying the top problem is economic compared to last year and historically and what we’re seeing is fewer Americans are saying that the shutdown is causing a great deal or quite a bit of harm to the economy,” Enten said. \n\nAll except three Democrats voted to shut the government down on Oct. 1 to retaliate against the continuing resolution (CR) not including an extension of Biden-era subsidies in the Affordable Care Act. The party has since been accusing Republicans of attacking the American people’s healthcare, although they had voted for the same CR in the past.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, the economy and immigration were the top issues for voters, which ultimately led to Trump defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris. During former President Joe Biden’s administration, inflation soared from 1.4% to a record of 9% between January 2021 and June 2022.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He outsourced his campaign to Democratic politicos, donors, and a sycophantic media.\n\nNo red state ever sought to remove Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris from their 2024 ballots. In contrast, 25 blue states attempted to take Trump off their ballots.\n\nIn 2021, Biden’s DOJ and FBI raided then-former-President Trump’s home.

Their reasons varied, but one was consistent across age groups in the community.\n\n“The Democrats take us for granted too much,” many said in interviews.\n\nEven among those who planned to vote for Harris, the frustration with the Democratic Party was palpable, especially when Trump targeted Haitians in Springfield.\n\n“Democrats are too nice,” frustrated supporters often lamented. “They’re playing politics like we’re in the ‘90s.”\n\nApparently, Karine Jean-Pierre was feeling the same frustrations, even more intensely so from her position as then-President Joe Biden’s White House press secretary. \n\nIn her latest book, “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,” Jean-Pierre details in a direct, unleashed approach why she feels betrayed by the Democratic Party. So much so that she has officially left it. \n\nIn the memoir released Oct. 21, Jean-Pierre reveals the background behind certain backstabbing maneuvers that played out publicly, such as Biden being pushed to end his reelection bid. She also reveals behind-the-scenes efforts in Washington intended to harm both Biden—whom she remains fiercely loyal to and grateful for—and herself. Jean-Pierre reveals how she navigated a high-octane workplace where she felt the standards were different for her as a “first” — scenarios that many Black women, a key audience for this book, may find all too familiar.\n\nJean-Pierre takes to task key sectors and features of our society for Trump’s reelection and subsequent actions, currently hurting vulnerable groups. Her account reflects much of the disillusionment the Democratic base felt, particularly the sisterhood of Black women who stayed most loyal, as they watched the political parties, media and spin culture fail them. One recurring critique is the Democrats’ adherence to respectability norms even as MAGA Republicans drowned out their voices to win over the electorate.\n\nOne area where the book shines most is its relatability in tone and language, the place where the Shirley Chisholm “unbought and unbossed” energy is unmistakable. It’s authoritative and reads like a frank conversation between friends, often evoking “tcheeuppss” when exasperated with certain scenarios she describes, “uh huhs” of agreement and full-chested chuckles. Jean-Pierre goes into no-nonsense Haitian auntie mode when she uses evocative phrases – such as “Trump was vomiting at the mouth” – that tap into the built-in imagery so common in Haitian speech, yet rarely seen in non-fiction volumes like this.\n\nFortunately, Jean-Pierre keeps the book from being a rant by urging ordinary people to re-evaluate how they engage with politics going forward. Her prompt for a shift in perspective is less about registering with a party and more about independent thinking. That sounds like good advice for our algorithm-driven society that can be applied not just in national elections, but at the local and municipal levels too. As such, it offers thoughtful guidance on ways the public can push for a more inclusive country and is peppered with resources for those curious about being an unaffiliated voter.\n\nOne aspect of the book that niggled me is a sense that Jean-Pierre sounds too much like an outsider at times. It’s as though she had little pull in how Biden engaged with the public, outside the White House, even though she held the title of senior advisor. \n\nIn explaining Biden’s atrocious debate performance, for example, Jean-Pierre comes off as protective of him, but not persuasive. When she says the face-off was scheduled too early in the election cycle, we wonder if her advisory role allowed her to object or why not. Without Jean-Pierre saying either way if that was in her purview or not, or whose job it was, a question from that night arises: “Why did you all let him go through with it?” \n\nOther times, Jean-Pierre explains that the law prohibits campaigning activities from the White House lectern. But, she doesn’t delve into the division of labor between the White House’s communications apparatus, the political parties and the President’s campaign offices to help us outsiders get a clearer picture. She blatantly blames the Democratic Party for failing to connect with ordinary people through podcasts, TikTok and other high-impression channels. But, again, by not saying why the White House team didn’t pursue those channels to tout his successes as president, she missed an opportunity to reveal more about the systems that govern our government. \n\nStill, “Independent” stands as an incisive read that gives a view of political power dynamics from a voice who continues to carry the mantle of representation throughout her journey in American politics. It’s a solid starting point for anyone looking for ways to secure the type of representation all Americans deserve. And for those Haitian American Democrats still feeling unseen and untethered, “Independent” elaborates on a message Jean-Pierre shared with The Haitian Times earlier this year.\n\n“Don’t give up. Don’t roll over,” she said at the time. “You don’t have to run for office to have a voice, [but] you have to care about something that moves you, that is actually helpful and makes a difference in making lives better.’","summary":"In “Independent,” Karine Jean-Pierre calls out party failures with candor—but leaves gaps in explaining some calls made during the 2024 elections.\n\n\nThe post Karine Jean-Pierre brings ‘unbought and unbossed’ energy to new book, ‘Independent’ appeared first on The Haitian Times.","url":"https://haitiantimes.com/2025/10/24/karine-jean-pierre-independent-book-review/","image":"https://haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 13:27:35","author":"Jen Rosenstein.

The percentage of Hispanic adults who say the country is going in the wrong direction has also increased slightly over the past few months, from 63% in March to 73% now.The shift could spell trouble for Republicans looking to cement support with this group in future elections. Many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year's election, and the new poll shows that despite Trump's promises of economic revitalisation, Hispanic adults continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans overall. Hispanic voters made up 10% of the electorate in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters, and the number of eligible Hispanic voters has been growing rapidly in recent decades.Alejandro Ochoa, 30, is a warehouse worker in Adelanto, California. He identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump last year, but he’s now unhappy with the president. He criticised some of Trump’s budget cuts, adding that the cost of groceries is too high and buying a home is still unattainable for him.“He was kind of relying on essentially the nostalgia of, ‘Hey, remember before COVID? Things weren’t as expensive,’” Ochoa said. “But now it’s like, ‘OK, you’re in office. I’m still getting done dirty at the grocery store. I’m still spending an insane amount of money. I’m trying to cut corners where I can, but that bill is still insanely expensive.”Hispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the last election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris: 43% of Hispanic voters nationally voted for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.But the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump's handling of the economy and immigration — two issues that were major strengths for him in last year's presidential campaign — and their views of his overall presidential performance have slipped a little as well.In March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.Over the past few months, Hispanic communities have also been a target of the president’s hard-line immigration tactics. The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March.Some see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.Fel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioural specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates. He said he appreciates Trump’s views on transgender issues, including restroom access for transgender women.But he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration policies leave many people living in fear, with negative effects on the economy.“A lot of people rely on immigrants to do labour in certain areas,” Echandi said. “When that gets affected, all prices go up. Our food costs more because of the costs to get people to do that work.”The poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared with the rest of the country. More Hispanics say the cost of groceries, housing and health care and the amount of money they get paid are “major” sources of stress, compared with U.S. adults overall.Views of Trump have even soured a little among Hispanic Republicans.In the latest poll, 66% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Trump. That's a slight shift compared with where Trump stood in an AP-NORC poll from September 2024, when 83% of Hispanic Republicans viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably. About 8 in 10 white Republicans had a favorable view of Trump in the new poll, which was unchanged from the year before.In another potentially worrying sign for the president, younger Hispanics and Hispanic men — two groups that swung particularly dramatically toward him in last year's election — also see him a bit more negatively.About two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll. That's a slight uptick from September 2024, when about half in both groups had a negative opinion of him.Other concerns about Trump's chaotic second term emerged in interviews.Teresa Covarrubias, a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, feels things are going in the wrong direction and said she was troubled by how some of Trump’s actions have defied norms and may impact social safety net programs.“My major concern is the disregard for the Constitution and the law, and then also the level of cronyism,” said Covarrubias, who is an independent voter. “The people at the top are just grifting and taking, and then there’s the rest of us.”There are signs in the poll that Trump's tough immigration approach may be alienating some Hispanic adults. Over the past few months, the president has doubled down on his pledge of mass deportations, with escalating crackdowns in Latino neighbourhoods in cities including Chicago.The poll found that, in general, Hispanic adults are more likely to say immigration is an important issue to them personally. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults.And although their views on immigration enforcement aren't uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. About one-quarter of Hispanic adults support this policy, the new poll found, while roughly half of them are opposed and the rest don’t have an opinion. Among U.S. adults overall, about 4 in 10 favor deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, while 34% are opposed and about 2 in 10 don’t have an opinion.Rick Alvarado, 63, a Republican who lives in San Diego, says he still supports Trump and praised his actions to cut public spending. Alvarado, a property manager, is behind Trump's immigration crackdown in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, saying he believes some immigrants are involved in organised crime.But he added that he would like to see a solution for those without criminal records to obtain legal residency status.“The people who are productive should have a pathway to stay here somehow,” Alvarado said.","summary":"The Hispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the last election, however the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump&#39;s handling of the economy and immigration.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trumps-favorability-has-fallen-among-hispanics-since-january-a-new-ap-norc-poll-finds","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/if-they-don-t-disarm-we-will-disarm-them-donald-trump-issues-big-warning-to-hamas-1760497703981-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 13:19:09","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":372196756,"title":"Dems lagging behind GOP on Asian American outreach could make or break blue state election, DNC leader warns","text":"The Democrat Party is not doing enough outreach with Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters and could risk the party's gubernatorial election in the deep blue state of New Jersey — home to one of the nation's largest Asian American populations, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) official warned. \"We lost ground with many of our communities,\" DNC Vice Chair Shasti Conrad told Fox Digital of the Democrat Party following its 2024 election losses. \"The Asian American community was one of them. Where we found that … more votes that did go towards Donald Trump, not overall, but in terms of a change from, you know, 2020 to 2024 there was a dip in the support for Democrats.\" \"I've certainly seen there's been a greater play from the Republican Party to reach Asian American voters, particularly in these last several years,\" Conrad added. \"And, you know, while there's also been a lot of anti-Asian rhetoric and anti-Asian hate that has come from the Republican Party, there's also been a real sort of tapping into fears around the economy, around the impact of taxes on the Asian American community, and that there have been more Republicans that have actually, you know, gone to Asian community spaces.\" The year 2025 is an off-season election year, with only Virginia and New Jersey holding gubernatorial elections, and New York City holding a highly-anticipated mayoral race. MAGA STAR JOINS CIATTARELLI ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN NEW JERSEY AS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP GOVERNOR'S OFFICE New Jersey is a longtime Democrat stronghold, previously voting for a Republican presidential candidate during former President George H.W. Bush's 1988 election. Trump, however, made inroads with New Jersey voters in the 2024 election, sparking renewed enthusiasm among Republicans to flip the state red. New Jersey voted to elect former Vice President Kamala Harris as president in the 2024 race, but post-election data showed Trump and the GOP flipped five counties red. All in, Trump cut his 2020 loss from 16 points to six in 2024. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill was elected the party's nominee for governor and will face off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli at the polls Nov. 4. FORTNIGHT TO ELECTION DAY: 5 KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH New Jersey has a massive Asian American population at just more than one million people in a state of roughly 9.5 million total residents. The 2024 voting data shows there were 584,236 eligible Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in the state. Conrad, who is also the chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, told Fox Digital that the lack of outreach to the voting bloc could hurt the Democrat Party's efforts to retain the governorship. She said she reminds party members that \"there are a million Asian Americans in New Jersey\" and that \"we as Democrats, have not invested as much as we could have into the community at our own peril.\" AAPI voters \"are the fastest growing demographic in this country, and we are growing in states that we need to win in,\" she added. \"We are growing in the South. We're a growing population in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Texas.\" On the national stage, 57% of Asian voters backed Harris in 2024, but Trump also improved his margins with the voting bloc compared to 2020. Trump saw one-in-four Asian votes cast in his favor in 2024 compared to earning 30% of the Asian vote in 2020, according to Pew data. The DNC leader said the party needs to meet AAPI voters in their community, whether it be at temples and churches or Asian-owned businesses, and hear their concerns directly. The voting bloc brings a multitude of cultural backgrounds and, subsequently, is a very nuanced group. Conrad noted the diversity of the group when listing off common top voting concerns among AAPI voters, including the economy and immigration — most notably how it relates to H-1B visas. Conrad said Republicans have met with Asian voters at their churches and businesses and at other cultural events in recent history, with the party increasingly throwing its support behind Asian candidates, as well. \"They've just have done more,\" Conrad said about the GOP. \"And they've also been running more Asian candidates, which is …. sometimes it's confusing to voters, in particular the Asian American community, where there's a lot of pride in having leadership that, you know, that is from the community.\" She called on Democrats to include Asian voters in their common campaign platforms focused on Black, Latino, rural and young voters.

MAGA STAR JOINS CIATTARELLI ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN NEW JERSEY AS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP GOVERNOR'S OFFICE New Jersey is a longtime Democrat stronghold, previously voting for a Republican presidential candidate during former President George H.W. Bush's 1988 election. Trump, however, made inroads with New Jersey voters in the 2024 election, sparking renewed enthusiasm among Republicans to flip the state red. New Jersey voted to elect former Vice President Kamala Harris as president in the 2024 race, but post-election data showed Trump and the GOP flipped five counties red. All in, Trump cut his 2020 loss from 16 points to six in 2024. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill was elected the party's nominee for governor and will face off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli at the polls Nov. 4. FORTNIGHT TO ELECTION DAY: 5 KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH New Jersey has a massive Asian American population at just more than one million people in a state of roughly 9.5 million total residents. The 2024 voting data shows there were 584,236 eligible Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in the state. Conrad, who is also the chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, told Fox Digital that the lack of outreach to the voting bloc could hurt the Democrat Party's efforts to retain the governorship. She said she reminds party members that \"there are a million Asian Americans in New Jersey\" and that \"we as Democrats, have not invested as much as we could have into the community at our own peril.\" AAPI voters \"are the fastest growing demographic in this country, and we are growing in states that we need to win in,\" she added. \"We are growing in the South. We're a growing population in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Texas.\" On the national stage, 57% of Asian voters backed Harris in 2024, but Trump also improved his margins with the voting bloc compared to 2020. Trump saw one-in-four Asian votes cast in his favor in 2024 compared to earning 30% of the Asian vote in 2020, according to Pew data. The DNC leader said the party needs to meet AAPI voters in their community, whether it be at temples and churches or Asian-owned businesses, and hear their concerns directly. The voting bloc brings a multitude of cultural backgrounds and, subsequently, is a very nuanced group. Conrad noted the diversity of the group when listing off common top voting concerns among AAPI voters, including the economy and immigration — most notably how it relates to H-1B visas. Conrad said Republicans have met with Asian voters at their churches and businesses and at other cultural events in recent history, with the party increasingly throwing its support behind Asian candidates, as well. \"They've just have done more,\" Conrad said about the GOP. \"And they've also been running more Asian candidates, which is … sometimes it's confusing to voters, in particular the Asian American community, where there's a lot of pride in having leadership that, you know, that is from the community.\" She called on Democrats to include Asian voters in their common campaign platforms focused on Black, Latino, rural and young voters.

The percentage of Hispanic adults who say the country is going in the wrong direction has also increased slightly over the past few months, from 63% in March to 73% now.\n\nThe shift could spell trouble for Republicans looking to cement support with this group in future elections. Many Hispanic voters were motivated by economic concerns in last year’s election, and the new poll shows that despite Trump’s promises of economic revitalization, Hispanic adults continue to feel higher financial stress than Americans overall. Hispanic voters made up 10% of the electorate in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters, and the number of eligible Hispanic voters has been growing rapidly in recent decades.\n\nAlejandro Ochoa, 30, is a warehouse worker in Adelanto, California. He identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump last year, but he’s now unhappy with the president. He criticized some of Trump’s budget cuts, adding that the cost of groceries is too high and buying a home is still unattainable for him.\n\n“He was kind of relying on essentially the nostalgia of, ‘Hey, remember, before COVID? Things weren’t as expensive,’” Ochoa said. “But now it’s like, OK, you’re in office. I’m still getting done dirty at the grocery store. I’m still spending an insane amount of money. I’m trying to cut corners where I can, but that bill is still insanely expensive.”\n\nDeclining approval on economy and immigration\n\nHispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the last election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris: 43% of Hispanic voters nationally voted for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBut the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and immigration — two issues that were major strengths for him in last year’s presidential campaign — and their views of his overall presidential performance have slipped a little as well.\n\nIn March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.\n\nOver the past few months, Hispanic communities have also been a target of the president’s hard-line immigration tactics. The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March.\n\nSome see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.\n\nFel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioral specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates. He said he appreciates Trump’s views on transgender issues, including restroom access for transgender women.\n\nBut he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration policies leave many people living in fear, with negative effects on the economy.\n\n“A lot of people rely on immigrants to do labor in certain areas,” Echandi said. “When that gets affected, all prices go up. Our food costs more because of the costs to get people to do that work.”\n\nThe poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared with the rest of the country. More Hispanics say the cost of groceries, housing and health care and the amount of money they get paid are “major” sources of stress, compared with U.S. adults overall.\n\nFavorability among Hispanic Republicans drops slightly\n\nViews of Trump have even soured a little among Hispanic Republicans.\n\nIn the latest poll, 66% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Trump. That’s a slight shift compared with where Trump stood in an AP-NORC poll from September 2024, when 83% of Hispanic Republicans viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably. About 8 in 10 white Republicans had a favorable view of Trump in the new poll, which was unchanged from the year before.\n\nIn another potentially worrying sign for the president, younger Hispanics and Hispanic men — two groups that swung particularly dramatically toward him in last year’s election — also see him a bit more negatively.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll. That’s a slight uptick from September 2024, when about half in both groups had a negative opinion of him.\n\nOther concerns about Trump’s chaotic second term emerged in interviews.\n\nTeresa Covarrubias, a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, feels things are going in the wrong direction and said she was troubled by how some of Trump’s actions have defied norms and may impact social safety net programs.\n\n“My major concern is the disregard for the Constitution and the law, and then also the level of cronyism,” said Covarrubias, who is an independent voter. “The people at the top are just grifting and taking, and then there’s the rest of us.”\n\nHispanic adults are more likely to prioritize immigration\n\nThere are signs in the poll that Trump’s tough immigration approach may be alienating some Hispanic adults. Over the past few months, the president has doubled down on his pledge of mass deportations, with escalating crackdowns in Latino neighborhoods in cities including Chicago.\n\nThe poll found that, in general, Hispanic adults are more likely to say immigration is an important issue to them personally. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults.\n\nAnd although their views on immigration enforcement aren’t uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. About one-quarter of Hispanic adults support this policy, the new poll found, while roughly half of them are opposed and the rest don’t have an opinion. Among U.S. adults overall, about 4 in 10 favor deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, while 34% are opposed and about 2 in 10 don’t have an opinion.\n\nRick Alvarado, 63, a Republican who lives in San Diego, says he still supports Trump and praised his actions to cut public spending. Alvarado, a property manager, is behind Trump’s immigration crackdown in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, saying he believes some immigrants are involved in organized crime.\n\nBut he added that he would like to see a solution for those without criminal records to obtain legal residency status.\n\n“The people who are productive should have a pathway to stay here somehow,” Alvarado said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The actress created a sensation on screen with her daring performance in ‘Murder‘, captivating audiences with her sizzling screen presence and leaving a lasting impact on the film industry.\nMallika Sherawat is a dream girl today, but there was a time when she had to defy her family to make her dreams a reality. Her family strongly opposed her decision to become an actress, but her strong desire to achieve something prevented her from settling down.\nOne day, she decided to live life on her own terms, with or without her family’s support. To pursue this, she left her family and home, setting out to breathe new life into her career.\nThrough her hard work and boldness, Mallika Sherawat has carved a niche for herself in Bollywood. Today, the world respects her, but she always harbours a regret that her family never expressed pride in her. She hails from Haryana and, despite family opposition, carved a successful career for herself in Hindi cinema.\nMallika Sherawat is an actress known for her bold scenes in films, which earned her acclaim. While she faced challenges common to many Hindi cinema actresses, she says it never bothered her.\nIn an interview, Mallika Sherawat, shared her struggles, dreams, and outspokenness. Born on October 24, 1976, Mallika Sherawat is 49 now.\n“I never had plastic surgery. I have lived my life with discipline. That’s why I never needed it,” she said. She explained, “I came to Mumbai from Haryana. My family was against it, but I took the step of my own free will; no one asked if I had Rs 10 in my pocket. There was no red carpet.”\nMallika Sherawat started with modelling, worked in commercials with Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, and then began receiving film offers after auditions. She described the 2004 blockbuster ‘Murder’ as the turning point in her career. Sherawat said, “I never imagined it would be such a big hit. I grew up watching Bhatt Sahab’s films. Emraan Hashmi was a gentleman, and despite the bold scenes, I felt safe.”\nShe added that while the film catapulted her to stardom, it also brought negative experiences. Many assumed that her bold on-screen persona reflected her personal life, but she has always maintained a clear boundary between the two, a misconception that continues even today.\nMallika Sherawat also worked in Hollywood with Jackie Chan in ‘The Myth,’ attended the Cannes Film Festival, and met notables like Kamala Harris and Barack Obama.","summary":"She described the 2004 blockbuster 'Murder' as a turning point, recalling that she never expected its success and felt safe performing bold scenes with Emraan Hashmi","url":"https://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/bollywood/this-actress-defied-her-conservative-family-to-take-up-bold-roles-turns-49-today-ws-kl-9656735.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/10/mallika-sherawat-2025-10-59d6984386ee5d5bb15579705a21ee1b.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 12:45:39","author":"News18,Satyaki Baidya","authors":["News18","Satyaki Baidya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.268},{"id":372179378,"title":"Kamala Harris Heckled, Interrupted by Protesters in London","text":"Former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was hit with more protests during the latest stop on her book tour in London, England.\n\nThree separate protesters interrupted the former vice president to heckle her about Palestine within minutes of her taking the stage at the Southbank Centre Thursday night to promote her memoir, 107 Days. A group of around 15 people with Palestinian flags and a banner which read “genocide enablers are war criminals” stood outside the venue before the event started, chanting “Kamala Harris not welcome here.” Police stood by them, monitoring the situation..\n\nNewsweek reached out to Harris’ office and the Southbank Centre by email to comment on this story.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nHarris, who lost the 2024 election to President Donald Trump, remains a significant figure in U.S. politics, and it has been rumored—though she has not confirmed either way—that she might run for president again in 2028.\n\nCopies of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ book 107 Days are displayed in Birmingham, Alabama, on October 17, 2025.\n\nThe heckling shows that tensions about the previous administration’s handling of tensions in the Middle East remain. Harris lost some support during the presidential election from pro-Palestinian advocacy groups who called on the Biden administration to impose an arms embargo on Israel in response to its attacks on Gaza since October 7, 2023.\n\nHarris’ book, which chronicles her presidential campaign following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race in August 2024, was published in September.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nWithin minutes of Harris taking to the stage for a conversation with author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, one protester stood up holding a banner which said “Harris you have blood on your hands.” Some members of the audience booed the heckler.\n\n“I understand the passion and the emotion and the feeling based on everything that has happened in Gaza,” Harris said. “I understand everything behind the protesters.”\n\nShe added that the administration should have made more public statements and indicated things could have been done differently.\n\n“As I write in the book, we had levers we did not exercise,” she said.\n\nThen, a man stood up and started shouting at Harris. A third person stood up with a banner and was dragged away by security.\n\n“I appreciate the emotion and the reason behind it and the facts that support it,” Harris said. “I do write about it in the book.”\n\nWhen Adichie pressed Harris about Israel later on in the conversation, Harris said: “I did not have the final say on that at all and if I had this would have been different.”\n\nHarris has been heckled numerous times on her book tour about how the Biden administration and her campaign handled the Israel-Gaza conflict and her response in London showed her striking a more conciliatory tone with protesters than she had taken previously.\n\nIn September, during the first stop of her tour in New York, Harris was heckled about Palestine, prompting her to respond: “I’m not president right now, there’s nothing I can do.”\n\nMeanwhile, during an event in Chicago on October 12, at least one protester began shouting and accusing Harris of complicity in Israel’s assaults on the Gaza Strip.\n\n“You are a killer, Kamala. You support genocide,” one protester shouted, before being removed by security.\n\nHarris said: “I’m not president and if you want to talk about legal lets talk about the legacy of mass deportation, of people not voting and Donald Trump.”\n\nThe previous day, protesters interrupted an event in Washington, D.C., and spoke about Gaza. Harris said in response: “You know what, I am not president of the United States.”\n\nDuring the conversation in London, she spoke about her presidential campaign and shared her views on Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nShe said she “felt the weight of the stakes” when she was running for president and that there was not enough time to campaign against Trump.\n\n“We did not have enough time even with 107 days,” she said. “And that’s the bottom line.”\n\nIn Trump’s America, she said, the “number of people who are on edge” and “are afraid” and distrustful of each other is “at a height that I have never witnessed.” She said she was surprised by business leaders’ responses to Trump and said “the number that have bent the knee at the foot of a tyrant has been profound.”\n\n“It may get worse before it gets better,” she said.\n\nDemocrats should respond, she argued, by reminding people “we are all in this together” and building community.

I’m trying to cut corners where I can, but that bill is still insanely expensive.”\n\nDeclining approval on economy and immigration\n\nHispanic voters shifted toward Trump in the last election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris: 43% of Hispanic voters nationally voted for Trump, according to AP VoteCast, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBut the poll now finds that Hispanic adults are slightly less likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and immigration — two issues that were major strengths for him in last year’s presidential campaign — and their views of his overall presidential performance have slipped a little as well.\n\nIn March, 41% of Hispanic adults approved of the way Trump was handling his job as president, but now that has fallen to 27%.\n\nOver the past few months, Hispanic communities have also been a target of the president’s hard-line immigration tactics. The poll found that Hispanic adults’ approval of his handling of immigration has declined slightly since March.\n\nSome see the two issues as linked. Trump’s attacks on immigration have affected low-wage and high-skilled workers alike, at a moment when the economy is already uncertain because of his erratic trade policies.\n\nFel Echandi, of Winter Haven, Florida, is a behavioral specialist who identifies as a Democrat but sometimes votes for Republican candidates. He said he appreciates Trump’s views on transgender issues, including restroom access for transgender women.\n\nBut he’s concerned that Trump’s immigration policies leave many people living in fear, with negative effects on the economy.\n\n“A lot of people rely on immigrants to do labor in certain areas,” Echandi said. “When that gets affected, all prices go up. Our food costs more because of the costs to get people to do that work.”\n\nThe poll found particularly high levels of financial stress among Hispanic adults, compared with the rest of the country. More Hispanics say the cost of groceries, housing and health care and the amount of money they get paid are “major” sources of stress, compared with U.S. adults overall.\n\nFavorability among Hispanic Republicans drops slightly\n\nViews of Trump have soured a little, even among Hispanic Republicans.\n\nIn the latest poll, 66% of Hispanic Republicans said they have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Trump. That’s a slight shift compared with where Trump stood in an AP-NORC poll from September 2024, when 83% of Hispanic Republicans viewed him at least “somewhat” favorably. White Republicans, by contrast, did not change their opinion of Trump over the same period.\n\nIn another potentially worrying sign for the president, younger Hispanics and Hispanic men — two groups that swung particularly dramatically toward him in last year’s election — also see him a bit more negatively.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll. That’s a slight uptick from September 2024, when about half in both groups had a negative opinion of him.\n\nOther concerns about Trump’s chaotic second term emerged in interviews.\n\nTeresa Covarrubias, a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, feels things are going in the wrong direction and said she was troubled by how some of Trump’s actions have defied norms and may impact social safety net programs.\n\n“My major concern is the disregard for the Constitution and the law, and then also the level of cronyism,” said Covarrubias, who is an independent voter. “The people at the top are just grifting and taking, and then there’s the rest of us.”\n\nHispanic adults are more likely to prioritize immigration\n\nThere are signs in the poll that Trump’s tough immigration approach may be alienating some Hispanic adults. Over the past few months, the president has doubled down on his pledge of mass deportations, with escalating crackdowns in Latino neighborhoods in cities including Chicago.\n\nThe poll found that, in general, Hispanic adults are more likely to say immigration is an important issue to them personally. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults prioritize immigration, compared with about 6 in 10 white adults and about half of Black adults.\n\nAnd although their views on immigration enforcement aren’t uniform, Hispanic adults are much less likely than U.S. adults overall to favor deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. About one-quarter of Hispanic adults support this policy, the new poll found, while roughly half of them are opposed and the rest don’t have an opinion. Among U.S. adults overall, about 4 in 10 favor deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, while 34% are opposed and about 2 in 10 don’t have an opinion.\n\nRick Alvarado, 63, a Republican who lives in San Diego, says he still supports Trump and praised his actions to cut public spending. Alvarado, a property manager, is behind Trump’s immigration crackdown in cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, saying he believes some immigrants are involved in organized crime.\n\nBut he added that he would like to see a solution for those without criminal records to obtain legal residency status.\n\n“The people who are productive should have a pathway to stay here somehow,” Alvarado said.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

This began after former president Joe Biden decided to withdraw from the race.\n\nHarris has been candid in the memoir about Biden's decision to run for a second term, saying the choice was one of 'recklessness', while also using the book to describe her interactions with Trump during that period and branding the current president as a 'con man'. \n\nOn October 23, Harris appeared at London's Southbank Center to continue celebrating and promoting her book in a conversation with fellow author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nDuring the appearance, which was attended by a journalist for UNILAD, Harris was asked whether Trump's second term was worse than she'd imagined it to be.\n\nNot pulling any punches, Harris vehemently responded: \"Yes.\"\n\nHarris' thoughts on Trump's current presidency appears to echo the feelings of a majority of Americans, with CNN's Poll of Polls - which aggregates and averages a number of recent polls - revealing that as of October 22, 56 percent of people disapprove of the president, as opposed to 41 percent who approve.\n\nCalling to mind specific controversies during Trump's second term so far, Harris made reference to the incident which saw a journalist invited into what apparently should have been a private group chat on the messaging app Signal.\n\nIn a lengthy article, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, reported seeing national security officials discuss airstrikes in Yemen before the attacks went ahead in real life.\n\nHarris said that the administration was 'lazy', adding that they should 'get off their tushies and go to a secure room to discuss classified information instead of texting on Signal'.\n\n“It’s so disrespectful of the power they hold, some of them don’t understand,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris criticized Trump, she has also admitted in 107 Days that Trump was complimentary to her in private, alleging that at one point, he asked her: “How do I say bad things about you now?”\n\nTrump also allegedly told Harris that his daughter Ivanka was a 'big fan' of her, but Harris made clear she did not want to get sucked in.\n\n“He’s a con man,\" she said, adding: \"He’s really good at it.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Lucy Sarret.","summary":"![CDATA[The former vice president was candid as she promoted her memoir, 107 Days]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/kamala-harris-107-days-response-trump-second-term-455406-20251024","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt3df1603ad79e757f/68fb626129ee493541332cb3/kamala-harris-brutal-answer-trump-second-term-succe","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 11:26:36","author":"Emily Brown","authors":["Emily Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":372149842,"title":"America's Legal Thought Leaders Stayed Silent During '21-'24","text":"RCP in your inbox daily.\n Thanks for subscribing.\n\n Thoughtful, ideologically diverse, and uncensored news, reporting,\n analysis, and opinion delivered every day.\n\n Check your inbox for a confirmation message from RealClearPolitics\n Today.

Her argument that the party had betrayed Biden by forcing him out of the 2024 race was strongly questioned by CBS hosts Tony Dokoupil and Gayle King. Dokoupil told Jean-Pierre, \"Some Americans are going to say, ‘seriously?’\" Jean-Pierre has insisted, in spite of numerous contrary reports and witnesses, that she never saw anything to make her question Biden's mental acuity. King also pushed Jean-Pierre on Biden's mental fitness as she said her decision to leave the Democratic Party also had to do with her frustrations about the current state of the party in standing up to the Trump administration. \"I want to pick up on what Tony was saying because I, too, thought that,\" King said. \"You said, people said, why didn’t members of his inner circle speak up about what many believe was the apparent decline of Joe Biden, and you said you’re a member of the inner circle, and you never saw the decline. After that I wrote, ‘How?’ You even write, Karine, that you were on the plane with him going to the debate, and you didn’t see anything.\" KARINE JEAN-PIERRE SAYS BIDEN HEALTH TALKING POINTS WERE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AT SENIOR LEVEL Jean-Pierre's book took aim at the Democratic Party's treatment of Biden and accused Democrats of betraying the former president by forcing him out of the race. She wrote that she couldn't \"stomach\" being a Democrat anymore and officially left the party this year. Jean-Pierre said it was a \"rare\" trip where she didn't see Biden even though they were on the plane together traveling to Atlanta, because his family was in tow. She added, \"I want everybody to know that I take this question incredibly seriously, I do. I was his White House press secretary, which means I had a role that saw him practically every day and traveled with him.\" King interjected again and asked, \"You saw nothing?\" KARINE JEAN-PIERRE REVEALS SHE NEVER THOUGHT KAMALA HARRIS WOULD WIN She argued that Biden and his team never denied the former president's age and said they often poked fun at it before insisting Biden's mental acuity was strong. \"I saw someone who was always engaged. I saw someone who understood policy, pushed us on the policy, and also understood history,\" she said. During an appearance on \"The Bulwark\" podcast, liberal host Tim Miller criticized Biden as a poor communicator and asked Jean-Pierre whether she ever spoke to him about his age. Jean-Pierre said she never spoke to Biden about his age but argued that Biden communicated his ideas well \"whether it broke through or not.\" KARINE JEAN-PIERRE ARRIVES FOR HOUSE OVERSIGHT GRILLING IN BIDEN AUTOPEN PROBE \"He talked way less to the press than Donald Trump does,\" Miller pushed back. \"Way less. And he wasn't out there at all. He wasn't good off the cuff. He wasn't doing press conferences. Let's just be real. Like, he didn't do events.\" \"But Tim, that's not true,\" Jean-Pierre interrupted. \"Tim, you're conflating all of it. That's what you're… no, you're… first, you're telling me he didn't talk well about it. Then you're telling me he didn't talk at all.\" Miller said Biden didn't do either. Jean-Pierre maintained that Biden talked to the press a couple of times a week and suggested Miller wasn't paying attention. FLASHBACK: KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DECLARED THERE IS 'NO COVER-UP' OF BIDEN'S HEALTH AFTER HE DROPPED OUT OF RACE The Washington Post's Becca Rothfield offered a scathing review of Jean-Pierre's book, calling it \"outdated,\" \"impractical\" and filled with platitudes like telling independents that they had to lean into their \"own truth.\" \"It is incredible — and emblematic of the Democrats’ total aesthetic and intellectual driftlessness — that someone who writes in such feel-good, thought-repelling clichés was hired to communicate with the nation from its highest podium,\" Rothfield wrote. \"Jean-Pierre’s central complaint boils down, more or less, to a vague sense of personal grievance. The Democrats were mean to Biden, her boss; they were mean to her personally, as she outlines in a lengthy diatribe against fellow staffers who leaked unflattering information about her to Politico; and they were mean to [Kamala] Harris, whom they refused to anoint as the nominee without a fight,\" she added. Independent journalist Matt Taibbi called the book \"incoherent\" and Jean-Pierre herself \"obtuse.\" Jean-Pierre insisted in the book and in her interviews this week that the two-party system is \"broken\" but also doesn't want a third party and remains aligned with Democrats. \"Jean-Pierre had over a year to think about what to say about all this, and instead of writing the book the whole world wanted, the true story (complete with photos of Biden’s used-bib collection and pictorial toilet guides) of her frustration at having to be the public face of one of the most obvious and legally perilous cons in American political history, she denied there was anything to cover up, much less that she had responsibility for it,\" Taibbi wrote. During an interview with Stephen Colbert, host of the \"Late Show,\" Jean-Pierre received similar pushback on the notion that the Democratic Party had betrayed the former president. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"It was very personal for those of us who watched it too, because it was a shock to our system to see that. Because — I mean, you’re talking to a guy who helped raise $25 million for Joe Biden in March of that same year,\" Colbert, an avid Biden supporter, told Jean-Pierre. \"And three months later, I saw a guy who I had not seen backstage at the benefit that I did. It seemed like a dramatically different person. And at 81 years old, that’s not entirely unexpected. You can imagine why people got so worried.\" The former press secretary repeatedly insisted that she had seen Biden every day and argued he was able to govern. \"And in a moment of great pressure on stage, we saw someone shock us and worry us. And nothing could assuage that worry. So I don’t think it was necessarily a betrayal of Joe Biden as other people saying, ‘We don’t think we were shown the Joe Biden that you saw,'\" Colbert pushed back. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jean-Pierre did receive some positive attention, such as in an interview with former MSNBC host Joy Reid, who began the discussion by complimenting her guest's hair. She was also welcomed on \"The View\" this week, where the co-hosts nearly all agreed with her criticisms of the Democratic Party's treatment of Biden. Like Jean-Pierre, they all supported Kamala Harris for president. In her book, the former press secretary wrote that she never believed Harris would win.

Donald Trump wants the common folk of America to surrender in advance, just like their betters did. But when more than 7 million said hell no, what did he do? Well, let’s just say it was profane.\n\nIn today’s edition, I want to talk about another kind of weakness that it revealed. Instead of the president and the Republicans, however, the No Kings rally exposed the weakness of certain centrist Democrats.\n\nHow so? First remember what centrism is. These days, it’s the capacity for a Democrat in a competitive district to accept as true the premise of the lies told about Democratic Party by Trump and the Republicans. \n\nFor instance, when it became conventional wisdom, as a result of all this lying, that Vice President Kamala Harris was defeated because she pushed too hard for trans rights, centrist Democrats accepted that as true, though it was false, in order to seem moderate by comparison. \n\nThis is what Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts aimed for when he invoked transgender girls in sports. Harris lost, he said, because his party spent “too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest … I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”\n\nCentrists do this in order to portray themselves to independent voters as honest brokers whose primary concerns are above partisan politics. In reality, however, it’s conflict-avoidance. They don’t want to take the risk of fighting Republicans. So they fight their own side instead. They make the demands of advocates and reformers – known cynically as “the groups” – seem radical or impractical or beyond “what’s really important to the American people.” The result? Nothing changes.\n\nWhat I’m describing is the normal for Democrats like Seth Moulton. They believe that it earns them credibility and public trust. But norms can’t endure in the face of an ongoing constitutional crisis. The Trump regime isn’t just violating the rights of one or two marginal groups. It is violating the rights of all Americans, triggering a national reckoning that fueled the biggest one-day demonstration in American history. \n\nMore than anything else, No Kings was a necessary reaffirmation of bedrock democratic principles, because so few elites, including centrist Democrats, have been willing to affirm them. And if centrists choose to smear more than 7 million people the way they have smeared “the groups,” they risk discrediting themselves completely.\n\nIt may not be clear yet that centrism is fictional, but it will be. \n\nIn the case of Seth Moulton, perhaps sooner than he thinks. \n\nMoulton is set to primary US Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. While he’s acting like trans rights are negotiable, Markey isn’t playing. At the No Kings rally in Boston, which drew 100,000 demonstrators, he declared trans rights to be human rights and the people there roared. \n\nWhen Moulton got up to speak, they booed.\n\nThat was a bright line, according to Evan Urquhart. After writing extensively for The Atlantic, Vanity Fair and others, he set up Assigned Media in 2022 to report on transgender news. Evan was in Boston. \n\n“The Democratic rank-and-file is disgusted by Trumpism,” he told me in the interview below. “They don't want to see Democrats who compromise and meet Trumpism halfway. They want to see fighters.”\n\nIn a thread prior to the No Kings rally, you shared some wisdom about how to balance the evils facing the trans community with the joys found within it. You seemed to be addressing the old problem with hope: too much makes you naive, too little makes you nihilist.\n\nI've noticed that informed Americans in general, and especially trans people, are crying out for ways to push through the despair at seeing our country's rule of law collapse. Ideals that we may have thought were universal and unassailable, such as human rights or the worth and dignity of every person, are suddenly very much up for grabs.\n\nIt is, as you say, naive to imagine that good is simply going to triumph here. We've blown past most of the guard rails that were supposed to protect us, and no one is more keenly aware of that than trans people. The federal government officially defines us as not even existing, and they've hinted that they want to go further to define us as terrorists.\n\nMy thread is about finding ways to live with the reality that we are losing our rights and there's no clear floor, no knowing how much we will lose before this insanity ends, while also contributing to efforts to find that floor and begin pushing that floor back up again.\n\nEd Markey was at the No Kings rally in Boston. He said: \"Here in Massachusetts we stand for what is right. We stand with trans people because trans rights are human rights.” That's in contrast to Seth Moulton, his primary challenger, who seems to think trans rights are negotiable. You were there. How are you feeling today? \n\nEver since November, when we learned Trump would be president, I've known that the trans community would be in a uniquely vulnerable position, because Trump's closing argument against Kamala Harris was that she was too trans-supportive. \n\nNever mind that Harris didn't say one word in support of trans rights during her campaign. The conventional wisdom was always going to be that Democrats were punished for being too trans supportive.\n\nSo the struggle for my community has been participating in a movement for democracy led by Democrats who aren’t sure they want our community with them – or want to blame us for all their troubles.\n\nSenator Markey is a longstanding supporter of trans rights, and his primary challenger is Representative Moulton, who was one of the early Democrats distancing himself from the trans community. \n\nAnd what I think we're seeing, and saw so decisively with Markey being cheered in Boston for standing up for trans rights and Moulton being booed by that same crowd, is that the Democratic rank-and-file is disgusted by Trumpism. They don't want to see Democrats who compromise and meet Trumpism halfway. They want to see fighters.\n\nTrans people are great fighters. Our activists are out there, unbowed, defiant in the face of all of this scapegoating and oppression, and I think that fighting spirit is resonating with many Americans.\n\nIn your thread, you hint at the importance of federalism – the decentralization of federal power and the sovereignty of the states – in protecting trans and human rights. You suggest that there could be a \"soft secession with blue state protections growing more meaningful as federal power fades.\" Talk about that more please.\n\nI think that the No Kings rallies showed that Americans are not willing to go quietly into dictatorship. Unfortunately, there are a lot of deep structural problems in the American system that Republicans are determined to exploit. The Supreme Court has become a partisan rubberstamp on the most lawless actions by the president. The government is currently shut down and House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn't even seem like he's trying to find a solution, to the point where you almost start to suspect Republicans would rather us not even have a legislative branch and just vest all power in the executive.\n\nThese are headwinds that national Democrats might be able to overcome with a strong enough midterms and a strong enough Democratic president in 2028, but even if a lot of things broke that way, it does not feel assured. So, what's the alternative? \n\nIf Trump is too weak and unpopular to turn all of America into a dictatorship, but Democrats are unable to restore constitutional governance, we could see a much stronger federalism, with blue states increasingly ignoring the federal government. It's a sad picture in a lot of ways, but trans people have got to be practical, and practically speaking, I'd rather live in a strong Massachusetts that can protect me, perhaps even a Massachusetts that has strong regional alliances with other New England states, than be forced out of the country.\n\nYou remind me of something I came back to often: that the crisis probably can't be overcome through elections alone, but through political change that starts with individual hearts and minds.\n\nI think we do have deeply moral people and movements, but those movements are increasingly detached from any institutional power.\n\nWhen I think about the concern people have about the fate of the Palestinian people, people halfway around the world that we've been indoctrinated to hate and look down on, I see a deep belief in the principle that where a child is born shouldn't determine whether they're able to grow up safely. \n\nWhen this deep care and concern for others is treated as radical, idealistic, naive and impractical, what happens at first is that no action is taken to protect the children in harm’s way, but in the end the leaders and institutions who worked so hard to distance themselves from these movements wind up delegitimizing themselves.\n\nIn journalism, we're seeing this with the deepest values of our profession. Journalists are expected to hold powerful people accountable without fear or favor, and bring audiences the truth even when it might be risky or unpopular. That’s being treated in the same way, as naive, childish and something no one believes any more, in a time when news organizations have been defanged by billionaires.\n\nAnd what happens at first is that you see a loss of hard-hitting, honest reporting, but what I think happens next is that those institutions lose their legitimacy, and independent reporters who are willing to carry the mantle of those deep values rush into the vacuum.","summary":"Yesterday, I talked about how the No Kings rally exposed the regime’s weakness. Donald Trump wants the common folk of America to surrender in advance, just like their betters did. But when more than 7 million said hell no, what did he do? Well, let’s just say it was profane.\n\nIn today’s edition, I want to talk about another kind of weakness that it revealed. Instead of the president and the Republicans, however, the No Kings rally exposed the weakness of certain centrist Democrats.\n\nHow so? First remember what centrism is. These days, it’s the capacity for a Democrat in a competitive district to accept as true the premise of the lies told about Democratic Party by Trump and the Republicans. \n\nFor instance, when it became conventional wisdom, as a result of all this lying, that Vice President Kamala Harris was defeated because she pushed too hard for trans rights, centrist Democrats accepted that as true, though it was false, in order to seem moderate by comparison. \n\nThis is what Congressman Seth Moulton of M","url":"https://www.alternet.org/trumps-weakness/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60329243&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C99%2C0%2C99","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 10:00:30","author":"John Stoehr","authors":["John Stoehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":372140380,"title":"Secret Service Agent Revealed as Successful Plus-Size Model, Balancing Dual Roles","text":"A former Secret Service agent, who once provided protection for Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter, is making waves as a plus-size model despite never passing her physical fitness assessments.\n\nAlison Zupancic was recruited by ex-Director Kimberly Cheatle, who prioritized Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) during her leadership. Zupancic’s role included safeguarding Ella Emhoff in New York, according to insider information shared with RealClearPolitics.\n\nOn her social media platforms, Zupancic refers to herself as a “nationally published curve model, plus-size fashion and fitness influencer, and body-positive advocate.”\n\nDespite repeatedly failing her fitness evaluations, Zupancic remained with the Secret Service, as reported by RealClearPolitics.\n\nDuring her time with the agency, she also appeared in a marketing campaign for a plus-size clothing brand, which subtly alluded to her Secret Service affiliation.\n\nDuring her employment the former agent starred in a plus-size clothing company’s marketing campaign that hinted at her position with the Secret Service.\n\nA photoshoot for ELOQUII, a fashion retailer that describes itself as ‘the ultimate destination for stylish plus size fashion 14-32,’ featured Zupancic in a floral-print dress behind bold text that read: ‘Undercover, But Never Underdressed.’\n\nThe announcement of the marketing campaign mentioned that it featured a ‘a law enforcement professional’ in order to shed ‘light on the preconceived notions around the profile of a woman behind a certain career.’\n\nIt also stated that the campaign was meant to ‘challenge unconscious bias in the workplace and beyond.’ \n\nAfter Zupancic’s multiple failed fitness tests, she was placed in the Special Services Division, the arm of the Secret Service that handles support functions. \n\nIn that role, she handled maintenance of the armored vehicle fleets and screened mail and packages received by the White House. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the Secret Service and Zupancic for comment.\n\nIt is not clear if Zupancic left the service before or after Cheatle was ousted as head of the agency in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in July 2024.\n\nCheatle held her leadership role at the agency from the time she was appointed by President Joe Biden in September 2022 until she resigned last year.\n\nAt the time of her departure, 24 percent of agents and officers at the agency were women, agency sources told RealClearPolitics. \n\nThe outlet was also told that during the former director’s tenure, agents in minority groups were able to enter chat rooms on the agency’s internal DEI website where they could vent about workplace frustrations. \n\nAt a press conference after Cheatle’s resignation, House Speaker Mike Johnson said: ‘The immediate reaction to her resignation is that it is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago.\n\n‘Now we have to pick up the pieces. We have to rebuild the American people’s faith and trust in the Secret Service as an agency.’\n\nCheatle was replaced by current Secret Service Director Sean Curran, who entered the role in January this year. \n\nSince then, there have been no serious assassination attempts on the president’s life, but the Secret Service has still suffered a number of embarrassing incidents and political violence has been on the rise. \n\nOver Labor Day weekend, a Secret Service officer failed to notice a Glock pistol after screening the bag of a man entering Trump’s DC golf course while the president was on site. The man noticed the mistake and self-reported the firearm.\n\nIn mid-September a Secret Service agent attributed Charlie Kirk’s assassination to ‘karma’ was placed on administrative leave.\n\nWhile earlier this month, a Secret Service agent fell asleep in public while providing security for the UN General Assembly and left his fully-automatic assault rifle unattended when he went to the restroom.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA former Secret Service agent, who once provided protection for Kamala Harris&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Secret Service Agent Revealed as Successful Plus-Size Model, Balancing Dual Roles first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/secret-service-agent-revealed-as-successful-plus-size-model-balancing-dual-roles/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Top-Secret-Service-agent-is-exposed-for-being-plus-sized-model.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 09:48:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.081},{"id":372152058,"title":"\"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\" By egregious behavioUr he of course means... quoting Ronald Reagan [News]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

It's both overblown and somewhat justified, but it is not nearly as farked up as the Republican Party process. You think Kamala Harris was selected \"illegally\" when over 96% of delegates voted to nominate her at the convention? Well, explain the Republican nominees gurgling Trump's ball sack during debates even when Trump wasn't at one of the Republican debates. And the Republican conventions are pure theater and more like coronations. \n\nNONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF KAMALA WERE ELECTED, and you cannot name any Democrat who seriously wanted to run in 2024 besides her, and she was on the ballot on Election Day running against the Twice Impeached Rapist, Fraud and Multiply Indicted Convicted Felon. There were no real problems facing the country except for post-Covid-19 inflation (that Biden had rather successfully contained), climate change, and an overdramatized immigration problem. Ukraine and Gaza are big problems in Ukraine and Gaza, but they were not existential problems to the United States.\n\nAbsent the 1/3 of the country dedicated to destroying the country, and we'd be a great nation with comparatively fewer problems than the rest of the world.\n\nCanadians, I love most of you and I'm sorry, and I understand those of you who've vowed never to visit the U.S. again. I hope we someday redeem ourselves enough that you can forgive us. But I also know that sometimes things happen that can never be forgiven. \n\n// In other news, this is a new iPad, and I'm delighted that my text replacement of \"Trump\" with \"Twice Impeached Rapist, Fraud and Multiply Indicted Convicted Felon Former President Trump\" somehow carried over with my AppleID, since I have not actually transferred my previous iPad over to this one.\n\n(3) Funniest\n\nless than a minute ago\n\nHe's such a snowflake.\n\n(0) Funniest\n\nless than a minute ago\n\nRagin' Asian: Guess he wants to incite a USMCA-style trade deal for the Western Hemisphere that excludes the US.\n\nCarney's been shoring up our trade agreements with Mexico. We're kind of expecting that's the way CUSMA will go next year, that the US will just drop out of it? That's the unpolite version. The polite version is making the US's participation contingent on doing things that are unacceptable, like letting the subsidized US dairy industry shoulder our Canadian one aside. For very obvious reasons, that's even less of an option now than before, now that Donny has shown how vulnerable that would leave us.\n\nSo anyway, we're planning for the worst, hoping for the best. Nobody on this side of the border is going to be surprised when CUSMA is just CMA next year, though. And you can bet we'll be levying a hefty price when the next president invariably wants to restore it.\n\n(1) Funniest\n\nless than a minute ago\n\nFinally some progress!

Democrats do not acknowledge that reality, tinker around the edges and people say, 'Trump may be crazy, but at least he's trying to do something.'\" the longtime progressive told Thompson.\nSanders — whose new book \"Fight Oligarchy\" is out this week — attributed Kamala Harris' loss last year to caution toward offending big businesses and corporations.\n\"It's very hard to say that Kamala Harris ran a campaign that spoke to the needs of the working class and was prepared to take on corporate greed and the oligarchs,\" he said.Driving ","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/24/axios-show-bernie-sanders-interview","image":"https://images.axios.com/TfFAqPjEXAtRYPjUPtMGMSeccT8=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/10/24/1761272347056.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 09:30:05","author":"Kathleen Hunter","authors":["Kathleen Hunter"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":372121904,"title":"Donald Trump&#039;s Support Among Gen Z Eroding","text":"President Donald Trump’s support among Generation Z voters has slipped sharply in recent months, even as his overall approval rating has remained steady, according to a new YouGov/Economist poll.\n\nThe survey, conducted between October 17 and 20, found that just 25 percent of Gen Z respondents approve of Trump’s performance, while 67 percent disapprove — a net approval of –42 points. That marks a notable decline from September (30–64, –34) and August (30–67, –37).\n\nThe trend suggests that younger voters—who briefly warmed to Trump during the 2024 election—are once again drifting away. According to AP VoteCast, voters aged 18 to 29 backed Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent in 2024, a far smaller margin than Joe Biden’s 61–36 victory among the same age group in 2020. But the latest polling shows that Trump’s tenuous foothold among Gen Z may be slipping for good.\n\n“Things aren’t working” for young voters\n\nProfessor of political communication at George Washington University Peter Loge said the reversal reflects frustration with the direction of the country and the pressures facing young Americans.\n\n“Support for President Trump is falling across the board. A lot of young voters supported Trump because they were concerned about their futures,” Loge told Newsweek. “Young people were worried about getting jobs, being able to afford to go to college or move out of their parents’ house, gun violence, and the pending climate crisis. Many didn’t see things getting better under Biden, so supported Trump. Since Trump’s election, youth unemployment jumped to more than 10%, double the national rate. Housing is still out of reach for many, the administration is cutting funding to higher education, politics is getting more volitile, and the president is reversing policies dealing with the climate crisis. Of course young voters are turning away from the president.\n\nPresident Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during a Diwali celebration in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nLoge added that the mood among young voters is not necessarily ideological but pragmatic: “Most young people, like most people of any age, want things to work. Things aren’t working, so voters of all ages are blaming the people in charge. Trump and Republicans are in charge, so they are getting blamed.”\n\nDisapproval of Trump’s foreign policy and shutdown handling\n\nThe YouGov/Economist poll also points to growing unease among younger voters over Trump’s handling of foreign policy, particularly in the wake of his 20-point peace plan between Israel and Hamas. While 53 percent of Americans overall approve of the plan, young voters are far less supportive. Among Gen Z, Trump’s foreign policy approval dropped from 30–56 in September to 29–61 in October.\n\nThe poll shows that 59 percent of Gen Z voters say they care deeply about the Israel-Palestine conflict—more than any other generation. Nearly half (46 percent) sympathize more with Palestinians, and 44 percent say the U.S. should stop all military aid to Israel. Forty-nine percent believe Trump has been too supportive of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, economic attitudes among young voters have brightened slightly, though dissatisfaction remains high. Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy rose from 27–63 in September to 29–61 in October, and perceptions of overall economic trends also improved marginally, with 13 percent saying the economy is getting better, up from 11 percent the previous month. Views on personal finances also improved modestly.\n\nHowever, the ongoing federal government shutdown—now the longest in U.S. history—could reverse those gains. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned on October 13 that the shutdown was “starting to affect the real economy” and could cost the U.S. $15 billion per week. Among Gen Z, 64 percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, the highest of any age group, and 43 percent say they blame the Republican Party for the crisis, compared with 19 percent who blame Democrats.\n\nOverall approval remains steady among other voters\n\nBut despite the shutdown and growing discontent among younger voters, Trump’s overall approval ratings have held firm. \n\nAccording to analysis by FiveThirtyEight, previous shutdowns typically triggered a noticeable drop in public support. During the 1995–1996 shutdown, President Bill Clinton’s Gallup rating dropped from around 51 percent to the low 40s before rebounding once the standoff ended. Likewise, 20 days into the 2018–19 shutdown during Trump’s first term, his net approval dropped by 3 points, according to CNN.\n\nHowever, the latest polls suggest Trump is defying that trend.\n\nThe YouGov/Economist poll put Trump’s net approval at -17 points, unchanged from a month ago. Trump’s approval rating was only up 1 point in the latest Echelon Insights poll, ...","summary":"&#039;Things aren’t working&#039; for young people, Professor Peter Loge told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-support-among-gen-z-eroding-10918527","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25294781283654_9df75d.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 09:00:00","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":372150788,"title":"Column: When 'Fact Checkers' Are Weaponized Partisan Public Relations","text":"Every once in a while, the “fact checkers” at PolitiFact publish reader comments, and this one stuck out. \"Your site seems to be mostly about Trump all the time,\" came one comment in an email. \"How about a little less Trump, and write more about any other falsehood subjects?\"\n\nPolitiFact’s audience chief Ellen Hine acknowledged they’ve published over 1,000 “fact checks” on Trump, but then trotted out the false claim that their targeting is nonpartisan: “Without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from all sides of the political spectrum. At the same time, we more often fact-check the party that holds power or people who repeatedly make attention-getting or misleading statements.”\n\nThat \"without keeping count\" is an obvious excuse. Anyone who attempts to count what they're doing will quickly realize they're very partisan in their targeting -- and in their ratings on truth and falsehood. \n\nIn the first five months of 2025, PolitiFact performed 68 “Truth-O-Meter” fact checks on Republicans to just 23 on Democrats. Even so, this website found the Republicans “Mostly False,” “False,” or “Pants On Fire” liars in 85 percent of those articles, while the Democrats landed on the false side only 39 percent.\n\nBut let’s focus on presidents. From January 1 through October 22, Trump landed on the False side of the \"Truth-O-Meter\" 50 out of 54 times, or 92.5 percent of the time. The other four were \"Half True\" ratings, meaning he was rated \"True\" or \"Mostly True\" on zero occasions. It's been more than a year -- October 19, 2024 -- since Trump drew a \"Mostly True.\"\n\n Instead, PolitiFact rated Trump as a \"Pants On Fire\" liar 13 times this year, 24 percent of the time. Since they began in 2007, PolitiFact has written up 217 \"Pants on Fire\" claims on Trump, to just seven on Joe Biden over those years.\n\nIf you take the same time period in 2021, President Biden drew 34 checks, but they found him on the False side just 14 times, or 41 percent of the time. Biden was \"True\" or \"Mostly True\" ten times. In those first months of the Biden presidency, the liberal Democrats of PolitiFact were inflamed against Trump about election denial and the January 6 riot, so Trump drew nine \"Pants on Fire\" ratings in 24 checks during that time period -- and one \"Half True,\" and nothing on the True side. \n\nThe tilt in targeting is so obviously partisan. In 2025, when the “Pants On Fire” tag has been applied to individuals and not social-media sites, every single target was on the right. In addition to the pile of attacks on Trump, the flaming list was Pam Bondi (twice) Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk, Sen. Mike Lee, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, Kevin O’Leary of the TV show Shark Tank, and InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nLet's stipulate that some of these fact checks are identifying unfactual statements. But the aggression is overwhelming. The right side is nearly always wrong and blatantly lying, while the left side supposedly stumbles into getting it wrong every once in a while.\n\nTrump is tagged as \"False\" when he calls New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a \"communist,\" and Mamdani has never been fact-checked. Trump was \"Pants On Fire\" when he called Kamala Harris a \"communist,\" but the Democrats can call him a \"fascist\" daily and there is no checking.\n\nThis isn't \"independent fact-checking.\" It's weaponized public relations.","summary":"Every once in a while, the “fact checkers” at PolitiFact publish reader comments, and this one stuck out. \"Your site seems to be mostly about Trump all the time,\" came one comment in an email. \"How about a little less Trump, and write more about any other falsehood subjects?\"\n\nPolitiFact’s audience chief Ellen Hine acknowledged they’ve published over 1,000 “fact checks” on Trump, but then trotted out the false claim that their targeting is nonpartisan: “Without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from all sides of the political spectrum.

There are other themes to be found, as well, in this slim volume. Jean-Pierre often returns to the intersectional identities of race, sex, and sexuality in a way that will instantly return the reader to those heady post-Floyd days of the early Biden administration. She also has thoughts on the nature of parties and the factions within them. There is a score-settling recounting of a power struggle with a Biden administration official whom she does not name but who is generally believed to be Anita Dunn. But the question of loyalty and to whom it is owed comes up throughout.\n\nJean-Pierre is loyal to Joe Biden, perhaps more loyal than she should be, and certainly more loyal than anyone else in his administration. Even Kamala Harris — to whom Jean-Pierre also writes of with a great deal of loyalty and affection — found some time to disparage the old man a bit in her own post-election memoir, 107 Days. But, as she did at the podium in 306 press briefings, Jean-Pierre writes here as Biden’s fiercest defender outside his own family.\n\nAt times, it is jarring. Unlike the portrait of a president in decline presented in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s Original Sin — a book Jean-Pierre pointedly says she disagrees with and has not read — the Biden of her memory is one physically slowed a bit by age, but fully in possession of his faculties. “I was technically a part of the president’s inner circle and saw Biden every day,” she writes, “and saw no such decline.”\n\nThe instances of odd behavior that led many to believe Biden was unwell? Jean-Pierre repeats the administration line about “cheap fakes” — videos taken out of context in some unseemly way. The disastrous debate that laid bare the truth? “I will say once again that he had a cold.” Beyond the sniffles, Biden also had to deal with extensive world travel (he had been home for 11 days) and his son’s criminal trial (which he didn’t attend and which also ended 16 days earlier). \n\nLoyalty is a virtue, but it is not for no reason that the phrase “loyal to a fault” exists. We should be loyal to our family, our friends, our employers, and others who have earned our trust. But the limits of loyalty must be tested when they begin to contradict fealty to the truth and to the self. Maybe Jean-Pierre never noticed Biden’s now well-attested mental decline. But if that is so, she must also see now that the administration officials above her sent her out each day with incomplete information and bade her lie to the people. Jean-Pierre’s sense of outrage comes through clearly as she details the gradual, continual defections from Biden that occurred over the 24 days between the debate and Biden’s withdrawal from the race. She insists that Biden “could have survived the debate setback” had the party remained loyal, but “the Democrats — Biden’s party, my party — didn’t seem to want to give him the chance.”\n\nDespite being “technically a part of the president’s inner circle,” Jean-Pierre was blindsided by Biden’s decision to throw in the towel. She nevertheless maintained that intense loyalty and devotion to spin until the clock ran out on Biden’s term.\n\nWhile she devotes plenty of space to disparaging Donald Trump and Republicans generally, the real scorn here is for establishment Democrats, whom Jean-Pierre sees as having abandoned the president. Loyalty to Biden and loyalty to herself now demand, in the author’s telling, that she abandon the political party that was neither loyal to her nor to her boss. She has, as the title suggests, become a political independent. \n\nBut it is a strange manner of independence. Independents usually are seen as undecided between the two major parties. But even if you skipped the chapter here called “The Republicans,” rest assured, Jean-Pierre does not want you to consider voting for them. “I’m not saying to vote third party. I’m not saying to vote Republican. I am saying let’s figure out new ways to be acknowledged.”\n\nKARINE JEAN-PIERRE STICKS TO HER BIDEN STORY, BUT NO ONE IS BUYING IT \n\nThis message is especially directed at black women, who have been the Democratic Party’s most loyal members in recent years and whom Jean-Pierre believes have been uniquely betrayed and taken for granted. But in giving away immediately the idea that they should, in the end, never vote for anyone but Democrats, she fatally undercuts the argument. Unless they are willing to walk away, the party will never change.\n\nIf conservatives want to extend any kind of grace and understanding to a former political opponent, it should be to recognize that Jean-Pierre truly believed in Joe Biden and was loyal to him. But this narrative should also remind us of the times when loyalty goes too far and asks too much. Loyalty must not require blindness. It must also mean calling those to whom we are loyal to account and telling them the truth, no matter how painful. Jean-Pierre understands that when it comes to the Democratic Party. But for Biden, she’s still spinning.\n\nKyle Sammin is the managing editor of Broad + Liberty.","summary":"In modern America, most people would agree that the job of the White House press secretary is to lie to the press.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been struggling to raise money during President Donald Trump's second term in office. According to several people \"familiar with the conversations,\" the DNC attempted to reach out to major donors earlier this year through the San Francisco-based fundraiser, but most had declined. \"Upon receiving the invitation, one replied with a profanity-laced rejection,\" the report read. \"Others said they didn’t want to give to the party until it produced substantive plans to win elections.

Appearing on “The Arena with Kasie Hunt,” McCabe defended Smith after reports suggested investigators subpoenaed toll records, or telephone call logs, involving lawmakers who objected to certifying the 2020 election results.\n\n“I think it’s important that he’s [Smith is] speaking up in a way to kind of demystify what has been grossly misrepresented to the American people by the senators in that testimony we saw a few weeks ago. As you mentioned, Kasie, toll records are a very rudimentary kind of first step investigative technique in many, many, many, almost all investigations,” McCabe told host Kasie Hunt. “And it’s typically done early in investigation when you have an allegation and you’re trying to … vet an allegation to even see if there’s something worth investigating.”\n\nMcCabe said obtaining phone records of Republican senators was a basic way to verify allegations.\n\n“So, if someone comes to you, let’s say a situation like this, if someone makes an allegation that they have information that the president contacted a particular senator in the process of trying to stall the Congress’ work on certifying the election,” McCabe said. “One way to vet that information would be to get toll records to see if there was actually telephonic contact between those people. And after you’ve proved that if there’s no contact, then you know not to go down that investigative avenue. If there is contact and there are of course more techniques that you can use to get to the bottom of it.”\n\nMcCabe added that acquiring those records takes a grand jury subpoena and insisted the process was lawful.\n\n“I should also say that it takes a grand jury subpoena to acquire those records. That is not something that a prosecutor and FBI agent just dream up off the top of their heads and call up the phone company and say, ‘Hey send us everything you have.’ There is a process,” McCabe said. “These records are access lawfully under the purview of the grand jury.”\n\nPressed on whether the FBI applies a higher bar for investigations involving members of Congress as opposed to private citizens, McCabe conceded there are internal policies that treat elected officials as sensitive investigative matters, but maintained that the Bureau still has the authority to pursue such leads.\n\n“Sure they are, by things as simple as kind of internal policy. [In] the FBI, there are some sorts of investigations that we qualify as sensitive investigative matters,” McCabe said.\n\nSmith reportedly expanded his inquiry to include several right-leaning groups, among them the campus organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA), as well as former Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, according to whistleblowers who briefed Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. (RELATED: Alan Dershowitz Breaks Down What Trump Is Really ‘Looking For’ In His New Legal Fight)\n\nSmith later obtained a superseding indictment against Trump in August 2024, roughly two months after the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s immunity claims tied to an earlier version of the same case. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed the charges in Nov. 2024 at Smith’s own request, following Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race.\n\nThen-Attorney General Merrick Garland made Smith’s final report public on Jan. 14, detailing his conclusions about Trump’s attempts to contest the 2020 results. Garland appointed Smith in Nov. 2022 to handle investigations concerning both Trump’s election challenges and his handling of classified documents.\n\nThe first Trump administration’s DOJ fired McCabe in 2018 following allegations that he lied about the leaking of information to the media. The Biden administration rescinded his firing in 2021.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And, she had to do so while being mindful of how most people perceive members of marginalized groups.\n\nJean-Pierre was familiar to many major Democratic politicians and party insiders at the time of her appointment. She had worked in assorted capacities for the unsuccessful presidential campaigns of John Edwards (2004), Martin O’Malley (2016), and Kamala Harris (2020), and the victorious ones of Barack Obama (both times) and Biden. She was on MSNBC as a political analyst and was an op-ed writer and memoirist (“Moving Forward” was published in 2019 and issued in paperback in May by HarperCollins). And, she had occupied the position of Principal Deputy Press Secretary to the woman whom she would succeed, Jen Psaki, for a year and a half.\n\nFollowing Harris’ defeat in 2024, Jean-Pierre opted to leave the Democratic Party. This decision forms the basis of her brand new book, “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines” (Legacy Lit, May 21). “Independent” explores to varying degrees how both her personal and professional lives led her to shed the only political affiliation that she had ever donned. \n\nIn the process, Jean-Pierre affords readers the perspective of someone whose presence was ubiquitous during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nJean-Pierre will be at Boston College High School on Oct. 24 to discuss her new book. The event, which will be moderated by GBH News’ Saraya Wintersmith, was initially planned for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum but was moved because of the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nBoston.com: How do you define being independent of the Democratic Party while still being in line with its ideology and policy objectives?\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: I’m definitely independent, but it’s very nuanced, right? I still very much agree with the Democratic Party and their ideology, I just think that the system is broken and things need to be fixed. And I am an independent in the sense that I don’t belong to any two main party affiliations, but I do believe that I still have a voice and hope that I can push accountability and awareness. \n\nAnd it’s not just me. Millions of Americans who voted in 2020 didn’t vote in 2024. So there’s a disillusionment that exists. And there are millions of independents. Young people are becoming more independent because they don’t feel like their voice is being represented. \n\nSo my hope is to turn that into a form of power from the outside, and make sure that all of our voices are being heard and forcing the party to work for my vote. As a private person, I wanted to make sure that I spoke about this in a way that I was speaking for myself. \n\nHow does no longer serving as the White House Press Secretary enhance your newly embraced independence?\n\nWhen you are working for the President of the United State as White House Press Secretary, you are not speaking for yourself. And I haven’t been speaking for myself for years, even when I was working for an organization before I joined Biden’s 2020 campaign. So this is the first time in years that I get to speak for myself. But you make that commitment. \n\nI felt privileged and honored to be White House Press Secretary for Joe Biden. But now, I’m not running for office, I’m not part of any political affiliation, I am my own person, standing on my own. I wanted to, in this moment, start a conversation that needed to happen in order to try to make the system make more sense.\n\nIs running for office as an independent of interest to you?\n\nI have no plans to run for office. It’s not a calling for me, so I don’t have to worry about that. As a private citizen, I want to do my part for a country that I love and care about. Policies are being created to harm people, and that’s not okay to me. I feel like if you’re silent, you’re being complicit, and I cannot be silent in this moment. \n\nHas leaving the Democratic Party given the Republican Party any appeal?\n\nI’ve worked for Democrats my entire political career. I would not ever work for a Republican or even vote for a Republican. I feel like that party has totally lost it and is touting Project 2025, which harms people and takes away people’s protections and freedoms. \n\nThe Democratic party is the one that have been a member of for a long time, and what I want to see from that party is fight, teeth. If anything, an opposition to what we’re seeing right now. I don’t see that, and that’s the conversation that I want to push. \n\nGiven what you perceive to be the many benefits, do you think that it would be better for everyone to abandon their party loyalty?\n\nWhen you belong to a party, you are belonging to a group, an organization, that you truly believe has your interests at heart. If you grew up in a Democratic family, it like part of your DNA, and sometimes you don’t question it because you’ve been in that party for so long. This book is not trying to convince people to become independent. It is explaining why I made that decision and at the same time asking people to ask questions. I think it’s important to do that. \n\nAnd the point of the book is to start a conversation about how we envision the direction of this country. Power should be taken out of the hands of the White House and into the hands of the people. And that’s the book. It’s about the political system, the power that they people have, and how we push forward. \n\nIs each of the parties is failing its constituents?\n\nI think that the two-party system is broken. You had millions of people who stayed home in 2024 who voted in 2020 and didn’t feel that their voices were being heard. You have millions of young people who are deciding to become independent because they feel like they two-party system is not listening to them. \n\nBut, at the end of the day, we need both parties to be functioning in a way that people feel heard. If you have the leader of one party leaning into authoritarianism and fascism, that’s a problem. Then you have a Democratic Party that seems like they’re giving up their power. \n\nI want the two-party system to work, so what I’m doing for myself is asking how I push that system to work from where I stand right now. And I feel like being an independent starts that conversation. The power has to be outside the party system in order to fix it, if that makes sense. \n\nAre you still in communication with Joe Biden?\n\nYeah, I am. I spoke to him recently. He called me not to long ago to check in to see how I’m doing and to make sure I’m okay. It was quintessential Joe Biden. He’s someone who’s a fighter, someone who I admire and always will, and I learned a lot from working with him these past couple of years.","summary":"The former White House Press Secretary discusses her frustration with the current state of both her former political home and the two-party system itself in her new book.\n\n\nThe post Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declares herself ‘Independent’ appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/community/books/2025/10/23/karine-jean-pierre-declares-herself-independent/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SU7JVV4PFWL5HR6NGITWUJG22Q-68fab6c7dbf81-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:34:16","author":"Audrey Cooney","authors":["Audrey Cooney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":372185334,"title":"NAACP: White Dem voters ‘will not vote for black candidates’","text":"The Supreme Court is considering a Louisiana redistricting case that could have a greater impact on U.S House of Representatives seats than the Texas and California “gerrymandering” maneuvers combined.\n\nThe New York Times wrote, “Democrats would be in danger of losing around a dozen majority-minority districts across the South if the court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act.” \n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller tweeted, “How many people just realized that Dems had as many as 20 extra seats based on years of unconstitutional race-based gerrymandering?”\n\nFor the purpose of “racial justice” under the Voting Rights Act, Democrat legislatures and politicians created several “majority-minority” districts in order to elect black and Hispanic congressional members. The Supreme Court will rule on whether these districts violate equal protection under the Constitution. \n\nACLU Voting Rights Project Director Sophia Lin Lakin, who supports these majority-minority districts, said: “Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in safeguarding the promise that people of color can participate in our democracy on equal terms. It has been our shield against discriminatory maps and our answer to laws designed to suppress the vote. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act with overwhelming, bipartisan support – and reauthorized it again and again – because our leaders understood a fundamental truth: you cannot cure discrimination by pretending it doesn’t exist.”\n\nNAACP lawyer Janai Nelson told the court, “It was clear that, regardless of party, white Democrats were not voting for black candidates whether they were Democrats or not. We know that there is such a significant chasm between how black and white voters vote in Louisiana that there is no question that even if there is some correlation between race and party, that race is the driving factor.”\n\nThe Supreme Court decades ago in Shaw v. Reno (1993) and Miller v. Johnson (1995) ruled against districts where gerrymandering by race was the dominant factor. “Ethnic cleansing!” cried Jesse Jackson after the Miller decision. Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said, “The noose is tightening.” Her colleague, Theodore Shaw, warned that once this decision goes through, the Black Congressional Caucus “could meet in the back seat of a taxicab.” But of the black House members in the four redesigned majority-white Southern districts who decided to run for reelection, three won. One chose not to run.\n\nIn 2016, the city of over 100,000 population that most voted for Donald Trump, with 80% of the vote, was Abilene, Texas, a city that is over 75% white. Shortly after Trump’s election, Abilene voted for its first black mayor. Black Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., recently said: “Myself, Wesley Hunt, Burgess Owens, John James – we are all black men who represent majority-white districts (referring to Texas, Utah and Michigan, respectively.) Tim Scott is the United States senator from South Carolina. South Carolina does have a strong black population, but it’s a predominantly white state. These are the facts.” America’s three largest cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, all have black mayors though none of these cities is majority black. There are many examples of blacks elected to statewide offices in a country where no state has a majority black population. These include Sens. Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Carol Moseley Braun and Cory Booker, as well as Govs. Doug Wilder, Deval Patrick and Wes Moore.\n\nAbout the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s principal rival for the Democratic nomination was Hillary Clinton. Obama was attempting to become the first black president, while Clinton was attempting to become the first female president. On the Republican side, the two primary rivals were Mitt Romney, who would become the first Mormon president, and John McCain, who would become at 72 the oldest elected president. In February 2007, Gallup found that 5% of Americans said they “would not vote for” a black presidential candidate; 11% “would not vote for” a woman; 24% “would not vote for” a Mormon; and 42% “would not vote for” a presidential candidate who is “72 years of age.” So, Obama’s hurdle was the lowest.\n\nAs for the Supreme Court, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., calls Republican-appointed jurists “often underqualified or completely unqualified for their role.” \n\nNothing says qualified quite like a bartender-turned-congressional candidate. And AOC got elected, proving yet again that despite America’s “systemic racism,” there’s hope.","summary":"On AOC: 'Nothing says qualified quite like a bartender-turned-congressional candidate'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/10/naacp-white-dem-voters-will-not-vote-black/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/students-children-schools-blacks-curious-cute-wondering-seriously-really-disbelief-haitians-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 22:51:25","author":"Larry Elder","authors":["Larry Elder"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":372185336,"title":"Conservatives triumph worldwide","text":"Called “ultraconservative” by the liberal media, Japan’s new prime minister is its first woman ever in that position. But a Japanese feminist author told NBC News that Japan attaining its first female prime minister “doesn’t make me happy.”\n\nSanae Takaichi takes the reins of power in Japan with strongly conservative positions on gender and marriage. She’s much more like Phyllis Schlafly than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris.\n\nTakaichi opposes same-sex marriage and is against allowing married woman to keep their maiden name as their last name after marriage. She favors the Japanese tradition of male-only succession in its imperial family.\n\nShe is unlikely to support DEI. She will strengthen the Japanese military, which would help us by creating a buffer against communist China, and she’ll meet next week with President Trump during his Asia trip.\n\nShe has supported tougher immigration policies in Japan. Like Trump, she is an advocate of hard work: “I myself will throw out the term ‘work-life balance.’ I will work and work and work and work and work,” she said.\n\nHer election was made possible by support from the Japan Innovation Party, called Ishin, which the liberal media describe as far-right. The same childless Japanese feminist author, Chizuko Ueno, complained that Takaichi “sees herself as the Japanese version of Margaret Thatcher.”\n\nThe issue of women’s rights pales in comparison with the crisis in Japan of its vanishing birth rate. Its population is contracting, falling from 127 million in 2015 to only 123 million today, a trend that will soon be nearly impossible to reverse.\n\nJapan’s population is declining at a rate of 0.5 to 1.5% annually now. That leaves fewer young workers supporting its vast elderly population.\n\nThe median age in Japan is 50 years old, meaning that half of its people are aging out of the workforce. By comparison, the median age in Florida as the place of retirement for many Americans is only 43 years old, and in booming Texas, the median age is only 36.\n\nThere cannot be economic growth without young workers, and Japan’s real gross domestic product decreased by an annualized 0.2% between the last quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of this year. Japan is burdened by the highest debt-to-GDP ratio of any developed country, a whopping 240%.\n\nThe number of childbirths in Japan dropped in the first half of 2025 by 3.1% from a year ago. A record-low 340,000 babies were born there in the first six months of this year, far too few to sustain its future.\n\nThe decline in births there is plummeting even faster than projections. While some blame male traditions in the country, the Japanese people are turning to a conservative woman to try to save them.\n\nTakaichi’s election is part of a trend worldwide that also recently resulted in the first conservative president of Bolivia in 20 years. Rodrigo Paz won a stunning upset against Leftist control of that South American country, and he vows to establish a better relationship with the United States.\n\nThis is terrific news as Bolivia is the third-largest producer of illegal cocaine in the world. In 2023 alone, 33 tons of cocaine were seized by anti-drug efforts in that country.\n\nThe recent Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to an anti-communist in Venezuela, María Corina Machado, who was forced into hiding after the Leftist dictator Nicolás Maduro stole the election from her last year. Machado is widely considered to have won that election for president of Venezuela while campaigning on a platform of getting tough against illegal drugs and improving relations with the U.S.\n\nWhen the Norway committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Machado, she immediately praised Trump and called him to let him know that he should have won. Machado’s conservative positions are popular in Venezuela, and her campaign rallies drew large crowds just as Trump’s did.\n\nThe left-wing political party ruling Great Britain today – the Labour Party – has fallen to a rock-bottom 19% in public support, according to recent polling. This is less than half of its support at the beginning of last year, and the liberal media are distressed at this without understanding why.\n\nTrust in the liberal president of France, Emmanuel Macron, fell to a record-low 14% this month according to a poll funded by the business daily Les Echos. President Trump’s approval rating in the United States is three times higher than that.\n\nIn June, Trump-endorsed conservative Karol Nawrocki prevailed in Poland over the liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The conservative prime minister of nearby Hungary, Viktor Orbán, cheered this “fantastic victory.”\n\nBack home, liberals are perplexed by Trump’s growing popularity during the Democrat-induced partial shutdown of the government. To understand better, they should take note of conservative victories sweeping the globe.","summary":"'Trust in the liberal president of France, Emmanuel Macron, fell to a record-low 14% this month'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/10/conservatives-triumph-worldwide/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/takaichi98.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 22:44:14","author":"Andy Schlafly","authors":["Andy Schlafly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":372015824,"title":"Top Secret Service agent is exposed for being plus-sized model who failed physical fitness test","text":"An ex-Secret Service agent who protected former Vice President Kamala Harris's stepdaughter is a plus-size model who never passed her physical fitness test.\n\nAlison Zupancic was hired under the leadership of of former Director Kimberly Cheatle, who emphasized Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives during her tenure.\n\nZupancic was assigned to protect Ella Emhoff in New York, according to Secret Service sources that spoke with RealClearPolitics.\n\nShe describes herself as a 'nationally published curve model, plus-size fashion and fitness influencer, and body-positive advocate' on social media. \n\nZupancic was retained at the Secret Service despite failing her physical fitness test multiple times, per RealClearPolitics.\n\nDuring her employment the former agent starred in a plus-size clothing company's marketing campaign that hinted at her position with the Secret Service.\n\nA photoshoot for ELOQUII, a fashion retailer that describes itself as 'the ultimate destination for stylish plus size fashion 14-32,' featured Zupancic in a floral-print dress behind bold text that read: 'Undercover, But Never Underdressed.'\n\nThe announcement of the marketing campaign mentioned that it featured a 'a law enforcement professional' in order to shed 'light on the preconceived notions around the profile of a woman behind a certain career.'\n\nIt also stated that the campaign was meant to 'challenge unconscious bias in the workplace and beyond.' \n\nAfter Zupancic's multiple failed fitness tests, she was placed in the Special Services Division, the arm of the Secret Service that handles support functions. \n\nIn that role, she handled maintenance of the armored vehicle fleets and screened mail and packages received by the White House. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the Secret Service and Zupancic for comment.\n\nIt is not clear if Zupancic left the service before or after Cheatle was ousted as head of the agency in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in July 2024.\n\nCheatle held her leadership role at the agency from the time she was appointed by President Joe Biden in September 2022 until she resigned last year.\n\nAt the time of her departure, 24 percent of agents and officers at the agency were women, agency sources told RealClearPolitics. \n\nThe outlet was also told that during the former director's tenure, agents in minority groups were able to enter chat rooms on the agency’s internal DEI website where they could vent about workplace frustrations. \n\nAt a press conference after Cheatle's resignation, House Speaker Mike Johnson said: 'The immediate reaction to her resignation is that it is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago.\n\n'Now we have to pick up the pieces.

The man noticed the mistake and self-reported the firearm.\n\nIn mid-September a Secret Service agent attributed Charlie Kirk's assassination to 'karma' was placed on administrative leave.\n\nWhile earlier this month, a Secret Service agent fell asleep in public while providing security for the UN General Assembly and left his fully-automatic assault rifle unattended when he went to the restroom.","summary":"Alison Zupancic provided protection to former Vice President Kamala Harris's stepdaughter Ella Emhoff despite not achieving all the requirements of a Secret Service agent.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15220649/Secret-Service-plus-size-model-failed-test.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/23/20/103263901-0-image-m-15_1761249323162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 21:10:13","author":"Editor,Eliot Force","authors":["Editor","Eliot Force"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.05}]}
