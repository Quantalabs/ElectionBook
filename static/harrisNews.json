As part of the arrangement, the firm agreed to scrap its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as provide $40 million worth of pro bono services to support Trump's agenda.Trump subsequently rescinded his executive order. In the wake of the settlement, Paul Weiss faced a firestorm of criticism and the head of the firm's pro bono arm, Steven Banks, resigned.More than 170 alumni of the firm also signed an open letter to the firm's chairman, Brad Karp, calling the decision to settle \"cowardly\" and adding that \"the very independence of lawyers and the legal profession is at stake.\"In total, the nine major law firms that settled with the Trump administration have agreed to provide about $1 billion in legal work, according to Bloomberg.What People Are SayingDunn, Rhee, Isaacson and Phillips said in an email to the firm on Friday both Bloomberg and The Times reported: \"We were disappointed not to be able to tell each of you personally and individually the news that we have decided to leave Paul, Weiss to start a new law firm.\"Brad Karp, the chairman of the firm, told The Times in a statement: \"We are grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions to the firm. We wish them well in their future endeavors.\"Neera Tanden, a prominent Democratic activist, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Proud of these legal leaders. They are putting principle first. Hope all lawyers at Paul Weiss of conviction join them.\"Jason Kint, a digital media veteran and the CEO of Digital Content Next, wrote on X: \"Wow. Paul Weiss just lost the top attorneys representing Google in its adtech antitrust case just as remedies are getting underway. It will be interesting to see how Google handles this since this is fallout for the law firm being first to do a Trump deal.\"What Happens NextAt least three law firms—Perkins Coie, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block—have fought Trump's executive orders in court. On Friday, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush blocked Trump's order targeting Jenner & Block after finding that it violated the Constitution.","summary":"A top Democratic lawyer, a former Mueller prosecutor, a well-known antitrust attorney and a former Alito clerk have left Paul Weiss.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/paul-weiss-partners-exit-start-new-firm-2076661","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2651116/paul-weiss.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 00:33:40","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":324278258,"title":"Kamala Harris called Anderson Cooper a ‘motherf—er’ after tense interview on Biden’s debate meltdown: bombshell book","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris blasted Anderson Cooper as a “motherf–ker” to colleagues following a tense interview at the height of last year’s presidential race, a bombshell new book revealed.\n\nThe disparaging remark came after the CNN host grilled the Democrat over the catastrophic performance then-President Joe Biden gave when he debated President Trump last summer.\n\n“This motherf–ker doesn’t treat me like the damn vice president of the United States, she said to colleagues,” according to the new book “Original Sin,” co-authored by Anderson’s CNN colleague Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.\n\n“I thought we were better than that.”\n\nThis is a developing story.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), in one of her accustomed racialist rants, recently went after her party’s big Democratic donors, who raised a record amount of money for Kamala Harris’ short-lived campaign.\n\nCrockett played the race card when claiming that Democratic insiders were already backing the next party nominee as the “safest white boy.”\n\nHer racist irritation is puzzling. After all, two out of the last four Democratic presidential nominees have been African Americans.\n\nYet it is certainly easy to see why Crockett, who endlessly spouts off about race in congressional sessions, used the pejorative “white boy.”\n\nShe knows that there are no repercussions given her race and, to a lesser extent, her gender and left-wing ideology.\n\nRecently, a past 2018 slur resurfaced from another House Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). \n\nShe had falsely claimed, “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths in this country.”\n\nOmar’s stereotyped smear was not only racist but also factually incorrect.\n\nThe FBI’s 2018 data on perpetrators of murder, when the race of the offender was known, reveals that 54.9% of the nation’s murderers that year were African American, who constitute about 13% of the population.\n\nAnd when the race of the murderer in rare interracial killings was known, blacks were more than twice as likely to murder whites as whites were to kill blacks.\n\nDuring recent controversies over leaks at the Pentagon, former UN Ambassador Susan Rice injected race by smearing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nShe leveled a trifecta race/gender/sexual orientation slur — all irrelevant to the issue at hand: “Well, if you’re a white male Christian cisgender macho MAGA man, you can be as dumb as a rock and be deemed qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense.”\n\nIn all these cases, there was no fallout from racial categorization and demonization.\n\nAgain, we apparently accept the pernicious idea that those identifying as an oppressed group cannot themselves voice illiberal stereotypes.\n\nBut while our political elites and celebrities seem fixated on using racial putdowns for career advantage and personal notoriety, the people increasingly ignore their entrenched and off-putting racism.\n\nFor example, in a recent Rasmussen poll surveying public attitudes toward Trump’s first 100 days in office, 62% of Hispanics voiced approval (higher than the 49% of whites) — and 39% of blacks agreed.\n\nOne result of the 2024 campaign was that while Democrats seemed fixated on racial stereotypes, the public had moved on. \n\nVoters increasingly see class considerations transcending race.\n\nThat fact may explain why exasperated and flailing Democrats and leftists desperately seek to resurrect racial polarization instead of finding a popular middle-class agenda.\n\nHistorically, tribalism erodes a multiracial democracy.\n\nIt did when white leaders in the past expressed racist attitudes toward blacks — and it will again if black elites simply flip the paradigm and do the same.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.","summary":"Human nature is universal — but our political elites and celebrities seem fixated on using racial putdowns for career advantage and personal notoriety.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/23/opinion/angel-reese-and-the-privilege-of-anti-white-bigotry/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/chicago-sky-forward-angel-reese-105153885-e1748040003818.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 23:33:44","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":324269270,"title":"Hey, Bruce: The Democrats long ago abandoned the American workers of your lyrics — like roadkill","text":"Bruce Springsteen hates Donald Trump. In other news, water is wet.\n\nLast week, The Boss kicked off his “Land of Hopes & Dreams Tour” in Manchester, England, by raging against our 47th president.\n\n“In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treacherous government,” he said onstage about Jill and Joe Biden.\n\nI kid, of course. \n\n“They are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent,” Springsteen continued. “They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators.”\n\nHow amusing. Imagine having so many electrifying hits and so many fans of so many political stripes — and opting to play bombs from your Trump Derangement Syndrome catalog. \n\nWhy perform “Jungleland” for the adoring masses when you can play the soliloquy “Orange Man Bad” for yourself?\n\nAnd then, voila, on Wednesday he went and dropped an actual TDS EP, “Land of Hopes and Dreams.” It features four live songs plus his Manchester Trump condemnation.\n\nHow stunningly brave to lob missiles at the president from England, a country literally jailing people over social media posts. But never mind all that.\n\nAs WFAN producer Al Dukes — a self-described “huge fan” of Springsteen — noted on X, the singer wouldn’t dare get up on stage in the United States and take precious minutes from a performance with an anti-Trump rant, because he’d get booed back to the swamps of Jersey.\n\nSpringsteen has long been a slobbering sycophant for anyone with the letter D next to their name. After sucking up to Obama for years, he threw his support behind the incompetent Kamala Harris and was on the roster of clueless celebrities who performed or spoke at her rallies.\n\nBut he doesn’t usually do political messaging on stage for paying customers, which is a sound policy.\n\nIt’s also one that’s kept me, a righty who has always had to separate the artists from the art, coming back. Born and raised near the Jersey Shore — Springsteen’s primordial soup — I was only 7 when I first saw him live. Since then, I’ve given The Boss more money than I want to admit. There’s been many concerts, albums and concert albums.\n\nWhile living lavishly on his tony Colts Neck spread, the iconic singer is still known for popping into local bars and working out at crappy chain gyms.\n\nYet he’s clearly not speaking with real people on those field trips.\n\nHis party policed speech, glorified identity politics and let scores of criminals into the country. Voters have rejected the elitism he truly champions under his blue-collar costume. \n\nEnough with the A-listers preaching to us little people from their private jets and mansions, they said.\n\nPerhaps Springsteen is too busy texting Obama, but he’s failed to notice that even his beloved Garden State has increasingly become red.\n\nHarris beat Trump by only 5 points — a whopping 10-point drop from Biden’s victory in 2020.\n\nThe Democrats long ago abandoned the American workers of Springsteen lyrics like road kill, and still view them as vile, stinky creatures, not valuable constituents.\n\nYet The Boss is still carrying water for the party that has subverted democracy for the last three presidential elections — a party that propped up a decaying old man so a shadow administration could govern.\n\nAnd he wants to lecture the side that said No to all that? \n\nSpare me all the peace, love and inclusion. \n\nA guy who never did a lick of labor but built his entire career on the lore of the grizzled working man, Springsteen remains stunningly out of touch with the temperature of the country.\n\nHe claims to be for the common man, but he’s hopelessly partisan. Just ask poor old sad superfan Chris Christie, who begged for his idol’s love for years but was always rebuffed — and skewered — by Springsteen because of party affiliation.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump — a man not blessed with the gift of restraint — of course took the bait.\n\nThe president unloaded on X, writing, “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.”\n\nThen he shared a video of himself swinging a club and the ball appearing to hit Springsteen on the back and knock him over.\n\nIt was unpresidential … but also funny. And, unintentionally, a nod to how ridiculous this bonfire of the boomer egos truly is.\n\nNext time, Bruce, spare us the lecture. Stick to the hits.","summary":"The Boss is still carrying water for the party that has subverted democracy for the last three presidential elections — a party that propped up a decaying old man so a shadow administration could govern.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/23/opinion/spare-us-your-tds-bruce-springsteen-stick-to-the-hits/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/springsteen-controversy_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DSSkvKOT-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-23 23:12:16","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.193},{"id":324273596,"title":"House GOP to probe important things—like Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis","text":"Because they are absolute ghouls, House Republicans are opening an investigation into former President Joe Biden’s health, including demanding that his doctor testify about Biden’s private medical information. Meanwhile, current President Donald Trump is so flagrantly and consistently incoherent that the only way for his administration to deal with it is to ensure no transcripts of his rambling remarks are available. \n\nThis latest probe is technically more of a reopening. House Republicans investigated Biden’s alleged cognitive decline last year, but thanks to Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper making the rounds with their book about how Biden getting old is the biggest threat to American democracy, they’ve got an excuse to do it again. And of course, after Biden announced his prostate cancer diagnosis, the door was wide open for Rep. James Comer to continue his unhealthy vendetta against the Biden family.\n\nNot that Comer really needs an excuse. The fever swamp that is his brain likely means that pretty much any time anyone even mentions the Biden name, he spins up the House Oversight Committee to “investigate” something, anything. After Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, Comer ran to Newsmax to say that meant it was time to open another investigation into Hunter’s laptop. That was after he spent 15 months fruitlessly trying to invent some corruption for which Biden could be impeached. \n\nThe one-two punch of Tapper’s media blitz and Biden’s cancer diagnosis must have been a dream come true for Comer, who dashed off letters to Biden’s doctors and former aides. He wants Biden’s doctor to prove that his “financial relationship with the Biden family” didn’t affect his assessment of Biden’s fitness to serve, while also basically saying that the doctor helped cover up Biden’s decline from the public. Inquiries to former aides are so that Comer can “understand who made key decisions and exercised the powers of the executive branch during the Biden Administration,” with the implication there being, of course, that it was not Joe Biden. \n\nHilariously, Comer is pretending that one of the reasons Biden’s physician has to share the former president’s private medical information is that the Oversight Committee needs that to “explore whether the time has come for Congress to revisit potential legislation to address the oversight of presidents’ fitness to serve pursuant to its authority under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.” \n\nComer has no actual interest in fitness to serve. This is just him building on Trump’s 2024 campaign rhetoric saying the 25th Amendment should be “modified” to allow for the removal of a vice president because Kamala Harris was part of a conspiracy to cover up Biden’s decline. Any real query into the capacity of a president to do his job would have to grapple with not just Trump’s inability to do the job but also his obvious handoff of vast chunks of decision-making.\n\nTrump routinely makes things up out of thin air, but that’s always been the case. That makes it difficult to tell whether he’s lost the plot or is just lying. When he showed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pictures from the Democratic Republic of Congo and insisted they were instead evidence of white genocide in South Africa, it’s just as likely that Trump knew the truth but didn’t care as it is that he genuinely didn’t have any idea what he was looking at. \n\nRelated | Trump's racist ambush of South African president gets even more bonkers\n\nBut even if you set aside all the times in which Trump blatantly lies in service of a political point, you’ve still got all the other times where it seems like he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He told the press he didn’t sign the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that paved the way for the mass deportation of Venezuelan migrants, despite his signature appearing on it. \n\nAnd he routinely admits he doesn’t know about major decisions. Earlier this month, The Washington Post compiled the most recent ones. He said he didn’t know his nominee for surgeon general, but had listened to a recommendation from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He said he hadn’t been briefed on U.S. soldiers killed in Lithuania. He wasn’t aware the administration was considering deporting people to Libya. He’s not the person responsible for the failure to bring Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia home from a Salvadoran prison, because, “We have lawyers that don’t want to do this.”\n\nIt’s a cliche to say that every accusation is a confession, but that’s pretty much what happens every time Republicans open their mouths.","summary":"Because they are absolute ghouls, House Republicans are opening an investigation into former President Joe Biden’s health, including demanding that his doctor testify about Biden’s private medical information.

SANDERS, WARREN WARN PARAMOUNT THAT SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT COULD BE ILLEGAL BRIBERY ACT Trump sued CBS News and Paramount – also Comedy Central’s parent company – for $10 billion in October over allegations of election interference involving the \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the presidential election (the amount has since jumped to $20 billion). Both Trump and Paramount have entered mediation, which could conclude at any time.

The nonprofit is able to seek damages because it owns shares of Paramount. It plans to act on behalf of itself and other shareholders, alleging that the settlement would amount to the company’s executives “breaching their fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets by engaging in conduct that US senators and others believe could amount to unlawful bribery that falls outside the scope of the business judgment rule.” The White House and Paramount did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nLast October, President Trump sued Paramount subsidiaries CBS Broadcasting and CBS Interactive, alleging that an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on longstanding CBS News program 60 Minutes was deceptively edited, in a manner that constituted election interference. Initially seeking $10 billion in damages, Trump amended the lawsuit in February to ask for $20 billion. Paramount Global has a market cap of roughly $8.5 billion.\nAlthough Paramount previously called the lawsuit “an affront to the First Amendment” in legal filings to dismiss this March, it has reportedly sought to settle; the company has a potentially lucrative merger pending with Hollywood studio Skydance that would require the Trump administration’s signoff.\nLast week, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone seeking information about any potential settlement, raising concerns that it would amount to bribery. “If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials,” they wrote, “they may be breaking the law.”\nTalks of a potential settlement had roiled CBS for months. Longtime 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens abruptly resigned in April, and CBS News president and CEO Wendy McMahon resigned earlier this month. “It’s become clear the company and I do not agree on a path forward,” she wrote in a memo to staff at the time.\nTrump’s lawsuit against Paramount isn’t an isolated attack on the media. He sued ABC News, owned by the Walt Disney Company, for defamation in March 2024 over comments from anchor George Stephanopoulos portraying the president as “liable for rape.” (A federal jury found President Trump liable for sexual assault in a 2023 civil case, but not rape.) The company settled the case in December. In late April, Trump posted comments on his social platform Truth Social that appeared to threaten The New York Times with the possibility of legal action in the future.\nThe type of lawsuit the Freedom of the Press Foundation plans to file, known as a shareholder derivative lawsuit, allows people and organizations who own shares of a publicly traded company to recover damages when executives harm the company. This is the same type of legal action that Tesla shareholders took to successfully fight CEO Elon Musk’s hefty $56 million compensation package, which Musk is now appealing. (Tesla also changed its corporate bylaws this month to make it harder for investors to pursue this type of lawsuit.)\nBest known for its free speech advocacy for media organizations, the Freedom of the Press Foundation sees this action—which is unlike any legal challenge it’s mounted before—as an extension of that mission, even though it targets a media organization.\nIf the Freedom of the Press Foundation does seek legal action and successfully sues Paramount over a proposed settlement, the damages would go to Paramount rather than the nonprofit itself. “You don't expect, as advocates for press freedom, to have to file lawsuits against executives of media publishers,” says Stern. “We're a press freedom organization trying to recover money for a media outlet from rogue executives.”","summary":"As Paramount considers settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview, the Freedom of the Press Foundation warns that it will sue over a deal that allegedly “could amount to a bribe.”","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/freedom-of-the-press-foundation-paramount-trump-settlement/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/6830d8de47797e411f30e857/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Paramount-Trump-Freedom-of-Press-Warning-Business-2164620757-1243412669.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 22:07:45","author":"Kate Knibbs","authors":["Kate Knibbs"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":324275050,"title":"Trump to 2.9M of his voters: Bleep off, suckers","text":"In the presidential election, Donald Trump won North Carolina’s 16 electoral votes thanks to 2,898,423 voters who pulled the lever for him — with many believing that he would deliver billions of dollars of federal aid to help them recover from devastating Tropical Storm Helene.\n\nOn Friday, he told them — and the 2.7 million voters who chose Democrat Kamala Harris and millions more residents — to fend for themselves: His administration denied another of the state’s request for tens of millions of dollars in needed aid.\n\nMore than 100 people died as Helene tore through western North Carolina in September, destroying homes, businesses and roadways. The storm’s record-breaking devastation totaled $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Recovery has been slow in parts of the region as some hard-hit mountain towns still appear ravaged by the storm nearly eight months later.\n\nIn the days immediately after the storm and before the election, Trump regularly criticized efforts by the Biden administration to help the state, and he often lied about the number of FEMA agents already on the ground and whether they were playing politics.\n\nTrump claimed without evidence that the Biden administration and North Carolina’s Democratic governor were “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.” And Trump adviser Stephen Miller said President Joe Biden “failed to evacuate or rescue” U.S. citizens, “just like you failed in Afghanistan.”\n\nThat led many voters to believe that Trump would bail them out. Instead, Trump has turned his back on them, with DOGE recommending the dissolution of FEMA.\n\nThe agency’s acting chief, David Richardson, announced plans to shift disaster recovery responsibilities to states for the upcoming hurricane season.\n\nGov. Mark Stein has called on the federal government to reform the agency but not to get rid of it, which he reiterated during his budget proposal announcement Monday.\n\nIn a letter to state officials, Richardson wrote that the state’s request for the federal government to pay for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days under major disaster ... is not warranted.”\n\nLast fall, Biden approved major disaster declarations for Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, allowing survivors to access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery immediately. FEMA and other federal agencies, along with private businesses and nonprofit and faith-based organizations, responded to the disaster in at least seven states, from Florida to Virginia.\n\nBiden approved more than $930 million for North Carolina’s Helene relief in 2024, which included $450 million for individual assistance (housing and other needs), $380 million for public assistance, and $100 million for emergency road and bridge repairs. \n\nThe Trump administration recently denied extending 100% federal cost sharing, shoving more costs on to the state.\n\nBiden warned that Project 2025 would dismantle FEMA and the national weather services that warned residents of approaching storms. Trump disavowed any knowledge of Project 2025, but his administration is using as the playbook to destroy the federal government as the courts intervene.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Today, Trump is just 1.6 points underwater, with his disapproval down to 49.3% and his approval up to 47.7%. That’s a pretty big shift in a few weeks. Something is happening.\n\nIt’s not possible to pinpoint precisely what is behind the move. But it appears that even as criticism of Trump from the usual suspects becomes more shrill, the president’s supporters are sticking with him, joining a substantial number of the independents and former Biden voters who voted for Trump last November. \n\nA new focus group of Wisconsin swing voters conducted for Axios — all the participants voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024 — reported they are “mostly standing by Trump despite reservations.” Yes, there were plenty of reservations. “The speed and scale of Trump’s tariffs aren’t sitting well even with some who agree with the idea of tariffs,” Axios reported. “Some said they don’t like Trump’s treatment of neighboring ally Canada, his incivility and bullying, or his ambiguity about whether he’ll abide by court rulings.”\n\nThat is entirely consistent with the kinds of feelings some voters expressed about Trump in the first term. But the story goes on to say that the focus group’s reservations “are mostly outweighed by their faith that Trump’s moves will eventually boost jobs, pay, and fairness for American workers — even if it means paying more now. They also blame Biden and other politicians more than Trump for the current situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Axios reports that none of them, not one of 12 people in the group, “said they would pick Kamala Harris if they could get a do-over.”\n\nYou can speculate about the reasons why Trump’s approval is on the rise. For example, there’s no doubt that some voters worried by Trump’s initial tariff threats are now a bit relieved that he has moderated some of those positions. \n\nAnother possible explanation is that there has been a lot of attention lately on the terrible scandal of the Biden administration — the long effort by White House aides to conceal the extent of Biden’s mental and physical infirmities. It didn’t work, of course, because everyone could see the problem with his or her own eyes. But now we’re learning how top Biden officials tried to fool the public. And we’re learning more about just how bad a shape Biden was in and the great risk that posed to the nation. In any event, all the bad news about Biden is, by definition, good news for Trump.\n\nBut in the end, it might be easier just to say that the polls show what is not working in the eternal battle over Trump. Lawfare isn’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Hysterical claims — Trump crashed the economy! — aren’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Wild predictions, such as that Trump will destroy democracy, aren’t working, as far as polls are concerned. Americans have heard that kind of stuff about Trump for years now, and a significant portion of them just aren’t listening anymore.","summary":"WHY IS TRUMP APPROVAL RISING? President Donald Trump&#8216;s job disapproval rating first exceeded his approval rating on March 13.

The Sirius XM tuner slips past E Street Radio, some stunning live track rips through my speakers, and I’m sucked in again. \n\n“Curse you, Bruce!” I think as I’m shouting along to “Badlands,” stomping my foot to “American Land” or tearing up to “This Hard Land.”\n\nYet when I consider the bile Springsteen spewed at President Donald Trump while standing on foreign soil, and die-hard fan Lee Habeeb’s heartfelt letter to The Boss in response, I think of the promise Springsteen made with his audience half a century ago now. Or more accurately, the promise his fans read into his music.\n\nAs he sang, “You be true to me and I’ll be true to you.”\n\nBruce sings about the lives and struggles of blue-collar workers, of those looked over by the elites, from the “coal mines of Appalachia” and “fiery furnaces” of Youngstown, to the Rattlesnake Speedway in the Utah desert. But he’s not one of them. Never has been.\n\nAnd he’s not true to them today.\n\nHe’s as much that blue-collar persona you see on stage as David Bowie was Ziggy Stardust or the Bible-believing preacher’s son Vincent Furnier is Alice Cooper.\n\nDon’t believe me. Believe his guitarist, lifelong friend and consigliere Steve Van Zandt. In his autobiography “Unrequited Infatuations,” Van Zandt said that between the “Born to Run” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town” albums, Springsteen “completely, 180 degrees changed his identity. He’s fronting, he’s playing a character. That was the most important moment of his life, because he stayed in that persona forever.”\n\nWhich gets us to the politics. Van Zandt himself is a hard-core, studious Leftist. The liner notes on his political albums come with footnotes, and study guides and quizzes. (I exaggerate, only slightly.) He sings what he means and means what he sings, as with his hit political anthem “Sun City.”Springsteen? He wouldn’t play Sun City. But he’d play for Kamala Harris for the right price.\n\nLet me ask. If you were a performer, and truly thought someone was a dictator, how much would you charge to help their opponent? You’d say, “Gimme a mic, and my ‘three chords and the truth’ will do the rest.”\n\nThat’s hardly the only example of Springsteen not being “true.”\n\nConsider his remarks in Manchester, England. The guy who had a hit with “War” shredded Trump as “incompetent” when Trump had that very same week mediated a ceasefire between nuclear-powered India and Pakistan, brought Ukraine and Russia back to the peace table, and moved closer to a war-evading deal with Iran.\n\nIf Springsteen were true, he’d admit that.\n\nThe Boss also attacked free speech in America while performing in a country putting people in jail for memes and protesting Muslim rape gangs.\n\nIf Springsteen were true, he’d have the guts to call the Brits out.\n\nIn response to the outcry over his remarks, Springsteen released an EP Wednesday featuring his monologue and four tracks from his Manchester show. The choices prove my point.\n\n“Land of Hope & Dreams”—a soul-stirring tribute to America, the “train” that welcomes “saints and sinners” and “fools and kings.” Just not the president and his 77 million supporters.“Long Walk Home”—A 2007 song expressing disillusionment with America’s direction during the George W. Bush era. A year earlier, Springsteen lambasted Bush for his nonchalant response to Hurricane Katrina, singing “He looked around, gave a little pep talk, said I’m with you and took a little walk.”\n\nFine. Where was Springsteen last year when the Biden administration “left to drown” hurricane-ravaged Western North Carolina?\n\nBob Dylan’s stirring “Chimes of Freedom”—Who were “the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked” Springsteen is singing about? How about the victims of those illegal immigrants Springsteen complains are being “rounded up in the streets.”\n\n“My City of Ruins”—Originally written about the economic devastation that wrecked his hometown. Yet he’s trash-talking the man who’s busting his butt to restore economic vitality to the towns left to die by Democrat administrations—while Springsteen himself partied on yachts with former President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2023 The Boss shrugged off a ghastly pricing scheme that sent ticket prices for his first tour in seven years to outrageous heights.\n\nHis indifference, his betrayal of his musical identity, was so great that the go-to website dedicated for decades to everything Springsteen, Backstreets.com, shut down in despair. Even the folks at E Street Radio struggled at first to grasp that The Boss wasn’t a “tramp like us” but a “rich man in a poor man’s shirt.”\n\nLook. It’s not all an act. You can’t create such rich characters and sing your heart out about those characters unless a part of them lives in you. And Springsteen’s done an enormous amount of good over the years in ways large and small. And he and his “Jersey Girl” wife have a son who’s a firefighter, for gosh sakes. \n\nUltimately, it’s on us. It’s our fault for putting so much faith and trust in Springsteen and holding him to the promise we thought he had made.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. As he sang in “The Promise”:\n\n“When the promise is broken, you go on livingBut it steals something from down in your soulLike when the truth is spoken and it don’t make no differenceSomething in your heart turns cold.”\n\nDang. That’s a great couplet. Curse you, Bruce. You did it to me again.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Phillips argued that the party's \"constant lying and gaslighting\" about Biden's deteriorating health has cost the Democratic Party the public's trust. The former congressman detailed multiple instances where Biden's decline was painfully apparent to those around him, and lamented the party's leadership for allowing him to run for a second term. \"In 2021, I had a front-row seat on two occasions when he addressed the House Democratic Caucus. I also spent time in close proximity to the president during two flights on Air Force One, in 2021 and 2022, where I was alarmed to see the president’s obvious decline in communication skills, gait, and leadership capacity,\" Phillips reported. FLASHBACK: KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DECLARED THERE IS 'NO COVER-UP' OF BIDEN'S HEALTH AFTER HE DROPPED OUT OF RACE Phillips claimed that after attending the White House holiday party in December 2022, the president's decline was \"too graphic to ignore,\" and he had no doubt in his mind that Biden was \"unfit to serve a second term.\" \"My opinion wasn’t an outlier,\" Phillips claimed. \"My congressional colleagues, like me, had eyes; behind closed doors we acknowledged the reality, lamented our party leadership’s inaction, and recognized the impending disaster awaiting us in November 2024.\" After many hushed conversations about Biden's worsening mental acuity, Phillips decided to reach out to prominent Democrats like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Vice President Kamala Harris, to enter the race. But according to Phillips, nobody answered the call to action. Frustrated with the leadership of his party, he decided to take matters into his own hands and enter the race himself. \"I was trying to spark a competitive primary—and at the very least to force a single, televised debate for Americans to assess the president and other candidates firsthand,\" Phillips said. \"I simply wanted Americans to see up close what I had seen and what the White House was trying to hide from them, and before it was too late.\" NEW BOOK EXPOSES HOW TOP BIDEN COMMS STAFFER WAS 'TIP OF THE SPEAR' COVERING UP BIDEN'S COGNITIVE DECLINE Phillips claimed that his efforts to primary Biden were met by stiff opposition from Democratic leadership, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' chief of staff informing him that he \"would not be speaking to Biden or anyone else in the White House\" after making a courtesy call to inform Jeffries that he planned on running against the sitting president. The former congressman also alleged that the media played a large role in preventing him from being listed on the ballot in 2024. \"Almost immediately, the party mechanism was activated, and I became persona non grata. The media, in particular MSNBC, where former Biden staffers wielded positions of influence—essentially deplatformed me and those supporting me,\" Phillips claimed. \"Party activists, paid and volunteer, took to social media to attack and discredit me.\" The Democratic National Committee (DNC) allegedly took steps to \"keep anyone not named Biden from being on the ballot, forcing Phillips and his team to file multiple lawsuits. \"This wasn’t a fight for democracy, rather a coordinated fight against democracy—executed by a private corporation with no accountability to voters,\" he asserted. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Phillips contended that Biden was surrounded by family and advisors who assured him that he was \"popular, able, and the best candidate to take on Donald Trump.\" \"And where did it get us? All those months of carefully guarding the president, prewriting his speeches, prerecording his interviews?\" Phillips questioned. \"In the end, the only unscripted, significant event President Biden did during his campaign was the [June] 2024 debate that was an unmitigated disaster. His entire campaign crumbled in the most humiliating way possible.\" Although Phillips had a multitude of criticisms for his party and those leading it, he did mention that the Democratic Party can still redeem itself. \"The first step is for everyone that was aware of Biden’s condition to come clean. No more evasions. No more insistence that he was sharp when you met him. The whole truth will come out, and they would be wise to get ahead of it,\" he advised. Phillips continued, proposing an intriguing question: \"If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses whose names we all know?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In conclusion, the former Democratic representative offered his party some advice on moving forward after the scandal. \"Protecting a president or institution at the cost of its credibility is a shortsighted and losing proposition. Democratic leaders and messengers must understand that sunlight is not our enemy, but rather the only way to earn the public’s confidence in our party,\" he concluded.","summary":"In a Thursday op-ed with The Free Press, Dean Phillips exposes Biden&apos;s alleged mental decline and Democratic leadership&apos;s inaction, facing media and party resistance in his 2024 primary bid.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-congressman-who-primaried-biden-hammers-party-over-health-cover-up","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/931/523/Phillips-Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 19:37:34","author":"Marc Tamasco","authors":["Marc Tamasco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":324244462,"title":"New Jersey governor race heats up ahead of primary -- with Trump's impact on the line","text":"New Jersey is set to hold its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month -- and many experts are saying the high-stakes race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections.\n\n\"This is going to be the first real test for the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration. We've seen a little bit from special elections that Democratic voters are motivated to turn out. Does that continue going forward in the fall in New Jersey?\" Daniel Bowen, a political science professor at The College of New Jersey, told ABC News.\n\nBrigid Callahan Harrison, the chair of the Political Science and Law Department at Montclair State University, told ABC News that the race might not only be a \"bellwether\" for how voters feel about President Donald Trump and the upcoming midterms, but that it could indicate both how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nHarrison points to Kamala Harris' small margin of victory in New Jersey, too. Harris won New Jersey by around 6 percentage points in 2024; then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAt stake in the race are also issues in New Jersey such as immigration enforcement and sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing and general affordability -- issues that have divided and animated Americans around the country and that are set to take center stage in the midterms as well.\n\nDemocrats contend with a crowded field\n\nThe Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue.\n\nPolling shows that U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents the state's 11th Congressional District, is leading the pack. Sherrill's experience as a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and network of political supporters from a previous run for Congress work in her favor, Harrison said.\n\nAnother Democratic candidate, Josh Gottheimer, has represented New Jersey's 5th Congressional District since 2017. The former political operative is widely seen as a moderate. Similar to other candidates, Gottheimer is positioning himself as ready to take on Trump. He has also framed himself as being the best one to tackle affordability in the state.\n\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka was an educator in Newark Public Schools and a member of the city council before being elected mayor for the first time in 2014. He was arrested earlier this month while joining members of Congress at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark. Trespassing charges against Baraka have since been dismissed.\n\nSteven Fulop was first elected mayor of Jersey City in 2013. The ex-Goldman Sachs investment banker and former Marine has overseen population growth, increased development and municipal reforms.\n\nSteve Sweeney, a former ironworker who served as New Jersey's state Senate president for more than a decade, spent two decades as a lawmaker in that chamber before losing to a Republican in 2021. He has touted his strong support from unions and experience as a legislator.\n\nSean Spiller, the president of the New Jersey Education Association -- the state's largest teacher's union -- has pointed to his experience as the former mayor of the city of Montclair as evidence that he is able to take on issues such as affordable housing and investing in childcare.\n\nAs the June 10 primary gets closer, experts say they're all facing some of the same headwinds. After New Jersey eliminated its old primary ballot design, which used to allow most county parties to give preferential placement to their endorsed candidates, candidates now must focus more on their own get-out-the-vote operations, Harrison said.\n\n\"Nobody's run in a race like this,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans play the Trump card -- as he endorses a returning challenger\n\nRepublicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red -- and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach.\n\nA recent New Jersey Republican Party fundraising email encouraged voters to \"finish the job\" and \"flip New Jersey red, for good.\"\n\nExperts said the presidential results might not necessarily indicate how competitive the gubernatorial race will be. Bowen said that New Jersey's off-cycle gubernatorial elections often show voters largely voting against the incumbent party in power in the White House, although he added that Republicans also see the race as intertwined with Democratic incumbent Murphy finishing up his time in office.\n\nStill, most of the Republican candidates have been eager to align themselves with Trump.\n\nTrump has endorsed the Republican front-runner Ciattarelli in the race that the president wrote is being \"closely watched by the entire World.\"\n\nCiattarelli has been involved in local politics for decades, serving various roles including councilman and state assemblyman. He has had his sights on governor since 2017, where he ran for the first time but lost the primary. Ciattarelli succeeded in clinching the Republican nomination in 2021, but ultimately lost to Murphy.\n\nCiattarelli, who says his top priority is making the state more affordable, has shifted his stance on Trump over the years. In 2015, he issued a statement calling Trump \"out of step with American values\" and \"not fit\" to be president. But he now supports the president, and endorsed Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump, recently wrote on his social media platform that Ciattarelli, \"after getting to know and understand MAGA, has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!)\"\n\nAfter the endorsement, Ciattarelli told Fox News that he will support the president's agenda. He has acknowledged his previous comments about Trump, too, but compared himself to Vice President JD Vance -- who at one point also did not support the president but is now vice president under Trump.\n\nAshley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, told ABC News that Trump's endorsement could help encourage undecided Republican voters to favor Ciattarelli. She said the center's polling showed that with Republican voters who were split, about half said an endorsement from Trump would make them more likely to vote for that candidate.\n\nConservative talk show host Bill Spadea previously ran unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. House and the state assembly, and has said he isn't afraid to call out both parties. He has expressed a desire to end taxpayer subsidies for Planned Parenthood and replicate the Department of Government Efficiency in New Jersey, in addition to promising to combat illegal immigration and increase affordability. Still, he said he has disagreed with Trump on \"multiple occasions.\"\n\nJon Bramnick, a former state senator, appears to be less supportive of Trump. Last April, he made it clear that he would not vote for Trump in the 2024 presidential race, though he also said he probably wouldn't vote for the Democratic candidate either.\n\nStill, some of Bramnick's positions reflect stances similar to Trump's. In addition to branding himself as the \"toughest candidate on immigration,\" Bramnick also seeks to end sanctuary state policies in New Jersey, and introduced the \"New Jersey Laken Riley Act,\" which intends to align the state's law with Trump's legislation.\n\nMario Kranjac, the former mayor of the town of Englewood Cliffs, is running a pro-Trump campaign, branding himself as a \"political outsider.\" Justin Barbera, a contractor, is also running a pro-Trump campaign, telling the New Jersey Monitor he is guided by his military and Christian background.\n\nEven with Ciatterelli standing out as the front-runner, Bowen said that nothing is certain until the primary wraps.\n\n\"It certainly looks like the race is Ciatterelli's to lose at this point -- although, of course, in a primary, anything can happen,\" Bowen said.","summary":"New Jersey is set to hold gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly-contested primaries set for next month.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/new-jersey-governor-race-heats-ahead-primary-trumps/story?id=122079421","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/24dbf47a-8542-4f4d-8325-993d9ab11129/nj-gov-candidates-ap-jef-250519_1747659302542_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 19:07:52","author":"Brittany Shepherd,Emily Chang,Halle Troadec,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Brittany Shepherd","Emily Chang","Halle Troadec","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.098},{"id":324227532,"title":"Barabak: Antonio Villaraigosa is dying to run against Kamala Harris for governor. Here's why","text":"If Kamala Harris runs for California governor, the job is essentially hers for the taking. So goes the common wisdom. After all, she's a household name, which is no small consideration in a state as vast and politically inattentive as California. She has a coast-to-coast fundraising base and a record of winning statewide contests going back to 2010, when she was first elected attorney general. Who better, supporters say, to engage President Trump than the former prosecutor who whipped him in their one debate and only just lost the popular vote after being thrust overnight into a drastically truncated campaign? Antonio Villaraigosa isn't buying that for a second. Unlike others in the crowded race for governor, who are likely to drop out if Harris jumps in, L.A.'s former mayor said he's not budging. In fact, Villaraigosa insists he wants Harris to run — just so he can beat her and, he says, send an anti-elitist message to those Democrats who have their noses in the air rather than eyes fixed on hard-pressed voters and their myriad frustrations. \"I think she's been OK that we've been a party of just people that drive a Tesla and not a Toyota pickup, or ride a bus like my mother did,\" Villaraigosa said. \"I think she has no idea what it means to buy a carton of eggs and spend $12 at Ralph's.\" Harris is \"the face of that party,\" he went on, warming to the heat of his smoldering rhetoric. \"The party that thinks that people that don't have a college education are stupid. The party that believes that ... people voted for Trump just because he's a great used-car salesman and not because what he was selling resonated with people that work every day. The people who shower after work. Not before.\" As Harris uses the summer to decide her future — retiring from politics or running again for president being other options — no Democrat has been as brash and bold as Villaraigosa when it comes to assailing the putative front-runner and erstwhile leader of the national party. Earlier this week, he accused Harris and Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra of helping cover up President Biden's decline in office, seizing on the scandal fueled by a new book, \"Original Sin,\" that offered details of Biden's eroding mental and physical state. \"She could say she didn't know,\" Villaraigosa said, elaborating on that initial volley during a lengthy conversation. \"They can't prove that she did. But last time I looked, she had lunch with him pretty regularly ... She had to have seen what the world [saw] over time and particularly in that debate. The notion that she didn't? Come on. Who's going to buy that?\" That sort of talk is more typical of, say, Fox News than a candidate bidding for the support of fellow Democrats. Villaraigosa, a former labor leader who's gotten crossways with teacher unions among other party mainstays, professed not to care. If anything, he said, he's been encouraged by the response. \"For every one of those people\" — upset by Villaraigosa's remarks — \"there are three of them, maybe not as high up among Democrats, who are saying the same damn thing. That's why this got so much traction ... Since Vietnam, people don't believe in government anymore. They don't believe in their leaders. And every time we lie or misrepresent ... [or] hide the truth from them, their support and their belief in our institutions\" diminishes. Harris would have plenty of time to push back on Villaraigosa's depiction, should she choose to run. In the meantime, what's notable is his eagerness to take on the former vice president, positioning himself as the most vocal and assertive of her potential gubernatorial rivals. Others have taken a few pokes. “No one should be waiting to lead,\" former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter told The Times' Seema Mehta after entering the contest in March. Becerra echoed that sentiment when he announced his candidacy in April. “Watching what’s unfolding before our eyes made it clear this is not a time to sit on the sidelines,” Becerra said. But that's comparatively weak tea. \"If she wants to come in the race, she should come in now,\" Villaraigosa taunted. \"Let's debate. What are the challenges facing our state? Where are the opportunities? Where do we meld them together? How do we make this a better state for our kids?\" During the 40-minute phone conversation, starting in his car and finishing after Villaraigosa arrived home in Los Angeles, he toggled between criticisms of Harris and statements of good will toward a one-time political ally. The two have known each other, he said, since the mid-1990s, when Villaraigosa was a freshman assemblyman in Sacramento and Harris was dating then-Speaker Willie Brown. He supported her run for attorney general — \"I did three press conferences\" as L.A. mayor — and was quick to back her as soon as Biden stepped aside last summer and Harris became the Democratic nominee. \"I supported her,\" he said. \"I got behind her. Her husband\" — former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff — \"has thanked me a number of times when he's seen me in person.\" The disagreement now, Villaraigosa said, is over the direction of a party he sees unmoored from its history as a champion of the middle and working classes and too beholden to interest groups that make up its patchwork coalition. Harris, he suggested, is the personification of that disconnect from Democratic tradition. \"At the end of the day, what I'm arguing for is, let's get to the place where we're focused on getting things done and focused on common sense,\" Villaraigosa said, citing, among issues, his support for Proposition 36, the anti-crime measure that voters overwhelming approved last November. The vice president, he noted, refused to take a position. But don't, he said before hanging up, take his attacks on Harris the wrong way. \"This isn't personal,\" Villaraigosa insisted. It's just politics.","summary":"The former L.A. mayor says Harris personifies a Democratic Party that's lost its way.

BLOOD\nAP Political Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Many of Kamala Harris’ supporters and detractors alike think she’d have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.\n\nThere are several reasons for Harris to make a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: “I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nNewsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, “if she runs.”\n\nTo run for governor, “you have to have a burning ‘Why?’ ” Newsom said on the “Next Up with Mark Halperin” podcast.\n\n“And if you can’t enunciate that, the answer is ‘No,'” Newsom added. “Why the hell would you want this job?”\n\nHere are some reasons why she might want it—and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nPro: She can skip a fractious 2028 primary\n\nHarris would have to convince national Democrats that she’s the face of the party’s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She’s also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump’s agenda in Washington.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.\n\nBut the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, “Who is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?” Burton said.\n\nCould Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.\n\n“She’s had her chance,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.\n\n“Voters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,” Green added. “That’s why Kamala Harris lost, and it’s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.”\n\nPro: California governor might be a safer bet\n\nHarris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn’t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world’s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.\n\nShe would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California’s tussles with Trump—the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance—while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.\n\nIn her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals under Trump.\n\nThe contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nIt’s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.\n\nDemocratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party’s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.\n\nWith multiple election wins in California, “there is just more certainty,” Salazar said. “I think she’s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn’t solidified” with the primary more than a year away.\n\nCon: Will voters welcome her back?\n\nHow will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?\n\nRepublican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It’s unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses—Biden was one example.\n\nAs for governor, “the California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,” Madden added.\n\nCon: She won’t necessarily run against a Republican in November\n\nUnlike many other states, California doesn’t automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.\n\nThe state’s open primary system has tormented many candidates—critics call it the “jungle primary.” All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nThe system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year’s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats—U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.\n\nBut Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she’d have faced in a 2028 bid.\n\nSan Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)\n\nWhile Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted.

Resentment also has grown towards King, especially after she joined Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez in a heavily touted, 11-minute ride aboard one of billionaire Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin space rockets, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n“People don’t want to say it out loud in the office but the entire space debacle really hurt us,” a staffer at “60 Minutes” told the Daily Mail. “Gayle being part of that is not a good look for our brand.”\n\nIt’s true that CBS Mornings’ coverage of the April 14 space ride gave the show a rare first-place ratings finish. But King’s participation also became a source of controversy over questions of whether the self-styled “journalist” had violated network’s own code of ethics by accepting a freebie from a billionaire who is trying to curry favor with Trump. King, Perry and Sanchez also were mocked for calling themselves “astronauts” and “crew” members, as they claimed they were making a “historic” statement about female empowerment because the passengers were all women.\n\nKing, in particular, was ridiculed for displaying celebrity cluelessness and hubris by insisting that the media call their ride a “flight.”\n\n“I really resent that people are calling it a ride,” King said when confronted by a TMZ reported outside CBS’s Manhattan studios the day after the Blue Origin spectacle.\n\nKing also bristled at the notion that the ride was a “P.R. stunt.” She argued that it had an important scientific component for the future of space exploration and likened it to the truly historic 1961 flight taken by original Mercury 7 astronaut Alan Shepard, who became the first American in space.\n\nLike many in the public, others at CBS thought differently of the Blue Origin situation. “I think a lot of people resent Gayle for that. I know I do,” the “60 Minutes” staffer said. There was “a general sense of embarrassment,” a CBS producer told the Daily Mail. “I almost feel like apologizing when I tell people where I work. I hate it here,” the producer also said.\n\nA former TV news reporter who once worked for her good friend Oprah Winfrey, King started co-anchoring “CBS Mornings” in 2012, alongside Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell.\n\nBut CBS is in upheaval for many more reasons than King’s Blue Origin spectacle. Paramount is trying to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump against CBS News’s legendary “60 Minutes” investigative news show. Trump claims that the show’s interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in October was deceitfully edited to make her sound better. The company has denied the allegations, and legal experts say Paramount could prevail in the lawsuit, The Guardian reported. \n\nBut Paramount reportedly wants to settle the case as it pursues a multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance. More upheaval came Monday when CBS News boss Wendy McMahon stepped down from her job, having voiced her opposition to Paramount setting the lawsuit, as the New York Post reported. \n\n“It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,” McMahon said in a memo. But McMahon also was faulted for her controversial efforts to overhaul the evening news, while ratings for King’s show remain “abysmal,” the New York Post said.\n\nWith everything going on at CBS, King’s future is not the biggest priority even though she is one of the network’s marquee stars. But the New York Post reported that she must know it would be “a miracle” for her to score another big, one-year deal, especially if Skydance is in charge. For that reason, King is exploring her options, with another source telling the New York Post: “Gayle sees the writing on the wall.”","summary":"King faces 'resentment' at CBS for her massive salary and her participation in Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space ride on April 14: \"Gayle being part of that is not a good look for our brand'","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/23/gayle-king-could-lose-job-cbs-woes-blue-origin-space-debacle/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151780992.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 17:41:03","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":324210038,"title":"The number of hate groups in the US is shrinking — but their voice is growing louder","text":"The number of white nationalist, hate, and anti-government groups in the U.S. declined slightly in 2024, not because their influence is fading.\n\nMany believe that racist ideologies and narratives of Christian persecution are becoming more accepted in government and mainstream conversations - allowing their voice to grow while the number of groups shrinks. \n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported a 5 percent decrease in hate and extremist groups in its annual “Year in Hate and Extremism” report released Thursday.\n\nThe nonprofit organization attributes the decline to a reduced need for formal organization, as hateful beliefs have increasingly permeated politics, education, and general society. According to the report, the influence is evident in efforts to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, restrict books and protest drag story hours.\n\n“After years of courting politicians and chasing power, hard-right groups are now fully infiltrating our politics andenactingtheir dangerous ideology into law,” said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the SPLC. “Extremists at all levels of government are using cruelty, chaos and constant attacks on communities and our democracy to make us feel powerless. We cannot surrender to fear. It is up to all of us to organize against the forces of hate and tyranny. This report offers data that is essential to understanding the landscape of hate and helping communities fight for the multiracial, inclusive democracy we deserve.”\n\nIn 2024, there were 533 active hate groups, including those promoting anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-Muslim views. This figure has been gradually decreasing since peaking at a record high of 1,021 in 2018, according to the report.\n\n\"The trends have slightly sort of gone up and down but let's just say generally, since our tracking, have increased. And that's not just on a total numbers level but also on a per capita,\" said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project.\n\nAccording to the Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of anti-government groups increased to 838 in 2024. These groups, which include militias and self-identified sovereign citizens, often view the federal government as \"tyrannical.\"\n\nThe SPLC also noted a growing presence of male supremacist hate groups, documenting seven new ones in 2024 for a total of 16. These groups promote misogynistic views and rigid gender roles. \n\nTheir increased visibility happened in a historic election year with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris becoming the first woman of color nominated for president by a major political party.\n\nWhile not directly attributing it to Harris’s candidacy, SPLC researchers found “intense vilification” of her in white supremacist chat rooms, along with claims that women are unqualified for leadership. \n\nAdditionally, some far-right groups promote the belief that white Christian culture is under threat due to a so-called \"demographic crisis,\" including declining birth rates.\n\n\"Politicians, pundits and provocateurs on the right have turned toward demonic language to tar those who disagree with them,\" the report states.\n\nLast year’s report found record levels of white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ groups in 2023. It detailed how far-right organizations sought to undermine democracy through disinformation, conspiracy theories, and threats against election workers. \n\nThe report also highlighted how advocates of Christian supremacy used these issues to rally support for authoritarian goals.\n\nThe SPLC is a liberal advocacy group that tracks hate groups, files justice-related lawsuits, and runs educational programs to combat prejudice. It has faced criticism from conservatives and legal challenges over its classification of certain organizations as hate groups.","summary":"In 2024, there were 533 active hate groups, including those promoting anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-Muslim views","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-hate-groups-declining-2024-report-b2756824.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/23/15/48/Untitled-design-(1).jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5L2R6GMf-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-23 17:20:55","author":"Erin Keller","authors":["Erin Keller"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.357},{"id":324254924,"title":"PBS News Hour Finally Turns to Tapper & Thompson, Challenges the Term 'Coverup'","text":"Surprise!

The problem was that, if you're doing reporting, you need sources to be honest. And a lot of Democrats basically did not want to speak up because they feared it would hurt Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris and help Donald Trump.\n\nBennett also asked: “You spoke to 200 Democratic insiders over the course of your reporting…More than 200. How did you vet their motivations to make sure that they weren't engaging in sort of retrospective blame-shifting after the fact?”\n\nTapper said that was a “great question” and noted “one thing that almost all of them copped to was the fact that this was a disaster, it was hidden from the American people and that it can't happen again. I think a lot of them felt they were unburdening themselves. A lot of them felt they regretted not talking to reporters ahead of time.”\n\nBut how aggressively were liberal reporters demanding they talk about Biden’s decline? Thompson suggested on NewsNation that Biden staffers were \"amazed\" at how most journalists were pushovers. \n\nBennett’s closing three questions were pro-Biden. First, he read the official Biden statement on the book, claiming \"There is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover-up or conspiracy.\" \n\nThe inevitable \"but what about Trump\" question was there: \n\nWhat's your response to [leftist] critics who say that this book punches at the wrong target at the wrong time, that focusing on Biden's decline distracts from Trump's threat to democracy, his authoritarian rhetoric, his attempt to dismantle institutions he doesn't like, so on and so forth?\n\nTapper shot back: \"All the stuff we cover every day.\" Especially on CNN!\n\nThen came the give-the-cancer-man-a-break question: \"On the eve of this book's release, the former president announced that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer. There are those who feel this is hitting a man when he's down, he's no longer in office. Why push forward with this?\"\n\nTapper insisted: \"Yes, look, obviously our hearts go out to the Bidens.

Eleven percent of Democrats identified her as the party’s leader.

The book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" said that Biden stumbled through filming campaign videos so much that the footage was ultimately deemed \"unusable.\" The nonfiction book was published Tuesday and is authored by journalists Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios. BIDEN FAMILY MISLED PUBLIC, CONCEALED DETAILS ON SON BEAU'S CANCER DIAGNOSIS, NEW BOOK SAYS In one case, Biden’s team sought to film a video for the campaign for ads on television in a high school gym where people could ask questions like they would at a town hall meeting. \"The campaign was trying to make it look like the president was out there taking off-the-cuff questions from voters in public,\" the book said. \"But the event was closed to reporters, and the campaign had the full list of questions that people would ask.\" However, Biden had so much \"trouble\" getting through the questions that his team decided to scrap the footage. While some attributed challenges to poor lighting in the gym, the book said that others identified Biden as the real problem. BIDEN MADE HARRIS CAMPAIGN A ‘NIGHTMARE,' DESTROYED HER CHANCES BY STAYING IN 2024 RACE TOO LONG, AIDES CHARGE Similarly, when groups requested a five-minute video address of Biden for keynote events, the White House would work to provide a one- or two-minute video, the book said. Still, given the time constraint, Biden \"often couldn’t make it through one or two minutes without botching a line or two,\" according to the book. \"The man could not speak,\" one person familiar with the effort said, according to the book. The person said Biden faced an \"inability to find words, to remember what he was saying, to stay on one train of thought.\" BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS \"Aides would sometimes make the videos in slow motion to blur the reality of how slowly he actually walked,\" the person said. \"If he was off, editing footage in a way that cast him in the best light would require hours of work.\" The book also pinned the blame on Biden for then-Vice President Kamala Harris' unsuccessful run in the 2024 election after Biden took so long to exit the race. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008 and a senior advisor on Harris’ 2024 campaign, said that Harris' campaign was \"a f---ing nightmare\" because of Biden.

The book is riddled with falsehoods.\" Biden's team has also challenged the material in \"Original Sin,\" which chronicles the 2024 election cycle and how Biden’s team allegedly plotted a cover-up to hide just how severely his mental faculties had declined. \"There is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover up or conspiracy,\" a Biden spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Nowhere do they show that our national security was threatened or where the President wasn’t otherwise engaged in the important matters of the Presidency. In fact, Joe Biden was an effective President who led our country with empathy and skill.\" The book is one of several that detail Biden’s decision to run in 2024 and details the deterioration of his cognitive function.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden struggled to get through filming campaign videos, or quick, filmed keynote addresses for various groups during the 2024 campaign due to his declining health, according to a new book.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-struggled-film-2024-campaign-videos-amid-declining-health-new-book-claims-the-man-could-not-speak","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/9f9b64dc-biden.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 16:35:54","author":"Diana Stancy","authors":["Diana Stancy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.454},{"id":324210848,"title":"Everything Changed After George Floyd. Five Years Later, What Have We Learned?","text":"It’s been five years since George Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in the Spring of 2020. Though far from novel, this particular act of state violence shocked the world and ignited one of the largest protest movements in modern history. In my latest video, I argue that this moment was much bigger than Floyd; from the horrors of the Middle Passage to the chains of mass incarceration, from slave codes to Jim Crow, the full weight of America’s long-standing commitment to anti-Blackness bore down on that moment and the months of protest that followed.\n\nPeople were energized: books written about Black authors topped the New York Times‘ bestseller lists, corporations pledged billions of dollars toward racial justice, and diversity, equity and inclusion practitioners were in high demand. From London to Lagos to Los Angeles, the world seemed to unite under one banner: Black Lives really do Matter.\n\nBut five years later, it’s worth asking: What actually changed?\n\nThe answer is complicated. In many ways, the mass awakening of 2020 gave way to a powerful retrenchment over the four years that followed.\n\nA year after the world marched for George Floyd, conservative politicians and pundits began rallying against so-called “Critical Race Theory”an academic field of study based on the honest examination of racism’s historical and present-day impact on society—and twisted it into a catch-all for anything conservatives didn’t like. Within a couple of years, Republican-led book bans would target bestselling titles that once spurred on a America’s “racial reckoning.”\n\nNowhere is that clearer than in the debate over of police reform: the most substantive policy demand of the Black Lives Matter protests. Despite efforts by lawmakers like Senator Cory Booker and then-Senator Kamala Harris to introduce police reform legislation as early as June 2020, Congress ultimately failed to pass a bill curbing chokeholds, no-knock warrants, or qualified immunity.\n\nInstead, in many cities, police budgets grew and a dozen states have broken ground on large-scale police training centers — dubbed “Cop Cities” by critics.\n\nThe penultimate act of America’s racial retrenchment came in the fall of 2024 when Donald Trump, buoyed by replacement theory fears and anti-“woke” campaign ads, was reelected president of the United States of America.\n\nWe’ve seen the rapid deterioration of civil rights protections, a commitment to arming police with surplus military gear, and the cancellation of Biden-era federal investigations into the police departments involved in the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. All while his most vocal supporters call for a federal pardon for Derek Chauvin, the officer convicted of murdering Floyd.\n\nYet, despite all of this, I think there is still reason for hope.\n\nIf 2020 was The Awakening, and the last four years have been The Retrenchment, then 2025 may mark the beginning of a new phase: The Reevaluation.\n\nI think the 2020 BLM protests were about bolstering Black social and political power, and despite all of the attacks that effort has endured, Black people aren’t giving up on it any time soon. \n\nIn Louisiana, Black voters helped defeat a constitutional amendment that would have made it easier to try children as adults — a move that many viewed as a veiled attempt to deepen mass incarceration.\n\nWe’re seeing it in economic protest too, with Black consumers leading boycotts of major corporations like Target, disrupting profit margins and forcing boardroom conversations.\n\nAnd we’re seeing it in grassroots organizing. Activists like Angela Rye and journalist Joy Reid are crisscrossing the country on the State of the People Power Tour, mobilizing and educating Black communities on how to build lasting political power from the ground up.\n\nSo, five years later, when we ask what’s changed, maybe the most honest answer is that we changed; and that might be the most powerful change of all.","summary":"It’s been five years since George Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in the Spring of 2020.

He said he had not read the document, nor did he intend to. Yet less than six months into his second stay in the White House, the president and his administration have initiated or completed 42% of Project 2025's agenda, according to a tracking project that identified more than 300 specific action items in the 922-page document. The Project 2025 Tracker is run by two volunteers who \"believe in the importance of transparent, detailed analysis,\" according to its website. Of all the action items, nearly a quarter are related to the environment through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Forest Service, and the departments of the Interior, Commerce, and Energy. Further, it seems the environment is a high priority for the Trump administration, which has initiated or completed about 70% of Project 2025's environmental agenda — or roughly two-thirds — according to a Times analysis of the tracked items. That includes Project 2025 action items like rolling back air and water quality regulations; canceling funds for clean energy projects and environmental justice grants; laying off scientists and researchers in related fields; and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, an agreement among nearly 200 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming. When asked about this overlap, the administration continued to downplay any connection between the president and Project 2025. \"No one cared about Project 2025 when they elected President Trump in November 2024, and they don't care now,\" White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said in an email. \"President Trump is implementing the America First agenda he campaigned on to free up wasteful DEI spending for cutting-edge scientific research, roll back radical climate regulations, and restore America's energy dominance while ensuring Americans have clean air and clean water.\" Project 2025 refers to climate change as an \"alarm industry\" used to support a radical left ideology and agenda. \"Mischaracterizing the state of our environment generally and the actual harms reasonably attributable to climate change specifically is a favored tool that the Left uses to scare the American public into accepting their ineffective, liberty-crushing regulations, diminished private property rights, and exorbitant costs,\" it says in a chapter about the EPA. The author of that chapter, Mandy Gunasekara, served as the EPA's chief of staff during Trump's first administration. In the document, she recommends that the president undertake a number of actions to reform the EPA, including downsizing the agency, eliminating its Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, and instituting a pause and review of grants — all of which Trump has done. That same chapter also recommends that the president undermine California's ability to set strict vehicle emission standards, which Trump vowed to do shortly after taking office; the Senate this week voted to revoke California's rights to enact policy on the issue. Gunasekara did not respond to a request for comment. Matthew Sanders, acting deputy director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford, said these and other Project 2025-mandated moves could have far-reaching ramifications. He noted that 11 other states had chosen to follow California's emission rules. \"What California does impacts what the rest of the nation does,\" Sanders said. \"In that sense ... decisions about how to effectuate the Clean Air Act mandates are technology-forcing for much of the nation, and isolating California and eliminating its ability to do that will have profound consequences.\" The EPA isn't the only agency affected by environmental policy changes mirrored in Project 2025. The Trump administration has also directed the Department of Energy to expand oil and gas leasing in Alaska, eliminate considerations for upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions, and expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas projects, all of which were recommendations outlined in the document. The Interior Department, which oversees U.S. national parks and public lands, has seen rollbacks of at least a dozen of President Biden's executive orders that prioritized addressing climate change, as well as the termination of a Biden-era policy to protect 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030, also known as the 30x30 plan. In April, Trump issued an executive order opening up 112.5 million acres of national forestland to industrial logging, as outlined on page 308 of Project 2025. The president said the move — which will touch all 18 of California's national forests — is intended to increase domestic timber supplies, reduce wildfire risk and create jobs. Sanders said actions on public lands are particularly consequential, not only for the extraction of resources but also for protected species and their habitats. The president has already taken Project 2025-mandated steps to lessen protections for marine life and birds, and has called for narrowing protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act. He also expressed concern about Trump's Jan. 20 proposal to revise or rescind National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations that require federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions — a step recommended on page 60 of Project 2025. While the president described NEPA and other rules as \"burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations\" that limit American jobs and stymie economic growth, Sanders said such framing is an oversimplification that can make the environment a scapegoat for other administrative goals. \"When we make these decisions in a thoughtful, careful, deliberate way, we actually can have jobs and economic development and environmental protection,\" he said. \" I don't think that those things are inherently opposed, but the administration, I think, gets some mileage out of suggesting that they are.\" Indeed, the Commerce Department, which houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service and other climate-related entities, has also seen changes that follow Project 2025's playbook. The document describes the agency as \"one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.\" In recent months, the president has made moves to \"break up\" NOAA — a directive also found on page 674 of the Project 2025 document — including laying off hundreds of staffers, closing several offices and proposing significant cuts to its research arm. The administration has similarly taken Project 2025-recommended steps to shift disaster relief responsibilities away from the federal government and onto the states; loosen energy efficiency standards for appliances; and rescind USAID policies that address climate change and help countries transition away from fossil fuels, among others. These are some of nearly 70 environmental action items identified in the Project 2025 Tracker, of which 47 are already completed or in progress less than 150 days into President Trump's second term. Tracking the administration's progress is a somewhat subjective process, in part because many of the directives have come through executive orders or require multiple steps to complete. Additionally, many goals outlined in Project 2025 are indirect or implied and therefore not included in the tracker, according to Adrienne Cobb, one of its creators. Cobb told The Times she read through the entire document and extracted only \"explicit calls to action, or recommendations where the authors clearly state that something should be done.\" \"My goal was for the tracker to reflect the authors' intentions using their own words wherever possible,\" she said. \"By focusing on direct language and actionable items, I tried to create a list that's accurate and accountable to the source material.\" Though the Trump administration continues to deny any connection to Project 2025, the creators of the massive tome were always clear about their presidential intentions. \"This volume — the Conservative Promise — is the opening salvo of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project,\" Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts wrote in its forward. \"Its 30 chapters lay out hundreds of clear and concrete policy recommendations for White House offices, Cabinet departments, Congress, and agencies, commissions, and boards.\"","summary":"The Trump administration says it isn't connected to Project 2025.

Even more folks were bracing themselves to be kicked out of the job. However, a federal judge has come down with a ruling to get in front of it which is great news for 10 percent of Black federal workers in the state.\n\nJudge Susan Illston of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order to protect up to 22 agencies — including veteran affairs, housing and urban development as well as the treasury — from feeling the wrath of Trump’s layoff sweep, per The New York Times. About 37 percent of Black federal workers are veterans, per The Economic Policy Institute.\n\nThe order also says the administration is not allowed to shut down the offices all together nor take on any orders from Elon Musk’s DOGE to cut programs. The judge straight-up accused Trump of not following the law. \n\n“Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress’s mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress,” wrote Illston in her ruling.\n\nThe order also calls for the reinstatement of probationary employees who were placed on administrative leave and addresses “reduction force” which has pushed thousands of federal employees on administrative leave, awaiting eventual termination. \n\n“I’m concerned about the effect of all of this litigation on the lives of the people who are being affected and being hired and rehired and furloughed. And I think we need to preserve as much order as we can for those people,” said Judge Illston Thursday during a hearing, via The Times. \n\nMind you, this isn’t the first time this particular judge clocked Trump at the door. Two weeks ago, Illston issued a two-week temporary restraining order, forcing the Trump administration to pause its layoff marathon, per CBS News. \n\nTrump’s administration requested the Supreme Court overrule the California judge but their ruling hasn’t come down yet. \n\nAs The Root previously reported, since Trump’s first day in office he’s been signing executives orders left and right to dismantle the DEI programs built into federal agencies under the Biden administration which led to its own set of mass layoffs. As a result, Black and brown were disproportionately affected. Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris massively expanded the federal government’s DEI bureaucracy, which Trump is vehemently going after.\n\nJudge Illston’s move is only latest lawsuit to come against the Trump administration as Musk continues to encourage the White House to clean house and essentially, muddle down government agencies deemed a waste of money. A federal judge in Boston just put his hand up, barring the administration from firing half of the Department of Education workforce, per ABC News. Trump can keep pushing if he wants to, but it’s obvious he’ll keep having pushback.","summary":"As of March, over 58,000 federal employees were laid off due to President Donald Trump’s war on government agencies.

Recent Economist/YouGov polling across the US, completed on May 9-12, shows 51% think the country is on the wrong track, while only 45% have a favourable impression of his job as president. On inflation and prices in the shops, only 35% approve of his handling of this policy.\n\nTrump seems to be scoring particularly badly with young voters. Around 62% of young people (18 to 29s) have an unfavourable opinion of the president, compared with 53% of the over-65s.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration continues to pursue an agenda to close down, or shackle, much of the media it considers not on his side.\n\nFunding for national public service radio NPR and television PBS, as well as the global news service Voice of America, is under threat. Some national news outlets are under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for their coverage. \n\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences.\n\nIn a speech in March, Trump said broadcasters CNN and MSNBC, and some newspapers he didn’t name “literally write 97.6% bad about me”. He added: “It has to stop. It has to be illegal.”\n\nThe Trump team clearly see the role of the media as important to establishing and retaining support, and have taken steps to shake up White House coverage – including by changing who can attend the White House press pool.\n\nAbout seven in ten members of the American public say they are following the news for updates on the Trump administration. It is interesting, therefore, to consider the role of the media in influencing Trump’s popularity, and insights can be found in the massive US Cooperative Election Study, conducted during the presidential contest last year. \n\nThat survey showed 57% of Americans had watched TV news in the previous 24 hours. Around 81% had used social media during the same period, but only 20% had used it to comment on politics.\n\nThere is a lot of attention being paid to fake news on the internet, which is helping to cause polarisation in the US. But when it comes to news about politics, TV coverage is still very important for most Americans. \n\nThe survey asked respondents about the TV news channels they watched, and Fox News came out on top with 47% of the viewers. ABC came second with 37%, and CBS and CNN tied on 35%. Fox News is Trump’s favourite TV station, with its rightwing populist agenda and regular output of Trump-friendly news.\n\nRelationship between Trump voters and Fox News’s audience in 2024 US presidential election:\n\nThe Cooperative Election Study had 60,000 respondents, which provides reasonably sized samples in each of the 50 states. The Trump vote varied quite a lot across states, with only 34% of voters in Maryland supporting him, compared with 72% in Wyoming. The electoral college formally decides the results of presidential elections, and this is based on states – so, looking at voting in this way can be quite revealing.\n\nThe connection between watching Fox News and Trump’s vote share can be seen in the chart above. It varies from 21% who watched the channel in Vermont to 60% in West Virginia.\n\nVermont is represented in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist from a radical political tradition, and only 32% voted for Trump there. In contrast, West Virginia is part of the rust belt of impoverished states hit by deindustrialisation and the decline of the coal mining industry, and 71% voted for Trump there.\n\nWe can use a regression model (which looks at the relationship between variables) to predict support for Trump using key measures that drive the vote share for Trump in each state. The model uses three variables to predict the results with 95% accuracy, which means while not perfect, it gives a very accurate prediction of Trump’s vote.\n\nNot surprisingly, partisanship – that is, the percentage of registered Republicans in each state – is one of the key metrics. In addition, ideology – the percentage of respondents who say they are conservatives – is another.\n\nPerhaps more surprisingly, the third important predictor is viewership of Fox News. The relationship between watching the channel and voting for Trump is very strong at the state level. Also, the more time people spend watching the channel, the more likely they are to have voted for Trump. \n\nImpact of key factors on Trump voting in 2024 US election:\n\nThis chart calculates the relationship between watching Fox News and other factors and the strength of a state’s support for Trump in 2024. If a variable is a perfect predictor of Trump voting, it would score 1.0 on the scale. If it is a perfect non-predictor, it would score 0.\n\nSo, the most important predictor of being a Trump voter was the presence of conservatives in a state, followed by the percentage of registered Republicans, and the third was watching Fox News. A high score on all three meant greater support for Trump. \n\nTo illustrate this, 45% of Texans considered themselves conservatives, 33% were registered Republicans, and 51% watched Fox News. Using these measures, the model predicts that 57% would vote for Trump. In fact, 56% voted for him in that state in 2024. So, while the prediction was not perfect, it was very close. \n\nA similar predictive model can be used to forecast former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s vote shares by state. In her case, we need four variables to predict the results with 95% accuracy – the percentage of registered Democrats, liberals and moderates in a state, and also Fox News viewership.\n\nNot surprisingly in Harris’s case, the relationship between Fox News viewing and voting is strongly negative (correlation = -0.64). When viewership was high, the Harris vote was low.\n\nYears ago, the “fairness doctrine” used to mandate US broadcasters to fairly reflect different viewpoints on controversial issues in their coverage. Candidates for public office were entitled to equal air time. \n\nBut this rule was removed by the FCC in 1987, and has led to an era of some broadcasters becoming far more partisan. The FCC decision followed a period of debate and challenges to the fairness doctrine. This led to its abolition under Ronald Reagan, the Republican president who inspired Project 2025 – the document that in turn appears to be inspiring the Trump government’s policy agenda. \n\nWhen the Trump era is over, incumbent Democrats are going to have to repair US institutions that this administration has damaged. If they want to do something about the polarisation of US politics, they may also need to restore the fairness doctrine. \n\nHad it not been removed in the first place, it is possible that Harris would have won the 2024 presidential election, since Fox News would not exist in its present form. Whatever happens next, the US media is likely to play an important role.","summary":"Donald Trump has lost popularity in the past few months – but how much is his voting base being maintained by media support?","url":"https://theconversation.com/as-trumps-ratings-slide-polling-data-reveals-the-scale-of-fox-newss-influence-on-us-politics-256274","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668483/original/file-20250516-56-4idmt7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C215%2C8021%2C4010&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 16:00:44","author":"Department of Government,Paul Whiteley,Professor,University of Essex","authors":["Department of Government","Paul Whiteley","Professor","University of Essex"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.274},{"id":324254926,"title":"Liberal Bias By Omission: Polls Moving Toward America in the 'Right Direction'","text":"The national media use polls the way they deploy all kinds of facts.

(Photo by Matthew Busch/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe Secret Service has paid Trump’s political committees about $13 million for air travel since 2016, a spokesperson confirmed to Forbes, to cover the costs of having the security detail travel with Trump.\n\nFederal Election Commission data from Trump’s committees, which runs through Dec. 31, list $10.4 million in payments and about another $5 million in outstanding bills, and the Secret Service says the difference probably involves invoices paid after Dec. 31 as well as those it might not have processed yet.\n\nTrump’s political entities have paid his aviation company, Tag Air, $18 million for flights since 2016.\n\nSecret Service payments to past presidential campaigns include $830,000 to Kamala Harris, $3.1 million to Joe Biden, $8.8 million to Hillary Clinton, $4.1 million to Barack Obama, $1.8 million to Mitt Romney and $2.6 million to John McCain.\n\nThose earlier campaigns, however, do not appear to have passed the funds on to companies the candidates own.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House declined to comment on the record, while a representative from the Trump Organization did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump maintains control over and can profit from his businesses through a revocable trust—a structure he also used during his first term—of which he is both the sole donor and sole beneficiary. The trustee is Donald Trump Jr. Through his trust, Trump owns 100% of Tag Air. In an April 2025 regulatory filing in the United Kingdom, the Trump Organization confirmed Trump still oversees his business interests.\n\nWhy Does The Secret Service Need To Pay Campaigns?\n\nThe Secret Service reimburses campaigns for travel when agents accompany protected candidates (it is also legal for campaigns to patronize the candidate’s businesses). “In such cases, the agency reimburses associated costs in accordance with federal regulations,” a spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement. “Once reviewed and approved, invoices are processed and paid.” While the agency sets rates, the Government Accountability Office reported in 2018 that payments should not exceed the cost of first-class airfare—and found that Trump’s 2016 campaign submitted incomplete and duplicate invoices, which the agency paid without dispute.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nIt’s unclear whether all of the Secret Service payments covered flights aboard Trump’s personal aircraft or if some involved planes chartered from other providers.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nTrump is no longer flying on Tag Air—as president, he uses the government-funded Air Force One—so this revenue stream for Tag Air is closed. But Trump still has some money coming his way: his political committees owe Tag Air $160,000, according to FEC filings. The next round of disclosures, which could reveal new payments, is due at the end of July..\n\nWhile Trump profiting from his campaigns and presidencies has been a decade-long story, the scale has exploded during his second term, fueled by three new ways—Trump Media & Technology Group, World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP meme coin—that allow supporters to buy into Trump-branded ventures with few concrete benefits in return. Thursday night, for example, Trump hosted a dinner at his D.C.-area golf club for top investors in his meme coin, a group who have collectively thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at his cryptocurrency.\n\n$33,846,072.69. That’s the total amount the Secret Service has paid to political committees since 2003, according to FEC records.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nTrump’s Boeing 757, the same jet often used on the campaign trail, was previously owned by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. Trump customized it with touches like 24-karat gold-plated seatbelt buckles.\n\nA 2024 report by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee found the Secret Service spent at least $1.4 million at Trump-owned properties during his first term—often paying above authorized per diem rates—and called that figure likely just a fraction of total agency spending at his businesses. For comparison, the agency paid Joe Biden about $172,000 between 2011 and 2023, largely for renting office space at his Wilmington, Delaware, home, with payments apparently ending in 2017, according to the Secret Service’s response to Forbes’ Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nForbes estimates Donald Trump’s net worth at approximately $5.3 billion, with the bulk of his wealth tied to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nFurther Viewing\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Businesses Hauled In $317,000 From RNC In March—Even As Crypto Ventures Soar (Forbes)\n\nTrump Store Debuts Merchandise Collection Pegged To Election Victory (Forbes)\n\nTrump Media Warns Of ‘Material Weakness’ In Financial Controls (Forbes)\n\nTrump’s New Jersey Golf Clubs Can Keep Selling Alcohol—For Now—Despite President’s Felony Conviction.

he stole it from the American people.\" \n\nAnother Democratic source says Biden may have been encouraged to run again, but the \"real culprit\" behind his choice to pursue a second term - and keep his health under wraps - was his \"own innate stubbornness and refusal to admit his obvious decline.\"\n\nThe source adds, \"He made the decision — and he'll have to live with the consequences.\"","summary":"A new book revealed Joe Biden's health is worse than known, and a top doctor warns he may have just six months to live after his prostate cancer diagnosis.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/joe-biden-health-book-doctor-staff-kill-claim/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/89lX4OTsE/0x0/radar-2025-05-23t111956726-1748013604883.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 15:40:07","author":"Juliane Pettorossi","authors":["Juliane Pettorossi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":324156040,"title":"Star Announces $100M Movie Studio Project in Texas: ‘Hollywood is Failing’","text":"Zachary Levi says Hollywood’s broken, so he’s taking his business – show business – elsewhere.\n\nThe 44-year-old actor, feeling sidelined by mainstream Hollywood over his resistance to align with progressive trends, is currently working on raising funds to establish a film studio in Austin, Texas. This studio aims to capitalize on movie industry policies tied to tariffs that former President Donald Trump has discussed.\n\nThe star of Chuck, during a Thursday interview with Variety, mentioned how the traditional studio model—already fundamentally shaken over the last decade by a troubled history of mismanaged power dynamics, swift technological advancements, and the rise of new business models—was essentially outdated even a century ago.\n\nThe American Underdog actor referred to silent film stars who collaborated over a hundred years ago to establish United Artists in 1919, addressing the subpar conditions prevalent in the entertainment sector at that time.\n\n‘Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and all those O.G.s knew it over 100 years ago,’ the Lake Charles, Louisiana native told the magazine. ‘Hollywood was broken then, and we needed a better system.’\n\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail’s new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. \n\nLevi added, ‘This industry is crumbling around us. In order for us to survive, we need to have a space for artists that will foster certified organic human-made content.’ \n\nLevi in 2008 posed with his Chuck costar Yvonne Strahovski and the then-star of NBC’s The Apprentice – now-President Trump – at an NBC Universal promotional event in 2008. He wound up hitting the campaign trail in support of Trump last summer. \n\nDailymail.com has reached out to Strahovski and her reps for comment on Levi’s plans and her run-in with the nascent U.S. president. \n\nLevi, who lives in Ventura, California with partner Maggie Keating, told Variety he’s been ostracized for his views on politics amid the turbulent timeframe.\n\n‘I know that there are people that would prefer not to work with me now because of my opinions,’ Levi told the outlet. ‘My team has let me know.’\n\nVariety reported that Levi nodded ‘in the direction of Beverly Hills, where his agents at UTA are headquartered’ when he made the remarks about professional alliances dissolving due to political disagreements.\n\n‘They haven’t given me any specific names, but there are people who prefer not to work with me at this time,’ Levi told the outlet. ‘And it’s unfortunate.’\n\nLevi said that he ‘knew that was probably going to happen’ and figured it into the calculus when making a series of public bold statements.\n\nLevi added that he ‘didn’t make this decision blindly or casually,’ as he’s landed in hot water at times for his views in support of President Trump, as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \n\nLevi’s ambitious plans were revealed nearly seven months after the actor was widely slammed after linking the COVID-19 vaccine to the death of Gavin Creel at 48, with fellow actor Norbert Leo Butz saying he was ‘utterly heartbroken’ by the move.\n\nWeeks prior to last fall’s presidential election, Levi posted a controversial one-hour rant on his Instagram October 22. \n\nIn it, he said he believed that Creel – his one-time costar in the Broadway revival of She Loves Me who died September 30 following a battle with cancer – ‘would be alive right now’ had he not gotten vaccinated.\n\nButz left a comment condemning the Shazam! star for mentioning Creel in his politically-charged statement,\n\n‘So incredibly disappointed you would politicize Gavin’s death,’ the Tony winner said. ‘Really tried to give you the benefit here. Made it halfway through, which was hard as hell. But was utterly heartbroken, as he would have been, that you felt the need to use his life and legacy to promote this awful platform.’ \n\nLevi endorsed Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris ahead of the election.\n\nTrump dominated with an electoral college total of 312 votes to Harris’ 226; according to the AP, Trump garnered 49.9 percent of the votes with 77,304,184 votes, while Harris had 75,019,616 votes accounting for 48.4 percent.\n\nIn his social media statement, Levi acknowledged there would be significant pushback to his words.\n\n‘I know that this is going to offend some people and make some people mad, and I wish it didn’t,’ Levi said. ‘So, a few weeks ago, my friend Gavin Creel died. He was 48 years old, and he was one of the healthiest people I knew.’\n\n‘You better believe that, with everything in me, I believe that if these COVID vaccinations were not forced on the American public, that the theaters weren’t being pushed and leveraged.’\n\nIn his statement, Levi said ‘people at the top’ forced those in the Broadway community, including producers and theater owners, to enforce vaccine mandates coming out of the pandemic.\n\n‘They knew the cost benefit of these shots, and it was garbage; guys, it was garbage,’ Levi said.\n\nHe added, ‘They knew that there would be plenty of side effects, including turbo cancers – they knew. ‘And I, without a shadow of a doubt, I believe that Gavin Creel would be alive right now – right f***ing now – he would still be alive if that stuff didn’t get put into his body.’\n\nLevi said he felt he was honoring Creel’s memory by ‘talking about’ the divisive issue.\n\nLevi faced criticism from a number of other social media users over trying to link Creel’s death to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOne user said in response, ‘Some people shouldn’t be allowed to talk. Shame on you for using Gavin Creel’s passing to spread misinformation.’\n\nAnother said, ‘I’ve been a fan since Chuck. I have to admit I’m terribly disappointed.’\n\nSaid one user: ‘This…. Was insane. I cannot believe you used Gavin’s passing to spread absolutely blatant misinformation. I think he would be incredibly disappointed in you. Like I’m sure much of the Broadway community now is.’\n\nOne put off fan added, Unfollowed … good luck with your new direct to DVD movie career.’\n\nSome fans lauded Levi for taking the risky career move in making a controversial statement in support of his core beliefs. \n\nOne said, ‘Good for you for standing up for what you believe in!’ while another added, ‘I don’t agree with you politically but I respect your bravery to voice your opinion.’\n\nAnother said, ‘Not even a Trump fan, (I’m DEFINITELY not a Kamala fan) but I absolutely give you respect for coming out in Hollywood and going against the tide!!! Been a fan since Chuck.’ \n\nSaid another user, ‘I am so proud that you are using your platform to go against Hollywood. Thank you for standing up for what is right. Sorry for the loss of your friend.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nZachary Levi says Hollywood&#8217;s broken, so he&#8217;s taking his business &#8211; show&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Star Announces $100M Movie Studio Project in Texas: &#8216;Hollywood is Failing&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/star-announces-100m-movie-studio-project-in-texas-hollywood-is-failing/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Star-plans-to-build-100M-movie-studio-in-TEXAS-Hollywood.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 15:22:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.125},{"id":324154696,"title":"Are Some Racist Slurs OK? ","text":"One reason why the public turned on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was its insistence that roughly 70% of the country was stereotyped as victimizers by virtue of their skin color. \n\nIn contrast, the other “diverse” 30% were de facto considered the victimized. \n\nIn such absurd binaries, the Left returned to the old “one-drop” rule of the antebellum South, suggesting that anyone with any nonwhite ancestry was a minority victim. \n\nAnd once that Marxist-inspired dichotomy was institutionalized, a corollary was established that the self-declared racially oppressed cannot themselves be racist oppressors. \n\nBut human nature is universal and transcends race. \n\nOne lamentable characteristic of our species is that we are all prone to excess and crudity if not deterred, especially once civilizational restraint is lost. \n\nWe are now witnessing examples of what follows when antiwhite stereotyping and racism are given a pass—as long as the purveyors can claim their victimhood entitles them to bias. \n\nRecently, WNBA basketball stars Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark got into one of their now-characteristic on-court rivalries. But this time around, Reese mocked Clark as a “White gyal (sic) running from the fade.” \n\nReese assumes that her status as a black star grants her immunity from backlash—a privilege unlikely to be extended if the roles were reversed. \n\nOr is her crassness a simple reflection that 60 years after the Civil Rights movement, it is deemed cool or deservedly acceptable to use the word “white” derogatorily? \n\nAfter all, loose-cannon Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, in one of her accustomed racialist rants, recently went after her party’s big Democrat donors, who raised a record amount of money for Kamala Harris’ short-lived campaign. \n\nCrockett played the race card when claiming that Democrat insiders were already backing the next party nominee as the “safest white boy.” \n\nHer racist irritation is puzzling. After all, two out of the last four Democrat presidential nominees have been African Americans. \n\nYet it is certainly easy to see why Crockett, who endlessly spouts off about race in congressional sessions, used the pejorative “white boy.” She knows that there are no repercussions given her race and, to a lesser extent, her gender and left-wing ideology. \n\nRecently, a past 2018 slur resurfaced from another House Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. She had falsely claimed, “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths in this country.” \n\nOmar’s stereotyped smear was not only racist but also factually incorrect. \n\nThe FBI’s 2018 data on perpetrators of murder, when the race of the offender was known, reveals that 54.9% of the nation’s murderers that year were African American, who constitute about 13% of the population. \n\nAnd when the race of the murderer in rare interracial killings was known, blacks were more than twice as likely to murder whites as whites were to kill blacks. \n\nDuring recent controversies over leaks at the Pentagon, former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, during the Obama administration, injected race by smearing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. She leveled a trifecta race/gender/sexual orientation slur—all irrelevant to the issue at hand: “Well, if you’re a white male Christian cisgender macho MAGA man, you can be as dumb as a rock and be deemed qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense.” \n\nRice still chafes that as a sometimes-official Obama administration spokeswoman, she serially and deliberately misled the country about the fatal 2012 terrorist attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi. \n\nIn all these cases, there was no fallout from racial categorization and demonization. Again, we apparently accept the pernicious idea that those identifying as an oppressed group cannot themselves voice illiberal stereotypes. \n\nBut while our political elites and celebrities seem fixated on using racial put-downs for career advantage and personal notoriety, the people increasingly ignore their entrenched and off-putting racism. \n\nFor example, in a recent Rasmussen poll surveying public attitudes toward Trump’s first 100 days in office, 62% of Hispanics voiced approval (higher than the 49% of whites). And 39% of blacks agreed. \n\nOne result of the 2024 campaign was that while Democrats seemed fixated on racial stereotypes, the public had moved on. \n\nVoters increasingly see class considerations transcending race. That fact may explain why exasperated and flailing Democrats and leftists desperately seek to resurrect racial polarization instead of finding a popular middle-class agenda. \n\nHistorically, tribalism erodes a multiracial democracy. \n\nIt did when white leaders in the past expressed racist attitudes toward blacks. And it will again if black elites simply flip the paradigm and do the same. \n\n(C)2025 Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\nNothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"One reason why the public turned on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was its insistence that roughly 70% of the country was stereotyped as victimizers...

His disapproval rating also dropped from 91 to 87 percent.The poll also showed that Trump's approval rating has received a 5-point boost from Black voters, with 27 percent approving of his job performance, up from 22 percent. His disapproval among this demographic dropped by 2 points to 64 percent. Among every other demographic polled, Trump's approval rating did not change significantly.Both polls had a margin of error of ± 3.1 percentage points.Quantus Insights was rated in the top 20 in ActiVote's Most Valuable Pollster (MVP ratings).Why It MattersDonald Trump's modest gains among Democrats and Black voters—who traditionally lean Democratic—signal subtle but potentially consequential shifts in the political landscape.This dynamic not only strengthens Trump's hand as he advances his second-term agenda but also signals a daunting challenge for Democrats heading into the 2026 midterms.What To KnowBut while the latest Quantus poll showed concerning signs for the Democrats, other recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating among Democrats increasing marginally, well within the margin of error.Such was the case in the most recent Civiqs and YouGov/Economist polls, where Trump's approval rating increased from 5 percent to 6 percent.But other polls conducted back in April had suggested that Trump is still more popular than his opposing party.A CNN/SSRS poll, conducted April 17—24 among 1,678 adults, showed that when respondents were asked who would be doing a better job as president, 45 percent chose Trump, while 43 percent chose Kamala Harris. \"This looks a lot like the election result,\" CNN pollster Harry Enten noted. The 2024 election saw Trump beat Harris in the popular vote by two points, with around 50 percent of the vote. That would suggest that voters' support for Trump has not shifted all that much since November.An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, conducted between April 18 to 22 among 3,634 respondents, brought more bad news for the Democrats, showing that when respondents were asked who they trusted more to deal with the U.S.'s main problems, 40 percent chose Trump, compared to just 32 percent who chose Democrats in Congress.And in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between April 25-27 among 1,029 adults, the Republicans held a significant advantage over Democrats on two of the most pressing issues for voters: immigration and the economy.When asked which party has the better plan to address immigration, respondents favored the GOP by a wide 19-point margin. On the economy, Republicans also lead by 9 points. That is despite recent polls showing Trump deep underwater on both issues over the past few weeks after he announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and became embroiled in a dispute with the Supreme Court over the mistaken deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to Kamala Harris, told Newsweek at the time that recent polling reflected lingering dissatisfaction with Joe Biden's presidency, which he said has damaged the Democratic brand. \"People were pretty unhappy,\" Nellis said, and Democrats now need to \"earn people's trust back\" rather than rely on Trump's unpopularity.But Quantus' poll suggests the Democrats are struggling at that task. 36 percent of Democrats polled said they believe President Biden's health problems were downplayed during his presidency in order to mislead the public. There is no evidence of this, but it was recently revealed that Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.Meanwhile, 58 percent of Democrats polled said they do not believe Biden had the mental and cognitive fitness required to serve effectively as president during his time in office.It comes at a time when polls have shown that following their 2024 election loss, the Democrats are more unpopular than ever.According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990.There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party.The survey suggested that this may be because Democratic voters want their party to take a tougher position in Congress. Among Democratic voters, 65 percent said they wanted their congressional representatives to \"stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington,\" while 32 percent said they should \"make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\"The poll largely reflects the debates occurring in the Democratic party right now in light of their 2024 defeat.Some feel that in order to get back on track and win back the House in the 2026 midterms, the party should take a more bipartisan approach to politics, and work with Trump to pass legislation, while others feel that doing so will alienate Democratic voters who see Trump as a toxic figure.In Quantus' April survey, 49 percent said they Democratic party should respond to Trump by resisting or opposing him, while 41 percent said they believe the party should work with Trump.The poll also showed that 35 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democratic party, while 65 percent view the party favorably.\"While a majority remain supportive, the one-third unfavorable share signals underlying discontent that could impact unity and engagement,\" Quantus Insights said on its website.Trump's Approval RatingTrump's rising approval rating among Democrats comes as polls have shown his approval ratings ticking up in recent days. That includes Newsweek's tracker, which shows that Trump's approval rating currently stands at 46 percent, while 50 percent disapprove. Earlier this month, his approval rating stood at 44 percent, while his disapproval was firmly in the 50s.The latest Insider Advantage poll, conducted between May 17 and 19 among 1,000 likely voters, gave Trump a net approval rating of +11 points, with 55 percent approving and 44 percent disapproving. That was up from a net approval rating of +2 points in early May, when 46 percent approved and 44 percent disapproved.And the latest Morning Consult poll also showed a surge in Trump's approval rating, with 48 percent approving and 50 percent disapproving, giving the president a net approval rating of -2 points, up from -7 in early May when 45 percent approved and 52 percent disapproved. That is his highest approval rating since mid-March.Meanwhile, the latest J.L. Partners/Daily Mail poll conducted between May 13 and 14 among 1,003 registered voters put Trump's approval rating at 50 percent, up 5 points from 45 percent in April.\n\nAmerican Research Group\n\nInsider Advantage\n\nMorning Consult\n\nYouGov/Economist\n\nReuters/Ipsos\n\nNavigator Research\n\nHowever, the overarching trend in the polls is one of stability, with some showing that his ratings have not substantially changed beyond a 1- or 2-point dip—within the margin of error.That includes the most recent Navigator Research poll, conducted between May 15-18 among 1,376 registered voters, which showed Trump's approval rating stands at 44 percent, while 54 percent disapprove. That is unchanged from April.Similarly, in Quantus' poll, Trump's approval rating stood at 48 percent, while 48 percent also disapproved. That is unchanged from a poll conducted earlier in May, and an April poll also showed his approval rating stood at 48 percent, while his disapproval rating was 2 points higher at 50 percent.Marquette's most recent poll also showed his approval rating unchanged from March, while an American Research Group poll, conducted between March 17 and 20 among 1,100 adults, put Trump's approval rating at 41 percent, down just 2 points from 43 percent in April. His disapproval grew from 53 percent to 55 percent.Meanwhile, a YouGov/Economist poll conducted from May 16 to 19 pegged Trump's approval at 43 percent, up 1 point from 42 percent the previous week, while disapproval ticked down slightly from 52 percent to 51 percent. The same pattern occurred in the latest Civiqs poll, conducted between May 17 and 20 among 1,018 registered voters.How Trump's Approval Rating Compares To First TermThe RealClearPolitics tracker shows that on May 23, 2017, Trump's approval rating was 40 percent, while his disapproval rating was 55 percent. This gave him a net approval rating of -15 points, making Trump more popular now than at the same point in his first stint in the Oval Office.How Trump's Approval Rating Compares To Biden'sTrump's 46 percent approval rating is lower than that of former President Joe Biden at the same point in his presidency. On May 23, 2021, Biden stood at 54 percent, with a disapproval rating of 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.While Trump began his second term with his highest approval rating, according to Gallup's first poll of Trump's second term, conducted between January 21 and 27, he was still less popular than any president since 1953 at the start of a term and the only one to begin with a sub-50 percent approval rating. Gallup said Biden started his first term with a 57 percent approval rating.And, according to data compiled from Gallup by The American Presidency Project, Trump ranks far below other recently elected presidents after 100 days, dating to Dwight Eisenhower, who had an approval rating of 73 percent.Other recently elected presidents had higher approval ratings at the 100-day mark, including John F. Kennedy, 83 percent; Richard Nixon, 62 percent; Jimmy Carter, 63 percent; Ronald Reagan, 68 percent; George H.W. Bush, 56 percent; Bill Clinton, 55 percent; George W. Bush, 62 percent; and Barack Obama, 65 percent.What Happens NextTrump's approval rating could fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations in the Russia-Ukraine war, the evolving tariff situation and concerns about a recession.","summary":"Trump's rising approval rating among Democrats comes as his general approval ratings have been ticking up.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-democrats-2076382","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2650826/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 15:04:32","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":324120770,"title":"Like many populist leaders, Trump accuses judges of being illegitimate obstacles to safety and democracy","text":"Federal judges and at times Supreme Court justices have repeatedly challenged – and blocked – President Donald Trump’s attempts to reshape fundamental aspects of American government.\n\nMany of Trump’s more than 150 executive orders, including one aimed at eliminating the Department of Education, have been blocked by injunctions and lawsuits.\n\nWhen a majority of Supreme Court justices ruled on May 16, 2025, that the Trump administration could not deport a group of Venezuelan immigrants without first giving them the right to due process in court, Trump attacked the court. \n\n“The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This is a bad and dangerous day for America!” he continued in the post. \n\nAs the Trump administration faces other orders blocking its plans, the president and his team are framing judges not just as political opponents but as enemies of democracy.\n\nTrump, for example, has called for the impeachment of James Boasberg, a federal judge who also issued orders blocking the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. to El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said that Boasberg was “trying to protect terrorists who invaded our country over American citizens,” and Trump has also called Boasberg and other judges who ruled against him or his administration “left-wing activists.” \n\n“We cannot allow a handful of communist, radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws and assume the duties that belong solely to the president of the United States,” Trump said at a rally in April 2025. “Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president to keep our country safe.” \n\nAs a scholar of legal and political theory, I believe this kind of talk about judges and the judicial system is not just misleading, it’s dangerous. It mirrors a pattern seen across many populist movements worldwide, where leaders cast independent courts and judges as illegitimate obstacles to what they see as the will of the people. \n\nBy confusing the idea that the people’s will must prevail with what the law actually says, these leaders justify intimidating judges and their sound legal rulings, a move that ultimately undermines democracy.\n\nThwarting ‘the will of the American people’?\n\nIn the face of judicial rulings against them, Trump and other administration officials have suggested on multiple occasions that judges are antagonistic to what the American people voted for. \n\nYet these rulings are merely a reflection of the rule of law. \n\nTrump and supporters such as Elon Musk have characterized the rulings as a sign that a group of elite judges are abusing their power and acting against the will of the American people. The rulings that enforce the law, according to this argument, stand in opposition to the popular mandate American voters give to elected officials like the president. \n\n“If ANY judge ANYWHERE can stop EVERY Presidential action EVERYWHERE, we do NOT live in a democracy,” Elon Musk posted on X in February 2025. “When judges egregiously undermine the democratic will of the people, they must be fired,” Musk added. \n\nAnd U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said in March 2025, “We do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court.” \n\nFraming judges as enemies of democracy or as obstacles to the people’s will departs sharply from the traditional view – held across political lines – that the judiciary is an essential, nonpartisan part of the American constitutional system. \n\nWhile previous presidents have expressed frustration with specific court decisions or judges’ political leanings, their critiques mostly focused on specific legal reasoning. \n\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned against the Trump administration’s charge that judges were actively undermining democracy. In late April 2025, she said during a conference for judges that “relentless attacks on judges are an attack on democracy.”\n\nSo, are judges obstructing democracy – or protecting it?\n\nAre unelected judges a sign of democracy?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution established an independent judiciary as a coequal branch of government, alongside the legislative and executive branches. Federal judges are appointed for life and cannot be removed for political reasons. The country’s founders thought this protection could insulate judges from political pressures and ensure that courts uphold the Constitution, not the popularity of a given policy. \n\nYet as the federal judiciary has expanded in size and power, the arguments about the relationship between democracy and judicial independence have become louder among some political scientists and legal philosophers. \n\nSome critics take issue with the fact that federal judges are appointed by politicians, not elected to their positions – a fact that others argue contributes to their independence. \n\nFederal judges often serve longer on the bench than many elected officials.\n\nWhy, some critics argue, should a small group of unelected experts be allowed to overturn decisions made by elected officials? \n\nOther democratic theorists, however, say that federal judges can act as a check on elected leaders who may misuse or abuse their power, or pass laws that violate people’s legal rights. This indirectly strengthens democracy by giving people a meaningful way to have recourse against laws that go against their rights and what they actually voted for. \n\nA common story across countries\n\nThe argument that judges are an enemy to democracy is not unique to the U.S. \n\nAuthoritarian leaders from across the world have used similar language to justify undermining the courts.\n\nIn the Philippines, then-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2018 told Maria Lourdes Sereno, a top judge who was an outspoken critic of Duterte’s war on drugs, “I am now your enemy.” Shortly after, the Philippines Supreme Court voted to oust Sereno from the court. These judges cited Sereno’s failure to disclose personal financial information when she was first appointed to the court as the reason for her removal. \n\nFilipino protesters and outside critics alike viewed Sereno’s removal as politically motivated and said it undermined the country’s judicial independence.\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s allies in the legislative assembly similarly voted in May 2021 to remove the government’s attorney general as well all five top judges for obstructing Bukele’s plans to imprison, without proper due process, large numbers of people. Bukele replaced the attorney general and judges with political loyalists, violating constitutional procedure. \n\nKamala Harris, then vice president of the U.S., was among the international observers who said the removal of judges in El Salvador made her concerned about El Salvador’s democracy. Bukele justified the judges’ removal by saying he was right and that he refused to “listen to the enemies of the people” who wanted him to do otherwise. \n\nAnd in April 2024, a minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet called Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara an “enemy of the people,” blaming her for protests outside Netanyahu’s home. This disparagement was part of Netanyahu’s broader efforts to weaken judges’ role and independence and to remove judicial constraints on executive power. \n\nPushing against democracy\n\nIn the name of weakening what they call undemocratic institutions, these and other leaders try to discredit independent judges. This attempt helps these leaders gain power and silence dissent. \n\nTheir attempts to disparage and discredit judges misrepresent judges’ work by asserting that it is political in nature – and thus subject to political criticism and even intimidation. But in the U.S., judges’ constitutionally mandated work takes place in the realm of law, not politics. \n\nBy confusing the idea that the people’s will must prevail with what the law actually says, these leaders justify intimidating judges and their rulings, a move that ultimately undermines democracy.\n\nIndependent judges may not always make perfect decisions, and concerns about their interpretations or potential biases are legitimate. Judges sometimes make decisions that are objectionable from a moral and legal standpoint. \n\nBut when political leaders portray judges as the problem, I believe it’s crucial to ask: Who truly benefits from silencing judges?","summary":"Political leaders in El Salvador, the Philippines and Israel, among other places, have also positioned judges as the enemy of the people.","url":"https://theconversation.com/like-many-populist-leaders-trump-accuses-judges-of-being-illegitimate-obstacles-to-safety-and-democracy-255472","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/669809/original/file-20250522-68-4tv32v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C584%2C7000%2C3500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 12:46:47","author":"Assistant Professor of Philosophy,Clemson University,Michael Gregory","authors":["Assistant Professor of Philosophy","Clemson University","Michael Gregory"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":324106988,"title":"The Intense CBS News Turmoil: Staff in Conflict and Distress","text":"CBS is currently experiencing turmoil, with employees in tears in the corridors, disputes over story assignments and seating arrangements, and a rush to polish their resumes amid concerns about widespread layoffs.\n\nAccording to insiders speaking to the Daily Mail, the atmosphere at the network has deteriorated significantly, affecting everything from the prestigious Sunday news program 60 Minutes to CBS Mornings. This decline in morale is driven by an impending $8.4 billion merger combined with a $20 billion lawsuit.\n\nThe tumult is turning into a ‘bloodbath’, one employee said, with feverish speculation rife among colleagues as to who will get the axe next.\n\nParticular anxiety surrounds reports indicating that Paramount Global, CBS’s parent company, is poised to cut $500 million in expenditures to gear up for a profitable merger with Skydance Media, all while ratings are in a downward spiral.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump’s legal action against 60 Minutes over claims that an interview with former presidential candidate Kamala Harris was deceptively edited continues to cause deep division.\n\nThere have been suggestions recently that bosses at Paramount are entertaining a $50 million payout as the Trump administration considers whether to renew CBS’s broadcast license.\n\nThe chaos has intensified since the abrupt exit of CEO Wendy McMahon on Monday, who indicated that she opposed settling with President Trump, and described her final months in the job as ‘challenging’.\n\n‘It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,’ McMahon wrote in her terse exit memo. ‘It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.’\n\nHer sudden departure sent shockwaves through the offices of The Early Show and CBS Evening News and has prompted frenzied gossip about which household names will follow her out the door.\n\n‘[Wendy leaving] really hurt us a lot,’ said one CBS employee. ‘I’ve seen people crying in the halls. Everyone is going into offices and conference rooms to whisper and strategize.’\n\nFed-up sources observed that there was growing resentment towards legendary CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King, who is reportedly facing a fight to have her $10million contract renewed when it ends in September.\n\nAnd there might be more exits to come. Multiple sources told the Daily Mail that 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley could also be on the way out.\n\n‘It’s marquee name after marquee name. People don’t want to say it out loud in the office but the entire space debacle really hurt us,’ a 60 Minutes staffer said of King’s participation in Blue Origin’s all-female spaceflight on April 2. ‘Gayle being part of that is not a good look for our brand.’\n\n‘I think a lot of people resent Gayle for that,’ continued the insider. ‘I know I do.’\n\nThere was a general sense of embarrassment, said one Early Show producer. ‘I almost feel like apologizing when I tell people where I work. I hate it here.’\n\nBut the most palpable impact appears to have been felt at 60 Minutes, where staff have compared the atmosphere to a ‘sinking ship’.\n\n‘We’re in the middle of a bloodbath,’ a staffer said. ‘The axe is falling, people are leaving, no one knows what to do next. We’re all updating our resumes because it really feels like this is a sinking ship.’\n\nThe tension has spilled out into the open, with blazing rows in the office over story coverage and petty squabbles concerning seating plans, sources told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘Fights, and loud ones,’ the insider continued. ‘You can hear them in the halls. People are arguing over everything and anything. From big things, like how to report stories, to small things, like who is sitting where in the conference room.’\n\nThe deterioration of the mood in the newsroom began with the April departure of Bill Owens, the long-time executive producer of 60 Minutes, who left citing concerns about editorial independence.\n\nNow, there is speculation Pelley could also be leaving, and King’s future is far from guaranteed – not least because of the backlash within CBS and beyond after the controversial spaceflight.\n\nWhen Owens quit, Pelley said on 60 Minutes: ‘Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires. No one here is happy about it. But in resigning, Bill proved one thing – he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.’\n\nSignificantly adding to the pressure at the embattled news network are suggestions of the potential settlement in the $20 billion lawsuit from Trump. \n\nThe president claims that a 60 Minutes segment featuring Harris ahead of the 2020 presidential election was deceptively edited in an attempt to assist her election chances.\n\nTwo versions of Harris’s interview were aired in which she appears to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war, according to the federal lawsuit.\n\nCBS News has maintained that the then-vice president simply gave a lengthy answer, which was cut down due to time constraints, and that the lawsuit was ‘completely’ without merit’. The network has asked a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nBut the President’s lawyers insist that CBS was being partisan, and trying to make Harris’s answer more coherent.\n\nAs CBS and Paramount Global are working towards their merger with Skydance, Trump’s Federal Communications Commission has said that it would not approve the deal until the lawsuit was settled.\n\nAll the uncertainty has led to frazzled nerves and personal turmoil for the journalists still working for CBS News.\n\n‘People are literally keeping antacid at their desks,’ said the Early Show staffer. ‘I’ve never seen anything quite this bad.’\n\nA representative for CBS News said the network ‘doesn’t comment on personnel matters’ in a statement to the Daily Mail.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCBS is currently experiencing turmoil, with employees in tears in the corridors,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Intense CBS News Turmoil: Staff in Conflict and Distress first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/the-intense-cbs-news-turmoil-staff-in-conflict-and-distress/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-vicious-CBS-News-bloodbath-where-staff-are-fighting-and.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 12:46:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":324281998,"title":"Mystery White Billionaire Tells Trump There's no 'White Genocide' in South Africa, Trump Plans Revenge Against A-List Celebs, Feds After Chicago's Black Mayor For Hiring Practices, Hopeful News For Federal Workers After Trump's Layoff Tirade and Other Pol","text":"The Story Behind the Mystery White Billionaire Who Told Trump There’s No ‘White Genocide’ in South Africa\n\nA meeting in the Oval Office turned sour after President Donald Trump ambushed South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa with claims of a “white genocide.” But one white man standing in the back of the room stood up to Trump, and though the world might not recognize him, he continues to play a vital role in mending the countries’ shaky relationship. - Phenix S Halley Read More\n\nTrump Tried to Recreate that Zelenskyy, White House Moment...but South Africa’s President Wasn’t Having it\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to Washington, D.C. hoping to ease growing tensions between his country and the U.S. Instead, he was ambushed by President Donald Trump, leaving the fate of the relationship between the nations up in the air. - Phenix S Halley Read More\n\nBlack Folks Respond to Trump’s Plan to Take Revenge Against Certain A-List Celebs\n\n Months have passed since Beyoncé and other celebrities endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

The book, which details how Biden's inner circle worked to keep his sharp decline a secret, is sourced from conversations with administration officials and high-ranking Democratic insiders. The reaction to the book has been mixed, with praise for its revelations but also derision for coming late to the party. TRUMP HAS NOT DIRECTED ADMINISTRATION TO DECLASSIFY BIDEN DOCUMENTS ON HEALTH 'COVER-UP' \"And I was saying this since 2022, alright?\" Carville continued. \"I think it was a big mistake for him to say he was running for reelection. And I’ve said it at the time and I will say it now, and I will say it a thousand times.\" \"It's not a job for 80-year olds,\" Carville said of Biden's age. Biden would have been 86 at the end of a second term if he'd been re-elected. The longtime political strategist argued that the decision to keep Biden in the presidential race until after his disastrous debate performance with President Donald Trump was a critical mistake for Democrats. \"I don't know if it's his staff, or if it's the family or who it is, but whatever it was it was just a colossal mistake, and to this day fervently believe, there's no way to prove it… I think it cost us the presidency,\" Carville said. Biden dropped out of the race last July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, but she lost to Trump.

'We are winning'","text":"To Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, the legal war against President Donald Trump is personal.\n\nRaoul is a Chicago native, born to Haitian immigrants, making him a self-described “birthright baby.” He’s also a prostate cancer survivor, and lost his father to the disease. And he’s watching Trump slash the budget and lay off staffers at the National Institutes of Health, one of the largest funders of cancer research.\n\n“I’d be lying to you if I told you this is not scary to me. That this does not hit me emotionally. That it’s not personal to me. Our very first lawsuit, birthright citizenship. I’m a birthright baby, right? My mom was not yet naturalized when I was born,” Raoul said in an interview with the Sun-Times. “I’m a cancer survivor. I’m a prostate cancer survivor. I was very public when I was diagnosed, partially because it was therapeutic to me while I was going through it.”\n\nRaoul recently lost a close friend, Matt Jones, to glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor. Jones worked for the Office of the Illinois Appellate Prosecutor and had been undergoing an experimental treatment at Northwestern.\n\n“This lawsuit with regards to NIH, they’re trying to cap the indirect costs for NIH’s funding of cancer research. It’s not just another lawsuit just to fight the Trump administration. It’s really personal,” Raoul said. “So it does hit me. Some more than others, emotionally. I’ve been one to just wear my emotions publicly and just suffer whatever the consequence that is. But we’re all human beings, right?”\n\nRaoul, 60, started his career as a senior staff attorney for the City Colleges of Chicago, then as a prosecutor with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office. He served as a state senator for 14 years, initially appointed to fill the seat held when Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate, before being elected attorney general in 2018.\n\nNow, he’s a key figure in Democrats’ legal battle against Trump’s executive orders and policies. The Democratic Attorney Generals Association in November 2024 elected Raoul a co-chair of their coalition, aimed at leading the coordinated efforts against Trump’s unconstitutional actions.\n\nRaoul and 22 other Democratic attorneys general are acting as a firewall. This month alone, he led a coalition of 18 AGs in filing an amicus brief supporting a legal challenge to two of Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, and another suit accusing the Trump administration of attempting to “illegally” coerce states into sweeping immigration enforcement by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding for emergency services and infrastructure.\n\nHe has been part of more than 20 suits and filings aimed at halting executive orders and policies since Trump took office in January. Raoul was among four attorneys general who filed a suit challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order.\n\nAnd he believes the legal fights are going in Democrats’ favor.\n\n“We are winning. Not every aspect and not every lawsuit, but overwhelmingly we are successful,” Raoul said. “And what winning looks like is having the spigot of funding reopened where there have been efforts to freeze funding or condition funding.”\n\nRaoul sees another version of “winning” in Republican-appointed federal judges blasting Trump’s actions as blatantly unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge John Bates, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush in February, ordered the administration to restore public health websites that were taken down after Trump ordered the federal government would only recognize “two sexes, male and female.”\n\nU.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, in February became the second federal judge to issue a nationwide injunction to block the administration from moving forward on Trump’s executive order targeting birthright citizenship. Coughenour called the executive order “blatantly unconstitutional.”\n\n“These are judges that apparently did take civics, did watch ‘Schoolhouse Rock’ when they were younger and understand that there’s an obligation to follow the Constitution,” Raoul said.\n\n‘The lawsuit are filed because they are unlawful actions’\n\nDuring a recent interview in Springfield, the attorney general brought a stapled list of all his Trump-related cases.\n\n“It’s more like a teddy bear, making me feel more confident,” Raoul said with a laugh.\n\nBut the journey has been far from light. Raoul said he’s receiving thank you notes and cards every week. But there’s also hate mail. They’re coming from “people not understanding the why,” he says.\n\n“The lawsuits are filed because they are unlawful actions, because the way he tries to pursue these things are either unconstitutional or violative of a law in some other way, not filed because I disagree with the policy,” Raoul said.\n\nThe frequent filings coming from Democratic attorneys general have created a deep bond among the group. In frequent Zooms and phone calls, they debate key issues, which Raoul, who co-chairs a working group on DEI matters, described as sometimes “tense.”\n\n“It’s hefty matters that we’re discussing, and so there’s disagreement sometimes as to how and when or if to proceed with something,” Raoul said. “We try to keep it together as much as possible.”\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison called Raoul “innovative, creative and a leader among Attorneys General.” He also lauded him for “his reserved calm in difficult moments.”\n\nAnd Sean Rankin, president of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, called Raoul a “forceful, strategic and impressive leader.” He also credited him for stepping up to lead Black men in a rally last year to support Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“He grew into a national voice in that moment,” Rankin said in a statement. “And as he became a DAGA Co-Chair this year and when Trump took office, I’ve seen his leadership and voice grow deeper as he works tirelessly to defend the rule of law, protecting the rights of Illinoisans directly and all Americans.”\n\nRaoul seeking more funds\n\nRaoul’s spotlight on the Trump administration lawsuits has unleashed some critics. Some Republicans like State Rep. Amy Elik, R-Alton, see Raoul’s leading role as “doing Governor [JB] Pritzker’s political bidding,” which Raoul has refuted.\n\nPritzker’s office sought to squash that characterization, calling him “an incredibly accomplished public official in his own right.” Spokesman Alex Gough said Raoul “has demonstrated strong leadership of a completely independent office.”\n\n Elik, who serves as an Assistant House Republican Leader, has filed legislation that would require transparency about the cost of lawsuits coming out of the attorney general’s office.\n\n“I’d be eager to see exactly how many millions of dollars are being wasted on these political lawsuits,” Elik said in an email. “We’re looking for places to cut after all, and that seems like a great start.”\n\nThe opposite of Elik’s request is likely to occur, with Raoul this year asking for more funding in this year’s state budget. He says more is needed as federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Education and Department of Justice, retreat under the Trump administration.\n\n“Ideologically there’s going to be a departure from a feeling that consumers ought to be protected at a federal level. What that means is there’s going to be increased burden on the state agency level. And one of the critical state agencies in that fight to protect consumers are offices of attorneys general,” Raoul said. “And so the burden is going to be bigger on our consumer protection teams, our public interest teams, our civil rights teams and we’re going to need more lawyers, not just for short term federal economy litigation.”\n\n‘If we all stand solid, he will be beaten back’\n\n“I want to talk about the law firms,” Raoul volunteered during an hourlong interview.\n\nNaturally, as a lawyer, Raoul is fuming about Trump’s targeting of law firms — and he’s even more upset about the firms “capitulating.” \n\nNine prominent law firms have made deals with Trump amid executive orders that targeted his political and legal adversaries. By agreeing to millions of dollars in pro bono work benefiting the administration, those nine firms have so far avoided retribution.\n\n“These threats to these law firms are something that I think all Americans should be concerned about in a very, very serious way, because it undermines advocacy. The same way that we as attorneys general are able to bring these lawsuits and effectively bring them, there are private actors, sometimes represented by law firms, that are doing these in cases where we don’t have standing,” Raoul said. “...I think it’s better if we could all stand solid as a legal community knowing that that is absolutely wrong, and if we all stand solid, he will be beaten back.”\n\nRaoul said he poached a law student from Kirkland & Ellis, whom he said “demonstrated courage,” in telling the firm he wouldn’t work for them after they made a deal with Trump.\n\n“I think people like that should be lifted up for demonstrating their courage and demonstrating a willingness to fight for the profession,” Raoul said. “...If that all is compromised by this revenge, this retribution that’s coming from the president of the United States, that is very, very dangerous.”\n\nRaoul plans to run for reelection\n\nAlthough Raoul said he had given thought to running for Sen. Dick Durbin’s seat, the incumbent attorney general said he plans to run for reelection in 2026.\n\n“The notion of me going back and forth to Washington D.C. and living in a some dorm room or small apartment somewhere and being only able to just give a speech instead of filing a lawsuit. Why would I leave this at this time to go do that?” Raoul said. “... I’m blessed to be in this. There’s a reason why Lisa [Madigan], my predecessor, served four terms. This is a hell of a job to have.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/05/23/illinois-attorney-general-kwame-raoul-fight-against-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40982b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7039x4018+0+338/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2Fda%2F569beb7b4e529220991771abee28%2Fraou","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 10:30:00","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":324181462,"title":"POLL: What Was the Worst Media Take of the Week?","text":"POLL: What was the worst media take of the week?

The Daily Beast reported about an apparent rift between the ladies of \"The View\" and the top brass at the company, going all the way up to Disney CEO Bob Iger, about a desire for the hosts to cool off the politics. Notably, all six of the co-hosts (Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro) voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and are outspoken critics of President Donald Trump. DISNEY BOSS BOB IGER, ABC EXEC ASKED ‘THE VIEW’ HOSTS TO COOL IT ON POLITICS: REPORT \"[ABC News president Almin] Karamehmedovic convened a meeting with The View's executive producer Brian Teta and its hosts, and suggested the panel needed to broaden its conversations beyond its predominant focus on politics, two sources familiar with the meeting said,\" the Daily Beast reported Wednesday. \"Karamehmedovic highlighted episodes with celebrity guests that he said were highly rated, one source said, and encouraged them to lean into such coverage moving forward.\" According to the report, \"The View\" co-host Ana Navarro forcefully pushed back, insisting their audience want their perspectives on politics. Navarro reportedly took her message directly to Iger, who she thanked for allowing them to keep doing their jobs, though Iger \"reaffirmed that the show needed to tone down its political rhetoric\" while expressing his support for \"The View.\" \"Ultimately, the women found the requests ‘silly’ and that ‘they were just going to keep doing their thing,’\" the Daily Beast wrote. BIDEN TELLS 'THE VIEW' HE WASN'T SURPRISED HARRIS LOST, BLAMES SEXISM AND RACISM A source with \"The View\" confirmed to Fox News Digital these discussions were had, but suggested not all the hosts are in lockstep with Navarro. \"Most hosts agree with the ABC top brass,\" the source told Fox News Digital. \"'The View' is a daytime network talk show and needs to do more than just politics and Trump bashing. This was a welcome direction for many of us.\" When asked whether \"The View\" will ultimately pivot towards less political coverage as the second Trump presidency continues, the source responded, \"It's hard to say,\" but added, \"Ignoring Bob Iger seems like a terrible decision.\" Another source familiar with the situation said such conversations with talent are normal based on viewer feedback, and that this conversation in particular is about finding a \"balance\" in topics and reevaluating politics in general, not just stories pertaining to Trump. Despite the internal discussions, \"The View\" has maintained its critical coverage of Trump and his administration in recent weeks. A spokesperson for ABC News declined to comment. ‘THE VIEW MELTS DOWN OVER LATEST BIDEN BOOK, SLAMS CNN FOR ’HAWKING' IT CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Iger's request for a shift in \"The View\" did not occur in a vacuum. Trump, known for his feuds with the media, is currently in mediation with Paramount Global to resolve his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over the handling of its \"60 Minutes\" election interview with Harris. ABC News itself settled a lawsuit filed by Trump in December, shelling out $15 million for his presidential library and an apology over liberal anchor George Stephanopoulos' false assertions that Trump was found \"liable for rape,\" alluding to the civil case victory by accuser E. Jean Carroll, when a jury actually determined Trump was liable for \"sexual abuse.\" That settlement was personally approved by Iger according to reports. Trump also landed multimillion-dollar settlements from social media giants Meta and X over their past suppression of his accounts on their platforms and is currently suing board members of the Pulitzer Prize for awarding The New York Times and The Washington Post for their Russiagate coverage.","summary":"An insider for &quot;The View&quot; is speaking out after it was reported the co-hosts clashed with Disney chief Bob Iger over his requests for them to tamp down the politics.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-insider-sounds-alarm-disney-boss-urges-abc-daytime-hosts-cool-political-chatter","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/theviewbobiger.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 09:00:35","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.297},{"id":324025022,"title":"Legal experts blast ‘baseless’ Warren-Sanders letter warning Paramount against Trump lawsuit settlement","text":"Legal experts blasted an ominous letter that a trio of liberal senators sent to Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone this week that suggested settling President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News could be illegal under the federal bribery statute. Trump is seeking $20 billion from CBS News and its parent company, Paramount Global, for what he alleged was election interference with how \"60 Minutes\" edited its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the weeks leading up to the presidential election. The two sides have entered mediation in hopes of reaching a settlement, and Redstone is widely believed to be open to a deal ahead of a planned multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media that could be halted by Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., cautioned Redstone that a quid pro quo arrangement leading to a settlement could break the law. \"The allegations are baseless,\" Ronald Chapman II, a federal defense attorney who’s argued before all levels of the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court, told Fox News Digital. SANDERS, WARREN WARN PARAMOUNT THAT SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT COULD BE ILLEGAL BRIBERY ACT The letter expressed \"serious concern\" that Paramount may be \"engaging in improper conduct involving the Trump Administration in exchange for approval of its megamerger with Skydance Media\" and suggested it could fall under the federal bribery statute. \"Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act. If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law,\" Warren, Sanders and Wyden wrote. \"The Federal Anti-Bribery Statute states it is illegal to ‘corruptly’ give anything of value to public officials to influence an act,\" Chapman said before listing a series of \"problems\" he found in the letter. Chapman said the entire letter is \"based on a hypothetical quid pro quo without any support\" that the Trump administration has coerced a quid pro quo. \"We don’t infringe private rights based on hypotheticals. Warren and Sanders must know that this type of activism and hyperbolic outrage is irresponsible,\" Chapman said. \"There is no support for the contention that payment for damages under a lawsuit is ‘a thing of value to influence’ a federal official. Moreover, there is no support for the idea that such a settlement would be corrupt,\" he continued. \"Perhaps Sanders and Warren don’t understand this, but their letter implies that CBS and Paramount are potentially engaged in bribery, which is an outrageous and unfounded allegation.\" Chapman said a federal judge will likely approve the deal and \"we have much bigger problems\" if senators believe a federal judge is going to condone bribery. \"A judge-approved settlement is the opposite of ‘corruption.’ This is a nothing burger,\" Chapman said. ‘60 MINUTES’ CALLS OUT CORPORATE OWNER PARAMOUNT ON THE AIR, SAYS PRODUCER WHO QUIT FELT INTERFERED WITH The senators also said Paramount appeared to be trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration to secure merger approval and cited veteran CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley, who recently told CBS viewers that \"Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways\" as the company is \"trying to complete a merger.\" The letter referenced the recent resignations of CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who both criticized corporate overlords on their way out. Cornell Law professor William A. Jacobson, founder of Legal Insurrection, echoed the notion that the harshly worded letter is essentially irrelevant. \"The claim that a settlement between Trump and CBS would be a violation of the bribery statute may make good politics, but it doesn't necessarily reflect good law,\" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. \"Trump has a lawsuit that the company might want to settle in the normal course, while claiming it did nothing wrong. That's standard corporate conduct,\" he added. \"It's also standard corporate conduct to clear the litigation docket before a merger.\" Jacobson noted that the letter recognized that the sides would have had to agree to perform an official act in exchange for the settlement in order for a bribery allegation, but he doesn’t see any evidence of a quid pro quo. \"The facts of how a settlement comes down, of course, would be important, and I expect that it would be structured to steer clear of any possible criminal violations by making clear that no action by Trump in his capacity as president is required,\" Jacobson said. Michelle May O’Neil, a senior shareholder at OWLawyers, believes the senators are \"savvy about how litigation works\" and must know that most courts require mediation and settlement efforts before spending the taxpayers’ resources on a trial. \"The trial between Trump and CBS would be a circus and cost even more taxpayer resources because of the media attention and high-profile nature of the issues. Accusing litigants of ‘bribery’ just because they settle legal differences is a terrible look for these [three] knowledgeable and allegedly respected senators,\" O’Neil told Fox News Digital. \"They know better. This seems to be just another attempt to grab a headline and be relevant about a non-issue,\" she continued. \"What they should be asking is, ‘Is in the interest of our citizens for this fight to keep going?’ Or, ‘Should we all start looking to the future and solving the real problems of the American people?’\" ‘60 MINUTES' PRODUCER'S ABRUPT EXIT FUELS DRAMA AT CBS NEWS AS NETWORK BATTLES TRUMP LAWSUIT O’Neil also feels that when companies are focused on future business deals, being involved in any type of litigation \"isn’t conducive to the future gain.\" \"It is common for companies to wrap up outstanding liabilities before entering into new deals or mergers,\" O’Neil said, noting that if CBS truly wanted to interfere in the election, the network ultimately failed because Harris lost. \"CBS may have decided that the time, effort, and money that the lawsuit required could be better spent on endeavors moving forward,\" O’Neil said. \"What’s done is done – how can we wrap this up and move on? Only cases that have really big legal issues or problems that lack a reasonable resolution view end up in trial in court.\" Attorney Danny Karon, author of the forthcoming book \"Your Lovable Lawyer's Guide to Legal Wellness: Fighting Back Against a World That's Out to Cheat You,\" said the letter \"was a dead-bang loser from the get-go.\" \"Not only did the senators assume a lot in accusing Paramount of engaging in bribery, but also any information they hope would prove their case is protected by attorney-client privilege, meaning they’ll never get it in the first place – period,\" Karon told Fox News Digital. Karon also took issue with Warren, Sanders and Wyden noting that Paramount could settle a lawsuit the company initially said was \"completely without merit\" as if that disqualifies the company from reaching an agreement ahead of trial. CBS ANCHORS SALUTE OUTGOING '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER, SAY EFFORT TO SETTLE TRUMP LAWSUIT TIED TO CORPORATE MERGER \"Every defendant in every case ever sued decries a plaintiff’s allegations as ‘completely without merit,’ as they claim to ‘vigorously defend’ themselves. These statements were as inconsequential as they were expected,\" Karon said. \"And that CBS might be interested in settling is hardly a concession. Settlement -- if Paramount is even seriously considering it -- happens for various reasons, from financial to political to personal,\" he added. \"For the senators to infer from this settlement possibility that Paramount is on the take is ‘completely without merit.’\" The offices of Warren, Sanders and Wyden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It was written by a medically savvy freelancer named J.D. Ratcliff and appeared in the December 1971 edition of Reader’s Digest. It was part of the monthly’s “I am Joe’s Body” series, its most popular feature ever.\n\nIn 33 installments over three years, Ratcliff used the first person to describe various corporal organs possessed by the fictional “Joe.” The articles were collected in a book and inspired several short documentary films. The headline “I was Joe’s Prostate” is a running joke in the Oscar-nominated 1999 feature “Fight Club.” Taken together, Ratcliff’s body-part impersonations form a lucid and entertaining course in anatomy, physiology and male self-care.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot this week about Joe’s prostate — one that’s owned by another Joe. “Original Sin,” the new book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, has been grabbing headlines with its depiction of Joe Biden’s failing health and the apparent efforts to cover it up during the final year of his presidency. The book follows last fall’s “Uncharted,” by author and filmmaker Chris Whipple, which describes similar shenanigans.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden’s personal office announced that the former president has been diagnosed with a form of prostate cancer that is usually fatal. Some Republicans denounced the disclosure as a deliberate distraction from the book-fed controversy over Biden’s health. Even some Democrats criticized his delayed decision to step down a mere four months before the 2024 election, thereby depriving his successor Kamala Harris of a proper campaign.\n\nBiden’s announcement also triggered a wave of sympathy and support for the former president. Even President Donald Trump said he and wife Melania were “saddened” by the news and wished his rival well. Humorist Andy Borowitz noted with admiration that Biden “thought he could hide his health issues by making the U.S. economy the envy of the world.”\n\nOur 46th president has plenty of company in his affliction. Prostate cancer is the third-biggest killer of American males, after heart disease and lung cancer. More than 35,000 men die of the disease every year, and nearly 10 times as many receive their initial diagnosis of it. Winston Chruchill and O.J. Simpson were in the former group. Robet DeNiro, Ben Stiller and Britain’s King Charles III are in the latter. Cartoonist and “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams announced this week that he, too, has Stage 4 prostate cancer and expects to die before the year is out.\n\nSo, what is this newsworthy organ that’s culling the male herd so relentlessly?\n\nAs described by Ratcliff in Reader’s Digest, the prostate resembles “a red-brown English walnut.” It sits just below the male bladder and exists chiefly to perpetuate the human race by producing and delivering sperm. In middle age, however, the prostate has an uncanny tendency to become cancerous.\n\nIt also enlarges as the years pass, encroaching on the bladder and causing geezers like me to urinate more frequently. Even Barack Obama, then a youthful 55, joked that when the White House phone rang in the middle of the night, “I’m awake anyway, because I gotta go to the bathroom.”\n\nMost prostate cancers advance so slowly that victims can survive decades after diagnosis, ultimately dying from an unrelated cause. But in about 15 percent of cases, the disease metastasizes to distant organs and cannot be cured.\n\nBiden’s version is among those. Even then, if I read the charts right, his five-year survival rate is well above 30 percent. That is an average of all Stage 4 cases, and his doctors are hopeful that effective treatment — radiation, chemotherapy or both — will help him beat those odds.\n\nLet’s hope so. Biden might not have been the most charismatic of presidents, but he was one of the best. He tamed the COVID pandemic and took the economy to new heights, setting a modern one-term record of 17 million new jobs created while producing both the lowest average unemployment rate and the strongest wage growth in half a century. He expanded health coverage to an all-time high of 93 percent of the population and reduced the prices of major drugs. He held NATO together and helped Ukraine resist a Russian invasion.\n\nBiden also articulated a clear view of America’s role in the world as well as its commitment to justice, civility and the rule of law. And he didn’t accept a single 747 for his efforts.\n\nJoe showed up for work every day and, no doubt, more than a few crisis-filled evenings. That’s why my prostate and I will be praying for him every chance we get — which will likely be several times a night.","summary":"Our 46th president has plenty of company in his affliction.

Many feel their beliefs, which includes racist narratives and so-called Christian persecution, have become more normalized in government and mainstream discourse. In its annual Year in Hate and Extremism report, released Thursday, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it counted 1,371 hate and extremist groups, a 5% decline. The nonprofit group attributes this to a lesser sense of urgency to organize because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general. Some of the ways they have done this are through pushing for bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, book bans and protests of drag story hours, the report says. Last year, there were 533 active hate groups. These include groups who express views that are anti-LBGTQ+, anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-Muslim. This number has been steadily declining since reaching a historic high of 1,021 in 2018. \"The trends have slightly sort of gone up and down but let's just say generally, since our tracking, have increased. And that's not just on a total numbers level but also on a per capita,\" said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project. The number of anti-government groups last year totaled 838, an increase from recent years, according to the law center based in Montgomery, Alabama, that tracks racism, xenophobia and far-right militias. These groups see the federal government as \"tyrannical\" and include militias and self-described sovereign citizens. Male supremacy also continues to emerge as an influential hate group. The SPLC documented seven new male supremacist hate groups, making the total 16. Their rhetoric espouses misogyny and strict gender roles. Their rising influence came during an election year when the country saw a woman of color be the first presidential nominee for a major political party. \"I'm not sure it's a direct result of the candidacy of Kamala Harris,\" Rivas said. However, SPLC researchers went into chat rooms of white supremacist organizations during the election and found \"intense vilification, the claiming of demonization of Harris as well as just the pushing of the idea falsely that women would not be qualified.\" Some people on the far right have also pushed a belief that white Christian culture is being threatened by a \"demographic crisis\" including fewer births. \"Politicians, pundits and provocateurs on the right have turned toward demonic language to tar those who disagree with them,\" the report states. Last year's report found \"record numbers\" of white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ groups in 2023. The analysis highlighted how far-right groups tried to waylay democracy through disinformation, false conspiracy theories and threats to election workers. It also examined how supporters of Christian supremacy used similar topics to organize a movement toward authoritarianism. The SPLC is a liberal advocacy organization that, besides monitoring hate groups, files lawsuits over justice issues and offers educational programs to counter prejudice. Frequently criticized by conservatives as biased, the nonprofit has faced lawsuits for its designation of some organizations as hate groups. The report's release comes as a Los Angeles college professor made an appearance in front of media and supporters a few weeks after he was severely injured in a hit and run that he reported as a hate crime. Aki Maehara, 71, arrived at the Chinese American Museum in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday morning in a wheelchair but was able to walk himself to a podium. \"All of your support, concern and care has helped to speed up my healing and has helped to raise my spirits,\" Maehara told the crowd. Photos of his injuries posted to a GoFundMe page have been shared multiple times on social media with users calling for hate crime charges. The crowdsourcing campaign has raised almost $80,000 for Maehara as of Thursday. Maehara said he is considering directing some of the funds \"to other victims of Asian hate violence and other victims of racist violence who are currently in need of support.\" \"I am wanting to add my voice to efforts to address fascist, racist violence directed against Asian Pacific Islander Americans, immigrant communities, all targeted communities and individuals during our current crisis,\" he said. Maehara was riding his electric bicycle in Montebello, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, on April 29 when he says heard a driver yell a racial slur. Maehara says a car then struck him and the driver fled. He was hospitalized with a concussion, neck injury, cheek bone fracture, bruises and swelling up and down his body among other injuries. Maehara, who is Japanese American, teaches a course on the history of racism in the U.S. at East Los Angeles College. He returned to the classroom last week, according to multiple outlets. The Montebello Police Department is investigating and treating the hit and run as a violent hate crime, said Det. Craig Adams. The department is seeking out video from homes in the neighborhood. \"We are still canvassing,\" Adams said. \"It's taken front row ahead of some other cases.\"","summary":"The number of white nationalist, hate and anti-government groups around the U.S. dropped slightly in 2024, not because of any shrinking influence but rather the opposite.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hate-groups-us-decline-influence-grows-report-shows-rcna208693","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250523-Unite-the-right-RS-43fd38.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 08:07:57","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":0.107},{"id":324005206,"title":"Why these Americans agree with the DOGE firings: 'Welcome to the real world'","text":"In April, I wrote about a federal worker who was five months shy of eligibility for a full pension of $6,000 a month when she was fired in the DOGE cuts.I received nearly 100 emails from readers, and almost all expressed how little sympathy they felt.\"Welcome to the real world,\" several said.\"Go get a job and work till you're dead like the rest of us,\" another wrote.\"National Steel went bankrupt. US Steel bought them for nothing. Thousands lost what was promised to us,\" another said.Of course, not everyone feels this way. I tend to get more emails from people with negative responses to stories than from those who aren't bothered. But I was curious to learn more, so I spoke with six of the people who were critical of the federal worker.They were over 60 and lived in California, Nevada, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Four were retired, and most lived on fixed incomes much lower than the pension the subject of my story would have received. They all said they didn't want their tax dollars to pay for high salaries and generous benefits for certain government employees when private sector workers aren't afforded the same rewards. They also questioned whether some government jobs were needed at all. All but one voted for now-President Donald Trump in this past election.While news of federal firings has slowed down, DOGE's purging of the government workforce is not over. The cuts happening now are more permanent and methodical, and the Trump administration is planning to reclassify some workers to make them easier to fire. The six people I spoke with said what DOGE is doing to the federal workforce is par for the course in the private sector. Several had lost their pensions because their employers went bankrupt or stopped paying into them and switched to the less-generous 401(k) model.Leslie Swor, 70, retired seven years ago after a career in the Coast Guard, an independent securities regulator now known as FINRA, and then Oracle. To supplement her income, Swor works a contract job as a school crossing guard in East Los Angeles, California. She told me public sector workers shouldn't expect to have a \"hefty\" pension for life. After all, private sector workers don't take that as a given.Swor said she had \"fabulous benefits and annual raises and bonuses\" early in her career in the private sector. In 2007, when she became an administrative assistant at Oracle, those benefits were no longer the norm.\"Life for us out here in the private sector, in my experience, seemed to get much worse,\" Swor said.The readers I spoke with were surprised that the subject of my story, Katherine Ann Reniers, was making so much money in a government job, in addition to generous benefits, and said the private sector had not been as cushy.Reniers, a fired US Agency for International Development worker, earned a base salary of $177,000. In addition to a pension, she and other federal workers have the Thrift Savings Plan, which is similar to a 401(k). In that plan, the government matches a small percentage of an employee's contributions. Reniers would have qualified for federal health insurance for life if she had hit two decades of service.Nearly 20 years ago, Reniers took a pay cut to leave the private sector, dropping from $150,000 to $54,000 in annual pay to get on a path that she saw as stabler for her family in the long run. At first, she moved every two to four years, sometimes to countries that had high rates of violent crime and lacked decent healthcare. In 2010, she was pregnant when she was assigned to Haiti after a devastating earthquake. Reniers, now 53, rose through the ranks to become a USAID division chief and lives in Maryland.Swor said her perception of federal employees was that they traded higher private sector salaries for more stability and better benefits. That's largely true for federal workers with a bachelor's degree or above. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of fiscal 2022 data found that federal workers who graduated from college had lower salaries but better benefits — including health insurance, retirement, and paid leave — than their counterparts in the private sector. Public sector jobs also tend to be held by white-collar, highly educated professionals. Reniers, for example, has a master's degree, speaks four languages, and has a lot of work experience in Africa and Europe.For workers with only a high school education, the federal government, on average, offers better pay and benefits than the private sector.Mike Knouse, a 62-year-old landscaper from Maryland, was also frustrated by what he viewed as generous public sector compensation. He's worked for 40 years at private companies but said he never had a pension or more than two weeks of paid vacation. His current employer doesn't offer a 401(k).Salaries and benefits for 2 million federal employees, including military and civilian personnel, accounted for about 4.3% of the nation's $6.8 trillion in annual spending in fiscal 2024. According to the CBO, social safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and benefits for veterans and military personnel account for more than 50% of the US budget.If DOGE does find savings, Knouse would like to see lower taxes, better healthcare for retirees, and more Social Security.\"I'm hoping that he could also cut the pay scale for federal employees, or any future hiring by the federal government, because it's got to balance out,\" Knouse said, referring to Trump and the DOGE office's cuts.In general, full-time federal workers can start receiving their full pension once they hit the minimum retirement age of 62. Those who've worked two decades or more for the federal government can retire earlier. Foreign service officers at USAID and the State Department — as well as law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers — can retire after 20 years and qualify for larger pension payouts after hitting that anniversary.I asked the people I interviewed how they viewed federal pensions and whether they wished the private sector still offered them. These \"defined benefit plans,\" which guarantee a certain payout, have become less common in the private sector as employers have adopted more \"defined contribution plans\" like 401(k)s or employee stock ownership, which offer varying payouts based on the market.Swor, for her part, was OK with pensions being eliminated in both sectors.\"I think people might be waking up that this is our money,\" Swor said of federal pensions. \"Why not just receive Social Security?\"Richard Myers, a 67-year-old retired commercial real estate developer in Nevada, felt conflicted about the federal pension system. On one hand, he understood that the government has to provide good benefits to attract talent. But it seemed overly cushy to him that certain workers could retire with a full pension — maybe even at 45 if they entered the government young enough — and go on to have another career.Ultimately, he said he understood a pension like this for military or law enforcement officers, as well as someone like Reniers, who had to move around a lot overseas at the government's request.\"After 20 years, you've probably paid your dues,\" Myers said. \"But someone with a desk job in Washington, DC?\"He said he joked with his friends that there would be a revolution in the US — not rich versus poor but public sector versus private sector, because workers in the latter category arriving at retirement age will be asking, \"How do they have all this extra money?\"While most people I spoke with didn't completely agree with the way the Elon Musk-linked DOGE office was implementing the cuts, the pursuit of finding and eliminating government waste appealed to them. So did Trump's \"America First\" mantra, which partly explained their skepticism of USAID.Cynthia Bean, a 64-year-old from Indiana, said she had never heard of the agency and didn't understand why \"billions of our tax dollars are being funneled through it to nonprofits in other countries.\"Bean, who owned a real estate title business for 20 years, said she voted for Trump because he talked about running the US government like a business.She said she didn't have a problem helping other countries prevent and treat HIV/AIDS or other diseases. People also need water and power, she added. Some 83% of USAID programs, including those that invested in disease prevention and clean water, have been cut by the Trump administration.Joyce Weaver, an 80-year-old senior home care aide in Pennsylvania and a Democrat who voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, said the government may be overspending on millions of federal employees.\"What Trump is doing needs to be done but not with so much pain for so many and so much danger for the whole country,\" Weaver said.Trump's criticism of federal workers, including calling them \"crooked\" and \"dishonest,\" and Musk's suggestion that some government roles are \"fake jobs\" resonated with several of the people I interviewed.\"We do need government jobs, and I don't care what anyone says, they do deserve a pension,\" Paul Alto, 61, who lives in Cleveland, said. \"But I think there are a lot of jobs that were made up.\"As for Reniers, she recognized she's more privileged than most but said that's not all due to government pay and benefits. She has homes in Maryland and Belgium because of her inheritance. To address that inequality, she said, Americans should support taxing the rich.\"Why aren't Americans fighting for pensions at their own companies, as opposed to saying federal workers like me shouldn't get a pension?\" Reniers said. \"In America, so many people are working so hard for low wages. I get there's a discrepancy between them and the wealthy. So I'm like, let's tax the rich.\"","summary":"Six Americans said they didn't want their tax dollars to pay for high salaries and generous benefits for certain government employees.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-americans-agree-with-doge-firings-federal-workers-pensions-pay-2025-5","image":"https://i.insider.com/6827914ec6ad288d148134f6?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 07:19:01","author":"Catherine Boudreau","authors":["Catherine Boudreau"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.504},{"id":323977762,"title":"Evangelical Trump-ally issues prophecy about 'great event' that will change America forever","text":"An evangelical MAGA Christian preacher has warned about a 'great event' that will strike the United States and 'render two groups of people obsolete.'\n\nMario Murillo - who famously endorsed Donald Trump and claimed Kamala Harris' campaign was 'demonic' - made the bizarre and vague warning which took aim at atheists and churches that don't believe in the supernatural. \n\nThe outspoken preacher made the chilling prediction at the Living Proof Crusade in Texas this week.\n\n'A great event is coming to the United States,' he proclaimed. \n\n'It'll be unlike anything America has ever seen. It will top all of the epochal things that have happened to our country. \n\n'And when it comes, and it will, it is going to render two groups of people obsolete. They will no longer be in business. They will be out of business.'\n\nMurillo went on to insist the event would be 'so stupendous, so monumental that it is very difficult for me to find the words to adequately describe it.'\n\nThe pastor often boasts of performing miracles on his supporters, healing various ailments and illnesses.\n\nHe warned that the unnamed event would tear open the 'very thin veil' between the natural and supernatural.\n\n'It will be generally accepted that the supernatural is real. The psychiatric community is going to admit that it's real.'\n\nHe asked: 'Are you listening to what I'm saying? Medical doctors will admit that it's real.' \n\nSimultaneously, 'demonic' events will begin occurring alongside spiritual events, likely on university campuses and for the news media to see.\n\nIn a warning to 'non-supernatural churches', Murillo said: 'You better bring back speaking in tongues. You better bring back prophecy. You better bring back casting out the devil. You better bring back laying hands on the sick.' \n\nMurillo then shifted to politics, warning ' The nations of the world are going to gang up on us. And do everything in their power to single out conservatives, Christians, and patriots. \n\n'God revealed that the Church has three and a half years to wake up, unify, get on fire, and begin speaking out. Men and women of God who preach the truth are the heroes of this era right now.' \n\nAhead of the election, he took part in a four-day sermon also attended by JD Vance about the future of America.\n\n'I don't want a devil in the White House,' Murillo said, speaking of Harris.\n\n'God is saying to the Church, ''Will you wake up and realize that I'm giving you the authority to stop this thing?'' he said. 'You have the authority.'\n\nHe sensationally claimed the Secret Service 'wanted' Trump to be assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania, and urged followers: 'We gotta stop the insanity going on in the United States.","summary":"The outspoken preacher, who famously endorsed Donald Trump and claimed Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign was 'demonic', made the chilling prediction in Texas this week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14741435/Trump-prophet-mario-murillo-warning-america.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/03/98674503-0-image-a-161_1747965739292.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 05:49:06","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.05},{"id":324074906,"title":"Inside the vicious CBS News 'bloodbath' where staff are fighting, crying and 'resent' Gayle King","text":"CBS is crisis - with staffers crying in the hallways, fighting over story coverage and seating, and scrambling to update their resumes amid fears of mass layoffs.\n\nInsiders have told the Daily Mail that morale has plummeted across the network, from the flagship Sunday news show 60 Minutes to CBS Mornings, sparked by a looming $8.4 billion merger and a $20 billion lawsuit.\n\nThe tumult is turning into a 'bloodbath', one employee said, with feverish speculation rife among colleagues as to who will get the axe next.\n\nTensions are running particularly high about reports that CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, is preparing to slash $500 million in costs in preparation for the lucrative merger with Skydance Media against the backdrop of a ratings freefall.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's legal action against 60 Minutes over claims that an interview with former presidential candidate Kamala Harris was deceptively edited continues to cause deep division.\n\nThere have been suggestions recently that bosses at Paramount are entertaining a $50 million payout as the Trump administration considers whether to renew CBS's broadcast license.\n\nThe chaos has intensified since the abrupt exit of CEO Wendy McMahon on Monday, who indicated that she opposed settling with President Trump, and described her final months in the job as 'challenging'.\n\n'It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,' McMahon wrote in her terse exit memo. 'It's time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.'\n\nHer sudden departure sent shockwaves through the offices of The Early Show and CBS Evening News and has prompted frenzied gossip about which household names will follow her out the door.\n\n'[Wendy leaving] really hurt us a lot,' said one CBS employee. 'I've seen people crying in the halls. Everyone is going into offices and conference rooms to whisper and strategize.'\n\nFed-up sources observed that there was growing resentment towards legendary CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King, who is reportedly facing a fight to have her $10million contract renewed when it ends in September.\n\nAnd there might be more exits to come. Multiple sources told the Daily Mail that 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley could also be on the way out.\n\n'It's marquee name after marquee name. People don't want to say it out loud in the office but the entire space debacle really hurt us,' a 60 Minutes staffer said of King's participation in Blue Origin's all-female spaceflight on April 2. 'Gayle being part of that is not a good look for our brand.'\n\n'I think a lot of people resent Gayle for that,' continued the insider. 'I know I do.'\n\nThere was a general sense of embarrassment, said one Early Show producer. 'I almost feel like apologizing when I tell people where I work. I hate it here.'\n\nBut the most palpable impact appears to have been felt at 60 Minutes, where staff have compared the atmosphere to a 'sinking ship'.\n\n'We're in the middle of a bloodbath,' a staffer said. 'The axe is falling, people are leaving, no one knows what to do next. We're all updating our resumes because it really feels like this is a sinking ship.'\n\nThe tension has spilled out into the open, with blazing rows in the office over story coverage and petty squabbles concerning seating plans, sources told the Daily Mail.\n\n'Fights, and loud ones,' the insider continued. 'You can hear them in the halls. People are arguing over everything and anything. From big things, like how to report stories, to small things, like who is sitting where in the conference room.'\n\nThe deterioration of the mood in the newsroom began with the April departure of Bill Owens, the long-time executive producer of 60 Minutes, who left citing concerns about editorial independence.\n\nNow, there is speculation Pelley could also be leaving, and King's future is far from guaranteed - not least because of the backlash within CBS and beyond after the controversial spaceflight.\n\nWhen Owens quit, Pelley said on 60 Minutes: 'Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires. No one here is happy about it. But in resigning, Bill proved one thing – he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.'\n\nSignificantly adding to the pressure at the embattled news network are suggestions of the potential settlement in the $20 billion lawsuit from Trump. \n\nThe president claims that a 60 Minutes segment featuring Harris ahead of the 2020 presidential election was deceptively edited in an attempt to assist her election chances.\n\nTwo versions of Harris's interview were aired in which she appears to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war, according to the federal lawsuit.\n\nCBS News has maintained that the then-vice president simply gave a lengthy answer, which was cut down due to time constraints, and that the lawsuit was 'completely' without merit'. The network has asked a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nBut the President's lawyers insist that CBS was being partisan, and trying to make Harris's answer more coherent.\n\nAs CBS and Paramount Global are working towards their merger with Skydance, Trump's Federal Communications Commission has said that it would not approve the deal until the lawsuit was settled.\n\nAll the uncertainty has led to frazzled nerves and personal turmoil for the journalists still working for CBS News.\n\n'People are literally keeping antacid at their desks,' said the Early Show staffer. 'I've never seen anything quite this bad.'\n\nA representative for CBS News said the network 'doesn't comment on personnel matters' in a statement to the Daily Mail.","summary":"As several high profile exits have rocked CBS News, staffers are anticipating a bloodbath - and popping antacids at their desks, insiders tell the Daily Mail.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14735395/cbs-news-staff-bloodbath-infighting-resent-gayle-king.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/00/98671689-0-image-m-18_1747955799031.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 05:36:20","author":"Editor,Steve Helling","authors":["Editor","Steve Helling"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":324058192,"title":"Column: 'Truth Teller' Bruce Springsteen Slimes Trump as Treasonous","text":"When Donald Trump is president, it’s considered dangerously authoritarian if he accuses someone of treason – and it’s considered heroic “truth-telling” when you accuse Trump of being a treasonous authoritarian.\n\n The latest exhibit is leftist rock star/first-rate tax evader Bruce Springsteen.

The headline blared: “Bruce Springsteen is fighting for the America he sings about: On a powerful new live recording, the rock legend isn’t warning us about approaching authoritarianism. ‘This is happening now.’”\n\nThis is what liberal journalists do. When they fail in their mission to elect Democrats, then democracy is vanishing. When Trump attacks the liberal media and seeks to deprive it of government subsidies, the “authoritarianism” is happening. That’s funny: many voters feel that using government money to push for a permanently Democrat-run government is anti-democracy.\n\nBut at The Post, democracy is always dying in darkness when Trump’s in charge. Richards began the piece: “When Bruce Springsteen described the Trump administration as ‘corrupt, incompetent and treasonous’ from a concert stage in England last week, there was no need to gasp. Springsteen is a truth teller.”\n\nRichards ended the piece with the same crusading tone: Springsteen’s messaging “confirms that we’re not talking about corruption, incompetence and treason in some vague future tense. This isn’t a rock star’s paranoid ramble about a still-forming authoritarianism. If you’ve ever believed this man, believe him now.”\n\nThe Post’s front-page motto could be “Paranoid rambling about Trump since 2015.”\n\nIn between these grand proclamations, Richards put on his “fact checking” hat: “On Monday, without evidence, Trump posted on social media that Springsteen, Beyoncé and Bono were paid by Kamala Harris to appear at her 2024 presidential campaign events.”\n\nWithout evidence? Shortly after Trump’s message, The New York Times offered some facts: “Ms. Harris paid $1 million to Ms. Winfrey’s production company for a live-streamed town hall in Detroit, according to campaign-finance records.” It wasn’t a “personal fee” for Oprah, so it somehow doesn’t count.\n\nLikewise, the Times found “Beyoncé headlined a rally for Ms. Harris in her hometown of Houston for an abortion-rights event, and Ms. Harris’s campaign paid the singer’s company $165,000 in November for ‘campaign event production’.” Everyone was led to believe Beyonce would sing, but she did not. She did get a check.\n\nThe Times also said “no records available yet show any payment from Ms. Harris’s campaign” to Springsteen. He endorsed Harris in a video, not on a rally stage. But nobody was fact-checking Springsteen when he claimed the Harris-Walz ticket represented the “working class,” as if Bidenomics was terrific for average Americans.\n\nForbes estimates that Springsteen is a billionaire, since he sold his music catalog for about a half-billion dollars in 2021. But he will sit in a diner and put on a plaid jacket and play himself up as an aw-shucks commoner when he endorses inflation-inflaming Democrats for president. That’s not exactly “truth-telling.” It’s about as authentic as his sketchy tax returns.","summary":"When Donald Trump is president, it’s considered dangerously authoritarian if he accuses someone of treason – and it’s considered heroic “truth-telling” when you accuse Trump of being a treasonous authoritarian.\n\n The latest exhibit is leftist rock star/first-rate tax evader Bruce Springsteen.
