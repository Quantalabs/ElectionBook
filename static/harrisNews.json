Rubenstein, and subsequently named himself as the new chairman.The Kennedy Center, established in 1971 as the United States' national cultural center, is undergoing its most significant leadership change in decades. The situation has created tension in the arts community, with some artists canceling appearances while others have used their performances to make political statements.The controversy threatens to overshadow O'Brien's achievement as he joins the ranks of comedy legends like David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Carol Burnett.What To KnowO'Brien, 61, was named the recipient in January, shortly before Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center board.The former Harvard Lampoon editor and writer for Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons rose to prominence in 1993 when he replaced David Letterman on Late Night. After 16 years, O'Brien briefly hosted The Tonight Show before an intensely public dispute with NBC led to his departure.He has since found success with shows on TBS, podcasts, and travel series, recently receiving acclaim for hosting the Academy Awards.What Is The Kennedy Center?The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was opened in 1971, by then-President Nixon, in tribute to JFK, a lifelong advocate for the arts before his assassination.Serving as the United States' national cultural center, in Washington D.C. it is one of the country's premier destinations for the performing arts, featuring a wide range of performances, including theater, ballet, music, and opera.The Kennedy Center offers educational programs and hosts the annual Kennedy Center Honors to celebrate significant contributions to the arts in America.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump: \"The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation.\"Republicans against Trump: \"We're rapidly looking more and more like a totalitarian country. Trump just purged the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees...\"Mike Nellis, former senior advisor to Kamala Harris, posted on X: \"Trump appointing himself Chair of the Kennedy Center makes sense when you remember Musk is running the country and he's bored as hell.\"Collin Rugg, news personality and co-owner of Trending Politics, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \" Trump terminates the chairman of the Kennedy Center in D.C., appoints himself as the new chairman then immediately bans drag shows targeting youth.

If they do make the leap, they would vacate tough House seats, eliminate the Democrats’ advantage of incumbency, and force party campaign operatives to recruit new candidates — and spend more money — to keep those districts in the next Congress.\n\nThe trend could complicate the Democrats’ path to winning back control of the House in the 2026 midterms, when party leaders are optimistic about their chances of seizing the Speaker’s gavel after four years in the minority wilderness. \n\nThe midterm cycle has been historically brutal for the party that controls the White House, and House Republicans are already clinging to just a tiny majority in the current Congress. If Democrats net three House seats in November of 2026, they’ll control the chamber — an outcome Democrats are confident they’ll achieve. \n\nFor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, seeing talented politicians who can win in swing districts reach for higher office is just a reality of the job.\n\n“House Democrats’ overperformance last cycle proves no one is better at recruiting and working to elect genuine and authentic candidates than the DCCC — and we’ll do it again this cycle,” DCCC spokesman Viet Shelton said in a statement.\n\nStill, the razor-thin margins in the House have left leaders in both parties scrambling to maximize every small advantage that comes along. With that in mind, Republicans are practically drooling at the prospect that a few of their top Democratic targets might leave the lower chamber on their own accord before voters ever go to the polls. \n\n“House Democrats aren’t just fighting amongst themselves, they’re fighting an uphill battle for the majority while watching their own ranks thin out as ambition takes priority over party survival,” one GOP campaign operative said. \n\nThe list of Democratic incumbents considering a run at another office is not a long one. But it’s grown in recent weeks with the announced retirements of several sitting senators, and it includes a handful of vulnerable frontliners whose experience and regional branding has given Democrats an edge even in some districts carried by President Trump.\n\nIn Maine, for instance, Rep. Jared Golden (D) is reportedly facing some pressure from allies to run for either the Senate, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is vying for a sixth term in 2026, or the governor’s mansion, where the current resident, Democrat Janet Mills, will be term-limited out of office at the end of next year. \n\nGolden squeaked to victory last November, winning a fourth term in a district that Trump carried, and Republicans have perennially made him a top target on their pick-up list. Golden’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about his future plans.\n\nAnother Democratic frontliner, Michigan Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, is also considering a run for the Senate following the announced retirement of two-term Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), according to local reports. \n\nTrump had won the state in last year’s presidential contest. But Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) had successfully jumped from the House to the Senate despite those national headwinds. And McDonald Rivet, who out-performed Kamala Harris by a healthy margin last year to win her first term in the House, is weighing whether to follow in Slotkin’s footsteps. Her office did not respond last week. \n\nIn Minnesota, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig said last month that she is “giving serious consideration” to a run for the Senate after Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) announced she will bow out at the end of the term. \n\nCraig easily carried her district last year, by almost 14 points, en route to a fourth term — a performance that far outpaced Harris, who won the region by 5 points. But Craig was a frontliner in her first three races for the lower chamber, and the seat could become more competitive without her on the House ballot. \n\nA campaign spokesperson said Craig’s decision will likely arrive “in weeks, not months.”\n\nNew Hampshire is another battleground state that could see some shake ups this cycle. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) is retiring at the end of 2026 after 18 years in the upper chamber, and two House Democrats are eyeing the opportunity to replace her. \n\nRep. Chris Pappas, who was just elected to a fourth term, is one, according to numerous reports. And first-term Rep. Maggie Goodlander is also weighing a run, according to a person familiar with her thinking. \n\nPappas is not on the Democrats’ frontline list heading into next year’s midterms. But he was a part of that swing-district group in previous cycles, and the Republicans’ campaign arm has him listed among their top targets in 2026. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment about his plans. \n\nHouse Democrats, to be sure, are not alone in having members eyeing higher office.\n\nMost notably, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), one of only three House Republicans to win a district that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in 2024, is eyeing a run for governor.\n\nAnd the open Michigan Senate seat or the state’s gubernatorial race could draw interest from Reps. John James (R), who represents a more competitive House district. James previously ran for Senate in 2020 and 2018.\n\nRepublicans’ success in any swing districts that are vacated by Democrats seeking higher office is not a guarantee, though, as key races in the 2024 cycle showed.\n\nWhile Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Mich.) won the seat vacated by now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Democratic Reps. Dave Min (Calif.) and Eugine Vindman (Va.) won competitive races in the seats vacated by former Reps. Katie Porter (Calif.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.).\n\nRedistricting slated for this year in Ohio, where there is an open gubernatorial race and special Senate election, could add another wrinkle for Democrats. Redrawn districts could potentially encourage some Democrats like Rep. Greg Landsman (D) and Rep. Emilia Sykes (D-Ohio), a frontliner this cycle, to abandon reelection bids and seek higher office, as Inside Elections analyst Nathan Gonzales wrote.\n\nDespite the possible loss of swing-district incumbents, Democratic leaders are voicing confidence that they’ll prevail in the midterms and seize power in the House in 2027, when they’re vowing to provide a check on a president they deem to be out of control.\n\n“Donald Trump and the Republicans are crashing the economy in real time and potentially driving us toward a recession,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who’s in line to become Speaker if Democrats do take over, told reporters last week in Brooklyn. \n\n“I’m very confident that next November we’re taking back control of the United States House of Representatives.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHouse Democrats vying to flip control of the lower chamber in next&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: House Democrats’ midterm chances may be impacted by the appeal of seeking higher positions first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/house-democrats-midterm-chances-may-be-impacted-by-the-appeal-of-seeking-higher-positions/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2025/03/Dems_032325_APGN.png?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 21:13:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":303341922,"title":"Stephen A.

Smith has launched a blistering attack on his own employees for voting Democrat in last year's presidential election.\n\nSmith, who recently emerged as a shock candidate to run for president in 2028, went on a furious rant about the staff working behind the scenes on his YouTube show while discussing Kamala Harris and the Democrats failure back in November.\n\n'Rather than telling us what we should vote against, maybe you should present us with options of what to vote for. Just a thought,' he said about the Democrats on the latest episode of The Stephen A. Smith Show.\n\nThe ESPN personality then looked beyond the camera and said to his employees: 'I mean, my god. Are you okay Michael with me suggesting that? Are you okay with me Sherry for suggesting that? Rashawn Galen and all of a bunch of leftists that’s under my umbrella trying to act like they’re independents when they’re full of it!\n\n'I'm talking about my own damn staff.

The rest of these damn people working for me, I mean, what left-wing party are you associated with? I mean, you gotta believe this stuff. You gotta listen to it to hear it.'\n\nSmith has been flirting with the possibility of running for president after a national survey revealed last month that he would receive more support than several high-profile Democrat hopefuls in three years' time.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com shortly after the survey was released, the 57-year-old left the door open to run if the American people call for it, despite stressing that he has no personal desire to do so.\n\nHe has frequently taken aim at the Democrats since Harris' resounding election defeat in November, accusing them of focusing too much on talking down Donald Trump than making their own case.\n\nHowever, Trump has also come in for criticism from Smith of late over his stance on DEI.\n\nIn his first week back in office, the president issued a series of executive orders to restrict DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) initiatives in the US after branding them a form of 'discrimination'.\n\nDEI laws and measures had been under attack for years by Republicans who believe they threaten merit-based hiring, promotion and educational opportunities of white people, specifically white men. Some Asian Americans also argue DEI unfairly limits opportunities for students and workers, while certain members of the black community claim it undermines years of progress.\n\nHowever, supporters of the programs are adamant that they are necessary to ensure institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse populations.\n\nSmith finds himself on the latter side of the debate after accusing Trump of 'forgetting' about the black, Hispanic and young voters who helped him return to office.\n\n'Nobody is calling out the president Donald Trump. I will,' the ESPN host and political commentator said in a passionate rant on the latest edition of 'First Take'. 'And I'm not gonna call him names and all of this stuff like stupid folks on the left are doing, engaging in incendiary rhetoric. It's unnecessary, it's immature and it's uncalled for.\n\n'He's the President of the United States, treat him with the respect that he deserves. But in the same breath, call him to the carpet for stuff that he's doing.' \n\nSmith went on to challenge Trump to a live TV debate, saying: 'President Trump, I’m happy to sit down with you to have that conversation, sir. I’d love for you to try to defend it.\n\n'Vice President Vance, you too. Pete Hegseth, you too. Stephen A. Smith is calling you out on national television.\n\n'I’d love for you to sit down with the cameras rolling and try to defend this.

Our proposal is a fair and reasonable compromise which crucially preserves the normal democratic processes of the Dail.\n\n“You cannot be in government and opposition at the same time, these democratic distinctions must be recognised and accepted by government for our system to work. We look forward to your immediate response.”\n\nPublic anger at speaking rights row\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin was told the Dáil speaking rights row was an \"affront to Irish democracy\" and asked \"is this the start of a dictatorship?\".\n\nMr Martin previously claimed the public \"aren't excited\" about the speaking rights row.\n\nHowever, messages to the Taoiseach, seen by BreakingNews.ie following a Freedom of Information request, show the public are very angry about the issue.\n\nThe messages, sent on are after January 22nd when the Dáil was suspended as opposition TDs protested over the matter and blocked the nomination of the Taoiseach, were all critical of the Government.\n\nThe messages, sent on are after January 22nd when the Dáil was suspended as opposition TDs protested over the matter and blocked the nomination of the Taoiseach, were all critical of the Government.\n\nThey supported the Opposition's efforts to block the move and their \"rightful indignation\".\n\nOn the evening of January 22nd, one person wrote: \"I think it's utterly farcical that TDs who support the Government are attempting to speak on Opposition time.\n\n\"I fully support attempts to disrupt proceedings today as this cannot stand.\"\n\nA message on the morning of January 23rd read: \"Micheál, is this the start of a dictatorship? You're deliberately taking away the democratic rights of the Opposition by cutting down their speaking time. The Independents who helped you form government have no place on the opposition benches taking time away from your actual opposition.\n\n\"This is an affront to Irish democracy. The painting of the opposition parties (Sinn Féin, Labour, Social Democrats etc) as the bad guys in this scenario is a deliberate projection on your part to avoid accountability for your shady dealings.\"\n\nMcGregor's unlikely Áras bid\n\nThe fallout from Conor McGregor's controversial White House meeting with Donald Trump, in which he pushed unfounded claims about immigration, is still ongoing.\n\nMcGregor has claimed he will use the meeting with the US president as the platform to launch his own bid for the presidency.\n\nHowever, it is highly unlikely McGregor will secure enough nominations to get on the ballot.\n\nTo become a presidential candidate, candidates must secure the backing of at least 20 Oireachtas members or four local authorities.\n\nThe election will take place on a yet to be confrimed date before November.\n\nAccording to the Irish Daily Mail, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will announce their candidates soon and intent to block McGregor's bid.\n\nGarron Noone deactivates social media accounts after immigration video\n\nGarron Noone has deactivated his social media accounts following backlash over a video in which he discussed immigration.\n\nThe Mayo man became a TikTok/Instagram sensation with his sketches and catchphrase \"follow me, I'm delicious\".\n\nNoone normally discusses light topics in his videos.\n\nHowever, he said he had been asked to discuss immigration by his followers after Conor McGregor's controversial White House meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nNoone has since deactivated his accounts. He had a sizeable following including 1.7 million people on TikTok alone.\n\nWhile some people are still criticising Noone over the video, fellow social media influencers have defended him online, along with some politicians.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane said: \"It’s sad to see Garron Noone has deactivated his social media accounts. I love his content & he is as decent as he is funny. There is not a racist bone in his body & nor is it racist to talk about immigration. Even if we do so a little clumsily.

Over 95% of kindergarteners in the 2019-20 school year were vaccinated for measles, the third class in the last four years to be at or above the target for herd immunity (The 2018-19 kindergarten class was just a tick below). The 2020-21 class saw a drop below 94%, the lowest in the past decade. The next two years dropped to and hovered around the 93% line, with the 2023-24 dropping below it. The pattern is similar to the decline in polio and whooping cough vaccinations.\n\nThere are roughly 4 million kindergarten students in the U.S., meaning that each percent drop is an additional 40,000 kindergarteners who are unvaccinated. Some states and localities have seen more drastic percentage drops, with Idaho from under 90% vaccinated to under 80%. A total of 39 states are below the 95% herd immunity mark, and just seven states have avoided a decrease in measles vaccination rates compared to before the pandemic. Gaines County, Texas, home of the most recent major measles outbreak, has a kindergarten vaccination rate of 82%.\n\nGoing back to 2021, the share of parents who “delayed or skipped some childhood vaccines” has almost doubled from 9% to 17%. The share of people who think that “the risks of childhood vaccines for [the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine] outweigh the benefits” has risen from 10% in 2020 to 18% now. Since 2023, trust in the CDC has dropped 5 points, trust in state and local public health officials dropped 10 points, and trust in the Food and Drug Administration dropped 12 points. We’ll revisit the FDA’s numbers later.\n\nIt isn’t hard to see where things went wrong with respect to vaccines during the COVID pandemic. The vaccine mandates imposed on the public did not follow “the science” or any lines of reason. Healthy adults who were not at serious risk from the virus were mandated to get the COVID vaccine in order to keep their jobs. Thousands were fired as a result, including U.S. service members. Pockets of California forced people to get vaccinated if they wanted to go into restaurants, leading to In-N-Out temporarily closing its location in San Francisco.\n\nThe vaccine mandates extended to children, ranging from requiring children to be vaccinated to return to school (or placing onerous testing and quarantine restrictions on unvaccinated children) to requiring children to be vaccinated to play sports or go to restaurants. Again, all available evidence indicated that COVID-19 was less dangerous for children than the flu.\n\nMandates for children and for adults who were not old, obese, or otherwise compromised by the virus were justified by the claim that the vaccine would slow the spread of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci told TikTok influencers that they would not have to worry about catching COVID-19 if they were vaccinated, while then-President Joe Biden flatly told the public that “you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.”\n\nThat is ultimately not how the vaccines worked. As my colleague Christopher Tremoglie observed in December 2021, “Fully vaccinated adults are testing positive for COVID-19 at about the same rate as unvaccinated people, regardless of how many booster shots they’ve gotten. And while the vaccines may prevent transmission marginally, insofar as they might help reduce the number of days a person is contagious, there is little evidence that they are doing anything at all to prevent the spread of the omicron variant.”\n\nBack to the FDA, trust in the agency dropped 12 points from 2023 to 2025. This stems from a variety of factors all related to its role in approving vaccines for the public. That includes the FDA rushing the typical process in order to make the vaccine available as soon as possible, which raised questions (fairly or unfairly) about the safety of the vaccine, or continued boosters. That was amplified by the pure partisanship on display during the 2020 elections, in which Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris undermined trust in the FDA’s neutrality by claiming that President Donald Trump was “exerting political pressure on the FDA” to approve the vaccines.\n\nAfter Biden and Harris won, they then turned around and mandated that people be vaccinated for COVID-19 as a condition of their employment. The FDA was used as a political prop in a process that culminated in Biden’s private sector vaccine mandate through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The FDA also suffered the consequences of state and local health bureaucrats and their war on the unvaccinated as mentioned above.\n\nThat the FDA is suffering the biggest trust crisis among major public health institutions shows that the duplicity and heavy-handedness of public health officials on COVID-19 vaccines struck a note with people. After all, the FDA’s only notable role in the pandemic was approving these vaccines, making the agency synonymous with them in the public’s eye. Combine that with the steep drop in trust for state and local health officials who imposed vaccine mandates on people, and you can see the looming resentment and distrust in vaccines that was fostered during the pandemic.\n\nThe justified doubts about what the COVID-19 vaccines did and did not do based on public health officials misleading the public have bled into people’s attitudes about other vaccines. The anger toward public health officials who pursued incoherent, excessively strict vaccine policies has created more skepticism toward other vaccination standards. According to Gallup polling in 2024, the percentage of people who think the government should require all parents to have their children vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles has dropped from 62% in 2019 to a simple majority of just 51%. The percentage who think childhood vaccination is extremely important has dropped from 58% to 40%.\n\nRFK JR. ADVOCATES VACCINATION AS MEASLES OUTBREAK CONTINUES\n\nNone of this is to say that these newfound vaccine doubts are a justified reaction. The effectiveness and safety of the measles vaccine and others have been proven over the course of decades. But it is to say that these reactions are a natural result of the public health bureaucracy lighting its credibility on fire in order to manipulate the public into taking its preferred actions during the pandemic. Experts are only worth as much as the trust people are willing to put in them, and experts who abuse that trust risk contaminating the credibility of their field in the eyes of the people they misled.\n\nThis is why a reckoning for COVID-19 policies, which the public health bureaucracy has largely avoided, is so necessary. The process of rebuilding this trust, and rebuilding faith in successful vaccines, begins with admissions of wrongdoing and mistakes. Pushing the issue under the carpet and hoping people just come flocking back to “the science” is only turning a blind eye to the damage COVID-19 policies did to public health in this country.","summary":"Communities around the United States are wrestling with a rising number of measles outbreaks.

The comments come as Harris is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor of California, according to a report from CBS News, with a person close to the former vice president's decision-making process telling the outlet that Harris would likely make the decision by the end of summer. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many consider to be a presidential contender in 2028, is term limited from running again in 2026, opening the door to what is expected to be a large field of potential Democratic candidates to seek the highest office in the dependably progressive state. TRUMP SAYS KEEPING MALES OUT OF WOMEN'S SPORTS IS '90-10 ISSUE' One former Harris advisor told CBS News that the former vice president would be a \"great\" fit for the job, noting her experience at both the national and state level. \"On a national level, what Newsom has been able to do with that job, there is a lot of upside with what she can do as the governor of the fifth-largest economy with her name ID, when our party is looking for national leadership and California looking for good governance – especially at a time when California is going through a lot,\" the former advisor said. But Harris also faces questions over how she handled her bid for president, which included accusations that she consistently shied away from doing interviews.

And one other thing, we're going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that because they missed their turn because of Covid.'\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are yet to comment publicly on the president's comments, and no date has yet been set for their invite.\n\nMany eyes will be on Kelce if and when the Chiefs do go, given his girlfriend Taylor Swift's very public campaigning against Trump before the 2024 election.\n\nWhile Kelce never publicly endorsed either candidate, Swift was firmly in Kamala Harris and the Democrats' camp, before they ultimately lost to Trump and the Republicans. \n\nThe Mahomes, meanwhile, have regularly praised Trump - especially the wife and mother of quarterback Patrick.\n\nWhen asked about Brittany and Randi, Trump said: 'I love those two women. They're so great and so loyal. I met Patrick's mother... at the game [the Super Bowl].\n\n'She came over. And Brittany, I've seen so much of Brittany that just, you know, being so loyal and great and beautiful.' \n\nThe Chiefs have twice been to the White House in recent years, although both under the Biden administration in 2023 and 2024.\n\nTaylor SwiftKansas City ChiefsWashington DC\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump reveals he has invited Travis Kelce and the Chiefs to visit the White House in shock decision\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Donald Trump has revealed he will host Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs at the White House after their 2020 visit was canceled due to the Covid pandemic.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14528537/Donald-Trump-Travis-Kelce-Chiefs-White-House-Super-Bowl.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/23/16/96488293-0-image-m-10_1742748301230.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 16:47:17","author":"Ben Nagle,Editor","authors":["Ben Nagle","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.026},{"id":303317648,"title":"Luttig: \"A rebuke from the nation's highest court … could well cripple Mr. Trump's presidency and tarnish his legacy\"","text":"Former-Judge Luttig wrote a guest essay in the New York Times, titled \"It's Trump vs. the Courts, and It Won't End Well for Trump.\" The essay concludes with these two paragraphs:\n\nIf the president oversteps his authority in his dispute with Judge Boasberg, the Supreme Court will step in and assert its undisputed constitutional power \"to say what the law is.\" A rebuke from the nation's highest court in his wished-for war with the nation's federal courts could well cripple Mr. Trump's presidency and tarnish his legacy. And Chief Justice Marshall's assertion that it is the duty of the courts to say what the law is will be the last word.\n\nI think every sentence is demonstrably incorrect. First, the Court has no power to \"assert\" its own authority. The Court lacks the power of the sword or purse.\n\nSecond, I can say with a high degree of certainty that a \"rebuke\" from the Supreme Court would do little to \"cripple Mr. Trump's presidency and tarnish his legacy.\" As for the \"legacy,\" if two impeachment trials, an alleged insurrection, and federal and state indictments didn't keep him out of the White House, then a few pages in the U.S. Reports will hardly leave a mark. By contrast, I think such a feeble effort to control Trump very well could \"cripple\" the Supreme Court.\n\nThird, Luttig tries to invoke Marbury, but in that case Chief Justice Marshall had the good sense to not assert any authority agains Jeffrson. The Court did not order the Jefferson Administration to deliver the commission, as such an order would likely be ignored. Likewise, Marshall never ordered President Jackson to do anything. Marbury teaches the judiciary to avoid unwinnable conflicts with the President.\n\nLet me try to put this conflict in perspective. Donald Trump was able to roll over Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and every other politician that stood in his path. Does anyone think John Roberts can do better? Does anyone think Roberts's press statement to respond to Trump's social media post even moved the needle? Op-eds like this from people like Luttig likely give the Chief some faint echoes of praise within his echo chamber, but will not register beyond the Capital District. (I think Texas would be considered District 12.)\n\nI'll repeat what I wrote last week:\n\nThe Constitutional Crisis is a coin with two sides. Trump causes judges to overact, and judges cause Trump to overreact. Any resolution must be bilateral, not unilateral. Roberts could de-escalate the situation by promptly reversing some of these out-of-control lower court rulings. But instead, he would rather sit on his hands and pontificate. I've long said that the Chief Justice is living in a different reality than the rest of us. This episode proves it. There are three co-equal branches of government; the judiciary is not supreme. Chief Justice Marshall had the good sense to avoid a confrontation with Presidents Jefferson and Jackson. But Roberts apparently thinks this sort of statement will make everything better.

He said a government shutdown would have been \"15 or 20 times worse\" for the American people and would have allowed Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to carry out more drastic cuts.Schumer added that he is not making the same mistake as Biden by not stepping down amid pressure to do so. The former president initially refused to end his reelection bid following a poor CNN presidential debate performance, but eventually dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\"No, absolutely not. I did this out of conviction,\" Schumer said, adding that Democrats are still united in \"fighting Donald Trump every step of the way.\"What People Are SayingDanielle Vinson, professor of politics and international affairs at Furman University, told Newsweek: \"I don't expect Schumer to be tossed out as leader just yet. Democrats tend to be more orderly than Republicans in replacing their leadership, and Schumer did provide protection for some senators who didn't want the shutdown.\"But given his age and the large number of younger senators who have been waiting a long time to take over, I would expect that he will be thinking about how to make a graceful exit—sort of like Pelosi did when her own members, despite her effectiveness, were demanding younger leadership.\"It will likely be up to him whether to stay in the position through the next election. I would expect that we will see more involvement of younger Democratic senators in the messaging as the year goes on.\"Christopher Borick, professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, told Newsweek: \"Certainly Schumer's leadership is showing lots of wear and tear, and Pelosi's negative critique of his decision on the continuing resolution highlights his diminished standing.\"The Democratic brand is in a terrible place, and finger-pointing is increasingly directed at party leaders in Washington. Schumer is an easy target. I think there is a growing desire among Democrats to see a change in Senate leadership, but I wouldn't underestimate Schumer's ability to survive.\"Mitch McConnell serves as a good example of a leader who could survive a damaged party brand and internal dissent by positioning himself in a way that makes a leadership change less palatable to caucus members.\"Chuck Schumer told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: \"Look, I'm not stepping down. I knew when I cast my vote against the government shutdown that there'd be a lot of controversy—and there was. But let me tell you and your audience why I did it. The CR [continuing resolution] was certainly bad, but a shutdown would be 15 or 20 times worse.\"The courts have ruled it's solely up to the executive what to shut down. With Musk and Trump, they would eviscerate the federal government. On day two, they could say SNAP, feeding hungry children? Not essential. On day four, mass transit, oil, aid to the states—not essential. We're cutting it. On day six, Medicaid—they'll cut that by 20, 30, 50, 80 percent. They'll go after Social Security, they'll go after veterans.\"When you're a leader, you have to act to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve, and I did it with pure conviction—doing what a leader should do and what was right for America and my party.\"What Happens NextSchumer could still decide not to seek reelection for another term in 2028, which would also signal an end to his Senate leadership position.","summary":"The Democratic Senate leader's says he will not step down after helping pass a GOP spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/chuck-schumer-senate-leadership-gop-bill-exit-2049282","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2613021/chuck-schumer-dc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 16:28:35","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.094},{"id":303369862,"title":"The Trump lads are abundant in New Zealand","text":"New polling shows a global trend is very much alive here, too.\n\nDonald Trump’s historic return to the presidency was powered by one demographic more than any: support from young men – white young men, especially. One of the most remarkable realities within that trend is the gap that has opened up between men and women. \n\nWomen under 30 overwhelmingly voted for Kamala Harris. Men under 30 overwhelmingly voted for Trump. That under-30 gender gap – variously ascribed to media filter bubbles, the rise of the “manosphere”, a #metoo backlash and the allure of influences including Joe Rogan, Andrew Tate and the UFC – was more than twice the size of the gap in any other age bracket.\n\nIt is not simply a US phenomenon. New polling by Essential in Australia found that, across a range of measures, men aged 18-34 thought Trump would have a positive impact at vastly greater rates than other cohorts. \n\nIn a post for the Guardian Australia, Essential’s Peter Lewis dubs this cohort “the lads”. He writes: “On everything from world peace to climate change to the Australian economy these young men are twice as likely to see Trump as a positive influence compared with the broader population.”\n\nWhat about New Zealand? Data provided to the Spinoff by Talbot Mills Research, drawing on polling conducted at the start of this month, suggests the Trump lads are very much a thing here, too. Across a survey of 1,003 people in New Zealand, 30% said they strongly or somewhat approved of the job Trump is doing as president, while 62% strongly or somewhat disapproved. That gives us a net -32 approval rating across the board. \n\nZoom in on the respondents, however, and the only category that returns a positive net approval rating is men aged under 40 – they give a net +14 assessment. It’s a stark contrast with women in the same age group, among whom the rating is -39.\n\nThe same poll asked respondents which party in New Zealand they supported. Approval ratings of Trump on that measure broke down like this:\n\nTalbot Mills also asked about perceptions of the impact of the Trump presidency on New Zealand. Here 53% said it would be negative and 17% positive, a net -36 result. That was a downward shift since the question was asked in December 2024. Then, the net result was -25, with 43% positive and 18% negative.\n\nWhen it comes to the Trump Lad, the demographic is not straightforward. Many, for example, tend to share some social views (such as on abortion) with women of the same age. In an interview with Ezra Klein published last week, Democrat polling expert David Shor suggested the gender gulf that has opened can be sheeted back to the Covid years. \n\n“We’re in the midst of a big cultural change that I think people are really underestimating,” said Shor. “If you look at zoomers, there are some really interesting ways that they’re very different in the data. They’re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them.”\n\nHe said: “If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I were going to speculate, I’d say phones and social media have a lot to do with this. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do. But I think it’s a big shift.”\n\nThe great unknown is whether that shift is a permanent paradigm adjustment or more like a bubble. The latest polling from the US suggests that diminishing opinion of Trump’s performance is being driven primarily by one factor: falling approval among men.","url":"https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/23-03-2025/the-trump-lads-are-abundant-in-new-zealand","image":"https://images.thespinoff.co.nz/1/2025/03/GettyImages-2161596340-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 16:00:36","author":"Toby Manhire","authors":["Toby Manhire"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"nz","sentiment":0.39},{"id":303282296,"title":"Democrats turn to college football star in search for 'next Obama' as party's popularity plummets","text":"Democrats turn to college football star in search for 'next Obama' as party's popularity plummets\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nBy EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT\n\nPublished: 15:37 GMT, 23 March 2025 | Updated: 15:43 GMT, 23 March 2025\n\nDemocrats are searching for their party's next star as their popularity plummets against President Donald Trump and his MAGA faithful.\n\nA top name on that list is Wes Moore, the 46-year-old governor of Maryland.\n\nJohn Ronquillo, the director of the Institute for Public Leadership and a professor at the University of Maryland, said Moore could be on the same path as Barack Obama - rising rapidly through the political ranks to ascend to the White House.\n\n'While I want to be careful with comparisons — Barack Obama is Barack Obama and Wes Moore is Wes Moore — there's no denying that they've both had a meteoric ascent to political prominence,' Ronquillo told The Hill newspaper.\n\nObama endorsed Moore's bid for governor and cut a campaign ad for him. \n\nMoore's ascendency comes as polls show voters are infuriated with the current Democratic leadership. Recent polls from NBC News and CNN showed the party is at its lowest approval rating ever: 27 percent and 29 percent, respectively. \n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore with Barack Obama\n\nNow they are looking at new leadership. \n\nAnother name being floated is California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has tipped his toe in the presidential waters, launching a podcast where he talks with conservatives at areas they have in common.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro are also being eyed for the power of their swing states. \n\nRising Democratic star hammers AOC and asks what she has 'actually done'\n\nBut Moore's resume makes him a strong contender.\n\nHis grandparents were immigrants, his father died when he was three and he was raised by his single mother, who straightened him out when he turned to petty crime as a teenager, sending him to military school\n\nMoore, whose speaking style on the campaign trail is similar to Obama's, has told the story of how one of his earliest memories is watching his father die in front of him from acute epiglottitis, a treatable condition that emergency room doctors had overlooked. \n\n'He died because he didn't get the health care he needed,' Moore said.\n\nHis mother moved him and his sisters from their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C. to the Bronx, to live with her parents.\n\nMoore graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy and went on to become a college football star, and a Rhodes scholar. He served in the Army, doing time in Afghanistan. \n\nHe and his wife Dawn married while he was on leave from the Army, eloping to Las Vegas where their ceremony was performed by an Elvis impersonator. They have two children.\n\nHis memoir, 'The Other Wes Moore,' was a New York Times bestseller. He was CEO of a major anti-poverty nonprofit, the Robin Hood Foundation.\n\nMoore is the first black governor of Maryland. Oprah Winfrey spoke at his inauguration, which was also attended by Chelsea Clinton.\n\nWes Moore along with wife Dawn and children Mia and Jamie\n\nOprah Winfrey speaks at Wes Moore's inauguration as governor of Maryland as Chelsea Clinton looks on\n\nMoore has raised his national profile, appearing at economic conferences and going on the Sunday morning political shows. \n\nAnd he was thrust into the international spotlight when a cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore in March of last year.\n\n'We are Maryland tough, and Baltimore strong,' Moore said the morning after the bridge collapse. The phrase caught on.\n\nHis time in the spotlight has drawn criticism from some in his state.\n\n'@GovWesMoore is busy running for president while ignoring Maryland,' Delegate Mark Fisher, a Republican, wrote on social media.\n\nMoore has laughed off talk of his ambitions, making a joke about it at the annual Gridiron dinner, which is a gathering of influential members of the media and top political figures. \n\n'If I actually wanted to be president, I wouldn't do any of this,' Moore said. 'Instead, I would take my case directly to the people who are in charge of our democracy: the Kremlin.' \n\nBut the fact that he was at a posh, inside-Washington dinner just fueled chatter about his ambitions.\n\nWes Moore campaigned for Kamala Harris along with Governors Tony Evers, Josh Shapiro, Kathy Hochul, Maura Healey and Gretchen Whitmer\n\nWes Moore served in the Army, going to Afghanistan\n\nPresident Joe Biden (C) delivers remarks near the wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, in the background, while standing with Maryland Governor Wes Moore\n\nGov.

The state is heavily populated by federal workers, who the Trump administration are firing. \n\nMaryland is one of the states legally challenging Trump's decision to fire government workers.\n\nMoore met with Trump in the early days of his second term but came out of that sit-down saying he cannot work with the president. He urged Maryland and other states to stand against Trump.\n\n'I come back from Washington with no illusion about what kind of partnership that this administration is trying to forge with our nation's governors,' Moore said. \n\n'And … with a clear understanding that if this first month is any indication of where things are going, we as lawmakers had better take this moment seriously and make sure that we're moving forward.'\n\nBut as Moore looks to what's next, Matthew Crenson, a longtime Maryland politics observer and professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has some words of caution.\n\n'It's easy to oversell somebody like that, because from the outside, they look perfect. Once they get in office, they have to face a lot of messy issues that will sort of spatter them with mud,' Crenson told NPR.\n\n'So far, he hasn't faced any really devastating challenges until this, and I think this will be the test. We'll be able to see whether there's really steel behind that résume.'\n\nMarylandDemocratsPoliticsDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDemocrats turn to college football star in search for 'next Obama' as party's popularity plummets\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Democrats are searching for their party's next star as their popularity plummets against President Donald Trump and his MAGA faithful.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14524381/democrats-star-wes-moore-barack-obama.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/21/20/96442977-0-image-a-41_1742587979226.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/22/7150243505937793952/1024x576_MP4_7150243505937793952.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-23 15:43:31","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.332},{"id":303285572,"title":"2 months into Trump’s second administration, the news industry faces challenges from all directions","text":"By DAVID BAUDER\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — During the first Trump administration, the biggest concern for many journalists was labels. Would they, or their news outlet, be called “fake news” or an “enemy of the people” by a president and his supporters?\n\nThey now face a more assertive President Donald Trump. In two months, a blitz of action by the nation’s new administration — Trump, chapter two — has journalists on their heels.\n\nLawsuits. A newly aggressive Federal Communications Commission. An effort to control the press corps that covers the president, prompting legal action by The Associated Press. A gutted Voice of America. Public data stripped from websites. And attacks, amplified anew.\n\n“It’s very clear what’s happening. The Trump administration is on a campaign to do everything it can to diminish and obstruct journalism in the United States,” said Bill Grueskin, a journalism professor at Columbia University.\n\n“It’s really nothing like we saw in 2017,” he said. “Not that there weren’t efforts to discredit the press, and not that there weren’t things that the press did to discredit themselves.”\n\nTrump supporters say an overdue course correction is in order\n\nSupporters of the president suggest that an overdue correction is in order to reflect new ways that Americans get information and to counter overreach by reporters. Polls have revealed continued public dissatisfaction with journalists — something that has been bedeviling the industry for years.\n\nTension between presidents and the Fourth Estate is nothing new — an unsurprising clash between desires to control a message and to ask probing, sometimes impertinent questions. Despite the atmosphere, the Republican president talks to reporters much more often than many predecessors, including Democrat Joe Biden, who rarely gave interviews.\n\nAn early signal that times had changed came when the White House invited newcomers to press briefings, including podcasters and friendly media outlets. The AP was blocked from covering pool events in a dispute over Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, setting off a flurry of First Amendment concerns among press advocates and leading the administration to assert that the White House, not the press, should determine who questions him.\n\nTwo months before the administration took office, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, had urged that changes be made.\n\n“It’s time to bring that (briefing) room in line with how readers and viewers consume the news in 2025,” Fleischer said in an interview. “They don’t get their news from The Washington Post, The New York Times and the three networks anymore. They get their news from a myriad of sources.”\n\nIn practice, some newcomers have refreshingly tried to shed light on issues important to conservatives, instead of hostile attempts to play “gotcha” by the mainstream media, Fleischer said. There were also softballs, like when the Ruthless podcast asked press secretary Karoline Leavitt if reporters who questioned border policy were “out of touch.” The conservative Real America’s Voice network tried to knock Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy off stride by asking why he wasn’t wearing a suit in the Oval Office.\n\nWhile the White House Correspondents’ Association has protested the AP’s treatment and efforts to upend tradition, it has been largely toothless. For more extensive discussions, the president and his team generally favor interviews with outlets that speak to his supporters, like Fox News.\n\nThe Trump team’s rapid response efforts to fight the ‘fake media’\n\nThe White House has also established a “Rapid Response 47” account on X to disseminate its views and attack journalists or stories it objects to. The feed’s stated goals are supporting the president and “holding the Fake Media accountable.”\n\nLeavitt, 27, hasn’t hesitated to go toe to toe with reporters, often with a smile, and Tik-Tok collects some of those moments.\n\n“We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, and we will not accept that,” she said at her first press briefing. It stood in contrast to Trump’s 2017 press secretary, Sean Spicer, who got into an angry confrontation with the press about the size of the president’s inauguration crowd on his first day in the White House, and never truly recovered from it.\n\nShowing the spread of the administration’s disciplined approach, the Defense Department also has a rapid response account that says it “fights fake news.” The Pentagon has evicted several news organizations from long-held office space, leading some reporters to worry about access to fast, reliable information during a military crisis.\n\n“Strategically, he likes to use the press as a pawn — it is one of the institutions that he can demonize to make himself look good,” said Ron Fournier, a former Washington bureau chief for the AP.\n\nTrump has active lawsuits going against news outlets that displease him, such as CBS News for the way “60 Minutes” edited an interview with 2024 election opponent, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, or The Des Moines Register, for what turned out to be an inaccurate pre-election poll of Iowa voters.\n\nThe new FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has signaled an activist stance, with investigations open against CBS for the “60 Minutes” case, ABC News for how it fact-checked the Trump-Harris debate and NBC on whether it violated federal “equal time” provisions by bringing Harris onto “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nEven with all the change, many newsrooms are confronting the challenge\n\nFleischer welcomes a newly aggressive attitude toward the press. He believes many journalists were more activists than reporters during Trump’s first term. He wondered why journalists were not more aggressive in determining whether Biden’s advancing age made him fit for the presidency.\n\n“I think that the press is either in denial, or they acknowledge that they have lost the trust of the people but they won’t change or do anything about it,” he said. “They just don’t know how to do their jobs any differently.”\n\nPress advocates worry about the intimidation factor of lawsuits and investigations, particularly on smaller newsrooms. What stories will go unreported simply because it’s not worth the potential hassle? “It has a very corrosive effect over time,” Grueskin said.\n\nWorth watching, too, is a disconnect between newsrooms and the people who own them. Both the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post backed off endorsements of Harris last fall at the behest of the their owners, and Post owner Jeff Bezos attended Trump’s inauguration. When the Post announced a reorganization earlier this month, Leavitt took a shot: “It appears that the mainstream media, including the Post, is finally learning that having disdain for more than half the country who supports this president does not help you sell newspapers.”\n\nMany newsrooms are notably not backing down from the challenge of covering the administration. “60 Minutes” has done several hard-hitting reports, the Atlantic has added staff and Wired is digging in to cover Elon Musk’s cost-cutting.\n\nFor their own industry, much of the news is grim. The future of Voice of America is in doubt, eliminating jobs and, its supporters fear, reducing the nation’s influence overseas. Cost-cutters are eyeing government subscriptions for news outlets, eliminating an income source. On a broader scale, there are worries about attacks on journalists’ legal protections against libel lawsuits.\n\n“They’re pulling at every thread they can find, no matter how tenuous, to try and undermine credible news organizations,” Grueskin said.\n\nIt is well organized. It is coming from multiple directions.\n\nAnd it has been only two months.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson contributed to this report.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

There’s the old and grump straight man, Sen. Bernie Sanders set in his Marxist ways, and there's the young, bubbly comedian Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, always smiling or dancing or making cute TikTok videos. Last week, Sanders & AOC launched a national tour to perform for tens of thousands. The Democrats’ dynamic duo even played Vegas, where they insisted attendees don COVID masks (no, seriously). The question is, why are they on the road? BERNIE SANDERS, AOC TAKE AIM AT TRUMP AND MUSK, AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS The 2026 midterm elections are more than 19 months away, so why would two Democrats whose seats are safe as houses spend millions of dollars and untold man hours on this traveling circus today? The answer is that Sanders & AOC are confronting an emergency, just not the one they say they are. They want you to think the emergency is President Donald Trump’s second term, but the real emergency is that America is firmly rejecting their brand of far-left progressivism. Make no mistake, old man Sanders and his spunky sidekick aren’t really fighting against Trump, they are fighting to maintain ideological control of a Democratic Party that right now might be the least popular major party in American history. In the aftermath of Kamala Harris’ embarrassing defeat in November, all fingers were pointed at wokeness to explain the Democrats’ woes. From men in women’s sports and open borders, to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and ending private health insurance, the far left has been rejected at every turn. So here come Sanders & AOC in their hilariously named \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, this from two people who never saw a big bundled donation from George Soros that they wouldn’t greedily accept. And yes, they perform some tired old material about Trump supposedly tearing down Democratic norms, or Elon Musk swimming in a pool of stolen social security money like Scrooge McDuck. But the real story is in the new material. Take this from AOC, for example, \"This isn’t just about Republicans,\" she opined in Arizona. \"We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us. That means each and every one of us choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class. I want you to look at every level of office around and support Democrats who fight, because those are the ones who can actually win against Republicans.\" Not lately, congresswoman. On Sunday, the Democratic Socialists of America, who launched Ocasio-Cortez’s career, were protesting in New York City to demand that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer step down for refusing to pointlessly shut down the government this month. These are desperate last gasps. Since 2008, when the party of Bill Clinton, once the moderate Democratic savior, became the party of Barack Obama, the Democrats have lurched so far left that their most sacred shibboleths of wokeism appear to most Americans as beyond parody. Sanders & AOC are well aware that as they continue to try to sell gender bending, the green new deal, and endless illegal immigration, there are lean and hungry Democrats like Rep. Ritchie Torres D-NY, Sen. John Fetterman D-PA, and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo who are ready to remake the party in their more centrist image. Even fellow comedian and TV Host Bill Maher is sticking it to Sanders & AOC by accepting a friendly invitation to meet with Trump. His message is clear; screaming, \"THIS ISN’T NORMAL!!!\" over and over again isn’t working and never will. This Burns & Allen act that Sanders & AOC have going on is meant to spur the Democratic faithful into revolt against semi-normal party leaders, the kind who won’t encourage the destruction of Teslas or stand around outside empty DC office buildings singing 1960s resistance songs off-key. Those more centrist Democrats have the upper hand now, and they know it. This is why instead of barnstorming the country with political celebrities, they are biding their time, building their war chests, and plotting a new course for their party.

Analysts and activists have consistently highlighted that the party appears leaderless, without a clear direction.Ocasio-Cortez, however, has emerged as one of the Democrats many see to be pushing back in a way that resonates with the party's base.The congresswoman has also been holding massive rallies in several states alongside progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. With thousands turning out for these events, it suggests the progressive duo has a message that resonates with a significant constituency of voters.What Recent Polls ShowA CNN poll carried out from March 6 to 9 showed that Ocasio-Cortez was the top politician among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents when asked which \"one person best reflects the core values\" of the party.The New York progressive was named by 10 percent of respondents. That was narrowly ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was named by 9 percent. Sanders came in third, with 8 percent. The survey included 1,206 U.S. adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.While Ocasio-Cortez may be seen as best at representing the party's values, a poll carried out by Morning Consult from March 14 to 16 showed her in third place when respondents were asked about who they would support in 2028.In that survey, Harris led the pack by a wide double-digit margin, with 36 percent support. In second was former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who sought the party's nomination in 2020, at 10 percent. Ocasio-Cortez had half of Buttigieg's support, with 5 percent.She was tied for third with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Harris' 2024 running mate, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Billionaire Mark Cuban came in just behind at 4 percent. The poll included 2,210 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.Another recent Echelon Insights poll conducted from March 10 to 13, with 457 likely voters, showed similar results. Harris was at 33 percent and Ocasio-Cortez was at 7 percent, tied with Newsom. Buttigieg was in second place at 10 percent. That poll surveyed 1,007 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.A poll by McLaughlin & Associates, carried out in late January among 414 likely voters, had Harris at 33 percent. Ocasio-Cortez was at 6 percent, behind Buttigieg at 9 percent and Newsom at 7 percent.What People Are SayingRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Las Vegas rally on Thursday: \"This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too. But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand up for the working class.\"Mary Ann Bennett, who attended Ocasio-Cortez's Denver rally with Sanders on Friday, told Newsweek: \"The Democratic Party has not been taking strong actions for the working class. Bernie and AOC acknowledged this, which is step one, and then laid out their plans for action which were met with strong cheers from the 30,000 people who showed up. Those moments were when I felt the most empowered and ready to fight for my neighbors.\"Monica Crowley, a former official in the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, told Fox News in November: \"Just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party: Do not underestimate AOC. She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive.\"What Happens Next?Democrats interested in running in 2028 aren't expected to officially announce until 2027, although it's possible someone could announce sooner.Buttigieg, Newsom and several prominent Democratic governors are rumored to be considering runs. While Harris is also widely speculated to be weighing a second presidential bid, she is also reportedly looking at a run to be California's next governor in the state's 2026 election.","summary":"\"We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us,\" the New York progressive said at a recent rally.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-2028-presidential-nominee-polls-2049256","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2613006/alexandria-ocasio-cortez.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 15:18:34","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":303272946,"title":"Here’s Trump’s advice to Kamala if she runs for Calif. gov","text":"President Trump has some advice for former foe Kamala Harris if she runs for California governor next year.\n\n“Let her run,” Trump, 78, told OutKick’s Clay Travis during an interview Saturday when asked about her future. “I don’t want to be [giving] people advice politically, but one thing she’s gotta start doing is she’s gotta start giving interviews.\n\n“[Former President Joe Biden] — during the COVID thing, he did no interviews, and he got away with it because of COVID.”\n\nSince her defeat against Trump in November, Harris, 60, has been rumored to be mulling three main options about her political future: running for California governor in 2026, vying for the presidency again in 2028 and staying on the sidelines as a Dem powerbroker.\n\nIncumbent California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is term-limited, leaving a big opening for Harris. \n\nHarris has laid low since departing the White House in January, declining to do any public interviews and only making a few appearances such as the 56th annual NAACP Image Awards last month. \n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, Harris had a guarded approach to the media. Some Dem operatives lamented the fact that she never went on podcast titan Joe Rogan’s show. \n\nBy contrast, Trump engaged in a strategy of blitzing independent media, sitting down with a wide range of personalities such as Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Schultz.\n\nThe president has credited his teenage son Barron with helping him select the podcasts with which to do interviews.\n\nVice President JD Vance also served as Trump’s attack dog with traditional media outlets during the 2024 race. Trump had bombarded traditional media outlets during his 2016 campaign as well.\n\nHarris’ vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), has since complained that the campaign apparatus hamstrung him when it came to doing interviews during the race.\n\nWalz said that he offered to do significantly more public events during the race’s homestretch last year but that the campaign rejected his suggestion, according to CNN.\n\n“There’s a danger – and I would argue I did it maybe during the campaign – of fighting the last battle instead of the next one,” Walz said, according to the outlet. \n\n“This is a whole different opponent fighting a whole different battle. And all of our past history that tells us how we should have approached this, I don’t think holds true.”\n\nWalz recently took it on the chin from Caitlyn Jenner when she mocked him for suggesting that conservatives fear his masculinity. Jenner, who is transgender, joked that she is more masculine than Walz.\n\nTrump, asked during Saturday’s interview about who would win a fight between Jenner and Walz,” replied, Oh, Caitlyn Jenner all day long.” \n\nDuring the interview with OutKick, Trump also mused that being elected in between terms “showed how bad [Dems] were.\n\n“What they were doing didn’t work,” he said.\n\nWhile reflecting on the difference between his first and second administrations, Trump took note of how he’s garnered more allies, including in the tech industry this time around. \n\n“If you look at the inauguration — look at the people that were there — it was a who’s who of a world that was totally against me the first time,” Trump said. “So a much different presidency. I have much more support.”","summary":"Since her defeat against Trump in November, Harris, 60, has been rumored to be mulling three main options about her political future: running for California governor in 2026, vying for the presidency again in 2028 and staying on the sidelines as a Dem powerbroker.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/us-news/heres-trump-advice-to-kamala-if-she-runs-for-calif-gov/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/trump-encourages-kamala-harris-run-100981882.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Swh0zTuQ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-23 14:57:00","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":303269258,"title":"All the celebrities who fled the US after Trump’s 2024 election victory","text":"When President Trump moved back into the White House on Jan. 20, it triggered a somewhat surprising migration trend among some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, who promptly packed their bags and relocated abroad, with many citing their upset over his election win as the reason for their sudden desire to live elsewhere.\n\nSince Trump claimed victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, multiple A-listers have quit the U.S. and moved elsewhere.\n\nSome, like Eva Longoria and Rosie O’Donnell, have publicly decried Trump’s administration and made clear that it was his policies that pushed them to find a new home outside of the U.S.\n\nOthers, including Ellen DeGeneres and Richard Gere, have been slower to link their relocations with his administration, despite being outspoken critics of Trump in the past.\n\nHowever, all of these stars have been quick to gush about their new home countries, with many opting to base themselves in Europe, where they have found new, luxurious dwellings that afford them the same lavish comforts as their mansions in Los Angeles or New York.\n\nOf course, there may well be more A-list emigrations to come, given the huge number of stars who have threatened to leave the country should Trump return to the White House—including Sharon Stone and Cher; however, it’s understood that they are still residing primarily in the U.S.\n\nEva Longoria\n\nLess than two weeks after the presidential election took place, Texas-born actress Longoria revealed that she had turned her back on the U.S., explaining in an interview with Marie Claire that she was “done” with life in “dystopian” America.\n\nThe former “Desperate Housewives” star told the outlet that she and her husband, José Bastón, had “escaped” the country with their son, Santiago, 6, and were living full time between their homes in Central America and Europe.\n\nAlthough the “Desperate Housewives” star says she made the decision before Trump’s election win, she said she believes the country will become a “scary place” if the President “keeps his promises.”\n\nLongoria conceded that she is very “privileged” in her ability to move away from the country where she was born and raised—and where she launched her successful acting career.\n\n“I’m privileged. I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren’t so lucky,” she said. “They are going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and my sadness is for them.”\n\nThe actress noted that the conditions in her former home state of California were largely to blame for her decision to leave the U.S. before the election, insisting that while she doesn’t want to “s–t” on the region, she found certain aspects of it very difficult to bear.\n\n“I had my whole adult life here. But even before [the COVID-19 pandemic], it was changing, the vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge,” she went on. “Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s–t on California—it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.”\n\nLongoria’s official exodus from the U.S. appears to have begun in earnest in 2023, when she put her sprawling Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $22.88 million—later slashing the price to $18.98 million in May 2024.\n\nThe listing for the home was removed in August of that same year; however, that didn’t stop Longoria and her family from leaving the dwelling behind in favor of residing between her homes in Mexico and Madrid.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi\n\nAmong the first to have fled the U.S. were DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, who swapped their mansion in Montecito, CA, for an $18 million farmhouse in the British countryside, where they are understood to have been living since the end of 2024.\n\nWhen news of their move was made public just weeks after the election in November 2024, TMZ reported that, while the couple had purchased their U.K. home in June, months before Trump’s win, their decision to “get the hell out” of America was cemented by his victory.\n\nDeGeneres was an outspoken supporter of Harris during the 2024 presidential election, publicly endorsing her in a post shared on Instagram back in August.\n\nSoon after, it was revealed that the couple had purchased a historic farmhouse in the Cotswolds, a celebrity-loved locale that is about two hours outside of London.\n\nAnd if there had been any doubt about their desire to make the U.K. their permanent residence, DeGeneres and de Rossi—who have made a lucrative career out of real estate investment—quickly began selling off their last remaining homes in the U.S., one of which was recently sold for $5.2 million, while another remains on the market for $29.99 million.\n\nStill, their move has not been without its difficulties.\n\nAccording to one report from London-based newspaper the Daily Mail, DeGeneres quickly found herself “in peril of getting on the wrong side” of a high-profile member of her new neighborhood after she “committed a ‘technical breach'” during the build of a single-story extension at her new abode in what the outlet described as a “planning clash.”\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi are reported to have received several objections from their neighbors, who have spoken out against their extension plan.\n\nDespite the protests, a spokesperson for West Oxfordshire Direct Council insisted that the Roman remains sit over 200 yards from DeGeneres and de Rossi’s property and that the work was “completed to a high standard.”\n\nRichard Gere\n\nHollywood legend and outspoken Trump critic Gere made his plans to move away from the U.S. months before the election, telling Vanity Fair Spain in April 2024 that he and his wife, Alejandra, were relocating to her home country of Spain so that she could be closer to her family.\n\n“It is a beautiful place, the food is extraordinary and the people exude sensitivity and generosity, as well as a strong will to laugh and enjoy,” he told the outlet. “I’m looking forward to going there.\n\n“For Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.\n\n“I love Spain and the ability of the Spanish people to live transmitting joy and happiness.”\n\nSoon after, the “Pretty Woman” star sold his Connecticut mansion for $10.75 million in an off-market deal, just two years after purchasing the expansive pad from crooner Paul Simon and his wife, Edie Brickell.\n\nGere and his spouse eventually relocated to their new home in Madrid with their children, Albert, 11, Alexander, 5, and James, 4, shortly before Christmas, later telling Elle España that they were “happier than ever” with their new lives in the European country.\n\n“The truth is that you are seeing us in our momentum. We are happier than ever,” he said during an interview with the outlet. “[Alejandra is happy] because she is at home and I [am happy] because, if she is happy, I am happy.”\n\nWhile the actor did not point to politics as the reason for his move, he did brand the U.S. a “dark place” while accepting an award from fellow Hollywood star Antonio Banderas in February, before going on to slam President Trump as a “bully and a thug.”\n\n“We’re all part of a universe of overlapping pain and sadness and joy. … I see this world that we’re in now forgetting that,” he said. “This very foolish tribalism is starting to take us over, where we think that we’re all separate from each other.\n\n“And we have unfortunately elected officials that don’t inspire us in the way that we want to be inspired. I’m coming from a place now … we’re in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who is the president of the United States.\n\n“But it’s not just in the U.S., it’s everywhere.”\n\nCourtney Love\n\nKurt Cobain’s widow announced her decision to permanently ditch her home country in favor of relocating to the U.K. during an appearance in London this month, telling spectators at a talk at the Royal Geographical Society that she is planning to apply for British citizenship, while branding President Trump’s plans for the U.S. “frightening.”\n\n“It’s so great to live here,” she said of her move to the U.K., according to the Daily Mail. “I’m finally getting my British citizenship in six months. I get to be a citizen. I’m applying, man! Can’t get rid of me!”\n\nThe singer, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, 78, for years, initially moved to the U.K. from her home in Los Angeles back in 2019—but says she now plans to make London her permanent home.\n\nThe singer-songwriter previously gushed about her love of the British city, telling the Evening Standard in 2017, “I know I’m going to end up there. I know what neighborhood I’m going to end up in, and I know that I want to be on the Thames.\n\n“I subscribe to this magazine called Country Life, which is just real-estate porn and fox hunting. It’s amazing.”\n\nLove rose to stardom as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Hole, which she formed in 1989. She was the leader of the group until they separated in 2002, before later reuniting from 2010 to 2013.\n\nShe made headlines when she tied the knot with Cobain in 1992, welcoming a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, now 32, that same year.\n\nFrances is married to skateboarder Tony Hawk’s son, Riley, with whom she is understood to be living in the L.A. area.\n\nRosie O’Donnell\n\nO’Donnell announced in March that she had quietly left the U.S. with her youngest adopted child, Dakota “Clay” O’Donnell, 12, revealing in a video posted on her TikTok account that they had settled down in a new home in Ireland.\n\nThe “Harriet the Spy” actress, who has long been an outspoken critic of Trump, confessed that she quit the U.S. on Jan. 15, adding that she is in the process of applying for Irish citizenship.\n\n“I’m here in Ireland, and it’s beautiful and warm—not physically, it’s actually quite cold,” she said. “I moved here on Jan. 15 [and] it’s been pretty wonderful, I have to say. The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming. And I’m very grateful.”\n\nThe comedian went on to explain that she can apply for citizenship in her new chosen homeland because she has Irish grandparents. However, she conceded that she never thought she would end up leaving the U.S., where she had most recently been living in Los Angeles.\n\n“I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, [but] that’s what I decided would be best for myself and my 12-year-old child. And here we are,” she went on.\n\nAlthough O’Donnell said she has relished in taking in all of the wonderful aspects of Ireland, she confessed that she has often found herself missing parts of the U.S., specifically her four other adopted children: Parker, 29, Chelsea, 27, Blake, 25, and Vivienne, 22.\n\nO’Donnell also said she would consider returning to the States after Trump leaves office and the country is “safe” again. She did not mention the president by name, instead referring only to what is “happening politically” in the country.\n\n“And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she said. “It’s been heartbreaking to see what’s happening politically and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know,” she said.\n\nAt the end of the nine-minute video, O’Donnell apologized to her fans who were concerned about her and encouraged people to use their voice to “stand up.”\n\n“Sorry for those of you who were worried and who missed me. I just felt like we needed to take care of ourselves and make some hard decisions and follow through,” she continued.\n\nGabriel Macht\n\nMeghan Markle’s former “Suits” co-star Macht revealed in January that he had left the U.S. with his wife, Australian-American actress Jacinda Barrett, and their two children—but interestingly refused to reveal where they are planning to settle down.\n\nMacht, 53, who starred in the hit legal drama as Harvey Specter for nine seasons, opened up about his mysterious move in a new interview with People magazine, explaining that the relocation had actually been years in the making.\n\nThe couple had wanted to take their kids out of school and begin homeschooling them in 2020, he told the magazine. However, their plans were scuppered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the time, Macht’s run on “Suits” had just ended, and he had decided to take a break from acting to focus on family.\n\n“Right before COVID, we wanted to take the kids out of school and homeschool them,” he shared. “But then we got stuck, and so we were in Manhattan. That just wasn’t doing it for us.”\n\nFour years later, the couple—who wed in 2004 and share two children, Satine, 17, and Luca, 10—seized their chance, packing up their lives and leaving New York City behind to see more of the world.\n\n“We decided to explore the world, so we left. I am based somewhere in Europe, but I don’t tell anybody where I live because I like to keep that under wraps,” he said. “I got out of town, and we’re exploring the world.”\n\nThe actor did not cite any political allegiances while discussing the move; however, he has previously spoken out against Trump during the 2016 election, voicing his support of Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in a post shared on his X account.\n\nMacht was born in The Bronx, NY, before his family relocated to Los Angeles when he was 5. His maternal grandmother was born in Russia, while his maternal grandfather was a Ukrainian immigrant who moved to the U.S.\n\n“I grew up in L.A. and I lived in New York for many, many years,” he told People. “Half of my life on the East Coast, half of my life on the West Coast.”\n\nMeanwhile, Barrett was born in Brisbane, Australia, and spent several years living in the U.K. and Europe, before moving to the U.S. to pursue her on-screen career.\n\nMacht reassured “Suits” fans that he would reprise his role in “Suits L.A.,” the upcoming spinoff of the hit show, despite confessing that he had “very little interest in coming back to work as an actor.”","summary":"When President Donald Trump moved back into the White House on Jan. 20, it triggered a somewhat surprising migration trend among some of Hollywood's biggest stars, who promptly packed their bags and relocated abroad, with many citing their upset over his election win as the reason for their sudden desire to live elsewhere.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/real-estate/all-the-celebrities-who-fled-the-us-after-trumps-2024-election-victory/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/u-s-president-donald-trump-100983021.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Swh0zTuQ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-23 14:31:44","author":"Realtor.com","authors":["Realtor.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":303266288,"title":"Two months into Trump’s second term, the news industry is dealing with difficulties from various sources.","text":"NEW YORK – During the first Trump administration, the biggest concern for many journalists was labels. Would they, or their news outlet, be called “fake news” or an “enemy of the people” by a president and his supporters?\n\nThey now face a more assertive President Donald Trump. In two months, a blitz of action by the nation’s new administration — Trump, chapter two — has journalists on their heels.\n\nLawsuits. A newly aggressive Federal Communications Commission. An effort to control the press corps that covers the president, prompting legal action by The Associated Press. A gutted Voice of America. Public data stripped from websites. And attacks, amplified anew.\n\n“It’s very clear what’s happening. The Trump administration is on a campaign to do everything it can to diminish and obstruct journalism in the United States,” said Bill Grueskin, a journalism professor at Columbia University.\n\n“It’s really nothing like we saw in 2017,” he said. “Not that there weren’t efforts to discredit the press, and not that there weren’t things that the press did to discredit themselves.”\n\nTrump supporters say an overdue course correction is in order\n\nSupporters of the president suggest that an overdue correction is in order to reflect new ways that Americans get information and to counter overreach by reporters. Polls have revealed continued public dissatisfaction with journalists — something that has been bedeviling the industry for years.\n\nTension between presidents and the Fourth Estate is nothing new — an unsurprising clash between desires to control a message and to ask probing, sometimes impertinent questions. Despite the atmosphere, the Republican president talks to reporters much more often than many predecessors, including Democrat Joe Biden, who rarely gave interviews.\n\nAn early signal that times had changed came when the White House invited newcomers to press briefings, including podcasters and friendly media outlets. The AP was blocked from covering pool events in a dispute over Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, setting off a flurry of First Amendment concerns among press advocates and leading the administration to assert that the White House, not the press, should determine who questions him.\n\nTwo months before the administration took office, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, had urged that changes be made.\n\n“It’s time to bring that (briefing) room in line with how readers and viewers consume the news in 2025,” Fleischer said in an interview. “They don’t get their news from The Washington Post, The New York Times and the three networks anymore. They get their news from a myriad of sources.”\n\nIn practice, some newcomers have refreshingly tried to shed light on issues important to conservatives, instead of hostile attempts to play “gotcha” by the mainstream media, Fleischer said. There were also softballs, like when the Ruthless podcast asked press secretary Karoline Leavitt if reporters who questioned border policy were “out of touch.” The conservative Real America’s Voice network tried to knock Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy off stride by asking why he wasn’t wearing a suit in the Oval Office.\n\nWhile the White House Correspondents’ Association has protested the AP’s treatment and efforts to upend tradition, it has been largely toothless. For more extensive discussions, the president and his team generally favor interviews with outlets that speak to his supporters, like Fox News.\n\nThe Trump team’s rapid response efforts to fight the ‘fake media’\n\nThe White House has also established a “Rapid Response 47” account on X to disseminate its views and attack journalists or stories it objects to. The feed’s stated goals are supporting the president and “holding the Fake Media accountable.”\n\nLeavitt, 27, hasn’t hesitated to go toe to toe with reporters, often with a smile, and Tik-Tok collects some of those moments.\n\n“We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, and we will not accept that,” she said at her first press briefing. It stood in contrast to Trump’s 2017 press secretary, Sean Spicer, who got into an angry confrontation with the press about the size of the president’s inauguration crowd on his first day in the White House, and never truly recovered from it.\n\nShowing the spread of the administration’s disciplined approach, the Defense Department also has a rapid response account that says it “fights fake news.” The Pentagon has evicted several news organizations from long-held office space, leading some reporters to worry about access to fast, reliable information during a military crisis.\n\n“Strategically, he likes to use the press as a pawn — it is one of the institutions that he can demonize to make himself look good,” said Ron Fournier, a former Washington bureau chief for the AP.\n\nTrump has active lawsuits going against news outlets that displease him, such as CBS News for the way “60 Minutes” edited an interview with 2024 election opponent, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, or The Des Moines Register, for what turned out to be an inaccurate pre-election poll of Iowa voters.\n\nThe new FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has signaled an activist stance, with investigations open against CBS for the “60 Minutes” case, ABC News for how it fact-checked the Trump-Harris debate and NBC on whether it violated federal “equal time” provisions by bringing Harris onto “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nEven with all the change, many newsrooms are confronting the challenge\n\nFleischer welcomes a newly aggressive attitude toward the press. He believes many journalists were more activists than reporters during Trump’s first term. He wondered why journalists were not more aggressive in determining whether Biden’s advancing age made him fit for the presidency.\n\n“I think that the press is either in denial, or they acknowledge that they have lost the trust of the people but they won’t change or do anything about it,” he said. “They just don’t know how to do their jobs any differently.”\n\nPress advocates worry about the intimidation factor of lawsuits and investigations, particularly on smaller newsrooms. What stories will go unreported simply because it’s not worth the potential hassle? “It has a very corrosive effect over time,” Grueskin said.\n\nWorth watching, too, is a disconnect between newsrooms and the people who own them. Both the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post backed off endorsements of Harris last fall at the behest of the their owners, and Post owner Jeff Bezos attended Trump’s inauguration. When the Post announced a reorganization earlier this month, Leavitt took a shot: “It appears that the mainstream media, including the Post, is finally learning that having disdain for more than half the country who supports this president does not help you sell newspapers.”\n\nMany newsrooms are notably not backing down from the challenge of covering the administration. “60 Minutes” has done several hard-hitting reports, the Atlantic has added staff and Wired is digging in to cover Elon Musk’s cost-cutting.\n\nFor their own industry, much of the news is grim.

Mike Levin didn’t make the cut.\n\nThat’s a good thing for him, though not so much for his potential opponent next year, county Supervisor Jim Desmond.\n\nOn Monday, the National Republican Congressional Committee released its first round of targeted Democratic members of Congress, 26 in all. Levin isn’t on it but five other California incumbents are.\n\nThat’s not entirely a surprise. Levin was first elected in 2018 and has proved resilient in the face of serious challenges ever since in the 49th District, which straddles the San Diego-Orange county line.\n\nThe GOP list will be updated throughout the election cycle, as will an eventual parallel one from Democrats, and the Republicans could change their thinking about how much to challenge Levin.\n\nStill, Levin’s absence is noteworthy because the district, once solidly Republican, has turned purple over the years and is considered the only potential battleground among San Diego County’s five congressional seats.\n\nIt’s also interesting because of the talk coming out of the California Republican Party’s state convention in Sacramento last Sunday.\n\nCorrin Rankin, who had just been elected the new California GOP chair, promised bold action from the party that for decades has struggled to remain relevant in the Golden State. She promised to challenge in Democratic bastions, according to Politico.\n\n“Expect to see us in San Francisco, on the Peninsula, in Los Angeles,” Rankin told reporters after her victory over former state Sen. Mike Morrell. “We’re going to make investments, and we’re going to start targeting those areas.”\n\nRankin said she’s “not concerned about backsliding” in California during next year’s midterm elections — which, in 2018, were a devastating loss for Republicans after Trump’s first two years in office. The GOP clawed back some ground over the next couple of cycles, but Democrats flipped three California House seats last year.\n\nStill, there’s nothing unusual about big confidence at political conventions, which tend to fire up rank-and-file activists and party leaders alike.\n\nAfter all, Democrats came roaring out of their national convention in Chicago last year after swapping out beleaguered President Joe Biden for Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee. That serves as a cautionary tale about projecting post-convention enthusiasm too far into the future.\n\nThe GOP may well start eyeing opportunities in the Bay Area and L.A., or at least plant the seeds for the long run. But more than likely, Republicans will focus on protecting their modest legislative gains in the Legislature, and who they view as vulnerable Democrats.\n\nBeyond that, the GOP will likely look at more competitive districts, like the 49th and the state Senate 40th District, than deep blue enclaves.\n\nThe Senate district sweeps from north San Diego County – from San Marcos, Escondido and Valley Center – down into a segment of the city of San Diego and over to East County rural communities, including Ramona, Alpine and Descanso. The incumbent is termed-out Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones of Santee.\n\nLike the 49th, the Senate district had been Republican but became less so because of demographic trends and reapportionment. Democrats now hold a minuscule advantage in voter registration over Republicans.\n\nThat seat could be ripe for flipping if the GOP doesn’t make it a priority. Symbolism only means so much, but losing the seat now held by the top Senate Republican would be a bad look.\n\nSan Diego City Councilmember Marni von Wilpert entered the race early and has lined up many establishment Democrats behind her. Two Republicans are in the hunt so far: San Marcos Councilmember Ed Musgrove, a former sheriff’s captain, and Kristie Bruce-Lane, a former Olivenhain water board member who twice ran for Assembly.\n\nShifting back to the Levin race, something to watch is whether Desmond will clear the Republican field, at least of any other major GOP candidate. On Wednesday, Levin’s 2024 opponent, businessman Matt Gunderson, announced he will not be running again and instead will focus on getting a voter ID law passed in California.\n\nAmong other things Desmond may have going for him is that he’s from the San Diego County portion of the district and is well-known, having served as mayor of San Marcos before being elected twice to the Board of Supervisors. Levin’s GOP opponents have all lived in Orange County, where the portion of the 49th District is significantly smaller than the San Diego territory.\n\nBut Desmond’s also a well-identified conservative and the race in the moderate 49th will be more partisan than his other elections. The San Diego part of the district is more Democratic than north of the county line. He also doesn’t appear to have the kind of deep pockets of Gunderson, who spent significant personal funds in losing to Levin by 4.4 percentage points.\n\nDesmond has so far raised the issues of immigration, the cost of living and concerns about overall quality of life, similar to his GOP predecessors. Still, Republicans believe they have made headway with those issues along with public safety, including homelessness, and the general public discontent reflected in polls with how the state is being run under Democratic leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the California GOP under recent past chair Jessica Millan Patterson registered nearly 1 million new Republican voters, boosting the party back into second place behind Democrats after it fell below the number of voters who list no party preference.\n\nPatterson has noted Republicans have been more successful in winning inland districts than Democratic strongholds along the coast.\n\nThere was considerable analysis about California shifting to the right last year. Trump lost big to Harris in the state, but did notably better than against Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nMaybe Republicans can keep it going in 2026. However, it’s sometimes easy to mistake the typical ebb and flow of politics for long-lasting realignment. Some Trump voters may stay home when he’s not on the ballot next year.\n\nAnd it’s hardly ancient history that the anticipated red wave in the 2022 congressional elections when Biden was in office turned into a Republican ripple.\n\nMidterm elections, which usually aren’t kind to the party holding the White House, often serve as a reality check.\n\nWhat they said\n\nSemisonic (@SemisonicBand), regarding the Trump administration using their hit song on an ad about deporting people.\n\n“We did not authorize or condone the White House’s use of our song ‘Closing Time’ in any way. And no, they didn’t ask. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely.”","summary":"Democratic Rep.

Pop princess's pals are embroiled in scandal - but star has clever strategy to protect squeaky clean image, expert says\n\nTaylor Swift has 'mastered the art of storytelling' in Hollywood A-lister circle\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift no longer speaking to Blake Lively after Justin Baldoni scandal shook decade-long friendship \n\nBy ELMIRA TANATAROVA\n\nPublished: 10:49 GMT, 23 March 2025 | Updated: 10:49 GMT, 23 March 2025\n\nTaylor Swift is a billionaire with one of the most successful tours in the world under her belt.\n\nAnd on top of that, the Reputation singer manages to keep hers squeaky clean.\n\nWhile the star has faced her fair share of criticism - and penned whole albums about how she's been publicly bashed by supporters and other A-listers alike - she appears to bounce-back with her loyal fanbase and stellar career in tact.\n\nIn recent months, Taylor appears to be on top of the world with her near-two-year Eras Tour finally complete; more loved up than ever with NFL star boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to the pop idol's close-knit friend circle, which has found itself in a web of controversies - and in some cases, steep downfalls from fame - over the months. \n\nThis includes the popstar's bestie Blake Lively - who has frequently been spotted out and about with Taylor - and is currently embattled in a legal dispute with Justin Baldoni over the scandal-ridden It Ends With Us film.\n\nElsewhere, her longtime pal Jaime King has been caught up in a custody battle with estranged husband Kyle Newman - as a judge said the actress must have her visits with her sons supervised until she finishes a mandated drug/alcohol program that lasts around six months.\n\nHer friendship with Brittany Mahomes has also been questioned after the wife of the Kansas Chiefs Quarterback appeared to like a post Donald Trump - when Taylor herself endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for President.\n\nThis includes the popstar's bestie Blake Lively - who has frequently been spotted out and about with Taylor - and is currently embattled in a legal dispute with Justin Baldoni over the scandal-ridden It Ends With Us film\n\nElsewhere, her longtime pal Jaime King has been caught up in a custody battle with estranged husband Kyle Newman - as a judge said the actress must have her visits with her sons supervised until she finishes a mandated drug/alcohol program that lasts around six months\n\nThe singer's connections to Karlie Kloss , Ice Spice and Lena Dunham have also been in the spotlight following their 'cancellations'\n\nSpeaking to FEMAIL, media & PR expert Chad Teixeira suggested that Taylor has managed to 'master the art of storytelling, not just in her music but in her public persona'. Pictured with Ice Spice\n\nThe singer's connections to Karlie Kloss, Ice Spice and Lena Dunham have also been in the spotlight following their 'cancellations'.\n\nSpeaking to FEMAIL, media & PR expert Chad Teixeira suggested that Taylor has managed to 'master the art of storytelling, not just in her music but in her public persona'.\n\n'She carefully controls her narrative, takes accountability when needed, and strategically chooses when to engage and when to stay silent,' he explained.\n\n'Unlike many celebrities who react impulsively to scandals, Taylor often lets the dust settle before addressing anything directly, making her seem composed and in control. \n\n'Plus, she has built such deep emotional loyalty with her fanbase that they are quick to defend her...her reputation isn’t just hers; it’s theirs too.'\n\nHe also added that she 'without a doubt' helps amplify and affect the public dial of her friends' social standing by being pictured with them, or speaking about them publicly. \n\nHere, FEMAIL looks at times Taylor's besties - past and present - found themselves in murky waters (while the star kept her head above surface). Taylor pictured with Karlie Kloss in 2013\n\n'Taylor Swift is like the ultimate influencer before the term even existed,' Chad continued.\n\n'If she’s seen supporting someone, it gives them an instant credibility boost. But the same works in reverse, If she distances herself, it sends a message.\n\n'She has a unique ability to frame the narrative, whether through subtle lyrical references or who she’s seen with (or not seen with). While she doesn’t control how her friends behave, her endorsement, or lack thereof: definitely shapes public perception.'\n\nHe remarked that while it's not exactly 'fair', it's 'inevitable' that Taylor's own credibility can face scrutiny based on the actions of those around her.\n\n'The reality is, when you’re one of the biggest stars on the planet, every association is scrutinised,' Chad explained.\n\n'People love to either pedestal you or pull you down, and Taylor is no exception. That said, she’s been savvy about not letting the noise define her.\n\n'She rarely gets dragged down by the scandals of those around her because she ensures her own actions align with the values she publicly upholds. And if there’s one thing Swifties love, it’s a well-crafted comeback.'\n\nHere, FEMAIL looks at times Taylor's besties - past and present - found themselves in murky waters (while the star kept her head above surface)... \n\nBlake Lively\n\nBlake Lively found herself caught up in one of Hollywood's biggest scandals last year, after starring in the film It Ends With Us with Justin Baldoni.\n\nLively previously filed a sexual harassment lawsuit in December against Baldoni, who also directed their hit romantic drama It Ends With Us.\n\nBaldoni later followed up by launching a $400 million defamation lawsuit against Lively, her publicist and her husband, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHe also filed a $250 million libel lawsuit against the New York Times for its reporting on Lively's allegations. \n\nBoth Lively and Baldoni have denied each others' claims, and the New York Times has denied Baldoni's accusations and requested that his lawsuit against the paper be dismissed. \n\nIt has certainly shown in Taylor's relationship with Blake - and the singer's shock involvement in the highly publicised legal rollercoaster appears to have rocked the foundations of their decade-long friendship.\n\nAnd the A-list pals are still struggling to move on from the fallout, with the Bad Blood singer no longer communicating with Lively, according to insiders.\n\nDailyMail.com previously reported that she had taken a ‘step back’ from the Gossip Girl alum, but their close bond has deteriorated, with Taylor reportedly refusing an invitation to the SNL 50th anniversary special as Lively was on the guest list.\n\n‘Taylor is not communicating with Blake,’ an insider said. ‘She was invited to SNL50, but with Blake there – and Kim Kardashian – it was the last place on earth she would be seen.’\n\nThe global frenzy around Lively has left Taylor questioning her close friendships and how she can prevent ‘external factors’ from damaging her own reputation.\n\n‘Taylor is taking stock of which of her friends are good for her and who name drops her for personal gain after Blake-gate,’ a second insider added.\n\n‘She has a new album in the works and is shocked by how much drama she was pulled into. She won’t let external factors hurt her career.’\n\nThe once best friends haven’t been pictured together for months. The last time was when both enjoyed a double date with their respective partners Ryan Reynolds and Travis Kelce in Manhattan in October.\n\nQuestions were raised in February when the actress failed to attend the Super Bowl with Taylor instead flanked by her collaborator Ice Spice, social media influencer Ashley Avignone and Haim sisters Alana, Este and Danielle.\n\nTaylor was dragged into the explosive saga in January, when Baldoni countersued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds for $400 million.\n\nIn his filing he claimed Lively, who accused Baldoni of sexual harassment in a lawsuit, used Swift to intimidate him at a meeting with Reynolds about edits she had made to a rooftop scene.\n\nBaldoni claimed the Cruel Summer singer made him feel like he 'needed to comply with Blake's direction for the script'.\n\nLively later appeared to threaten Baldoni by comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi in a series of text messages, included as exhibits to court papers, in which she referred to Reynolds and her best friend as her 'dragons'.\n\nA source previously told DailyMail.com that the ‘uncool and unnecessary’ description was a shock for Taylor who had never planned to be at the meeting, but arrived at Lively's New York penthouse to find it was still ongoing.\n\n'For the time being she is taking a step back from Blake because she doesn’t want to get tangled in this more than she already has – which is far more than she ever needed to be,’ an insider told DailyMail.com.\n\nKhaleesi, also known as Daenerys Targaryen and Mother of Dragons, is one of the main characters in Game of Thrones, which aired between 2011 to 2019.\n\nShe was portrayed as a villain after descending into madness and turning to vengeance due to trauma and loss.\n\nBaldoni also claimed in the suit that Lively leveraged her friendship with the Grammy-winner to get her way behind the scenes.\n\nHe claimed the actress threatened to 'change her mind' about reaching out to Swift to secure the use of her hit 2020 track My Tears Ricochet.\n\nTaylor and Lively have been friends for a decade, with the pair celebrating milestones together and the singer even name dropping Lively’s children in her music.\n\nShe appeared to rally around the actress when rumours of rancour between her and Baldoni first started bubbling in August.\n\nShe was pictured arriving at Taylor's Rhode Island property, taking solace at the $17 million, eight bedroom estate alongside her husband Reynolds, to escape the frenzy.\n\nHer past behaviour has come under increasing scrutiny in the months since.\n\nShe and husband Reynolds appeared to fuel the hostility towards them last month when he seemingly poked fun at his wife's allegations at the SNL50: The Anniversary Special.\n\n'I have a question,’ he said, to which Tina Fey replied: 'Oh Ryan Reynolds, how's it going?'\n\nIn an apparent nod to the maelstrom of headlines, he responded: 'Great - why, what have you heard?'\n\nThe reaction from viewers was predictably brutal, with many accusing the Hollywood power couple of using their clout to claw back public favour after months of bad headlines.\n\nLively made headlines when she accused Baldoni of sexual harassment in a bombshell lawsuit last year. \n\nShe alleged that Baldoni showed her explicit videos and photos of other women, openly discussed his struggles with pornography, and made inappropriate remarks about her appearance and weight. \n\nLively also accused the former Jane The Virgin star of entering her trailer while she was nude, and letting his 'friends' watch her film intimate scenes, along with other activities that created a 'hostile work environment'. \n\nBaldoni claimed in court filings they made efforts to usurp and undermine his input as the director of It Ends with Us. \n\nThe actor has denied the allegations, while Lively and Reynolds have denied the accusations made in litigation by him.\n\nLast month, Lively also unleashed a new salvo in her ongoing legal back-and-forth with Baldoni by claiming that she was not the only woman he made uncomfortable on the set of It Ends With Us.\n\nAn amended version of her complaint filed late in New York federal court alleged that she has corroboration of her original claims, and a spokesperson for the actress claimed that 'other women confided in Blake about their discomfort,' according to People.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Baldoni's attorney Freedman said: 'Our clients have been transparent in providing receipts, real time documents and video showing a completely different story than what has been manipulated and cherry picked to the media. Our clients have taken this matter and these issues very seriously notwithstanding the jokes made publicly by the plaintiff and her husband. \n\n'Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims,' he continued. 'Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively’s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively’s lack of actual evidence.'\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Lively's attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb said her amended complaint against Baldoni 'provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims'.\n\nThey added that it 'includes previously undisclosed communications' Lively had with Sony Pictures, Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios and 'numerous other witnesses.'\n\nThe new version of the complaint reportedly includes an added defamation claim against Baldoni that was not part of the initial document, which was filed on New Year's Eve.\n\nAccording to Hudson and Gottlieb, Lively is suing for defamation 'based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint...'\n\nShe has also expanded her complaint to add Jed Wallace and his Texas-based crisis PR firm Street Relations, Inc., as a defendant. \n\nWallace, who has denied playing any part in a smear campaign against the Gossip Girl star, previously filed a $7 million lawsuit against her in response to Lively's allegation in her initial complaint that his firm 'weaponized a digital army' against her on behalf of Baldoni. \n\nShe had requested Wallace be deposed in her initial complaint, though he revealed in his subsequent lawsuit earlier in February that the request had been rescinded.\n\nLively's new filing alleges that others on the set of It Ends With Us can corroborate her claims. \n\nIt claims that Baldoni and his co-defendants' 'false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth' that the actress 'was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni...'\n\nThe filing also tries to establish that she 'raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023, not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the film in 2024.'\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for Lively, the amended filing 'details the corroboration that backs up Blake’s original sexual harassment and retaliation concerns.'\n\nThey allege that the document proves that 'other women confided in Blake about their discomfort and fear of coming forward, and their concern about the current public vitriol.'\n\nDespite the escalating legal battle between the two parties, there's no end in sight for Lively or Baldoni. \n\nIn January, a judge scheduled a trial date for their lawsuits in March of 2026, and both parties have already decided to skip any attempt at mediation. \n\nJaime King - a longtime friend of Taylor Swift's - was pictured with the Shake It Off artist in 2020\n\nThe custody case between actress Jaime King - a longtime friend of Taylor's - and estranged husband Kyle Newman took another turn this month, as a judge made a bold order in the long-running legal affair. \n\nThe judge awarded Newman, a 49-year-old director, sole physical custody of their two young sons James Knight, 11, and Leo Thames, nine, People reported after reviewing court docs on Monday.\n\nThe situation peripherally involves superstar singer Taylor - a stalwart confidante of King's who was named godmother to Leo in March of 2015. \n\nThe two boys with live with Newman, who will have final say on legal custody while the pair will share custody on paper amid the contentious case. \n\nThe judge said King, 45, must have her visits with her sons supervised until she finishes a mandated drug/alcohol program that lasts around six months. \n\nDailymail.com had at the time reached out to Newman for comment on the latest developments. \n\nThe people approved in the supervisory role included her mother, sister, brother-in-law, and Newman's brother Kevin, the outlet reported. \n\nKing, who played the role of Heather Vandergeld in the 2004 comedy White Chicks, has made repeated visits to court over the past five years with her ex-husband to litigate custody concerns.\n\nKing, 45, must have her visits with her sons supervised until she finishes a mandated drug/ alcohol program that lasts six months. Pictured in 2014 with Swift in LA\n\nMost recently, King - who has also been seen in movies such as 2009's My Bloody Valentine and 2005's Sin City - filed with the court for an emergency request.\n\nKing filed the request to alter the agreement they made in terms of child and spousal support two years prior, People reported.\n\nKing 'lacks the ability to pay the support,' her attorneys said in legal docs, while Newman said King had 'been out of compliance' with the court's child and spousal support orders for well over a year.\n\nNewman told the court that King would not 'sign a judgment' in their divorce agreement; and that she did not have the legal right to 'rescind' any of the court's orders, the outlet reported. \n\nThe former couple initially wed in 2007 at the Los Angeles-based mansion Greystone Park and Manor. \n\nKing in May of 2020 entered a court filing requesting a divorce to end the 13-year marital union.\n\nKing concurrently filed paperwork with the court requesting a emergency motion toward custody and visitation-related issues, the outlet reported, as well as a petition to prevent domestic violence.\n\nAmid the custody row, King said in May of 2020 that Newman had put together an 'intervention' for her four months earlier after informing family and friends she was having substance abuse issues.\n\nKing in legal docs said she went a facility so she could be tested and cleared as drug-and-alcohol free. She said that days in, she had been sent home after passing a substance abuse test.\n\nKing is 'a chronic drug addict and alcoholic who refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem, let alone seek meaningful treatment for such problem,' Newman said in his legal filing at the time.\n\nNewman told the court in a filing that 'several friends' informed him that she had used narcotics during both of her pregnancies. He added that doctors told him that their son Leo 'was also addicted due to her continued drug use.'\n\nHe said he 'was devastated' to learn at the same medical appointment 'that Leo Thames had a congenital heart defect and would need surgery to survive as soon as he was born.'\n\nNewman said in his court filing that on occasion, King had driven 'under the influence' with their children in the vehicle, People reported. \n\nKing became 'so intoxicated in front of them that they thought their mother was dying, and abandoning them for days at a time to get drunk and high instead of care for them.'\n\nHe added that 'at one point, Jaime left Leo Thames at his doctor's appointment with the nanny, only to be found over a half hour later at the liquor store across the street buying a bottle of alcohol.'\n\nTaylor was involved when Thames had to undergo the surgery, as the Grammy-winner donated a generous sum of money to the Los Angeles-based hospital Cedars-Sinai, King revealed in an August 2016 Instagram post.\n\nThe former couple initially wed in 2007 at the Los Angeles-based mansion Greystone Park and Manor. Pictured in late 2019 in LA\n\nKing said that Swift 'does so many selfless acts that go unnoticed because she does them silently, from such a great place of unconditional giving.'\n\nKing went into detail on her younger child's health woes, writing, 'Dear all- at 20 weeks our son was diagnosed with Transposition of the Great Arteries AKA TGA.'\n\nKing said that watching her youngest child undergo 'a major heart surgery ... was terrifying, and traumatic for us as parents, for our family.'\n\nKing, who did not allude to any of the accusations Newman has made in the social media post, said that she and her then-spouse had kept the details close to their vest amid the difficult timeframe.\n\n'Only a few of our best friends knew. I felt that I had to protect him in fear of the unknown, fear he would not make it. We felt isolated & confused.'\n\nKing said that Swift - as 'the Godmother of Leo Thames - made an 'incredible donation to the people that saved his life' at Cedar-Sinai, specifically the Congenital Heart Surgery unit led by Dr. Alistair Phillips.\n\nKing said that the lesson she learned was her famed friend was that it was important to provide support and spread awareness toward people in similar circumstances.\n\n'It made us realize that silence cannot connect other parents & people going through these issues,' said King. 'TS knew that by giving back in this way would be the greatest gift one could give to us, to Leo Thames and to all of those with congenital heart issues. \n\n'She came to the ICU to comfort us, to hold and bond with him with such grace & strength.'\n\nBrittany Mahomes\n\nBrittany Mahomes has been left 'deeply bothered' by Donald Trump's public attack on her close friend Taylor Swift and is feeling reluctant to show support for the former president\n\nBrittany Mahomes has bonded with Taylor over their shared WAG status. But while the pair have been spotted happily chatting away at Kansas City Chiefs games - and on double dates with their NFL beaus - Swifties have questioned whether there has been a rift over politics. The two couples pictured at the 2024 US Open\n\nBrittany Mahomes has bonded with Taylor over their shared WAG status. But while the pair have been spotted happily chatting away at Kansas City Chiefs games - and on double dates with their NFL beaus - Swifties have questioned whether there has been a rift over politics.\n\nBrittany, who has been married to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes since 2022, sparked controversy in August, when she liked a post about Donald Trump, 78, on social media.\n\nWeeks later, Taylor, 35, publicly endorsed Kamala Harris' bid for president - an action that drove a reported 338,000 visits to the federal voter registration website after she shared a link on Instagram. \n\nTrump hit back in predictably blistering style on his Truth Social platform, claiming 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' - prompting Brittany, 29, to 'question' if she will continue to endorse his campaign. \n\nIn the run up to the election, Brittany had liked multiple social media posts and comments supporting Trump and it didn't go unnoticed from Trump himself.\n\n'I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social network ahead of his electoral victory over Kamala Harris in November.\n\nTaylor, 34, publicly endorsed Kamala Harris' bid for president, weeks after Brittany was spied liking posts regarding Trump's campaign \n\nThe source told DailyMail.com: 'She is questioning her support for Donald Trump after he lashed out at Taylor, saying he hates her' \n\nIt remains to be seen if Taylor will be re-united in a luxury box with Brittany during this current season, with the pair sitting in separate suites for the last two games (pictured last season)\n\nBut Taylor and Brittany made it clear that they have no bad blood by attending the US open with their partners\n\nIn August, eagle-eyed users caught the soon-to-be mother of three liking a Trump post mapping out 16 of his policies to his 26.3million followers; ranging from topics on immigration to the economy.\n\nThe like has generated plenty of outrage among liberals on social media, and Brittany appeared to hit out at her critics.\n\n'I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood,' she wrote on her Instagram Story. \n\n'There's no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.'\n\nFollowing the presidential debate on September 10, Taylor revealed in a lengthy Instagram post that she would be voting for Kamala in November. \n\nShe did not attack or call out Trump personally but she signed her backing of Harris with: 'Childless Cat Lady.'\n\nIt is a reference to Trump's Vice President Sen.

Vance, who said in a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson that the U.S. is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.' \n\nTaylor also encouraged her millions of followers to do their research on the election and register to vote with a link she shared of vote.gov on her Instagram story sharing her grid post.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people – over 338,000 – clicked on the link from Swift's story. \n\nMore than 11 million people liked the image Swift posted of herself with one of her three cats named after a fictional character, Benjamin Button.\n\nFans feared that Brittany's apparent endorsement of Trump's policies could lead to an awkward tension with fellow Chiefs WAG Taylor, who has publicly expressed disdain for Trump in the past.\n\nAnd despite Taylor receiving backlash for being linked to the Mahomes, it appears she has still been beloved by her largely Democrat-supporting fanbase.\n\nWhile the pair have since been seen together attending the US open with their partners, and were at Patrick's 29th birthday bash - Taylor was not pictured in the same suite as Brittany at several Chiefs games last season.\n\nAnd while the pair went out the night before the Super Bowl - which ended with a loss for the Chiefs - they were not pictured together at the big event.\n\nThe event, which was attended by Trump as well, saw Taylor was cruelly booed by fans on the night.\n\nLena Dunham\n\nLena penned a gushing message to the star back in 2018 as she wrote: 'When we became friends 6 years ago I didn't know she'd also prove to be the loyal and hilarious cat lady who loved me through every rough moment and the triumphant ones too'\n\nThe Bad Blood singer has enjoyed a friendship with Girls actress Lena Dunham for a decade.\n\nThe duo's sisterhood began online back in 2012 when Lena first tweeted about how important the songstress' music was to her.\n\nPraising the artist, she wrote: 'Judging by how much she's helped me thus far, Taylor Swift is going to write the song that finally gets me comfortable with death.'\n\nLater that year in October, after the release of Taylor's album Red, Lena took to Twitter once again as she penned: 'Update: @taylorswif3's album is triumphant. If she'd been here when I was in college I would have written papers on her, not Sylvia Plath'.\n\nOverjoyed at her compliment, Taylor instantly replied as she raved about Lena's comedy series Girls. \n\nShe replied: '@lenadunham, you made my day with that. I'm now going to sit in my dressing room reciting my fav @girlsHBO quotes.. Which is all of them.'\n\nAfter Taylor decided to take the jump and followed Lena, it wasn't long before the director replied and the friendship began. \n\nThe pair were seen cuddling up together at the Grammy's in 2013, at the time when Lena was dating Taylor's now producer Jack Antonoff.\n\nScrolling back to the pair's first ever messages during an interview with Rolling Stone , Taylor revealed Lena's first message to her read: 'I am so excited about the prospect of being friends with you that I added the adjective best in front of it’\n\nIn 2015, the star appeared in Taylor's Bad Blood video which saw the star recruit her famous pack of girlfriend's for her hit single with Kendrick Lamar. \n\nIn 2021, Taylor had the honour of serving as one of Lena's bridesmaids at her wedding to husband Luis Felber at Soho's Union Club in London. \n\nGetting married after the COVID lockdown, Taylor was one of nine bridesmaids as Lena confessed she hadn't seen some of her friends in over a year due to the pandemic. \n\nShe explained: 'I spent so much time during the pandemic talking to my girlfriends about our feelings over FaceTime, but a few of my best friends I haven't seen in over a year.\n\n'And, you know, my girlfriends have had to deal with a lot of not-so-happy things with me in our adulthood, so to be able to celebrate something joyful and use it as an excuse to be together was very special.'\n\nIt's clear the pair have a special bond with one another, but Lena has often found herself in the spotlight, and not always for positive reasons.\n\nIn 2015, Lena was caught up in an anti-Semitism row after writing a controversial article comparing her Jewish boyfriend and her dog.\n\nThe then-28-year-old prompted the storm after writing a quiz in the March 30 edition of New Yorker magazine - asking readers if a number of statements referred to her dog or ex-boyfriend Jack Antonoff.\n\nThey included: 'He doesn't tip', 'he never brings his wallet anywhere' and 'he has hair all over his body, like most males who share his background'.\n\nLena, whose mother is Jewish, has been criticised by Twitter users, as well as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - an organisation which fights anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry. \n\nAlso among the 35 statements were 'my grandma Dottie loves him and says he's a 'good, good boy'' and 'bald men trigger a primal fear in him'.\n\nAbraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, said: 'Some will certainly find Lena Dunham's stereotypes about cheap Jews offensive. Others will take issue with the very idea of comparing a dog and a Jewish boyfriend.\n\n'While we understand that humor is its own special brand of expression and always try to give leeway to comedians, we wish that she had chosen another, less insensitive way to publicly reflect on her boyfriend's virtues and vices.\n\n'We are surprised that the New Yorker chose to print it.'\n\nIn 2016, the creator and star of HBO's Girls made the controversial statement an episode of her podcast, Women of the Hour. \n\nDescribing the experiences of loved ones who had had abortions and a visit she made to Texas Planned Parenthood, she commended the 'bravery' and 'self-knowledge' of women who have had abortions, adding that she has realized her need to put her own stigma surrounding the issue 'in the garbage.'\n\nShe concluded by saying: 'Now I can say that I still haven't had an abortion, but I wish I had.'\n\nHer comments were widely condemned by women who had had terminations, who branded them 'sickening'.\n\nAfter initially remaining silent in the face of their criticism, she later issued an apology on Instagram, and said she has made a 'sizeable donation' to Abortion Funds, which helps women pay for terminations.\n\nShe shared a picture of the the word 'choice' written in white chalk on a blackboard on the social networking site, together with a long apology for what she described as a 'distasteful joke'.\n\n'My latest podcast episode was meant to tell a multifaceted story about reproductive choice in America, to explain the many reasons women do or don't choose to have children and what bodily autonomy really means,' she wrote. \n\n'I'm so proud of the medley of voices in the episode. I truly hope a distasteful joke on my part won't diminish the amazing work of all the women who participated.'\n\nShe went on to say she had adopted a 'delusional girl' persona, but had not intended to 'trivialize the emotional and physical challenges of terminating a pregnancy'. \n\nWhile Ice Spice has become one of Taylor's go-to besties at major events, with everything from awards shows to the Super Bowl, after the pair collaborated on a remix of the song Karma together - the young rapper has faced her fair share of controversy.\n\nWhile Taylor has also had her romantic relationship scrutinised by the public, Ice Spice, 25, found herself in the middle of heated love triangle drama last summer. \n\nCentral Cee's ex-girlfriend Madeline Argy launched a scathing rant against the musician - for being seen with Ice Spice mere hours after they broke up.\n\nThe hitmaker, 26, and the influencer, 23, began dating in September 2022 but decided to part ways in 2023.\n\nIce Spice and Central Cee released their first single together this week, a track called Did It First where they explore the themes of an unfaithful relationship.\n\nThe pair also sparked dating rumours earlier this month when they were spotted driving around London together. \n\nIn her TikTok video, Madeline claimed she and Central Cee were broken up mere hours before she saw him and Ice Spice together.\n\n'Remember when he made me pay for my own birthday ticket to the zoo? At least this year I got something better. That's why my friends turned up to my house in gorilla suits the day of my birthday because I had just woken up to a video of him with a big baddie in the club. They literally had to drag me out of my f*****g house.'\n\nMadeline then claimed she had received a phone call from someone on Central Cee's team telling her things wern't as bad as it looked. \n\nShe said: 'This man has since called me, emailed me. It wasn't that much of a surprise when I get a call from his team and it's a girl saying,'firstly I am a girl's girl.'\n\n'His team is trying to convince me to have a conversation with him that he had no control over this. I'm trying to get the point across, it doesn't matter whether he had control or not. \n\n'Why was I told 12 hours before it happend? I'm going insane. All I'm seeing are comments going, why would she let her man act like this? I wasn't, no one told me.'\n\nMailOnline contacted a representative of Central Cee for comment at the time. \n\nKarlie Kloss\n\nTaylor has faced a flurry of criticism for not being political enough, and being linked to celebs perceived to be Republicans - but not quite as ardently as her ex supermodel pal, who is married into the Kushner family, known for its warm relations with Donald Trump\n\nVictoria's Secret Angel Karlie has made it clear that she doesn't support her in-laws' views, and the same seems to be the case for Joshua\n\nTaylor has faced a flurry of criticism for not being political enough, and being linked to celebs perceived to be Republicans - but not quite as ardently as her ex supermodel pal, who is married into the Kushner family, known for its warm relations with Donald Trump.\n\nHer brother in law is also wed to the First Daughter, Ivanka Trump. \n\nHowever, Victoria's Secret Angel Karlie has made it clear that she doesn't support her in-laws' views, and the same seems to be the case for Joshua.\n\nIn 2019, she admitted that it's been 'hard' to navigate the dissonance.\n\nSpeaking to British Vogue, she added: 'But I choose to focus on the values that I share with my husband, and those are the same liberal values that I was raised with and that have guided me throughout my life.'\n\nJust two years prior, her husband has voiced similar sentiments on 'liberal values' which have 'guided his life'.\n\n'I have supported political leaders that share similar values,' he told Forbes in an interview.\n\n'But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.'\n\nKarlie and Taylor were once besties, but appear to have had a rift since. Pictured taking a selfie together\n\nIn 2019, Karlie admitted that it's been 'hard' for her to navigate the dissonance. Pictured campaigning for abortion rights\n\nThings appeared to come to a boil after Karlie criticised Trump supporters following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, in 2021 and insinuated that she has tried to have political conversations with Jared and Ivanka. \n\n'Accepting the results of a legitimate democratic election is patriotic,' she posted on X. 'Refusing to do so and inciting violence is anti-American.'\n\nThe post immediately drew a rebuke from one of her followers on social media who wrote: 'Tell your sister-in-law and brother-in-law,' to which Karlie responded: 'I've tried.' This was later deleted. \n\nAnd in March last year, despite both couples attending the opulent wedding celebrations of Anant Ambani and his bride-to-be Radhika Merchant, there were no pictures of the whole Kushner clan together.\n\nIt is also hard to ignore that Karlie has been a passionate campaigner for pro-choice policies - while Ivanka, in 2020, a few years before the Roe v Wade overturning, explicitly stated she is 'unapologetically' pro-life.\n\nA few months before the election which saw Trump re-elected into the White House, Karlie penned an emotive op-ed for the Miami Herald, where she hit out at Florida's 'new draconian deadline banning abortion after six weeks'.\n\nIn it, she recounted her experience in visiting an abortion clinic, slamming the government's axing of abortion access federally in June 2022.\n\n'I've been engaged with this issue since I was a teenager. Growing up, I trained as a clinic escort at the Planned Parenthood near my hometown in St. Louis, MO,' she wrote.\n\nKarlie, pictured, showed her support for Joe Biden and other Democrats in the 2020 presidential election\n\n'Years later, I became involved with Abortion Bridge Collaborative Fund, which funds independent abortion clinics and organizations that support them, and dozens of other clinics like CHOICES in Carbondale, IL.\n\nTaylor Swift no longer speaking to Blake Lively after Justin Baldoni scandal shakes friendship\n\n'When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the long-held federal right to abortion, I launched an organization called Gateway Coalition to direct funding to various Midwest groups to provide accessible abortion care. I've visited many abortion clinics, met with countless patients and the incredible doctors serving them, but I was still deeply moved and surprised by what I saw that day.'\n\nKarlie was tirelessly urging her social media followers to vote before the election last November, penning captions focusing specifically on the abortion ban. \n\nOn Instagram, she penned: 'Every single vote matters in this election & in the fight for reproductive rights. Protecting and restoring reproductive freedom means showing up for all of the races and props on the ballot.\n\n'The policies that shape our everyday lives—our schools, healthcare, and rights—are impacted by local races where school boards, state legislatures, and judges quietly hold enormous power.\n\n'Doing the research on down-ballot candidates and propositions can feel overwhelming, but it's worth it when you get to the voting booth. Check out endorsements from organizations that align with your priorities. ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Reproductive Freedom for All, The States Project, and Vote 411 all have resources highlighting where candidates stand. You can also find voter guides put together by local organizations you trust, and check your ballot return deadlines through When We All Vote.'\n\nIn contrast - in 2020 - Ivanka confirmed that she is 'pro-life, and unapologetically' in an interview. \n\nElsewhere, tensions between the two couples were made clear after Karlie made an appearance on Project Runway.\n\nA contestant made a seemingly snide remark about her husband Josh's family that had people audibly gasping in the studio. \n\nThe awkward moment came when Tyler Neasloney was being critiqued for his design, after he and the show's other contestants were asked to create a look for Karlie to wear to a CFDA event in Paris using only donated clothing from a local Goodwill store. \n\nWhen Karlie asked him to explain the ruffled top and pencil skirt that he designed, he said he was 'going for a very traditional like Montauk, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Americana vibe.'\n\nWhile Tyler was proud that he made the look using only four pairs of pants, the judges were less impressed. \n\n'It's definitely wearable in some place that is neither Paris nor Montauk or Martha's Vineyard,' said designer and judge Brandon Maxwell. 'I cannot see Karlie wearing it anywhere, honestly.'\n\n'Not even to dinner with the Kushners?' Tyler hit back with a smile. \n\nKarlie was rendered speechless and her jaw dropped open before she tilted her head and gave him a pointed look. \n\nTyler's fellow contestants were stunned, and some audibly gasped when they heard the controversial quip. He quickly realised the line had landed flat and tried to make light of it, adding: 'That's your husband.' \n\nKarlie ignored his comments about her husband's family and, instead, focused on the aspiring designer's failed look. \n\nAt the end of the episode, the host announced that she and the other judges had voted to send Tyler home. She gave him a kiss on the cheek, which she has done with all of the eliminated contestants so far, and said: 'Thank you for being here.' \n\n'Karlie, I want you to know that I'm not a jerk,' he told her. 'I'm professional, so what I said earlier had no hidden agenda, no meaning, nothing like that.' \n\nThe model gave Tyler a smile and thanked him for his apology. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHow does Taylor Swift keep up her Reputation?

Shock and despair are starting to give way to rage and action. It’s not just Kamala Harris voters who are riled up by President Trump’s assault on our country’s institutions. So are many voters who helped put Trump back in office because they wanted cheaper groceries, a ceasefire in Ukraine or lower inflation but had no idea they were endorsing Trump’s increasingly tyrannical approach to co-governing with his fellow billionaire Elon Musk. Democrats, as a party, have not yet figured out how to meet the moment. “What leverage do we have?” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries complained last month about Republican control of the House, the Senate and the presidency. Hardly the rousing call to action that one might expect from an opposition leader. And where to start with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who sided with Republicans and allowed passage of a horrendous Republican spending bill, a.k.a. continuing resolution, rather than risk yet another government shutdown? Schumer claimed a shutdown would hurt Americans and enable the Trump/Musk depredations. Really? Musk and Trump are already burning it all down. Even the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents more than 750,000 federal workers, pleaded with senators to vote against the continuing resolution, saying it, not a shutdown, would worsen the destruction already wreaked by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The good news is that many Americans aren’t just sitting around watching their 401(k)s shrink. In February, anti-Trump demonstrations took place in all 50 states, part of the of 50501 movement (which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one day). On March 15, thousands of people marched in New York City under the banner of public employee unions against the Trump/Musk cuts to public services. The arrest of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card-holding Columbia University graduate who played a prominent role in anti-Israel protests last year, has sparked an uproar over whether the Trump administration is violating the 1st Amendment by targeting immigrants for their political beliefs. And God bless New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 35, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 83, who are on the road in Western states with their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, which has drawn thousands of people to arenas this week in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. There's more. \"Missing member\" events, for example, where voters are holding their own town halls because their Republican members of Congress are too afraid to face them. In some cases, constituents step up to a microphone and pose questions to an empty chair. In Wisconsin, Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden did not show up at a town hall, so a Democrat from a nearby district, Rep. Mark Pocan, came instead and spoke to 300 people next to an empty chair with Van Orden’s name on it. Hundreds of healthcare workers demonstrated outside the Anaheim Hills office of Republican Rep. Young Kim the other day to protest expected cuts to Medicaid, the health safety net for more than 72 million low-income and disabled Americans. And millions of Americans all over the country may answer the call on Saturday, April 5, for a “Hands Off” protest organized by Indivisible, the progressive grassroots group that got its start in 2017 when a handful of congressional staffers put together a handbook about peaceful, effective resistance to right-wing power grabs. The “Hands Off” motto: “They’re dismantling our country. They’re looting our government. And they think we’ll just watch.” On Thursday, I, along with some 4,500 others, tuned in to one of Indivisible’s weekly Zoom meetings led by its founders Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg. There are about 1,600 local Indivisible groups scattered around the country, and more are springing up each day. “Throughout history,” said Levin, “there has been no solution to creeping authoritarianism other than all of us — mass, broad-based organizing from people all over the country, from all walks life.” “If your ideas are popular and you have a mandate for change,” Greenberg said, “you do not hide from your constituents. We are the ones who are out there, who are unafraid and organizing and showing up in public because our ideas are popular. When people hear what we have to say, they want that, not them.” The April 5 protests are meant to be a show of strength. “‘Hands Off,’” said Greenberg, “is a message about everything that is happening, right? It’s hands off Medicaid, hands off our democracy, hands off Social Security, hands off our environment, hands off veterans benefits.” Now, for those who think that firebombing Tesla dealerships is a better tactic than nonviolent protests, I would remind you of the world-changing work of Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. And I would also tell you about the work of Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth and her colleagues. To Chenoweth’s surprise — shock, actually — she discovered that over time, nonviolent protests are far more successful than violent ones. Between 1900 and 2006, she says, campaigns of nonviolent civil resistance were twice as successful as violent campaigns. She also came up with the so-called 3.5% rule: No government can withstand a challenge from around 3.5% of its population without accommodating the movement. Examples? In 1986, millions of Filipinos peacefully protested the entrenched Marcos regime, which folded after four days. In 2003, protesters in the country of Georgia stormed the Parliament holding red roses, which led to the peaceful overthrow of the country's President Eduard Shevardnadze. In 2019, after decades in power, leaders in both Sudan and Algeria were forced to step down after peaceful popular uprisings. To hit the magic percentage, about 11 million Americans would have to rise up. In 2017, nearly half a million people protested Trump at the Women’s March in Washington. Around the United States, between 3.2 million and 5.2 million people joined in, which amounts to between 1% and 1.6% of the population. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that twice as many Americans are now upset enough to take to the streets. The goal is not to overthrow the government. The goal is to awaken the small-d democratic instincts of a Republican-dominated Congress that has actively ceded its power to Trump. And the only way they'll snap to is if they begin to fear for their jobs. Americans appalled by Trump’s wanton destruction of American democracy — and, yeah, OK, the high price of eggs — must be willing to show it before it’s too late (and it’s getting perilously late).

Josh Gottheimer, a moderate who strives for bipartisan solutions.\n\nThe rest — Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, teachers-union boss Sean Spiller, former state Senate president Stephen Sweeney — offer at best the same old, same old and at worst policies that will dig Jersey even deeper into its big-government hole.\n\nOn the GOP side, Ciattarelli promises income-tax cuts “for all taxpayers,” a cap on budget growth (plus a Department of Government Efficiency for the state, which could certainly use it), expanded school choice, lower gas, electric and insurance rates and a ban on sanctuary cities.\n\nJust behind him in the polls are state Sen. Jon Bramnick and radio host Bill Spadea.\n\nSpadea, who served in the Marines, also vows to be “tough on immigration” and to cut taxes.\n\nBramnick, though, might have a problem working with Trump: Prior to the 2024 presidential election, he vowed to drop out of the governor’s race if Trump won the state, because “if that’s what New Jersey wants, I ain’t your guy.”\n\nAt least Garden Staters will have a wide choice this year; here’s hoping they get it together to choose real change.","summary":"New Jersey stands an excellent chance of electing a Republican governor this year, and so potentially breaking from its long, slow decline.

While Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has come under fire over its ham-fisted style of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal government, the effort remains largely popular with the public. Despite Schumer’s love affair with the tax man, I highly doubt the minority leader’s strategy of convincing taxpayers that they should give the government more of their money will play well on Main Street.\n\n“’I built my company with my bare hands,’” Schumer said mockingly, “’how dare your government tell me how to treat my customers, the land and water that I own, or my employees.’” Schumer may not be aware that over 46% of the workforce is employed by a small business, and most of those companies were, in fact, built by the “bare hands” of their owners and employees. Nearly two-thirds of people own land, and aside from the terminally Stockholm syndrome-afflicted, few want the state interfering in how they manage their private property.\n\nAfter a short honeymoon, President Donald Trump’s approval rating has come back down to earth, although it remains higher than at any point during his first term. While the president’s marks on immigration are high, his job approval on his handling of the economy is underwater by nearly 8 points. Amid an ever-changing cycle of implementing and scrapping tariffs aimed at America’s economic competitors and allies alike, and the nervousness surrounding Trump’s pledge to enact widespread reciprocal tariffs on April 2, the stock market is down across all indices since the 47th president took office. On March 11, the S&P 500 experienced its steepest decline in several months, erasing $4 trillion from its peak a month prior.\n\nIt’s still “the economy, stupid” to quote former Clinton strategist James Carville. The last two incumbent presidents were unable to overcome sluggish economies, and the Trump agenda may face an electoral impasse if the president’s economic policies keep the market on its current volatile trajectory. Perhaps Trump-friendly, yet economically literate pundits are correct that the president’s goal is only to wield tariffs as a bargaining chip that will usher in a period of free trade and prosperity, but even if the Trump tariffs stick this time, Democrats may be unable to capitalize on the administration’s blunders.\n\nSCHUMER’S GRIP ON NEW YORK LOOSENS UNDER TRUMP 2.0\n\nThe Democratic Party, in its current iteration, is lost at sea. The party’s approval rating has fallen to a comically low 29%, and a new poll found that Democrats view Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as the leader who best reflects the values of the party, followed by the deeply unpopular former Vice President Kamala Harris and 83-year-old socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nTrump and Republicans have given and will continue to give Democrats ammunition in their fight to regain power, but Democrats would have to paint themselves as the rational, economically literate counterpoint to Trump’s so-called chaotic economic leadership. I doubt that the top Democrat going on an unpopular talk show to preach the virtues of taxation and preserving government waste brings them any closer to that goal.\n\nBrady Leonard (@bradyleonard) is a musician, political strategist, and host of The No Gimmicks Podcast.","summary":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) drew the ire of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party by caving to Republicans to avoid a government shutdown earlier this month, and he used his Tuesday appearance on The View to give yet another gift to Republicans. &#8220;You know what their attitude is, &#8216;I made my money all by myself.

This includes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing's massive global infrastructure project aimed at enhancing trade, investment, and economic cooperation across Asia and other parts of the world. More than 20 Latin American and Caribbean nations are currently involved in the project.Vincent Wang, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Adelphi University in New York, says China's increasing presence in the region is part of a long-term geopolitical strategy, which may result in the Asian powerhouse trying to get involved in elections in Florida.\"One of the most remarkable gains in Chinese foreign policy in recent years is the increasing power and presence of the communist state in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region traditionally considered America's backyard. This is due to China's growing diplomatic clout, the leftward inclination of several countries, and America's neglect,\" Wang told Newsweek.\"China is strategically focused on the state of Florida because of its importance to the region and to U.S. national politics. China is interested in getting involved in U.S. electoral politics. I would say that the threat posed by China today is more serious than the threat posed by the Soviet Union during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,\" Wang added.Newsweek reached out to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' office for comment via email.Over the years, China has invested billions of dollars in Caribbean and Latin American countries, particularly in infrastructure and trade relationships.A House Foreign Affairs Committee report found that China invested more than $10 billion in six Caribbean countries—Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and the Bahamas—between 2005 and 2022. These investments included tourism, transportation, agriculture, and energy sectors.A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told Newsweek that there are \"no geopolitical calculations\" in its engagement with Caribbean and Latin American countries,\"Cooperation between China and LAC countries has won popular support because it respects the will of the people, meets the needs of regional countries, and provides reliable options and broad prospects for the revitalization of the region,\" the spokesperson said. \"We take no interest in interfering in the internal affairs of any countries, including the elections in the U.S.\"Experts say Florida, home to a large Latino and Caribbean population, could be directly impacted if China decides to exert any influence in its neighboring regions.Deborah Norden, a professor of political science at Whittier College in California, said that President Donald Trump's major import tariff plans against China could strengthen these countries' connections with Beijing. This may indirectly affect Florida and potentially weaken U.S. regional dominance.Norden also warned that China could use its presence and clout in the region to influence elections in Florida and across the country.\"Under the Trump administration, the United States is rapidly yielding its already declining hegemony in Latin America to China,\" Norden told Newsweek. \"The threat of tariffs drives Latin American countries to expand economic integration with more eager partners, at the same time that the obliteration of U.S. foreign aid erases decades of cultivating loyalty in the region.\"\"In this context, China's rising role, especially in the Caribbean, may put Florida at risk in that its neighbors can no longer be expected to ally with the United States in an international conflict, particularly one between the U.S. and China,\" Norden added.\"The vulnerability of U.S. elections to both money and external propaganda also creates the possibility that China could, if it found it in its interest, choose to try to toss some coins on the scale of American elections in Florida or elsewhere.\"Florida was once considered the most important swing state in the country, as seen when the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore came down to just a few hundred votes.It has since become an increasingly strong red state, with Trump defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the 2024 election and DeSantis winning reelection as governor in 2022 by 19 points.DeSantis has previously taken steps to try to reduce Chinese influence in Florida over concerns about perceived threats from the Chinese Communist Party.This includes signing a law in 2022 prohibiting government entities from purchasing foreign technology products and services to prevent espionage. DeSantis also directed the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) to suspend the availability of school choice scholarships to four schools that it claimed direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party in September 2023.In May 2023, DeSantis signed three bills aimed at \"counteracting the malign influence\" of the Chinese Communist Party in Florida. One of these laws, Senate Bill 264, banned Chinese nationals without permanent U.S. residency from buying property or land in the state.In February 2024, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction temporarily halting the law's enforcement, ruling that it \"blatantly violates\" the 14th Amendment's protection against discrimination. The legal battle over SB 264 is ongoing.\"Governor DeSantis has prioritized the eradication of the Chinese Communist Party's interference in Florida. Under Governor DeSantis' leadership, Florida delivered the strongest posturing in the nation to confront economic, strategic, and security threat—the Chinese Communist Party,\" a spokesperson for DeSantis told Newsweek.In addition to its infrastructure projects, China has strengthened military ties with several Latin American and Caribbean countries, especially Venezuela.John Lee, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank who served as a senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister between 2016 and 2018, previously told Newsweek that Chinese activities raise a \"threefold\" threat to U.S. influence in the Caribbean and Latin America.\"First, increased economic, financial, and technological dependency on China offers Beijing opportunities to exert influence in the geopolitical decisions and even domestic politics of smaller states,\" Lee said.\"Second, China seeks to redefine and change the rules and standards used by nations to conduct commerce and trade in its favor. Third, Chinese development and operation of ports in foreign countries have been used by Beijing to gather significant military and economic intelligence for the purposes of aiding China in its geopolitical rivalry with the U.S.\"Gordon G. Chang, an author and expert on U.S.-China relations, recently suggested that China's presence in the Caribbean region could open Florida up to an influx of Chinese migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally via the Sunshine State.\"I think the Chinese are trying to gain influence in a region that is very close to the American homeland,\" Chang told Fox News in February.With U.S.-China tensions rising amid a trade war between the two powerhouses and Beijing deepening its presence in the West, it remains to be seen just how vital Florida could become if it becomes the forefront of a new geopolitical battle.","summary":"Experts discuss what China steadily expanding its influence in the Caribbean and Latin America could mean for the Sunshine State.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/florida-warned-china-influence-caribbean-latin-america-2047102","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2610164/florida-warned-chinas-growing-power.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 08:00:02","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.445},{"id":303206106,"title":"Trump revokes security clearances for Biden, Harris, and key political opponents","text":"Donald Trump revoked security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and other political opponents, citing national interest in a presidential memo issued on March 21, 2025The move also targeted Biden’s family and several individuals involved in investigations or impeachment proceedings against TrumpThis decision has sparked significant political controversy, reflecting ongoing tensions in U.S. politics\n\nWashington, D.C., United States – Former President Donald Trump issued a presidential memo on March 21, 2025, revoking security clearances for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and several other prominent Democrats and political adversaries.\n\nThe revocations also extended to former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, among others.\n\nAccording to Guardian UK, Trump stated that the decision was made in the \"national interest\" and directed executive departments to revoke unescorted access to secure government facilities for the individuals named.\n\nBroader implications of the revocations\n\nThe move also targeted Biden’s entire family, including Hunter and Ashley Biden, who lost their Secret Service protections earlier in the week.\n\nTrump’s actions appear to be a counterstrike against Biden, who had previously barred Trump from accessing classified information in 2021, citing concerns over his \"erratic behaviour.\"\n\nThe revocations also included individuals involved in Trump’s impeachment proceedings, such as Fiona Hill, Alexander Vindman, and Norman Eisen, as well as officials linked to investigations into Trump’s activities during the Biden administration.\n\nPolitical fallout and context\n\nThe revocations come amid reports of declining popularity for the Democratic Party, with an NBC News poll showing only 27% of registered voters holding positive views of the party.\n\nFormer President Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, had recently offered to assist in rebuilding the Democratic Party following the defeat of Kamala Harris in the November elections.\n\nTrump’s actions have been widely interpreted as a politically motivated response to his critics and opponents.\n\nUS security clearance\n\nSecurity clearance in the United States is a process used to grant individuals access to classified information based on their eligibility and trustworthiness. \n\nIt typically involves a thorough background check and is issued at different levels, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret, depending on the sensitivity of the information. \n\nThe clearance ensures that only authorised personnel can access material critical to national security, and it is periodically reviewed or revoked based on changes in circumstances.\n\nUS revokes legal status for 500,000 immigrants\n\nLegit.ng earlier reported that the United States has announced the termination of legal status for over 500,000 immigrants, ordering them to leave the country within weeks.

He was 56.\n\nMiller was diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer two years ago and wrote regularly for the Union-Tribune as he underwent treatment. His final column, about San Diego FC coach Mikey Varas, appeared in the Feb. 23 print edition.\n\nAn avid outdoorsman since his childhood in Iowa, Miller viewed San Diego first with an outsider’s awe before becoming a true local. He fished off the Coronado Islands, stalked the backstretch at Del Mar and was as comfortable in the Padres’ clubhouse as he was at an outdoors expo.\n\nHis coverage of the 2017 Lilac fire, which killed at least 46 horses at San Luis Rey Downs and burned their caretakers, earned Miller the 2019 Eclipse Award, given annually to the best horse racing writing by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\n“Bryce was an insightful columnist, a keen observer of the human condition and a masterful storyteller who easily won the trust of others — whether they were sources, strangers or stars,” said Lora Cicalo, the Union-Tribune’s editor. “But more than any of those things, he was a truly exceptional human being — generous, kind and unfailingly approachable — as anyone who crossed paths with him would attest.”\n\nA superb storyteller\n\nAs the U-T’s sports columnist, Miller told stories of San Diegans at their highest — and lowest.\n\nMiller stood on the White House’s South Lawn last July, when Point Loma Nazarene’s women’s soccer team was hailed by Vice President Kamala Harris for winning the Division II national championship. Days later, he was in the Nationals Park press box as Dylan Cease threw the second no-hitter in Padres history.\n\nMiller was in the champagne-soaked clubhouse after the Padres slayed the Dodgers in the 2022 National League Division Series, and again when they beat the Braves in October’s wild-card series.\n\n(Experience elsewhere meant Miller had a plan to stay dry; Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon’s errant champagne spray had ruined one of Miller’s tape recorders in the aftermath of Boston’s curse-breaking World Series title in 2004.)\n\nMiller followed SDSU’s men’s basketball team all the way through its 2023 NCAA Tournament run. When Lamont Butler’s jump shot beat Florida Atlantic and moved San Diego State to the national championship game, Miller put it in proper perspective.\n\n“The nation wondered aloud if a team that valued defense first and always could climb past offensive obstacles to summit the ‘One Shining Moment’ mountaintop,” he wrote. “They debated whether San Diego, the sports bridesmaid still hunting for the white dress, was doomed to getting close without a cigar in sight.”\n\nMiller’s gripping story about the Lilac fire and its aftermath was among his best work while at the Union-Tribune.\n\nMiller prided himself on his versatility. He wrote about marathoners, endurance athletes, animals of all stripes — and one Tiger. (His column on golfer Tiger Woods from the relocated Genesis Invitational was published last month).\n\n“Pretty much anything I asked him to do, he was willing to try,” said Jay Posner, who retired as the Union-Tribune’s sports editor in 2022. “I don’t think he knew much about horse racing when he came here, but he discovered there were good stories at Del Mar, and he enjoyed the chance to tell a good story. He quickly developed relationships there, covered the big races there and elsewhere, and I’ll always remember his incredible work after the Lilac fire.”\n\nMiller flew to Eritrea to tell the story of long-distance runner Meb Keflezighi, a San Diego High School graduate who grew up in the country. He shadowed late Padres owner Peter Seidler as he walked the streets of Pacific Beach, ministering to the homeless.\n\nMiller drew inspiration from those stories as he faced cancer treatment. Former Padres manager Bruce Bochy and Keflezighi were among those who reached out to Miller in recent weeks.\n\n“Lessons like those, unpeeled by spending time with those who are exceptional, resonate in myriad ways,” Miller wrote in August 2023. “Stick to it. Focus on today. Don’t quit. On to the next. Words like those, just words in some ways at the time, have gained significant heft.”\n\nFinding his tribe\n\nMiller grew up in Redfield, Iowa, a no-stoplight town “that, depending on the hour, might top 700” people, he said. He was one of 33 people in his high school’s graduating class.\n\nMiller graduated from the University of Iowa and worked for the Des Moines Register and with USA Today in Arlington, Va., before heading west to San Diego. He was hired in October 2015, an outsider in a city that can sometimes feel insular.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Miller to find his tribe.\n\nHe made fast friends near his homes in Pacific Beach and, later, Kensington.\n\nA dinner thrown by former Union-Tribune outdoors reporter Jim Brown connected Miller with former U-T columnist Tom Cushman, ex-Padres radio broadcaster Bob Chandler and J. Stacey Sullivan Jr., the attorney who negotiated the Chargers’ move from Los Angeles to San Diego in 1961.\n\n“We joked,” Brown said Saturday, “that he was the son we never knew we had.”\n\nBrown connected Miller with Bochy because of their shared love of the outdoors.\n\nMiller’s deep roster of friends and family were by his bedside in recent weeks, providing updates in the mornings and evenings to his friends from around the world.\n\nLongtime friend Keith Murphy broadcast his Iowa-based “Murph & Andy” radio show from Miller’s hospital earlier this month. An Iowa Hawkeyes pennant hung in his hospital room.\n\nOn air, Murphy’s co-host, Andy Fales, called Miller “the minibike of friends.”\n\n“You see Bryce and you’re like, ‘Oh man, I’m about to have some fun,’” Fales said. “He’s not a commuter friend. He’s not the friend that you lean on to get help with your TurboTax. He’s your buddy that you plug into a situation where you know you’re going to have fun, and he just makes it better.”\n\nMurphy posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday that Miller “squeezed so much joy into his 56 years.”\n\n“He did it by saying yes,” Murphy wrote. “Yes to fun. Yes to living. Yes to today. Figure the rest out later.”\n\nA world traveler\n\nMiller loved San Diego, but understood that a big world lay beyond the county line.\n\nMiller covered six Olympics during his journalism career. While at the Union-Tribune, he ventured to Mexico City (twice), the Dominican Republic, Asia and Africa.\n\nHe traveled to Seoul, South Korea, last March to cover the Padres’ series with the Dodgers. A month later, he flew to Japan for vacation.\n\nNothing brought him as much joy (and peace) as his annual fishing trip to Lac Seul in Ear Falls, Ontario, Canada. Every summer for nine years, Miller and friends drove the 10 ½ hours from Minneapolis in pursuit of walleye, pike and smallmouth bass. He wrote that the lake was “as much a cherished friend as a destination.”\n\nIt took on added importance in June, during what would be his final trip.\n\n“When your world includes near-weekly lab visits, chemotherapy treatments, a bathroom cabinet bulging with pill bottles and side effects that ambush you at every turn,” he wrote, “the rippling water and the riches it holds delivers powerful medicine of its own.”\n\nWriting, starring in stories\n\nMiller wrote stories. But he could star in them, too.\n\nShortly after moving to San Diego, Miller connected with legendary sports broadcaster Dick Enberg, a longtime La Jolla resident who enjoyed a final act as the Padres’ play-by-play man on television. The two would meet periodically for breakfast near Enberg’s home.\n\nOne meeting in particular elicited chuckles nearly a decade later.\n\nMiller, a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, watched the team clinch the 2016 World Series championship from a Pacific Beach tavern alongside many of his friends. The celebration continued deep into the night; by the time Miller arrived to meet Enberg the next morning, he was … run down.\n\nEnberg, a baseball junkie himself, understood what a World Series win meant to a Cubs fan. The two agreed to reschedule.\n\nMiller relished spring training trips to Peoria, Ariz., where he and Union-Tribune reporters and photographers would pile into a rented house to cover the Padres.\n\nIn 2023, aware there was a Seattle Mariners pitcher named Bryce Miller sharing the Peoria Sports Complex with the Padres, the columnist finagled a sit-down interview.\n\n“In one place this spring there are two Bryce Millers, one a guy who can hit 100 mph on the radar gun and, at age 24, is flirting with a big-league rotation spot. The other, 30 years his elder, typing fingers raw about the Padres on the other side of the Peoria Sports Complex shared by the teams,” he wrote. “One, spry and fit with the world in front of him. The other, wondering if it’s time for that AARP card after all.”\n\nUnion-Tribune reporter Kevin Acee traded barbs and one-liners with Miller for years.\n\n“The more I got to know Bryce, the more I liked him,” Acee said. “I teased him mercilessly, and he almost always just shook his head like he couldn’t believe I found myself so funny.”\n\nWhen the 2024 baseball season ended, Miller and Acee left town and went fishing. It was Acee — not the veteran angler Miller — who caught a fish that day, albeit one barely the size of his palm. When he returned to San Diego, Miller and another angler sent Acee an enlarged photo of his (tiny) catch to mark the occasion.\n\n“Oh, he drove me crazy,” Acee said. “… But he was also unselfish, hard-working and a really good human. He basically taught me how to fish, and I’ll be eternally grateful.”\n\nOpting for understanding\n\nIn an age where media personalities often manufacture outrage to attract listeners and clicks, Miller opted for understanding.\n\nHis writing was poetic and nuanced and, reflecting the columnist’s personality, never reactionary.\n\n“I’ll remember him for all those stories,” Posner said, “but mainly for just being a really good and kind person.”\n\nMiller adored sports and sportswriting because it brought him closer to people — with all their triumphs and tragedies.\n\n“That’s what you learn, covering all this sports stuff. It’s not really sports. It’s people,” Miller wrote in his final column for the Des Moines Register. “So it stays with you. It sticks to you — heart, mind and all.”\n\nMiller is survived by his brothers, Brian and Bruce, and a sister-in-law, Melissa; his mother, Bea Winters; and friends in Iowa, Kensington and beyond. Services are pending.","summary":"Miller was diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer two years ago.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/22/bryce-miller-union-tribune-sports-columnist-and-outdoorsman-dies-at-56/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-millerobit-0324-04.jpg?w=1024&h=753","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 05:47:25","author":"Ryan Finley","authors":["Ryan Finley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.451},{"id":303262178,"title":"US: Donald Trump Pulls Security Clearance For Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Cites, 'No Longer In National Interest'","text":"As reported by AFP, the individuals whose access to classified information was revoked included Biden, his family members, and Vice President Kamala Harris, who had been Trump's opponent in the presidential race.\n\nThe list also included former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.\n\nAlso Read: Bill Clinton's top 12 golden rules of politics – Practical, witty, and eye-opening \n\nIn a memorandum to agency heads and distributed by the White House communications office, Trump said the named officials should no longer be allowed access to classified material.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump said, as reported by Reuters.\n\n“I hereby direct every executive department and agency head ... to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals,” Trump said.\n\n“I also direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States Government facilities from these individuals.”\n\nAs reported by AFP, Former US presidents and national security officials traditionally retain a security clearance as a courtesy, and some find it useful in seeking employment with private contractors.\n\nAlso Read: Kamala Harris emerges as clear frontrunner for 2028 Democratic Party nomination: New poll","summary":"(MENAFN - Live Mint) On Good Friday, US President Donald Trump  followed through on his threat to revoke the security clearances of his predecessor, Joe Biden, and several senior former White House ...","url":"https://menafn.com/1109346149/US-Donald-Trump-Pulls-Security-Clearance-For-Hillary-Clinton-Kamala-Harris-Cites-No-Longer-In-National-Interest","image":"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-03/23/LM_d44a9image_story.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 05:33:30","author":"Date,MENAFN","authors":["Date","MENAFN"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jo","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":303249812,"title":"Trump rescinds security clearances of political rivals Harris, Clinton and others","text":"(CNN) — President Donald Trump, in a late-night Friday memo, directed federal agencies to revoke security clearances for more than a dozen of his perceived political enemies, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information” Trump said in the memo. “I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information.”\n\nThe memo applies to classified briefings and any access the individuals might have had to classified information based on previous tenure in Congress.\n\nThe move marks the latest instance of Trump pulling security clearances from political rivals, after the president in February said he was “immediately” revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and stopping his daily intelligence briefing.

Adam Kinzinger.\n\nEarlier this month Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that in accordance with a directive from Trump, she had revoked the security clearances of a number of the people named in Friday’s memo, including top Biden officials, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as two of the attorneys who brought legal cases against Trump: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nIn another late-night memo on Friday, Trump revisited past grudges against lawyers who have opposed him and vowed to punish lawyers and law firms by rescinding security clearances and canceling federal contracts they hold.\n\nHe directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the conduct of lawyers and law firms the administration considers to have filed frivolous lawsuits against the Trump administration or attempted to block immigration initiatives, broadening the president’s crackdown on the US legal community in the United States.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\n\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\n\nTrump’s revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\n\nBiden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, all lost their clearances.\n\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\n\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. They were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump’s role in the 6 January 2021 attack on congress.\n\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US house of representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\n\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses.\n\nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.\n\nManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump’s criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\n\nTrump’s legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\n\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\n\nFriday’s order listed him among the individuals who would lose access. However, Zaid told the BBC that “despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally”.\n\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm “the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could”.\n\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\n“I don’t care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn’t been active for five years,” Vindman wrote on X.\n\nEisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump’s order “just makes me file even more lawsuits!”.\n\nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden’s favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.\n\nIn February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden’s security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden “set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community to stop the 45th president of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former presidents”.\n\nIn 2021, Biden – serving as president at the time – barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his “erratic behaviour”.\n\nA 2024 justice department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\n\nIn 2023, justice department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election. – BBC","summary":"UNITED States (US) president Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.

Vance, who holds 5/2 odds (28.6%). Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is next in line with 9/1 odds (10%). Democratic Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California are also in the top five, with 9/1 and 10/1 odds, respectively.\n\nTrump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the only second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” The amendment was introduced after Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term presidency.\n\nTrump has repeatedly joked that he may end up serving more than two terms. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has claimed recently that Trump would run again in 2028. In an interview with journalist Chris Cuomo, Bannon said that his team was working to find ways Trump could bypass the restrictions laid out in the Constitution. \n\nA William Hill spokesperson told Newsweek that repealing the 22nd Amendment would be a difficult process, but Trump might attempt it due to his support in Congress.\n\n“Trump ally Steve Bannon predicted this week that the POTUS would run for a third term and win, so there’s certainly a feeling that it could be possible, and we’re not taking any chances as we’ve installed him in our next president market at 5/1, behind only favorite J.D.

He uses me as a punchline whenever he feels the need.’\n\n‘The Supreme Court has given him ultimate power – the powers of a king or a monarch,’ she warned, referring to what she perceives as the erosion of American democracy. ‘That’s not what the United States is about. It’s terrifying.’ \n\nIt appears Trump has not forgotten O’Donnell either.

You can just be a normal person.”‘\n\nDespite settling into Irish life, O’Donnell insists she’s not done with America entirely.\n\n‘A large part of me does [want to go back and fight],’ she said. ‘That’s what I’ve done my whole career.’\n\nBut before that, O’Donnell says she now plans to pursue Irish citizenship.\n\nKnown for her harsh war of words with Trump over the years, long before he became president, the mother of five has been even more vocal to hammer his tough talk and policies in interviews and on social media since he started his first term in 2016.\n\nO’Donnell’s feud with Trump dates back to 2006, when she criticized him on ‘The View’ for allowing that year’s Miss USA pageant winner, Tara Conner, to keep her crown after she was caught drinking underage.\n\nTrump owned the Miss USA competition at the time and decided to not to strip the 20-year-old model’s title, stating he believed in ‘second chances’ and that Conner would be going into rehab.\n\nWhen Trump heard that O’Donnell had mocked Conner’s conduct, he called her ‘a real loser.’\n\nOver the years, Trump has said ‘The Flintstones’ actress is ‘dumb,’ ‘desperate,’ ‘fat,’ and ‘disgusting both inside and out.’\n\nHe also said that if he were in charge of The View, which O’Donnell was on for a brief time in the 2006-2007 season, he would have fired her.\n\n‘I’d fire Rosie, I mean I’d look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and I’d say, “Rosie, you’re fired,”‘ he said, borrowing his catchphrase from ‘The Apprentice.’\n\nTheir war of words reignited in 2015, after Trump shocked the world and announced a run for the White House.\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in August, moderator Megyn Kelly asked the then-real estate magnate and television personality about his treatment of women.\n\n‘You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,’ Kelly said.\n\nTrump interjected with, ‘Only Rosie O’Donnell.’ The one-liner got a tremendous response from the audience, who filled the auditorium with laughs and cheers.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, later attacked Trump in a debate, pointing out that he had called women nasty names just like Kelly had.\n\nIn that September debate, Trump once again name-dropped O’Donnell as a defense.\n\n‘Rosie O’Donnell — I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,’ he said.\n\nIn one of more recent critiques she shared a video on TikTok of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hugging children and picking them up with a smile on his face.\n\n‘If only the current president had a drop of his caring committed heart #resist #protest #defythem #love #FDT,’ she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn December, O’Donnell took to TikTok to bash Time magazine for naming Donald Trump its man of the year for 2024, as reported by The Daily Beast. \n\n‘Man of the year, Donald Trump. Well, f**k you Time Magazine. F**k you, seriously,’ O’Donnell said. ‘How about most dangerous man of the year? How about most criminal man of the year? How about the worst president we’ve ever had… of the year.’\n\nRosie becomes the latest celebrity to have move in the wake of Trump being elected to a second term in office.\n\nAmong the stars to recently move are actor Richard Gere, who sold his $11 million Connecticut home in November and moved to Madrid, Spain, in part to be closer to his wife’s in-laws, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nGere, 75, told the outlet he felt it would be a ‘great adventure’ to relocate with Alejandra and their sons Alexander, five, and James, four, ‘because I have never lived full-time outside of the United States.’ \n\nFormer talk show host, comedian, and long-time liberal Ellen DeGeneres, 67, and her wife Portia de Rossi, 52, opted to move to the English countryside in December. \n\nIn a 20th anniversary tribute to her wife DeGeneres wrote how she was ‘so happy we get to travel and explore the world together’ in a selfie snap taken in the UK.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRosie O&#8217;Donnell has suggested the 2024 presidential election may have been stolen&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Rosie O&#8217;Donnell shares strange theory about Elon Musk after leaving the US following the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/rosie-odonnell-shares-strange-theory-about-elon-musk-after-leaving-the-us-following-the-election/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/22/22/96473211-14527029-image-m-17_1742682328712.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 01:54:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":303132528,"title":"Trump voids security clearances for Biden, Kamala and Clinton","text":"BRIDGEWATER: US President Donald Trump on Friday took away security clearances for former president Joe Biden, former vice president Kamala Harris, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and several other senior former White House and national security officials in latest move against his Democratic opponents.\n\nThe list of names, stripped of their authorisation to see state secrets, included Biden, his family members, and former vice-president and Trump presidential rival Kamala Harris.

This is karma': Insiders reveal what's going on in Alec and Hilaria Baldwin's marriage after THAT humiliating video","text":"When Hilaria Baldwin’s red carpet evisceration of husband Alec went viral last week, the snorts of laughter in Hollywood could barely be contained.\n\nIn footage shared millions of times on social media, yoga instructor Hilaria, 41, snapped at her 66-year-old movie star husband after he interrupted her during an interview, sniping irritably: ‘Oh my god. When I’m talking, you’re not talking.’\n\nAs her husband mumbled ‘I’m sorry’, Hilaria doubled down on the public tongue-lashing, throwing her hands up and repeating: ‘When I’m talking, you’re not talking!’\n\nWithin hours of the cringeworthy spat at Planet Hollywood in Manhattan going public, social media influencer Hilaria posted a jokey video to her nearly one million Instagram followers, in which a grovelling Alec apologised for his ‘manterrupting’ and ‘correctile dysfunction’.\n\nBut the excruciating public humiliation of a man who once, it’s claimed, inspired ‘fear and loathing’ in Hollywood, drew glee from those who say they were ‘terrorised’ by the star’s aggressive and intimidating behaviour.\n\nOne former studio executive told The Mail on Sunday: ‘People are relishing the fact that karma has finally come for Alec. He terrorised movie sets for years with his behaviour, and now he’s being publicly ridiculed by his much younger wife. It’s delightful. There’s only one person wearing the pants in that household, and it ain’t Alec.’\n\nOn Thursday, Hilaria, who has seven children with Baldwin, appeared on the Today show on America’s NBC network and seemed to repeat the sentiments she expressed on the red carpet. ‘Since I met Alec a lot of people have spoken for me, have taken my narrative,’ she said. ‘I don’t want that any more.’\n\nAlec’s slap-down represents a dramatic volte-face in the public’s perception of the couple which, until recently, firmly placed Alec in the driving seat of their 12-year marriage.\n\nExperts say it is clear the balance in the relationship has flipped. Eric Schiffer, of Reputation Management Consultants, said: ‘Alec is someone who was known in Hollywood for being macho, for flying off the handle, for being aggressive’.\n\nHe cited Baldwin’s volatile marriage to first wife Kim Basinger and his ‘appalling’ treatment of their daughter Ireland who, during their contentious 2002 divorce -– when she was just 11 – he called a ‘pig’ and ‘daughter of a bitch’ for not picking up the phone when he rang.\n\nMr Schiffer said: ‘Clearly he’s worked on his anger management issues to keep his current wife and family together. He’s learned from past mistakes, which is an admirable trait. But what happened on the red carpet between Hilaria and Alec is an abomination. It’s not healthy for either partner.\n\n‘He was utterly humiliated in public which, much as they want to joke about it, will have been devastating for an old-school macho man like Alec.\n\n‘Hilaria comes across as unhinged. She’s pushing her way in front of the cameras and the dynamic is very much one of a young, attention-seeking spouse and an older husband who is desperately trying not to upset her.’\n\nAs a couple, they’ve certainly come a long way since they met outside a New York vegan restaurant in 2011. Bizarrely, she claimed she didn’t know who he was because she ‘never watched TV’.\n\nWhen they married in the Basilica of St Patrick’s Old Cathedral in Manhattan in 2012, to the congregation it looked like Alec had bagged himself an exotic Spanish senorita. There were nods to her ‘heritage’ everywhere: she wore a traditional Spanish lace veil ‘mantilla’ and cooled herself with a flamenco hand fan while the pair exchanged rings engraved with ‘somos un buen equipo’ – meaning ‘we are a good team’.\n\nShe claimed to have been born in Spain, spoke with a hint of a Spanish accent and, during one infamous TV cookery segment, seemed to forget the English word for ‘cucumber’.\n\nYet it turned out Hilaria was as American as apple pie, having been born in Boston with the real name Hillary. Alec was forced to leap to the rigorous defence of his wife from what he called ‘online bullying’ as she was accused of cultural appropriation.\n\nAt one point, the argument entered the realms of parody as Alec insisted Hilaria was ‘almost Spanish’ because she went to Majorca on holiday as a child and her brother and parents now live on the island.\n\nThe growing power imbalance has been playing out on the Discovery+ TV channel in the family’s reality show The Baldwins, which, inexplicably, the actor chose to film last summer as he faced involuntary manslaughter charges for accidentally shooting cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in 2021.\n\nWhile charges against Baldwin were later dropped, critics have panned the show, accusing the couple of callously exploiting their seven photogenic young children to create ‘positive PR’ for themselves in the wake of the tragedy. The Mail’s TV critic Christopher Stevens gave the show one star, describing Hilaria has having ‘the air of a bargain-basement Meghan Markle’. And he ended his review saying: ‘Last week, Alec Baldwin was just a has-been actor to me. Now I know exactly who he and his wife are. What hideous people.’\n\nAlec’s reputation and professional standing seemed irreparably damaged following the appalling, accidental shooting of 42-year-old Ms Hutchins.\n\nIn a scandalous oversight, a prop revolver, which Alec was using on set, actually contained a live round. Ms Hutchins died and director Joel Souza was injured, leading to both Alec and the set armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed being charged with one count each of involuntary manslaughter, while assistant director David Halls agreed to plead guilty to a charge of the negligent use of a deadly weapon.\n\nGutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and Halls received a six-month probation order.\n\nSpeaking on The Baldwins, Hilaria tells how her husband was ‘suicidal’ following the incident, and suffered ‘survivor’s guilt’, adding: ‘It’s hard sometimes.’\n\nOn the show, a clearly emotional Alec is seen attending therapy with his wife. Head in hands, he says: ‘I don’t think I could have survived this without you and the kids.’\n\nBaldwin is still sensitive about the issue. Last month he threatened to punch a comedian impersonating Donald Trump who approached him outside the couple’s £10 million Manhattan apartment, making dubious jokes about the shooting.\n\nReputation manager Mr Schiffer, who knows the Baldwin family, said: ‘I’m not sure Alec is comfortable putting his family front and centre this way.\n\n‘But what do any of us know about what happens behind closed doors in a marriage?\n\n‘I’d be inclined to say Alec is trying to hold it all together for the sake of the seven children he has with Hilaria.\n\n‘He’s 66. He doesn’t need this drama. When you watch him on the reality show he doesn’t look comfortable. He adores his wife. And she’s leading the way.’\n\nAnother former colleague, who worked with Alec on the 1990 thriller The Hunt For Red October, also applauds the change in him, saying: ‘I hadn’t seen him in years. He always had anger issues, he made no secret of them. In the early days of his career, he was drinking and doing drugs and, I think, that added to his volatility.\n\n‘He got out of Hollywood and went to New York. People in LA couldn’t stand him and we were happy to see him go, and I think the feeling was mutual. After he and Kim split up he wanted to get the hell out. Alec was never going to lead an uneventful life.\n\n‘But I watch him with Hilaria in the reality TV show, I think it’s sweet. He clearly adores her and she’s given him the family he’s always wanted.’\n\nAs for Hilaria, cynics believe she has got what she always wanted too: fame. And she shows no sign of backing away from the spotlight.\n\nOn Thursday morning – even as critics were dissecting her brutal take-down of her husband – she popped up on the top-rated NBC Today show with the couple’s 11-year-old daughter Carmen to promote a new beauty book containing tips for pre-teenagers.\n\nYet for all the speculation about their relationship, for those who have seen the couple together it’s clear it works for them, however feisty and combative it seems. A colleague who attended Hilaria’s yoga class in 2017 was surprised to see an adoring Alec waiting in the wings.\n\n‘I remember that he couldn’t keep his hands off her,’ she recalls. ‘He was obviously mad about her.’\n\nThere are others who remember Hilaria back in her Boston days, when she still known as Hillary Lynn Hayward-Thomas.\n\nDavid Golann, 41, who attended The Cambridge School of Weston with her, told the Mail: ‘She was always a kind, reserved person. It sounds like she’s changed.’\n\n‘Back then she certainly made no claims to Spanish heritage. On the contrary, she was proud that her family dated back to the pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower.\n\n‘She was always nice and kind to me. Everyone can draw their own conclusions [about what happened last week] and they will.’\n\nFor Hilaria, it’s now back to business as usual. She has a ‘full schedule’ to promote her book with Carmen, which is entitled\n\nGlowing Up: Recipes To Rock Your Natural Beauty. She has also engineered to be on the cover of the People celebrity magazine to promote the reality show, with an interview in which she spoke about her husband suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after the Rust shooting. But, in Hollywood, sceptism remains. \n\nThe Baldwins came after Alec won acclaim for his parody of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, an American comedy institution especially popular with the Left.\n\nOne person familiar with the production said the series was commissioned with the hope that Kamala Harris would win the US election in November, but Trump’s return to power has changed the political climate.\n\nThe source said: ‘When it was commissioned, Joe Biden was in the White House. Alec Baldwin is an ultra-liberal who played Trump on Saturday Night Live. He’s yesterday’s man, but he knows what’s going on. He’s many things but he’s not stupid.’\n\nNor, many would say, is his wife, who’s never slow in spotting an opportunity. As the insider says: ‘Don’t underestimate Hilaria.’","summary":"The excruciating public humiliation of Alec Baldwin, who once, it's claimed, inspired 'fear and loathing' in Hollywood, drew glee from those who say they were 'terrorised' by the star's behaviour.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14526619/Alec-Baldwin-Hilaria-marriage-Hollywood-video-argument.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/22/18/96467887-0-image-m-15_1742666901115.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 01:36:53","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":303116690,"title":"President Trump Endorses Conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Candidate Brad Schimel","text":"President Donald Trump endorsed conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel on Friday during early voting and ahead of the highly consequential election on April 1.\n\n“WISCONSIN: There is a very important Election for State Supreme Court on April 1st, and Early Voting is now underway,” Trump said in a post to Truth Social. He went on:\n\nBrad Schimel is running against Radical Left Liberal Susan Crawford, who has repeatedly given child molesters, rapists, women beaters, and domestic abusers “light” sentences. She is the handpicked voice of the Leftists who are out to destroy your State, and our Country — And if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin. All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel. \n\nTrump added, including a link to a voting information website:\n\nBy turning out and VOTING EARLY, you will be helping to Uphold the Rule of Law, Protect our Incredible Police, Secure our Beloved Constitution, Safeguard our Inalienable Rights, and PRESERVE LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. SO IMPORTANT – PLEASE GET OUT AND VOTE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \n\nSchimel, a Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge and a former Wisconsin attorney general, thanked President Trump for his endorsement, saying he is “humbled and deeply honored.”\n\n“The stakes of this race could not be any higher. On April 1, Wisconsin conservatives must unite to restore objectivity to our Supreme Court and save our state like we saved our country in November. The job is not done. We cannot allow America’s success to bypass Wisconsin,” he said in a statement. \n\nWisconsin GOP Chairman Brian Schimming also celebrated the endorsement saying, “Momentum is on our side.” \n\n“Wisconsinites are sick and tired of judicial activists like dangerously liberal Susan Crawford,” Schimming said in a statement. “President Donald J. Trump’s endorsement of Judge Brad Schimel will bring more attention to this critical election to save Wisconsin and America. While Susan Crawford has made it abundantly clear she is running to legislate from the bench, Judge Brad Schimel will stand by the Constitution and the rule of law on the Wisconsin Supreme Court,” stated WisGOP Chairman Brian Schimming. ” \n\nScott Presler, whose whose organization Early Vote Action works in swing states to register Republicans and encourage early voting, reacted to the endorsement in a post to X.\n\n“This is a game changer,” he said.\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said he “couldn’t agree more with President Trump.”\n\n“Everyone who voted for Trump in November needs to get out and vote for Brad Schimel to save our Wisconsin Supreme Court from the radical left,” he said.\n\nThe race between Dane County Circuit Judge Crawford and Schimel follows a blowout Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023, in which liberal-leaning Janet Protasiewicz beat conservative candidate Dan Kelly and flipped the balance of the court to 4-3 majority liberal.\n\nWhile conservatives have the chance to take back the majority once more with the retirement of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, Democrats view the battle as a chance to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats and help them close in on the Republicans’ slim majority.\n\n“To say that what happens in Wisconsin will not stay in Wisconsin is putting it really mildly,” Schimming previously told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview.\n\n“It could literally mean the success of President Trump’s term. It could literally mean them having the votes to bring impeachment articles against him,” he added. “The implications of what happens in Wisconsin would be a political earthquake for the House of Representatives.”\n\nDemocrats’ view of the race as a pathway to power in D.C. is not mere speculation and has been touted openly. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan.13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler has a subject line that reads: “Chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.”\n\n“But winning this race could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026,” the email reads. \n\nThe two seats are currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin and Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) in the 3rd Congressional District in the western part of the battleground state. \n\n“They got caught saying the quiet thing out loud, and they revealed what they’re up to. This is, as it was in 2023, a power play to attract enormous amounts of money from partisan donors and turn that into results on the court,” Schimel told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview, referring to the email.\n\nIn Wisconsin, state Supreme Court justices serve ten-year terms. While the judicial race is nonpartisan, both sides of the political aisle are heavily invested in the results of the election. The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race is expected to be even more expensive than the 2023 election, which shattered national spending records for a judicial contest at $56 million and brought in massive out-of-state spending.\n\nRecent polling is showing a tight race in the battleground state, with Crawford ahead by five points — slightly outside the survey’s 4-point margin of error. Polling earlier this month indicated that many voters didn’t know much about either candidate.\n\nPresident Trump’s 2024 victory was notably only the second time a Republican presidential candidate has won Wisconsin in nearly 40 years — with Trump securing the first win during his 2016 run. Both times, Trump saw a narrow margin of victory, although Trump has received increasingly more votes during all three of his presidential runs in the swing state.\n\nIn 2016, Trump beat out Hillary Clinton 47.8 percent to 47 percent, 1,405,284 votes to 1,382,536. In 2020, Biden won the state by a slim margin, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent, but Trump pulled in more votes for himself than in 2016 at 1,610,184. In 2024, Trump won Wisconsin over Kamala Harris, 49.6 percent to 48.7 percent, and secured more votes than in 2020 at 1,697,626.\n\n“Trump got about 1.7 million here in Wisconsin…[If] we get 60 percent of those voters, which is just a little over a million, if we get six out of ten Trump voters to go vote for Schimel, we’re going to win the Supreme Court,” Schimming told Breitbart News.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

\n\nFalling in line \n\nMost important, with some 60 other schools in the federal crosshairs for similar misconduct, including Harvard, Penn and Northwestern, a clear settlement pattern has now been established. \n\nBet your bottom dollar the other schools will fall in line. \n\nThey can’t afford not to. \n\nLike Columbia, they are addicted to federal money. \n\nWithout it, much of the research they do wouldn’t be affordable. \n\nAnd without that research, which ranges from the hard sciences to social sciences, and carries global implications in such areas as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, the schools would not be able to attract the best and brightest talent. \n\nBut even allowing for the fact that Columbia caved because it would be a shadow of itself without taxpayer funds, the agreement is a tremendous victory for the US and for common decency. \n\nIt is obscene how far elite universities have strayed from their basic missions. \n\nMany schools have become propaganda factories that turn impressionable young minds against their own country and Western civilization itself. \n\nThat gushers of taxpayer money have been crucial to this abomination was a scandal that few outsiders appreciated until Trump connected the dots. \n\nThankfully, he didn’t merely complain about the terrorist-supporting professors and the kaffiyeh-wearing students who called for the elimination of Israel. \n\nAnd he didn’t regard it as acceptable that classes would be disrupted, buildings seized and Jewish students harassed and intimidated as the crazies played out their hateful fantasies. \n\nNor did Trump stop with just threatening the cash cow. \n\nHis double-barrel approach became clear with the arrest of and the plan to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia grad who led protests on its campus last year and the Barnard campus as recently as this month. \n\nAlthough the left would have you believe the bid to revoke Khalil’s green card and send him packing violates the First Amendment, the administration cites his alleged “activities aligned to Hamas” as the reason for his removal. \n\nIt is also seeking to deport a Cornell student on similar grounds. \n\nMomodou Taal, who has a student visa, has been asked to surrender to ICE. \n\n‘Not a suicide pact’ \n\nThese are not free speech cases. \n\nThey are about actions that oppose American policies and interests and we are not obligated to welcome those who came here to do us harm. \n\nAs the late Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg eloquently declared in a 1963 case, “the constitution is not a suicide pact.” \n\nThe campus crackdown is long overdue and serves as the latest reminder that elections have consequences. \n\nAmong the many differences between Trump and Joe Biden, this is another very important one. \n\nBiden ignored the radicals when he wasn’t tacitly agreeing with them that Israel, not Hamas, was the problem in Gaza, as if the horrors of the Oct. 7 invasion never happened. \n\nSimilarly, Kamala Harris, when she became the party’s nominee, looked away from the attacks on Jews in a pandering bid to win the support of Muslim voters in swing states. \n\nIn fact, with the exception of New York’s Rep. Ritchie Torres and a few others, nearly all top Democrats simultaneously denounced Israel and were silent in the face of the antisemitic mobs at home. \n\nWhile Republicans in Congress were condemning Ivy League presidents for failing to protect Jewish students in the face of clear intimidation, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was privately telling the same people to “keep heads down” because their “problems are really only among Republicans,” according to a message Schumer sent that was released last week. \n\nEven now, most Dems are opposing the White House bid to rid campuses of those who openly support terrorists and call for the death of Jews. \n\nThe rush to protect Khalil is a continuation of a shameful pattern. \n\nBut thanks to Trump, college leaders no longer have the luxury of keeping their heads down and ignoring Republicans and the travesties unfolding on their campuses. \n\nWith a new sheriff in town, resistance would be very, very expensive. \n\n$5B in fed contracts \n\nColumbia, for example, gets about 25% of its operating money from Washington, and reportedly has federal contracts valued at $5 billion over several years. \n\nThe prospect of losing even $400 million in a first round of penalties set off alarms bells and led to disputes in faculty meetings about who would lose their sinecures if Trump turned off the spigot. \n\nMeanwhile, other schools on the list imposed hiring freezes over the possibility they would also have to absorb major cuts. \n\nAlready some of these schools are facing budget problems because the White House, in a bid to save money, plans to limit the overhead funds that follow federal grants. \n\nThose added funds can be as high as 75% of the grant itself and are used to pay for everything from turning on the lights to hiring assistants. \n\nIn some cases, the grants are treated as slush funds for star faculty members and university leaders. \n\nA Trump plan in the works would limit those added funds to 15% of the underlying grant, which is adding to the campus panic. \n\nNaturally, some members of the academic ecosystem are losing their minds over the changes and see Columbia’s surrender as the end of the world. \n\nThat implies a childish fantasy that it’s unfair to attach conditions to taxpayer money. \n\nBesides, what Columbia agreed to are things it should have been doing all along. \n\nBut nothing would have changed if Trump hadn’t dropped the hammer. \n\nAll the pleading and scolding and jawboning in the world would have come to nothing without his threat to take away the money. \n\nWell done, Mr. President.","summary":"The screaming headline was prophetic: “Trump’s Policies Shake Academic World and May Reshape U.S. Culture.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/opinion/michael-goodwin-columbia-university-is-all-about-the-money-as-they-cave-in-to-trumps-demands/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2025-washington-dc-trump-traveling-100877532-e1742687973316.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:41:44","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.102}]}
