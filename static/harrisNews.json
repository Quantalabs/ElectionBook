What Betting Odds Say","text":"The odds are firmly against President Donald Trump ending the Russia-Ukraine war during his first 90 days back in the White House, according to a popular online betting market.Newsweek reached out for comment to the White House via email on Tuesday.Why It MattersDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to end the war in Ukraine within \"24 hours.\" While the self-imposed deadline came and went, the president has continued to call for a fast end to the war.Trump initially received a significant amount of backlash for opening a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war while largely leaving Ukraine out of the loop.Last week's contentious meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which featured Trump and Vice President JD Vance engaging in a heated argument with their guest in front of the press, and a freeze on U.S. aide to Ukraine has only intensified the criticism and doubts about peace.What To KnowRussia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, significantly escalating a war between the countries that has been taking place since Putin's forces invaded and annexed Crimea in March 2014.While the U.S. had been strongly allied with Ukraine and provided significant military aid to the country since the 2022 invasion, relations have been icy since Trump's return to office.Polymarket, which was funded in part by prominent Trump backer Peter Thiel, showed Trump with a 27 percent chance of ending the Russia-Ukraine war during his \"first 90 days\" as of early Tuesday evening.The odds have risen in recent days from a low of 19 percent on Sunday. However, the odds are well below a high point of 53 percent on November 7, two days after Trump won his second term.Polymarket odds, which are based on bets by users rather than any outside factors like polling, accurately predicted that Trump would defeat former Vice President Kamala Harris last year in the presidential election.According to Polymarket's terms, Trump will have ended the war if the following condition is met: \"An armistice, ceasefire, or negotiated settlement is announced by both Ukraine and Russia regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine at any point between the Associated Press calling the election for Donald Trump, and April 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.\"What People Are SayingTrump, during a White House press conference on Monday: \"The deal could be made very fast. It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast. Now, maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal. And if somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long.That person will not be listened to very long. Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal, they've suffered more any anyone else.\"Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, in an opinion article published by U.S. News & World Report on Monday: \"The only way to get a real peace deal would be to convince Putin that he cannot conquer any more territory. That would entail the U.S. and our European partners giving Ukraine more weapons to create a stalemate on the battlefield. Trump, however, has signaled the opposite...Trump and his team have not proposed in public a single concession that Putin should make to end this war. Not one. Yet we are already seeing signs of Putin's future demands: limits on the number of soldiers Ukraine can have in its army, a ban on Ukraine importing weapons and other constraints on Ukraine's sovereignty.\"What Happens NextIt is unclear when, or if, a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will be reached. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Trump would announce during his joint speech to Congress that a mineral rights deal between Ukraine and the U.S., which could be a key component for a deal, had been signed.However, the White House quickly pushed back on the report, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling Fox News that \"there is no signing planned.\" A report from CBS News speculated that Trump was holding out for a \"bigger, better deal.\"","summary":"Trump repeatedly promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war within \"24 hours\" during his 2024 presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/can-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-90-days-what-betting-odds-say-2039619","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2600401/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-war-peace-deal-odds.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:14:28","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":296746610,"title":"Left-wing streamer walks back comment about killing Republican senator after Twitch suspension","text":"Left-wing political commentator Hasan Piker has walked back remarks urging Republicans to “kill” Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., after getting suspended from Twitch, a popular video live-streaming service.\n\nPiker’s statement came during a stream in which he reacted to an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who discussed measures to “carve out” waste, fraud and abuse within Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDuring the stream, Piker insisted that fraud primarily comes from providers, not recipients of government programs.\n\n“They’re not tackling providers; they’re not actually going after false billing. They are trying to cut recipients. [Fraud] is not happening at the point of recipient. If you cared about Medicare fraud or Medicaid fraud, you would kill Rick Scott,” he said.\n\nThe streamer noted that Columbia/HCA was fined over $1.7 billion when Scott was CEO of the healthcare company following an investigation into its “Medicare billing.”\n\nTwitch did not provide a specific reason for the suspension, although the timing of the violation and Piker’s ensuing X posts suggest that the above comments pushed the platform to act.\n\nThis is Piker’s fifth Twitch suspension.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Piker apologized, telling his social media followers, “I’m sorry!”\n\n“I’ll choose my words carefully next time and say, ‘if Mike Johnson cares abt [sic] medicare fraud (since he wants to cut 800m from Medicaid/Medicare) he’d call for MAX PUNISHMENT for current fl gop senator/former gov Rick Scott- who has done the most Medicare fraud in us history!'” he continued.\n\nFive minutes later, Piker addressed his critics.\n\n“Big shout out to the right-wing free speech lovers who took time out of their day screaming about DEI & immigrants, to cry abt [sic] this!” he wrote on X.\n\nHasan and Twitch didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and other Democrats have sat down with Piker, who was praised in December by Kamala Harris’ former deputy campaign manager, Rob Flaherty.\n\n“We need a whole thriving ecosystem,” Flaherty told Semafor following Harris’ election loss. “It’s not just Pod Save America, though I think we should have more of them. It’s not just Hasan Piker. We should have more Hasan Pikers. It’s also the cultural creators, the folks who are one rung out who influence the nonpartisan audience. Those things all need to happen together.”\n\nPiker, who has a following on Twitch of over 2.8 million, and who previously raised more than $1 million for Palestinian aid, has used his platform with millions of followers to downplay and justify terrorist attacks such as Oct. 7 and 9/11 as acts of resistance in recent years.\n\nDuring a 2019 livestream, Piker praised the “brave f—ing soldier” who wounded conservative U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, while he was deployed to Afghanistan as a Navy SEAL, asking, “Didn’t he go to war and, like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen, a brave f—ing soldier, f—ed his eyehole with their d—?”\n\nHe went on to say that “America deserved 9/11, I’m saying it,” before later walking it back and saying it was “inappropriate.”\n\nPiker raised $100k for charity on Saturday alongside the creators of “No Other Land,” a film co-directed by Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers.\n\nThe film won the Oscar for Best Documentary the following day.","summary":"YouTuber Hasan Piker previously called Hamas a 'lesser evil' than Israel and claimed the US 'deserved' 9/11.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/media/hasan-piker-walks-back-comment-about-killing-rick-scott-following-twitch-suspension/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2018-los-angeles-convention-center-99768943.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V2x0xCy0-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-04 23:57:01","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":296746624,"title":"Stephen A. Smith spars with Whoopi Goldberg on the real cause of Democrats’ 2024 loss","text":"ESPN host Stephen A. Smith challenged Whoopi Goldberg during “The View” on Tuesday over the Democratic Party’s messaging problem after the liberal host attempted to defend the messaging by comparing it to President Donald Trump.\n\n“If you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it’s not about him winning. It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, ‘Hey, you should be a party for the working class,’ which the Democrats was once known for. They’re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That’s why they lost. He didn’t win. The Democrats lost,” he told the co-hosts of “The View.”\n\nSmith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, “Making sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right. All these things are the things that the Democrats have always said.”\n\nShe then compared that to President Donald Trump’s early executive actions, specifically in cutting federal jobs, as Smith pushed back.\n\n“Before you brought that up, you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating. I’m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,” he said. \n\nGoldberg shot back, “Oh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.” \n\nSmith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump.\n\n“The bottom line, you’re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn’t do, he didn’t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do? Who is the Democrat, who is the vice president under Barack Obama? He opens borders. Over 12-plus million people entered the country. You had stuff going on in the streets, there was a migrant crisis,” Smith said.\n\nIn the second segment, Smith made the argument that Trump did have a mandate from the American people, pointing to his gains within minority groups. \n\n“If you’re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3%, and looking at that 1.5% difference, that’s an excuse to say, what we did really wasn’t that bad, we should continue to do that. No, don’t continue to do it, find a new strategy,” he said. \n\nSmith demanded to know what Democrats were doing to win future elections, and said he would continue to interview prominent Democratic figures and ask them that question.\n\n“I want somebody to step up and recognize that man in the Oval Office, whether you like it or not, is potent, he’s coming, and he wins, you got to find a way to beat him,” he said.\n\nHe also told the co-hosts, who all supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the election, that the Democratic Party has no real leader right now.","summary":"ESPN host Stephen A.

But more than a month into Trump's second term, Mann, a 41-year-old Phoenix resident, said he was cautiously optimistic about what he had seen so far.\n\n\"He's doing what he said he would do,\" Mann said. He was encouraged by reports of fewer migrants crossing the border, in favor of reducing aid to Ukraine and hopeful that Elon Musk would root out excessive government spending and, \"like Robin Hood,\" deliver the savings to citizens in the form of $5,000 dividend checks.\n\n\"I'm just waiting to see how it pans out,\" Mann said. \"At the end of the day, he's our president; you can't just wish him bad.\"\n\nAs Trump prepares to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening -- a stand-in for the State of the Union during a president's first year in office -- voters in battleground districts around the country are trying to make sense of the frenzy of executive orders and other actions that have so far defined Trump's second term.\n\nIn Arizona's 1st Congressional District, around the swingy suburbs of Phoenix and Scottsdale -- areas that helped flip Arizona blue in 2020 before shifting rightward again last year -- reactions to Trump ranged from elation among Republicans to disgust among Democrats, with a few wary independents wedged in between.\n\nThe partisan rancor in this competitive district remains high, but in conversations with several dozen voters across the political spectrum, many seemed willing to give Trump the runway he needs to execute his \"America first\" vision of the country.\n\n\"I feel great,\" said Rashad Davis, 33, a Republican who was particularly enthused about the import tariffs Trump has announced. \"He's sticking to his word -- everything he said.\"\n\nMany voters singled out the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Musk's cost-cutting effort, as a major driver of their open-mindedness toward the Trump administration -- at least, to a point.\n\nMaureen Wielgus, 69, said that she had voted for Trump in each of the last two elections and that she was pleased with his performance so far, though she added that he needed \"to soften his approach a bit sometimes.\"\n\nWielgus had similarly qualified praise for Musk's initiative, which has fired thousands of workers and boasted of tremendous government savings, often only to backtrack and delete its mistakes.\n\n\"They're going in like a bulldozer, a little firm,\" she said. \"But they're finding the corruption and the fraud.\"\n\nAround the state, Arizonans seemed to be split on Trump. Recent polling there has found that roughly half of the state's residents at least somewhat approve of his handling of the job. Rich Thau, the president of the nonpartisan research firm Engagious, said that in a recent focus group of a dozen Arizona residents who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 before switching their support to Trump last year, all of the people gave Trump high marks for his performance.\n\n\"They want somebody who's a strong leader, who takes command, does what he says, and that's what they feel like they're getting when they see Trump in action,\" Thau said. But, he added, \"they are very concerned about his getting distracted.\"\n\nDan Hylen, 39, an independent who did not vote last November, said he had seen \"some good and some bad\" from Trump so far.\n\n\"Some of the government efficiency stuff I feel like is maybe going in the right direction,\" he said. \"I like the idea of cutting the fat.\"\n\nBut he disliked Musk's \"willy-nilly, shoot-from-the-hip attitude\" and was not in favor of Trump's approach to Ukraine. \"I don't want to be in every single war in the world,\" Hylen said, \"but I think we have to help some people out sometimes.\"\n\nSome voters said Trump's combative showdown with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Friday, in which he angrily rebuked Zelenskyy for not showing sufficient gratitude for the U.S.' support of Ukraine in its war against Russia, was a shameful display.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment,\" said Greg Wise, 53, who votes Democratic. \"Throwing away decades of goodwill with neighbors.\"\n\nOthers saw it as the perfect representation of a foreign policy agenda that prioritizes America's interests.\n\n\"He's showing that we're not messing around,\" said Tasha K., a Republican from Scottsdale who declined to give her last name out of fear that her husband, who is a federal employee, would face retribution. \"He put America first, and that's what we hired him to do.\"\n\nThe 1st Congressional District's ambivalence toward Trump could be seen recently in moments beyond conversations with voters.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic groups organized a protest on a busy street corner in the district, accusing Trump and the district's Republican representative, David Schweikert, who voted for a budget resolution last month that calls for deep cuts to government spending, of neglecting their interests. Protesters held up signs reading \"Fire Musk\" as well as images of a \"missing\" Schweikert on a milk carton. Many passing drivers honked in support, while others rolled down their windows to voice their dissent.\n\nStill, in a purple district where voters of different political stripes frequently brush up against one another, even some of the president's steadfast opponents were willing to look for silver linings.\n\nNina Meixner, 71, said she was a conservative who had backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last year because she disliked Trump's personality. But she was encouraged by his tough stance on immigration and the tariffs he was putting into effect.\n\nMeixner cringed at the chaos that she said was Trump's \"business model.\" But, she added, \"there's things that I am happy for.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"PHOENIX -- Keith Mann, a self-described independent voter, sat out the 2024 election, dismayed by both candidates for president.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/in-one-swing-district-guarded-optimism-after-trumps-first-six-weeks/article_2eddefb7-ffbc-57ea-9677-c39472699416.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 23:13:34","author":"Kellen Browning,North Adams Pride","authors":["Kellen Browning","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.082},{"id":296736878,"title":"With Trump Tariffs, Expect Food Inflation For These Fruits, Vegetables","text":"With tomato imports, 99% come from Mexico and Canada.\nustradenumbers.com\n\nAs you try to digest the 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada that President Trump announced today, as you listen tonight to his first State of the Union Address of his second term, consider this:\n\n99% of the tomatoes the United States imported in 2024 came from Mexico (86%) and Canada (13%) in 2024.\n\n99% of the imported lettuce came from Mexico (588%) and Canada (11%) in 2024.\n\nWith carrots,88% come from Mexico and Canada.\nustradenumbers.com\n\n88% of imported carrots came from Mexico (49%) and Canada (39%) in 2024.\n\n70% of imported avocados came from Mexico in 2014.\n\n67% of imported strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries come from Mexico (63%) and Canada (4%).\n\n60.7% of all imported onions and garlic came from Mexico (52%) and Canada (8.7%) in 2024.\n\n57.8% of all imported green beans and peas come from Mexico (56%) and Canada (1.8%).\n\nI chose to focus on fruit and vegetable imports because inflation, and specifically the cost of food, is widely believed to have been a factor in the 2024 presidential race between President Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

What I discovered was the Mexico or Canada ranked first for 72% of the export categories.\n\nPrior to that, I wrote a column about how much more dangerous a trade war with Mexico and Canada would be compared to the existing one with China, precisely because of our export strength with those our USMCA partners. While U.S. exports to China have grown rapidly in the last decade, the percentage of exports to total trade still lags behind the U.S. average with the world while Mexico and Canada are at or above the average.\n\nIn response to Trump’s 25% tariffs that went into effect today against the nation’s two largest trade partners, Canada has announced it will impose tariffs on the United States in retaliation. Mexico has indicated it will decide by this weekend.\n\nAlso, Trump:\n\nHas imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, key to the automotive and other industries,\n\nHas announced that cargo ships representing Chinese companies or manufactured there would have to pay to enter U.S. seaports,\n\nIs studying “reciprocal” tariffs against the rest of the world’s countries that in the White House’s estimation, do not trade fairly with the United States,\n\nIs considering tariffs on passenger vehicles globally.\n\nMany are estimating the impact the Mexico and Canada tariffs will have.

Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.\n\nBeijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\n“Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump's trade war.\n\nThe president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity.

Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.\n\nBeijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\n“Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump's trade war.\n\nThe president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II.

Tuberville: America Is Back. President's Joint Address Will Celebrate It | Opinion","text":"Tonight, President Donald Trump will give his first joint address to Congress since his triumphant return to the White House. For the past four years, Americans endured a national nightmare under the Biden administration. Democrats opened our borders—allowing criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, and murderers to flood into our country unchecked. They canceled American energy production and forced us to rely on our foreign adversaries for energy. They wrote a blank check to Ukraine—while doing nothing to actually stop the bloodshed. They even went as far as to support men competing in women's sports. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris brought this country to the brink of destruction.The last four years were a dumpster fire—a total disaster. \"Sleepy Joe\" was worn slap out as soon as he got up in the morning. Thinking back on it now, I really don't know how our country survived. It's a miracle that we made it through those dark days. One thing is for sure: President Trump's address will be nothing like the clown show we endured the last four years.But today, America is ready to usher in its golden age under President Donald J. Trump. We're only a month and a half in, and President Trump is well on his way to renewing the American dream by reversing some of the Democrats' most destructive policies. Most importantly, President Trump is keeping his promises to the 77 million Americans who voted for him and his \"America First\" agenda. A recent poll showed 70 percent of Americans believe President Trump is doing what he said he would do.We've already seen a whole lot of winning. Illegal border crossings have plummeted under the Trump administration, reaching their lowest levels in decades. Democrats' \"catch and release\" program has been replaced with detaining and deporting illegal immigrants. Since master-dealmaker President Trump first threatened tariffs, Canada and Mexico have been pulling their weight to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and deadly fentanyl into the U.S. It's about time they pony up and contribute to this so-called \"alliance.\"Two weeks ago, the administration officially designated eight different cartel groups as foreign terrorist organizations. Did Border Czar Kamala Harris recommend any of these policies? I don't think so. She was too busy trying to keep the Left's radical agenda alive. Border security is national security, and President Trump is making the safety of U.S. citizens his top priority.President Trump is also hard at work restoring common-sense policies. For example, his administration announced that schools that still enforce COVID vaccine mandates will no longer receive federal funding. President Trump also signed an executive order defining gender as male and female, along with one banning men from competing in women's sports.President Trump is also taking action to cut wasteful spending and lower prices for hard-working Americans. Thanks to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), taxpayers are already seeing an estimated $100 billion in savings from the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. The administration is also getting rid of burdensome and costly regulations on everyday appliances like gas stoves, along with the ridiculous Biden-era electric vehicle mandates.Thanks to President Trump's master negotiating skills, Hamas has released Israeli hostages. President Trump is actively working to facilitate peace and end the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war. The U.S. is no longer funding the terrorist-sympathizing UNRWA or the corrupt and fraudulent USAID. President Trump also made it clear that our military will be focused on lethality, not woke DEI politics. And the icing on the cake was Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reversing the Pentagon's immoral policy allowing taxpayer dollars to fund abortion-related travel.I was particularly thrilled when President Trump signed an executive order to protect Title IX and keep men out of women's sports. But unfortunately, executive orders can be reversed. My bill, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, finally got a vote last night in the Senate. Every Democrat voted against it. Last week, my wife Suzanne and I welcomed our first granddaughter, Rosie Grace. Now that I'm a grandfather, I'm more motivated than ever to continue fighting to permanently keep men out of women's sports.President Trump is doing something rare in D.C.: delivering on his campaign promises. From cutting wasteful spending with DOGE to renaming the beautiful Gulf of America, President Trump is renewing the American dream. And he's not slowing down. Trump has brought unbelievable energy to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He won't rest until American families, businesses, farmers, and manufacturers are winning again.We have a long way to go if we're going to get our country back on track and truly make America great again. But we're well on our way. I look forward to hearing his address tonight and am committed to helping advance his agenda from the Senate.Tommy Tuberville is the senior United States senator from Alabama, a seat he has held since 2021. Before entering politics, he worked in college football as a coach.

We should continue to do that.\" No, find a new strategy.'\n\nSmith insisted that he is 'no supporter of Trump' and is not a fan of the president's direction since returning to office. \n\nIn particular, Smith 'didn't like what (he) saw' when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House and had a heated exchange with Trump and JD Vance.\n\nThe ESPN star conceded that it is possible that some groups - such as Black and Latino voters - might regret voting for the 78-year-old.\n\n'But in the end, what it comes down to is this: the American people, in their eyes it wasn't about him. They were voting against what the Democrats were throwing in their direction.'\n\nSmith namechecked several big-name Democrats that he likes, including governors Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania) and Wes Moore (Maryland).\n\nBut he warned the left not to kid themselves that Trump hasn't earned a mandate from the American people.\n\nSmith namechecked several Democrats that he likes, including Maryland governor Wes Moore \n\n'Let me be very clear: I'm no supporter of Trump. I'm a supporter of truth and the facts.

That's a mandate. We can sit up there and play around all we want to. \n\n'In 2020, Trump didn't win the popular vote. He didn't win the electoral college vote. As a matter of fact, the Republicans hadn't won the popular vote since 2004.

I don't understand how people can look at that and say: there's no mandate. There's a mandate.'\n\nIn a separate interview on 'The Chris Cuomo Project', Smith singled out Republican congressman (Florida) Byron Donalds as a huge future threat to the left.\n\n'Although I don’t like his flagrant support of Trump, where he shoves aside just anything that Trump has done, when you get into the weeds talking politics with this man about what conservatives offer compared to Democrats, I find it very difficult to imagine a Democrat in front of him being able to beat him on the issues,' Smith said. \n\n'Because I think he knows what he’s talking about and I think he speaks in a way that resonates with an audience. So he has the facts, he has inside knowledge about what takes place, and on top of it all, he has the personality where he’s feisty enough to come back at you and resonate with a viewing audience.

It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.On Monday, Trump ordered a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia — casting doubt on future support from Washington to Kyiv in fending off Russia’s invasion.That followed Friday's disastrous Oval Office meeting, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance tore into Zelenskyy for what they perceived as insufficient gratitude for the more than $180 billion U.S. has appropriated for military aid and other assistance to Kyiv since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine in 2022.Trump, a Republican, has since slammed Zelenskyy for suggesting that the end of the war likely “is still very, very far away.” Ukraine’s leader says it would take time to come to an agreement to end the war as he tried to offer a positive take on its relationship with the U.S. after the White House blowup last week.And Vance has increased the pressure, and sparked uproar in Europe, by suggested that a critical minerals agreement the Trump administration has pushed — but that Zelenskyy left Washington without signing on Friday — “is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.”The vice president was referring to an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France.A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy’s relationship over the years:‘Perfect' phone callIn July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future U.S. military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a “perfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced “no blackmail.”But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.Russia's war in UkraineRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.Since then, the U.S. has provided tens of billions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centerpiece of his foreign policy.As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.“Your money is not charity,” he said then. \"It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.Upon taking office, he upended years of U.S. policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.Trump meets with Zelenskyy ahead of Election Day 2024Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight with Russian ground forces.A few days later, he traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, “It should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.“And I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that’s a good combination,” Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, ”I will.\"That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, “You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\"Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.Trump calls Zelenskyy a dictator, then suggests he didn'tLast December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion.As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organizing an election to decide if he should remain in power — an idea backed by Russia — calling him a “ dictator without elections.”He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.Before last week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times — all during the Biden administration.

Democrats won in 2017, following Trump's first victory, but Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin won in 2021, despite the state's leftward shift over the past few decades.For Republicans, the election will be a gage into whether they are able to hold onto some of the voters they gained in 2024. Meanwhile, it will be a key test for Democrats' messaging as they seek to stage a comeback at state and national levels.The race may also be an early bellwether of the popularity of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the task force led by Elon Musk that is aimed at cutting unnecessary spending. Virginia is home to more than 140,000 federal workers, making it a commonwealth that may be especially affected by the firing of federal workers.What To KnowA new poll from Cygnal showed Spanberger, who previously represented both Richmond suburbs and Northern Virginia in Congress, with a narrow lead over Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican. It surveyed 600 likely voters from February 26 to February 27.Forty-six percent of respondents said they intend to mark their ballot for Spanberger in November, while only 40 percent said they plan to vote for Earle-Sears.\"In a state Harris won by 6, Spanberger currently leads by the same margin, showing a competitive race under a Trump presidency,\" Cygnal wrote in a poll write-up.One week earlier, a poll from the Roanoke College Institute for Policy and Opinion Research similarly showed Spanberger with a lead, though it notably showed nearly one-third of voters were still unsure about how they'd vote.It found that 39 percent of voters favor Spanberger, while 24 percent favor Earle-Sears. Thirty-two percent were undecided and four percent said they planned to vote for another candidate.Earlier independent polling has also showed Spanberger with an early advantage.A Virginia Commonwealth University poll, conducted among 806 adults from December 18, 2024 to January 15, 2025, showed Spanberger up 10 points, winning 44 percent support compared to Earle-Sears' 34 percent.Notably, no polls have shown either candidate with a majority so far.Virginia, once a reliably Republican state, shifted toward Democrats throughout the past few decades, but it still remains competitive. Vice President Kamala Harris only carried the state by about 5.7 points in 2024, and Governor Youngkin won the governorship by nearly two points in 2021.Newsweek reached out to the Spanberger and Earle-Sears campaigns for comment via email.What People Are SayingHarry Wilson, interim director at Roanoke University's Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, in a press release: \"Even with one-third undecided, a candidate would prefer to be in Abigail Spanberger's position with a 15-point lead over Winsome Earle-Sears. But there is an eternity of political time and much work to do before this election takes center stage.\"Veteran political scientist Larry Sabato previously told Newsweek: \"The early bet is on Spanberger but it's way too early to bet unless you have money to burn—or extra eggs to give away. Too many things can happen. If Trump is very unpopular as he was in 2017, it's bound to help Spanberger as it helped [Former Governor Ralph] Northam in 2017. Just like Youngkin was assisted by Biden's unpopularity in 2021.\"What Happens NextSpanberger and Earle-Sears are both viewed as favorites to win their party's nominations. Virginia voters will pick their next governor on November 4, 2025.","summary":"Spanberger, a Democrat and former U.S. House Representative, scored a new polling victory on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-odds-becoming-virginia-governor-8-months-election-2039505","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2600199/virginia-governor-candidate-abigail-spanberger.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 20:34:51","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":296701822,"title":"United Auto Workers union praises Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico","text":"The United Auto Workers (UAW) union praised President Trump’s new tariffs on Tuesday, claiming it’s necessary for America to “end the free trade disaster.”\n\nThe union, with more than 1 million members, touted Trump’s decision to place a new round of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, where America imports tens of billions of dollars worth of cars and parts every year.\n\n“Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals,” the union said in a statement.\n\n“We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.”\n\nAlthough the union has historically supported Democrats, endorsing Kamala Harris in 2024, the UAW has said it’s eager to start negotiating with the Trump administration to discuss the auto tariffs and how it’ll benefit their members. \n\nThe UAW, which has come to embrace Trump’s America-first policy, is hoping the tariffs prompt American automakers to bring jobs and factories back to the US. \n\nAmerican automakers have kept the cost of business down by investing in production plants north and south of the border, savings that would effectively be undone by the new tariffs. \n\nThe US imported $87 billion worth of cars and another $64 billion in parts from Mexico last year, according to the US Commerce Department. \n\nAmerica also imported nearly $57 million in cars and parts from Canada, according to the Census Bureau. \n\nTrump’s tariffs are expected to see the cost of vehicles rise, along with a plethora of goods across the US. \n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, previously warned last month that the new tariffs could undo all the savings automakers have enjoyed thus far, leaving the sector fuming as there’s little recourse other than to raise prices at the consumer’s expense. \n\nThe UAW said that despite the looming price increases, it will be companies that raise the costs that are ultimately to blame, not Trump. \n\n“There’s been a lot of talk of these tariffs ‘disrupting’ the economy. But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don’t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision,” the UAW said. \n\nEconomists have repeatedly predicted that the American auto industry could be among the biggest victims of the trade wars, with Kelley Blue Book estimating that the price of the average new car could spike by $3,000 more. \n\nThe vehicle valuation and automotive research company also estimated that the price of some full-size pickup trucks could shoot up by $10,000. \n\nWith Post wires","summary":"The union, with more than 1 million members, touted Trump’s decision to place a new round of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/us-news/united-auto-workers-union-praises-trumps-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/COMP-2202607808.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pJRFVOUI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-04 20:07:37","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":296713212,"title":"Stephen A.

It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, 'Hey, you should be a party for the working class,' which the Democrats was once known for. They’re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That’s why they lost. He didn’t win. The Democrats lost,\" he told the co-hosts of \"The View.\" Smith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won. Co-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, \"Making sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right.

I’m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,\" he said. Goldberg shot back, \"Oh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.\" Smith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump. \"The bottom line, you’re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn’t do, he didn’t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do?

Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.\n\nBeijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\n“Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump's trade war.\n\nThe president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient.\n\nImport taxes are “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,” Trump said Monday. “And now we’re using them.”\n\nDartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday’s hikes will lift America’s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. “We’re in a new era for sure.\"\n\nU.S. markets dropped sharply Monday after Trump said there was “no room left” for negotiations that could lower the tariffs. Shares were mostly lower Tuesday after they took effect.\n\nThe Yale University Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs amount to a tax hike of $1.4 trillion to $1.5 trillion over 10 years and would disproportionately hit the poor.\n\nTrump has said tariffs are intended to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration. But he's also said the tariffs will come down only if the U.S. trade deficit narrows.\n\nThe American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations — into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm.\n\nBut by declaring a national emergency last month involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, “he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,’’ House said. “It’s chaotic.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs.\n\n“Donald Trump is not a king,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. \"Presidents don’t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies. Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn’t leadership — it’s dangerous.”\n\nEven some Republican senators raised alarms. \"Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S.\n\nTruck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he’s done for decades.\n\nLike many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. “Things could change drastically,” Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S.\n\nAlan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump’s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n\"Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,” Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn’t find enough workers in the United States.\n\nU.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada.\n\nSales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. “They’re putting that 25% on studs.'' Builders will strain to stay within their budgets.\n\nRetaliation will likely pinch U.S. businesses.\n\nAfter years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada's crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold.\n\n“That hurts,” he said. At his small distillery \"every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.”\n\nBard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky's Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTrump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin.\n\nThe China tariffs threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling,” as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.\n\nSteve Rad, CEO of the Austin, Texas-based toy maker Abacus Brands Inc., hopes to find ways to avoid raising prices in the wake of the 20% tax on Chinese goods.\n\nThe company will have to “go to war” with its pricing and cost structure and figure out how to avoid penalizing consumers. For one product, a $39.99 kit that teaches children how volcanoes work, he’s thinking of switching to cheaper, lower-quality paper.\n\nRachel Lutz owns the Peacock Room, four women’s boutique shops with about 15 employees in Detroit. She’s been bracing for the tariffs but doesn’t understand the logic behind them.\n\n“I’m struggling to see the wisdom in picking a fight with our largest trading partner that we’ve had historically wonderful relationships with,” Lutz said Tuesday from her shop. “I’m struggling to really understand how they can’t see that will profoundly impact our economy in ways that I think the American consumer has not predicted. We’re about to find out.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump launched a trade war Tuesday against America&amp;rsquo;s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin as the U.S. faced the threat of rekindled inflation and paralyzing uncertainty for bus...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/536567/Trump-s-trade-war-draws-swift-retaliation-as-Mexico-Canada-and-China-impose-tariffs-on-the-US","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/3/79184a97d841196b4f74fc3f7092ac0a3229ae4ed96f474bfa24d9f393f15854_p4154802.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 19:35:00","author":"Josh Boak,The Canadian Press","authors":["Josh Boak","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":296689306,"title":"Trump Is Working to ‘Drain’ the D.C. Prosecutor’s Office and Make It MAGA","text":"In mid-February, Donald Trump’s interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, emailed his staff to tell them he was “impressed by the great work in the office and with our awesome team,” before sharing some “great news”: He has been authorized to hire 20 new assistant U.S. attorneys.\n\n “We are on it and hard — to get job postings up so that we can fill those positions asap!” he wrote in an email reviewed by Rolling Stone. He added that — amid Trump and Elon Musk’s hiring freeze and mass ongoing purge — the office would likely be approved to hire more support staff, too.\n\n Despite being supposedly “impressed” by his “awesome team,” Martin soon demoted seven top prosecutors in his office to low-level jobs. Some had been involved with cases related to the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n Sources who know Martin say he is aware that his office is full of staff who really do not like him and leak on him regularly. As The New York Times has reported, members of his staff refer to Martin as “keyboard warrior” for his many email missives. \n\n Ever since Trump returned to power in late January, the twice-impeached president and his lieutenants have gone into overdrive to purge the federal government — including the Justice Department and FBI — of suspected anti-Trump subversives and stack the so-called “Deep State” with MAGA loyalists and enforcers who don’t flinch at Trump’s increasingly autocratic demands. Trump, according to sources who’ve spoken to him about the Department of Justice in recent weeks, views Martin as a vital cog in that machine.\n\n Martin — whom Trump nominated last month to remain in the role permanently — has made his loyalties and priorities clear. As an attorney who not only promoted Trump’s anti-democratic lies about the 2020 election but also defended Jan. 6 rioters, Martin is at the forefront of the second Trump administration’s efforts to rewrite the history of the Capitol attack. He is also one of Team Trump’s primary blunt instruments in their openly corrupt mission to wield the powers of the state to bully and investigate their political enemies for completely bogus, frivolous reasons. \n\n Since taking control of the office, Martin has publicly cozied up to Elon Musk, who’s leading Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In emails reviewed by Rolling Stone, Martin has pledged to “protect DOGE” and described his team of prosecutors as “President Trumps’ lawyers.”\n\n He has also publicly threatened to investigate Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) over a speech he gave in 2020, as the Supreme Court was considering an abortion rights case. Schumer warned conservative justices that they had “released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Martin has chosen to interpret those words as “threats” in need of investigation.\n\n He’s done the same with Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), who had said that voters want Democrats “to bring actual weapons to this bar fight” and more forcefully respond to the efforts by Musk and DOGE to purge the federal workforce and block funds to government projects that he and Trump don’t like. Martin claimed in a letter to Garcia that these words could be interpreted as a “threat to Mr. Musk,” and also complained that Garcia had called Musk “a dick.” \n\n According to The New York Times, Martin has sought to present evidence against Schumer to a grand jury regarding his comments, but has been rebuffed to this point by the Justice Department. \n\n Martin has notably failed to express concern about Musk repeatedly “joking” during the 2024 campaign about someone assassinating then-Vice President Kamala Harris or President Joe Biden. Martin’s office also conspicuously refused to sign off on an arrest warrant for Florida Rep. Cory Mills, a staunch Trump ally, after the U.S. congressman was accused of assaulting a 27-year-old woman.\n\n Martin does not want to target Trump’s enemies and critics alone. For weeks, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, Martin’s allies have sifted through resumes and shortlists of sufficiently MAGAfied candidates and attorneys to fill the roles that Martin announced in his office email, and to fill the positions that will inevitably be vacated through firing or resignation. Several of the names on these lists the source mentioned are mainstays in the right-wing legal universe, and have made Trump-adulating appearances on conservative media, including Fox News and Fox Business.\n\n Two sources familiar with the matter say that some staff and lawyers in Martin’s office — ones who aren’t enthralled by the Trump personality cult, as well as some who were demoted — are already beginning to flee or are strongly considering doing so soon, as they do not think they can have any meaningfully moderating influence and do not want to be part of a Trumpist project of vengeance and intimidation. Some staff believe they’re likely to be purged anyway.\n\n One of the two sources describes Martin’s office as in the process of suffering a “drain” of personnel who aren’t on the Trump train.\n\n “The thought process is, ‘Why should I stick around to pervert the system to punish a Democratic elected [official] who says something mean about Elon or Trump?’” the source says.","summary":"Ed Martin, Trump’s interim U.S. Attorney in Washington, is viewed in the White House as a vital cog in their purge of the Justice Department","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-ed-martin-dc-prosecutor-drain-maga-1235288173/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ed-martin-donald-trump-dc-prosecutor-office.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 19:10:06","author":"Andrew Perez,Asawin Suebsaeng","authors":["Andrew Perez","Asawin Suebsaeng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":296686470,"title":"Andy Cohen calls out ex-“The View” star Meghan McCain for 'previous ally-ship' to LGBTQ community amid anti-trans post","text":"Controversial conservative pundit and former The View cohost Meghan McCain's recent resharing of a social media post that some have deemed to be anti-trans has drawn the ire of Bravo personality and Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen.\n\n On Monday morning, McCain, 40, commented on an X post that outlined an alleged \"traumatic brain injury after a transgender-identifying man spiked a volleyball into\" the head of a 19-year-old, amid President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order banning trans women from women's sports.\n\n \"Democrats defending young women suffering from traumatic brain injuries as a result of trans athletes is why they will continue losing every election,\" McCain shared on the social media site, to which Cohen replied, \"Surprised you’re buying into the vilification of the trans community given the real problems happening in this country, your previous ally-ship of the lgbtq community, and the fact that this non issue affects about four people in this country.\"\n\n In response, McCain said: \"Surprised you’re okay with violence against female athletes,\" and claimed that the player's account was \"just one story\" among many. \"You have my cell, always happy to talk privately or publicly on either of our shows because these conversations are reductive to hash out on social media,\" she finished.\n\n When reached for comment, a representative for McCain declined Entertainment Weekly's request for comment, but noted that McCain would elaborate on her thoughts via her personal and professional channels.\n\n McCain has been a guest on Cohen's WWHL talk show several times in the past, where she's spoken about everything from The View's COVID scare involving Kamala Harris to Republican-leaning discourse on Bravo programming.\n\n McCain has previously stated that she's an LGBTQ+ community supporter, though Trump's policies regarding trans people and the queer community have been labeled as harmful.\n\n According to the Human Rights Campaign, \"Sports bans are part of a cruel effort by anti-LGBTQ+ hate groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom to further stigmatize and discriminate against LGBTQ+ people across the country,\" the organization's website observes. \"In fact, legislators have repeatedly been unable to justify the need for these laws, and admit that very few transgender youth even play sports.\"\n\n In a recent interview, RuPaul's Drag Race star Hormona Lisa told EW she feels that Republicans \"don't see us as human,\" with regard to an uptick in anti-trans legislation sweeping the country over the last few years.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n \"Something I’ve always tried to do is validate and love myself where I don’t need it externally, and that’s something we’re going to have to all focus on developing, especially over these next four years.

This is Piker's fifth Twitch suspension. On Monday afternoon, Piker apologized, telling his social media followers, \"I'm sorry!\" \"I'll choose my words carefully next time and say, 'if Mike Johnson cares abt [sic] medicare fraud (since he wants to cut 800m from Medicaid/Medicare) he'd call for MAX PUNISHMENT for current fl gop senator/former gov Rick Scott- who has done the most Medicare fraud in us history!'\" he continued.

They were also on edge that the former NBCUniversal CEO felt that the Tiffany Network should simply appease Trump, as they argued that there was no foul play on the Harris interview.\n\nTrump ultimately sued CBS to release the transcripts, recently raising his damages claims to $20 billion, and he clinched the presidency shortly after. Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, who will decide if the merger can go through, also pressured the network to release the transcript, which it did in February.\n\nSince then, Shell and current Paramount boss Shari Redstone have pressured the network to settle the lawsuit with Trump — even though “60 Minutes'” did not reveal any doctoring, just a cleaning up of Harris’ jumbled responses — sources told The Post.\n\nThe case is currently before a mediator, who is facilitating discussions between both sides about a possible settlement.\n\nBoth Shell and Redstone want the deal to go through but Owens and McMahon believe they have done nothing wrong and that caving to Trump would damage the journalistic integrity of “60 Minutes.” What’s more, Owens has expressed clearly that he would not apologize as part of any settlement. \n\nSome insiders wondered if the “60 Minutes” executive producer could be on the chopping block, but others brushed off that notion.\n\nMeanwhile, McMahon, too has expressed resistance behind the scenes, even as sources told The Post that her job may be on the line due to several missteps, once the deal is greenlit.\n\nStaffers at the network have balked at the notion of settling with Trump and have voiced their concerns even as Carr has opened a probe into the Harris edit and opened it up for public comment.\n\nThe pushback from McMahon and Owens contrasts to how many other media and tech leaders in recent months.

But more than a month into Trump's second term, Mann, a 41-year-old Phoenix resident, said he was cautiously optimistic about what he had seen so far.\n\n\"He's doing what he said he would do,\" Mann said. He was encouraged by reports of fewer migrants crossing the border, in favor of reducing aid to Ukraine and hopeful that Elon Musk would root out excessive government spending and, \"like Robin Hood,\" deliver the savings to citizens in the form of $5,000 dividend checks.\n\n\"I'm just waiting to see how it pans out,\" Mann said. \"At the end of the day, he's our president; you can't just wish him bad.\"\n\nAs Trump prepares to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening -- a stand-in for the State of the Union during a president's first year in office -- voters in battleground districts around the country are trying to make sense of the frenzy of executive orders and other actions that have so far defined Trump's second term.\n\nIn Arizona's 1st Congressional District, around the swingy suburbs of Phoenix and Scottsdale -- areas that helped flip Arizona blue in 2020 before shifting rightward again last year -- reactions to Trump ranged from elation among Republicans to disgust among Democrats, with a few wary independents wedged in between.\n\nThe partisan rancor in this competitive district remains high, but in conversations with several dozen voters across the political spectrum, many seemed willing to give Trump the runway he needs to execute his \"America first\" vision of the country.\n\n\"I feel great,\" said Rashad Davis, 33, a Republican who was particularly enthused about the import tariffs Trump has announced. \"He's sticking to his word -- everything he said.\"\n\nMany voters singled out the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Musk's cost-cutting effort, as a major driver of their open-mindedness toward the Trump administration -- at least, to a point.\n\nMaureen Wielgus, 69, said that she had voted for Trump in each of the last two elections and that she was pleased with his performance so far, though she added that he needed \"to soften his approach a bit sometimes.\"\n\nWielgus had similarly qualified praise for Musk's initiative, which has fired thousands of workers and boasted of tremendous government savings, often only to backtrack and delete its mistakes.\n\n\"They're going in like a bulldozer, a little firm,\" she said. \"But they're finding the corruption and the fraud.\"\n\nAround the state, Arizonans seemed to be split on Trump. Recent polling there has found that roughly half of the state's residents at least somewhat approve of his handling of the job. Rich Thau, the president of the nonpartisan research firm Engagious, said that in a recent focus group of a dozen Arizona residents who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 before switching their support to Trump last year, all of the people gave Trump high marks for his performance.\n\n\"They want somebody who's a strong leader, who takes command, does what he says, and that's what they feel like they're getting when they see Trump in action,\" Thau said. But, he added, \"they are very concerned about his getting distracted.\"\n\nDan Hylen, 39, an independent who did not vote last November, said he had seen \"some good and some bad\" from Trump so far.\n\n\"Some of the government efficiency stuff I feel like is maybe going in the right direction,\" he said. \"I like the idea of cutting the fat.\"\n\nBut he disliked Musk's \"willy-nilly, shoot-from-the-hip attitude\" and was not in favor of Trump's approach to Ukraine. \"I don't want to be in every single war in the world,\" Hylen said, \"but I think we have to help some people out sometimes.\"\n\nSome voters said Trump's combative showdown with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Friday, in which he angrily rebuked Zelenskyy for not showing sufficient gratitude for the U.S.' support of Ukraine in its war against Russia, was a shameful display.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment,\" said Greg Wise, 53, who votes Democratic. \"Throwing away decades of goodwill with neighbors.\"\n\nOthers saw it as the perfect representation of a foreign policy agenda that prioritizes America's interests.\n\n\"He's showing that we're not messing around,\" said Tasha K., a Republican from Scottsdale who declined to give her last name out of fear that her husband, who is a federal employee, would face retribution. \"He put America first, and that's what we hired him to do.\"\n\nThe 1st Congressional District's ambivalence toward Trump could be seen recently in moments beyond conversations with voters.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic groups organized a protest on a busy street corner in the district, accusing Trump and the district's Republican representative, David Schweikert, who voted for a budget resolution last month that calls for deep cuts to government spending, of neglecting their interests. Protesters held up signs reading \"Fire Musk\" as well as images of a \"missing\" Schweikert on a milk carton. Many passing drivers honked in support, while others rolled down their windows to voice their dissent.\n\nStill, in a purple district where voters of different political stripes frequently brush up against one another, even some of the president's steadfast opponents were willing to look for silver linings.\n\nNina Meixner, 71, said she was a conservative who had backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last year because she disliked Trump's personality. But she was encouraged by his tough stance on immigration and the tariffs he was putting into effect.\n\nMeixner cringed at the chaos that she said was Trump's \"business model.\" But, she added, \"there's things that I am happy for.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"PHOENIX -- Keith Mann, a self-described independent voter, sat out the 2024 election, dismayed by both candidates for president.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/in-one-swing-district-guarded-optimism-after-trumps-first-six-weeks/article_ed6c1d1d-1b76-5a2a-96e1-3a094e05c71d.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 18:12:28","author":"Kellen Browning,North Adams Pride","authors":["Kellen Browning","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.082},{"id":296687554,"title":"Donald Trump Will Lunch With TV Anchors Ahead of Joint Session Speech","text":"Last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the administration would take over the White House Correspondents Association’s traditional role in determining which organizations participate in the daily press pool, for which a small group of reporters cover the president’s words and actions for participating outlets.

The meeting is one presidential custom Trump has taken on in stride, hosting reporters off the record throughout his first term. However, the gatherings were certainly not without controversy, including the president railing against former Meet the Press anchor Chuck Todd ahead of the 2018 State of the Union Address, complaining of the meeting’s content leaking in 2019, and even excluding CNN from the lunch in 2020.\nIn response to the Trump administration’s recent press restrictions, Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, wrote in a statement that the action “tears at the independence of a free press in the United States,” adding that the body would “not assist any attempt by this administration or any other in taking over independent press coverage of the White House.”\nNot only has the White House already taken over the WHCA’s regular duties, but the Pentagon has also instituted a new media rotation program. In lieu of outlets like CNN, NBC News, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, which are traditionally located in the Department of Defense headquarters, the Pentagon has replaced them with more politically aligned organizations, including One America News Network, Breitbart, and the New York Post.\nTrump has also waged legal battles against news networks including ABC News, which recently settled a defamation lawsuit for $15 million, and CBS News over its handling of a 60 Minutes interview with then vice president Kamala Harris. CBS parent company Paramount and Trump have reportedly held settlement talks.\nEven amid tensions with the news media, National Journal found that Trump took more than 1,000 questions during his first month in office, far more than his predecessor, Joe Biden.","summary":"Despite his ongoing war on the White House press corps, the president will participate in the traditional sitdown with journalists ahead of his first major address.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-lunch-tv-anchors-ahead-of-joint-session-speech","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67c72c61878fb6b8c8295f7e/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf325-white-house-press.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 17:56:23","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.167},{"id":296686468,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg cuts off “The View ”cohost“ ”Alyssa Farah Griffin's tense moment with ex-White House press secretary","text":"The View's presidential incumbent and commander of The Whoopi Goldberg War Room™ had to step in and moderate a diplomatic affair on Tuesday's episode of the talk show.\n\n The series welcomed history-making former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to the Hot Topics table for a wide-ranging discussion about President Donald Trump and a look back on the tumultuous end to Joe Biden's presidency that saw him bow out of the race over calls from fellow Democrats like George Clooney (and from View panelists) to do so.\n\n Toward the middle of the chat, Republican cohost (and ex-Trump communications staffer) Alyssa Farah Griffin asked Jean-Pierre about the \"onslaught\" her team faced after Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in 2024 — particularly after Jean-Pierre having \"described it as a firing squad\" in a recent interview. \"Do you believe that Joe Biden would've won if he'd stayed in, and a follow -p to that, do you think Kamala Harris would've had a better shot [at defeating Trump] had she had more time?\" Griffin asked.\n\n \"I was asked a question, I answered it honestly and how I felt at the moment.

An outside ethics lawyer will monitor the company's activities and his investments will likewise be handled by an outside firm.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe Trump Organization also says it will not enter into new material transactions with foreign governments and says it will donate all profits from foreign government patronage to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThat largely mirrors the arrangement he had during his first term from 2017-2021, which ethics experts said did not do enough to prevent conflicts between his official duties and his business empire.\n\nDuring his first term, foreign dignitaries, business executives and Republican allies spent freely at the Trump International Hotel, situated in a historic federal building blocks from the White House.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nHere are some of the ways that Trump, a businessman whose first publicly elected office was the presidency, could profit from his status as president in his second term:\n\nCRYPTOCURRENCY\n\nTrump launched two cryptocurrency tokens called $TRUMP and $MELANIA shortly before taking office in January, attracting billions of speculative dollars and sparking new ethics concerns. Watchdog groups say the tokens provide a way for foreign buyers to curry favor, as Trump-affiliated companies owned 80% of all stock and stand to benefit when the price rises.

He has proposed a government-owned \"strategic reserve\" of cryptocurrencies.\n\nREAL ESTATE\n\nTrump no longer owns a showcase property in Washington, as his company sold the lease on the Trump International Hotel in 2022 and it is now a Waldorf Astoria. The Wall Street Journal reported that his family is in talks to possibly reacquire the lease on the 263-room hotel.\n\nTrump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida has become a popular spot for Republican Party fundraisers and other conservative events, which put money in his pockets. The property stood to generate $24 million in cash last year, according to a Reuters analysis. His golf courses have posted healthy returns, thanks in part to patronage from political supporters.\n\nTrump has billed the U.S. Secret Service for lodging and other services while protecting him at his hotels and golf courses, though he has promised to offer a discount.\n\nOn the international front, Trump's real-estate company said last year it would develop Trump-branded towers in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. In 2022 the Trump Organization announced a deal to build a resort in Oman.\n\nTrump has proposed that the U.S. should clear the war-torn Gaza Strip and develop it as an international beach resort, echoing an idea floated by his son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nKushner, who served as a White House adviser during Trump's first term, now runs a private-equity firm fueled by investments from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nTrump's Truth Social platform is a Nasdaq-listed company (DJT.O), opens new tab that is held widely by retail investors, some of whom say they bought it as a gesture of support. The stock price has swung wildly along with his political fortunes and dropped 30% during his first month in office. Trump himself owns more than half of all shares.\n\nTrump has given a high-profile administration role to tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has overseen an effort to radically shrink and reshape the federal workforce, including agencies that regulate his companies Tesla(TSLA.O), opens new tab, SpaceX and Neuralink.\n\nMusk regularly praises Trump on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022. The Wall Street Journal reported that X paid $10 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit he filed after he was suspended from the service in 2021.\n\nMeta likewise paid $25 million shortly after Trump's inauguration to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump after it suspended his Facebook and Instagram accounts following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Meta has scrapped fact-checking efforts that have been criticized as biased by conservatives.\n\nTRADITIONAL MEDIA\n\nTrump sued CBS News for $20 billion during the presidential campaign, alleging that it had treated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris favorably. The Federal Communications Commission, headed by a Trump appointee, is also investigating.\n\nCBS could face pressure to settle the lawsuit as its parent company Paramount (PARA.O), opens new tab seeks FCC approval for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.\n\nThe FCC is also investigating ABC News for its moderation of a debate between Harris and Trump, and NBC News for letting Harris appear on a \"Saturday Night Live\" program just before the November 2024 election.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab is paying $40 million for a documentary about first lady Melania Trump, according to Puck News, though it is not clear how much she will get paid.

Minority Leader Rob Ortt, R-North Tonawanda, led a press conference in the state capitol where he and other GOP lawmakers called on their Democratic colleagues to “provide relief for hardworking New Yorkers” by passing a pair of proposed tax-reduction bills.\n\nThe bills, if approved by the state legislature and signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul, eliminate state income taxes on cash tips which are considered wages or compensation and eliminate state income taxes on overtime pay. The measures are part of the so-called “Liberate New York” agenda touted by Ortt and other senate Republicans.\n\nThe proposals follow Trump’s pledge during last year’s presidential race to cut taxes on tips to help restaurant workers and others who receive tipped wages.\n\nThe Republicans did not discuss any potential state budget ramifications, if any, should the bills be approved. Ortt said the proposed bills would impact about 1 million workers in New York and would result in about $1.25 billion being “put back into their pockets.”\n\n“This is a way for us to lead,” Ortt said. “I know they are talking about this at the federal level. Why should we wait? Why not lead by example?”\n\nState Sen. Sean Ryan, D-Buffalo, suggested GOP leaders should be as concerned about the potential economic impact on the state should Trump follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on Canadian goods on Tuesday.\n\n“I’m glad to see our friends on the other side of the aisle put forward their own ideas, but they can start by demanding that President Trump end his economic war with Canada and actually focus on lowering costs for Americans, as he promised he would do throughout the campaign last year,” Ryan said. “He has already broken his pledge to lower prices on day one, and seems more focused on starting fights with our allies rather than addressing the impact of inflation.”\n\nOrtt said there’s Democrats should oppose eliminating state taxes on tips and overtime, arguing that both GOP-supported bills warrant bipartisan support. He noted that, while on the campaign trail, Trump’s Democratic opponent Kamala Harris endorsed the idea of eliminating taxes on tips.\n\n“I know she didn’t agree with everything with President Trump, but she did agree on this because it was the right thing to do,” Ortt said.\n\nState Senators Jack Martins, R-Mineola, and Steven Rhoads, R-Wantagh, introduced the bills, which Martin said would provide “real relief” to New Yorkers who have faced a 25% increase in the cost of living over the past four years.\n\n“Time and again we forget those people who are most vulnerable and if you look at it, people who are earning tip wages are in that category,” he said.\n\n“Middle-class families need relief, not more government bloat,’ Rhoads said. “If the Senate Majority is actually serious about making New York affordable — not just growing the budget — they’ll put these bills in the budget. It’s time to cut the nonsense, cut the taxes, and let New Yorkers catch a break.”\n\n© 2025 the Niagara Gazette (Niagara Falls, N.Y.).

He was the oldest during his first term. His record was then broken by Joe Biden. However, the title of the oldest man in the white house is back to Donald Trump.\n\nAnd apparently, his old age is catching up to him, just like his first term.\n\nDuring Donald Trump’s first term, there were rumors of the President being cognitively unwell. Which Trump tried to deny time and time again. He even talked extensively about the cognitive test administered by the white house medical staff.\n\nThis time around, Trump’s body and mind show signs of age. His speech has been slurred, there have been doubts about his hearing capacity, and just last week, there was bruising on his hand.\n\nTrump health fears explode after dark mark seen on US President’s hand https://t.co/CpRMq9tpOK I’ve seen bruises like that after an IV treatment.\n— Independent voice (@Kcamp1776) February 26, 2025\n\nThe Internet was quick to diagnose the bruises, as the one from the IV was. Trump’s team tried a lot to cover them with makeup, yet they were visible. Trolls also joked about the bruises that were caused by Macron’s removal of Trump’s hand rather strongly.\n\nThis week, American people are wondering if the President of the United States is able to walk.\n\nDonald Trump recently had his Mar-a-Lago resort. He was seen playing golf. After getting off a golf cart, the President’s right leg looks to be trailing slightly behind his left. It was all caught on a video of him playing golf.\n\n🚨 WATCH: After months of footage showing 80 year old Trump dragging his right leg, new video from yesterday’s golf outing shows him struggling to step out of a cart—his legs looking far from stable.\nWhat’s going on here? pic.twitter.com/EENBARsPHO\n— Chris D. Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) March 2, 2025\n\nEveryone who witnessed the video showed concern for the President’s health. People were left wondering if there were any other underlying health issues.\n\nDonald Trump is not the only older President in the white house. During Joe Biden‘s term, Fox News always made fun of Biden being old. His voice, manner of talking, and slowed walk were shown again and again on the news.\n\nMany speculated that Biden’s bruise, which also seemed to be covered up by cosmetics, was the result of alleged IV treatments.\n\nTrump however has declared himself to be absolutely fit. He has done that in the past too. To showcase how physically fit he is, he has often compared himself with Former President Barack Obama.

Harris suffers from seasonal allergies, which Trump presented as “dangerous conditions” to all his followers.\n\nPaul Quirk is a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia in Canada.

He also added that Trump has more obvious cognitive impairment, which is evident in his slurred speech and egregious, repetitive mistakes at each campaign rally.\n\nHowever, now that Trump is in office, and his failing health is a national concern, maybe the administration should prepare the Vice president JD Vance for future emergencies.","summary":"What is wrong with Donald Trump’s Leg?","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trumps-limping-leg-caught-on-camera-what-is-the-white-house-hiding-about-his-health","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Donald-Trump-cant-walk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 14:41:33","author":"Divya Verma","authors":["Divya Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":296708722,"title":"Melania Trump Has Found Love in Menswear—Here’s Why It’s Not A Random Switch","text":"Ever since her husband’s second term began, Melania Trump has been spotted in men’s clothing during her public appearances.

But Trump’s doing them all wrong","text":"In the run-up to the 2024 election, a lot of people were ringing alarms about Donald Trump’s tariffs. Kamala Harris called Trump’s policies a “tax on the American people” and warned of sky-high prices. According to the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, they are “very bad for America and for the world”. His fellow Nobel laureate Paul Krugman called them “small, ugly, and stupid”. More recently, the whirlwind tariff drama of the past two months – first a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, then a 30-day “pause” on that policy, a plan to raise tariffs on steel, aluminum and agricultural goods, plus an across the board tariff hike on China – has generated yet more frenzied debate about the danger of tariffs.\n\nObservers aren’t wrong to criticize the US president’s policies. His proposed tariffs seem unlikely to improve what ails the US economy. Worse, applying tariffs as broadly as he’s proposed, and without any supplementary industrial strategy, does risk needlessly raising prices while acting like a big corporate giveaway. Yet, despite what elite economists say, tariffs can be sound, and progressive, economic policy.\n\nIn fact, liberals might be surprised to learn that during his administration Joe Biden actually raised the highest tariffs in recent American history: a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. Why? Because tariffs work.\n\nTariffs are, simply put, taxes on certain imported goods, paid by the importer. The goal is to make foreign products more expensive than their Made-In-USA counterparts. This is why people refer to tariffs as “walls” that help “protect” domestic industry from global competition. Right now, China quickly and efficiently produces fleets of electric vehicles that are – thanks to the low cost of Chinese labor – a lot cheaper than the EVs made in the United States. Without tariffs, it would be impossible for US-made models to compete. Since making electric cars was a big goal for Biden, his administration raised an eye-watering tariff that would double the price of any Chinese-made import.\n\nThe EV example is useful because it demonstrates the difference between Biden’s tariff policies and Trump’s.\n\nTrump has, for the most part, not focused on raising tariffs on particular imported goods but instead on all goods coming from certain countries. Mexico and Canada face across-the-board tariffs; China was already facing 10% tariffs, doubling to 20%. But raising the prices of all products from these countries doesn’t help develop any particular line of US manufacturing. Tariffs like these are both too broad and too small to make a positive impact. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods might make it more expensive for Americans to continue to buy certain things from China. But nothing in that policy encourages Americans to buy American-made products; they might just as well find a Vietnamese supplier to avoid the tariff while continuing to reap the benefits of cheap labor. Moreover, it’s possible that some Chinese manufacturers will simply eat the additional costs and sell their goods at slightly slimmer profit margins. Or, equally likely, they will try to avoid the tariffs by having other companies assemble their products in neighboring countries before sending them to the US. As is, Trump’s country-based tariffs seem more like a geopolitical tool than an economic one. Frankly, they don’t make much sense if the goal is to bring factories home.\n\nTrump’s steel and aluminum tariffs are closer to the mark. By making all steel imports (regardless of national origin) subject to the same tariff, the policy could succeed in making US steel comparatively cheaper for domestic buyers.\n\nYet even this wouldn’t make US steel bigger or better, or make its production more efficient. Nor would it necessarily raise the wages of steel workers. Pure and simple protectionism will benefit existing US steel manufacturers, but no one much beyond that. Without the government stepping in to develop new manufacturing – encouraging the adoption of the latest techniques to make a superior product, actively building new demand for American steel, or providing social guarantees for steel workers – tariffs alone risk protecting a sick industry without much upside.\n\nSo what would a labor-forward tariff program look like? It would combine tariffs with big investments in infrastructure to help steer industry, and the country, into better economic health.\n\nFor steel, such a fix isn’t hard to imagine. The US benefits from being a continental-sized country, with hundreds of thousands of bridges, school buildings, libraries, miles of rail and highway. All of those things are made with steel. And all of them are falling apart. Major new investments in infrastructure upgrades would provide the tariff-protected steel industry the new demand needed to grow, and provide the requisite scale for industrial dynamism.\n\nIn exchange, steel firms should be required to provide family-sustaining wages and benefits, and promise to stay neutral in union elections. Not only this, but the government should have some say in actually directing the production process. New steel plants should be built in places that need jobs, not isolated tax-free industrial parks, but in the very same areas that were obliterated by deindustrialization. That is, production should be directed, first and foremost, toward public use and social ends.\n\nSome might wonder: why bother with such an expensive experiment?\n\nManufacturing is still a huge part of the US economy and it is among the only sectors that consistently provides high wages for a large base of workers. Protecting that industrial foundation is essential not only for those workers, but for the health of other sectors too. When a factory closes, it’s not just the high-wage blue-collar workers who are thrown out of jobs. So are all the middle-income truck drivers who deliver the goods. And all the high-skilled mechanics who fix the machines. Not to mention the servers and cooks who staff now empty local restaurants. The only businesses that grow in the wake of a factory closing are those related to opioids and alcohol.\n\nSince Nafta was signed, tens of thousands of factories have closed in the US. Millions of largely union jobs have been lost. This fact alone explains so much of the populist revolt against globalization. And while it’s unlikely that we could ever return to the industrial output of 1946, is it that hard to imagine returning to 1994? If Pearl Jam is still making albums, can’t the US still make steel?\n\nRebuilding our manufacturing capacity will be a big part of building a better country. And tariffs – deployed wisely with big investments – are an indispensable tool for doing so.\n\n Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623","summary":"Trump’s levies won’t bring factories home.

Elizabeth Warren\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized billionaires throughout her career, making policies on taxing the wealthy a staple of her political campaigns. Since 2019, Warren has even sold mugs branding the words “billionaire tears” for $28 on her campaign’s website. When she began selling them in 2019, they were $25.\n\nDespite her strong anti-billionaire sentiments, Warren accepted funding from at least 30 billionaires from 2011-2019, according to a New York Post review of her campaign donations.\n\nWarren posted on X during Trump’s presidential run that he “promised” his “rich as hell donors” tax cuts that won’t “help working people one bit.”\n\nOn Feb. 12 Warren told Rolling Stone that Trump is trying to “distract” people from his “failure to cut costs for families” and that he is “play[ing] up to the billionaires.”\n\nGeorge and Alex Soros; Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg; Susan Pritzker, wife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II; Christopher Sacca, a venture capitalist who went on “Shark Tank”; GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner’s wife, Theresa; and David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks; and many more all donated thousands of dollars to Warren’s presidential and senatorial campaigns, according to the New York Post.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden\n\nFormer President Joe Biden began his presidency calling for “unity” in his inaugural address but left office warning that an “oligarchy” was “taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy” in his farewell speech.\n\nBiden took funding from at least 230 billionaires during his 2020 presidential campaign, which amounted to 25% of America’s billionaires at the time, according to Forbes. Trump received money from only 14% of American billionaires that year.\n\nBiden’s menagerie of ultrarich backers included George Soros; Ralph Lauren; Mellody Hobson, wife of George Lucas; Eric Schmidt, former CEO at Google; the founders of companies like DoorDash, Patagonia, and Netflix; as well as the family heirs to the Walmart fortune. Some billionaire donors gave a few thousand dollars, and others gave up to $1.7 million.\n\nForbes noted that at least 60 Biden donors also gave to some of Biden’s super-PACs, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz contributing $47 million, and Mike Bloomberg rolling out $100 million.\n\nBiden also presented his billionaire donor George Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom last month, along with Hillary Clinton and Denzel Washington.\n\n“I love Bernie, but I’m not Bernie Sanders. I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble,” Biden said in 2018 at the Brookings Institution. “The folks at the top aren’t bad guys. I get in trouble in my party when I say wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks. I’ve found no distinction.”\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison\n\nIn a video posted to X on Feb. 5, Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison repeated Biden’s “oligarch” claim. He concluded the video with a call to action, “the small, tiny little group of oligarchs that are trying to destroy our democracy, we can stop them if we band together. We are the many, they are the money, and we can overwhelm them.”\n\nIn 2018, Ellison accepted $100,000 from Alex Soros, George Soros’ son and business successor, according to The Washington Free Beacon. This amount represents a little less than half of funds raised by an independent expenditure committee devoted to Ellison’s campaign success.\n\nAlex Soros, like his father, is a left-wing billionaire philanthropist. “He’s a lot more on the fringe than his dad was,” Joseph Vazquez, associate editor and George Soros expert at the Media Research Center, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “He’s going to be a much more potent political threat.”\n\nVazquez said that Alex Soros might use his father’s business like “a wrecking ball,” and that he may “take that $32 billion empire and smash it against wherever he needs to in order to turn his father’s vision into reality.”\n\nVazquez and Tom Olohan outline why Alex Soros “could be even worse” than his father in a Media Research Center special report titled “Meet the New Boss.” The authors conclude in the report that Alex Soros might be “more radical than his father on everything from abortion to climate change to the weaponization of race to demonize his political opponents.”\n\nEllison was one of the several democratic officials that filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s executive order banning child sex changes. He said in a statement on Feb. 7 that “our children deserve so much better than to be targeted … by the President of the United States and his billionaire cronies,” pointing to how child sex changes are “evidence-based” and this executive order is “mean-spirited and deeply hurtful.”\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar recently joked about Trump being “for sale,” though records show she has accepted funding from at least 21 billionaires.\n\n“What is the difference between Greenland and Donald Trump? Greenland is not for sale,” Klobuchar said at the Washington Press Club Foundation Annual Congressional Dinner, according to the Huffington Post.\n\nDuring Klobuchar’s 2020 presidential campaign she accepted donations from 15 billionaires and six of their spouses, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, according to a Forbes analysis of federal election findings.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin\n\nNewly-elected Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin has contributed to this anti-billionaire narrative multiple times. “Trump and the billionaire cabinet … bought this country,” he wrote on X on Feb. 7. George Soros gave at least $250,000 to Martin’s Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party in 2022, according to the Center of the American Experiment, a Minnesota-based think tank.\n\n“Are we on the side of the robber baron, the ultra-wealthy billionaires, the oil and gas polluter, the union buster, or are we on the side of the American working family?” Martin asked the DNC crowd during his acceptance speech on Feb. 1.\n\nOn Jan. 19, while Martin was still a DNC chair candidate, he went on record saying he will only take money from “good billionaires” going forward.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris critiqued The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times for not endorsing her 2024 presidential run and suggested that her opponent only cares about “billionaires in Donald Trump’s club” during a podcast appearance with Charlamagne tha God.\n\nA total of 83 billionaires supported Harris’ presidential campaign, according to a Forbes Federal Election Commission filings analysis.\n\nNotable Democratic PAC backers included George Soros, Laurene Powell Jobs, Gordon Getty, as well as Bill Gates, who donated $50 million.\n\nDemocratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n\nDemocratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi wrote on X on Feb. 10 that “Republicans are enabling financial predators to rip off hardworking Americans to reward their billionaire donors.”\n\nThe Golden State representative is tied to House Majority Forward, a dark money nonprofit that received $3 million from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss in 2020, according to Fox.\n\nPelosi has received much criticism for her own high net worth over her career, as some estimates rank her as one of the wealthiest members of congress.\n\nMany have suspected that Pelosi, along with her husband, Paul Pelosi, have participated in insider trading. Paul Pelosi has refuted these claims.\n\nBONUS: Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced plans to fight “the oligarchy” on Feb. 12. His spokesperson Anna Bahr told Politico that Sanders will support “working-class people” while “Donald Trump and Elon Musk march us toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy.”\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported the senator’s change in rhetoric from critiquing both “millionaires and billionaires,” until dropping the “millionaire” once he became one in 2019.\n\nFederal filings show that Sanders received just under $500 from one billionaire donor, Marta Thoma Hall, the wife of billionaire Velodyne founder David Hall in 2019. After Forbes notified Sanders’ campaign, they claimed they wouldn’t keep the money.\n\n“Most Americans should believe that as a citizen, you’re allowed to attempt to influence the political process,” Brian Doherty, Los Angeles Times best-selling author and senior editor at libertarian magazine Reason, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “You’re allowed to have your voice.”\n\nDoherty expressed skepticism regarding this anti-billionaire narrative. “I don’t think the Democrats complaining about Elon Musk really have a political objection to … billionaires funding political causes,” Doherty said. “It’s a rhetorical red herring.”\n\nDoherty added that when voters are “aware of the range of really rich people funding both parties and both causes,” they are likely to “lose that sense of anger” regarding wealthy donor influence.\n\nThe offices of Warren, Ellison, Pelosi, Martin, Harris, Klobuchar, Newsom, and Sanders did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Numerous elected Democratic officials have criticized the wealthy despite taking funding from billionaires in the past.

As Liu wrote: Not long ago, American and Chinese people mostly liked each other. In 2011, polls showed that the majority in each country viewed the other favorably. That same year, the “Kung Fu Panda” series was a hit at the box office for the second time, offering a rare cultural touchpoint both nations shared. Economically, the United States and China seemed inseparable. The term “Chimerica” captured this dynamic: China produced and saved; the United States consumed and borrowed. The relationship was celebrated as the engine of global growth, helping the world recover from the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Yet in the years since, the anti-China narrative has become lodged in the U.S. psyche. Today, the amiable era of “Chimerica” has been long forgotten, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a relentless campaign targeting China with tariff and tech restrictions. The last eight years of Washington-Beijing hostilities have turned the U.S. public consensus against China, and in dramatic fashion. As Liu noted, a 2024 Pew survey showed that 81 percent of Americans viewed China unfavorably, with 42 percent perceiving it as an “enemy” of the United States. Today China is more likely to be depicted as hostile and unfriendly in U.S. popular culture – as seen in the political tv drama thriller series “The Diplomat” (2023) – than be celebrated for its pandas and kung fu. Just before the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, there was much discussion in China over whether a victory by the Republicans’ Donald Trump or the Democrats’ Kamala Harris would be less disadvantageous for China’s economic and national interests. In spite of the setbacks tariff and tech wars brought to China’s economic and technological growth, it was believed by some that the Trump 1.0 presidency had provided useful opportunities for China’s top leader Xi Jinping and the country’s military establishment. And the shift from Trump to President Joe Biden in 2021 didn’t exactly change the needle on Trump’s China policy. When the “Cold War warrior” – a moniker the Chinese coined for Biden – entered the White House, Beijing hoped the Democratic president would steer the fraught China-U.S. relations toward improvement and at least avoid plunging the bilateral ties into a new Cold War. As Nanjing University scholar Zhu Feng put it in mid-2020: “Beijing should avoid any illusions that a Biden presidency will automatically change everything, but Beijing should be ready and recognize what sort of efforts China could step up and do.” However, U.S. concern about China’s threat to its national security deepened further under Biden, and his administration went a step further in choking China’s tech industries with restrictions on investments and export controls. In China’s views, the Biden administration also exploited the “Taiwan card” – a “red line” issue in the U.S. relationship with Beijing. As the U.S. presidential election 2024 neared in early November, the consensus in Beijing was that China-U.S. tensions would remain, regardless of who won. On October 31, days before the voting, when asked to comment on likely expectations of the Chinese Communist Party leadership regarding a Trump or Harris win, Shi Yinhong, an international politics professor at the Renmin University in Beijing said, “Whether Harris or Trump becomes the next U.S. president, the continuity in U.S. policy toward China will almost certainly outweigh any major shifts.” That’s precisely why, despite the Chinese official media and social media playing full coverage of the 2024 U.S. election campaign, among the Chinese public interest in the two candidates and their policies appeared muted compared with 2016 and 2020 elections. “It doesn’t matter who wins,” one social media user wrote in a popular comment on China’s X-like platform Weibo. “Their containment of China won’t ease.” Interestingly, despite Trump’s first four years in office having delivered huge economic and technological setbacks to China, he was popularly called Chuan Jianguo (川建国, meaning “nation-builder Trump”) in Chinese slang. A certain fondness for Trump on Chinese social media does not mean the leadership in Beijing preferred another Trump presidency, but it’s undeniable that Biden’s term in office did little to open space for negotiation between Washington and Beijing. Still, Trump’s return to the White House was not expected to signal a meaningful shift in the already fraught and fragile bilateral relationship. Given the bipartisan consensus favoring an aggressive stance in the United States’ China policy – a rare constant over the past eight years – Beijing was well-prepared for the second Trump administration to stay the course, albeit with a more transactional and less predictable approach. However, contrary to Beijing’s expectations, China seemed to have been let off in the early days of the Trump 2.0 presidency. Yes, Trump has implemented two rounds of tariffs on China – sparking reciprocal moves from Beijing – but U.S. allies and partners have received the same harsh treatment. There's little to suggest a particular antipathy toward China in Trump's tariff policy. It’s also been widely noted in China that Trump gave TikTok a reprieve from a Biden-era law that would have banned the popular app unless its Chinese parent company fully divested. Thus a recent editorial in the pro-Beijing Chinese tabloid Global Times observed that after more than a month in office, China-U.S. relations under the new administration have had “a relatively mild and cautious start.” Some U.S. sources have added strength to this argument. First, around the time when Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, Xi Jinping’s leading man responsible for China-U.S. economic ties, held his first phone conversation with Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on February 19, the New York Times ran an article proclaiming: “Trump Eyes a Bigger, Better Trade Deal with China.” Second, many in China have followed with deep interest the news that Trump is seeking budget cuts to the U.S. Defense Department. One influential current affairs commentator pointed to the potential military spending cuts as proof that Trump “does not want to go to war with China.” Despite the conflicting signals, the Chinese intelligentsia overwhelmingly still believes that the U.S. political elite is determined to strive for its twin objectives: stifling China’s economic growth and forcing regime change. But given Trump’s seeming disdain for traditional pillars of U.S. foreign policy, a massive shift on China policy is not impossible. Trump has been in office for over six weeks, and the establishment in Beijing seems clueless regarding the new U.S. administration’s thinking on China. They are far from alone.","summary":"Contrary to Beijing’s expectations, China seemed to have been let off easy in the early days of the Trump 2.0 presidency.

On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, rocking international relations and prompting concerns from critics that the White House is moving away from a democratic ally and hewing closer to Russia, an authoritarian adversary.\n\nTuesday’s speech — Trump’s first address to Congress of his second term — gives him the opportunity to further justify the shake-ups, both at home and abroad, to lawmakers and the public, and to preview what’s coming next.\n\nThe president plans to use the address to tout what he views as his administration’s initial successes, while also hosting guests the White House said benefited from Trump’s first term, according to an administration official and a senior White House official.\n\nThe president is likely to focus his remarks on immigration, new tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to slash budgets and fire federal workers, as well as the administration’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, a senior administration official told NBC News last week.\n\n“There will be a lot of surprises and a lot of made-for-TV moments,” another administration official said.\n\nIn his last joint address to Congress, his 2020 State of the Union speech, Trump awarded right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom — the country’s highest civilian honor. (Limbaugh, 70, died a year later.)\n\nTrump may not travel the country to amplify his message in the days after the address, as is typical for presidents, according to a White House official. The official said that the president and his team believe he’s accomplishing much of his agenda from the White House, adding that they were comfortable with him explaining his message to Americans from his perch in the Oval Office.\n\n“The priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,” the official said, adding that post-address plans could change.\n\nInstead, Vance will travel outside of Washington to highlight the key points in the president’s address, a senior administration official said. He will begin with a trip to the southern border Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump’s second term.\n\nVance played a key role in Friday’s combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation with a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration’s criticisms of Zelenskyy.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president’s opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party’s priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan’s competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid.\n\nSlotkin’s speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said.\n\nMembers of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who “have suffered under the Trump administration’s policies,” according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy, whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program, and two fired federal workers.\n\nTrump’s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president’s speech.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, in a joint address to Congress on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Anticipating Trump&#8217;s speech to Congress: What should you expect? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/anticipating-trumps-speech-to-congress-what-should-you-expect/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-What-to-expect-from-Trumps-prime-time.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 11:30:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":296547864,"title":"That extra dab of guacamole on your burrito could cost more because of new tariffs","text":"That extra dab of guacamole on a burrito is likely to cost more in coming days. President Trump’s new tariffs, if they go into effect on Tuesday as scheduled, are expected to increase the price of Mexican avocados, beer and tequila — all very popular imports among Californians. The state’s business owners and consumers expect costs and tabs to spike. “We’re bracing,” said Luis Navarro, the owner of two Mexican restaurants in Long Beach named after his late mother, Lola. “Immediately, we started trying to figure out what our reaction was going to be because we’re going to be directly impacted. [And] we sell a lot of tequila.\" Alcohol and produce sellers urged Navarro to place orders before Saturday, when Trump’s 25% tariff increase on Mexican imports was initially expected to go into effect. The tariffs were first proposed in early February and then delayed for 30 days on Mexican and Canadian imports in response to concessions from the two nations on immigration issues. Trump ordered the tariffs to take effect on Tuesday because of the continued influx of drugs, notably fentanyl, across American borders, the president said last week. “We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, on Thursday. On Monday, Trump reiterated that the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods would go into effect as planned. Even before the tariffs took effect, prices started rising. The wholesale cost of a crate of 48 large avocados increased from $75 to $85 last week, said Navarro. He worried that he will have no choice but to raise the prices on his enchiladas Suizas, which are garnished with a fan of avocado slices, as well as his spicy watermelon margaritas and Mexican mules. “Modelo Especial is the No. 1 selling beer in the restaurants. All of the avocados we get, all our dried chiles and our beans, a lot of that stuff is coming from Mexico. It’s a tough one,” Navarro said, adding that these cost increases occur in the aftermath of pandemic shutdowns, inflation, minimum-wage increases and growing insurance costs. Restaurant chains may be more likely to weather the increased costs than mom-and-pop outfits. Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said the fast-casual Mexican restaurant does not currently plan to raise its guacamole prices, though he cautioned that this may change depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect. “We don’t think it’s fair to the consumer to pass those costs off to the consumer, because pricing becomes permanent,” he told \"NBC Nightly News\" on Sunday. “That’s our intent this year. Let’s hold pricing constant, because we don’t know if the tariffs are transitory, if they’re going to be permanent, how sticky they’ll be in the new administration.\" In 2024, Mexico exported $505.9 billion of goods to the United States, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Top exports include vehicles, machinery and produce, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition to avocados, other top agricultural imports include tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries and peppers, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Economists with the Brooking Institution think tank have predicted that the tariffs will reduce the United States' gross domestic product, employment, wages and exports while increasing inflation, particularly if Mexico responds with retaliatory tariffs. Californians are the nation’s top consumer of Mexican avocados, importing $602 million of the Hass varietal in the 2023-24 fiscal year, according to a report by Texas A&M professors for the Mexican Hass Avocado Import Assn. Beyond being mashed to create guacamole, avocados have become an American culinary staple because of their creamy texture and healthy fat and fiber content — exemplified by the ubiquity of avocado toast on Southland brunch menus. Per-capita consumption in the United States has grown from 1.5 pounds in 1998 to more than 9 pounds in 2023, according to a University of Florida report. And while American farmers once grew nearly all of the avocados consumed here, nine out of 10 avocados currently consumed in this country are imported from Mexico, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Americans consume a lot of avocados, and virtually all of the avocados we consume come from Mexico,” said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston who focuses on public policy in Latin America. He said that while costs will certainly increase, the amount will depend on how much exporters, importers, wholesalers, retailers and grocers absorb the extra cost. “The idea of tariffs often sounds good in the abstract for many Americans, the idea of protecting United States industries and protecting the United States from foreign competition,” Jones said. “Avocados provide a concrete example — when you have tariffs, consumers pay more for the goods and services they consume.” First Step Fitness gym owner Javier Torres, 33, said potential price spikes will affect his life for two reasons — his work as a personal trainer, since he urges his clients to eat avocados because of their nutritional content, and his Mexican roots. “This will affect every aspect of my life, in the sense of what we eat and how we eat, and what we’ve been eating forever,” said Torres, a Long Beach resident. The tariffs, depending on how long they remain in place, could affect the price of other produce later in the year because of the growing seasons in different locales, such as berries. More immediately, they will affect Mexican beer and tequila; the latter can be only produced from blue agave plants in the state of Jalisco and a handful of other swaths of Mexico. Americans are the largest consumers of tequila, and Californians drink the most — roughly 6.3 million 9-liter cases in 2023, according to Statista, which tracks market and consumer data. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said that while they support Trump’s efforts to secure the border, crack down on fentanyl, increase American manufacturing and reduce trade deficits, the tariffs will have a disproportionate effect on his industry because of its unique nature. “You can’t make tequila in the United States,” he said. The council has been working with its counterparts in Mexico and Canada to try to stop a trade war over liquor exports, Swonger said. He added that tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey likely would result in reciprocal tariffs that harm American craft distillers, whose numbers have increased exponentially in recent decades, including in California. “If we get caught in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with tariffs, it will have a significant impact,” Swonger said. “It will impact American consumers — it will have an impact on prices.” Brad Sims, 52, an engineering consultant, said he's most concerned about how the tariffs affect the price of tequila. The Republican said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 because of his economic views despite disliking the president. “I don't need him to be my moral compass. I don't need him to be my pastor. I'm more concerned about things that affect me personally, selfishly — taxes, inflation,” Sims said. “And if he can help control those, I'll be happy. But it remains to be seen at this point.” Sims made the comment while he was lunching with Matt Troyka, a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. Despite their differing political views, the Long Beach residents said they viewed the tariffs as a strategic effort by Trump to force concessions from the nation’s largest trading partners. “I think there's a lot of positioning, a lot of posturing,” said Troyka, a 52-year-old marketer for food companies. “He probably knows that it's not a good idea long term.” While Troyka said he would be irked if he sees an extra charge for guacamole, it comes at a time where many costs have increased. \"Everything's going up,” he said.","summary":"Californians are among the nation's largest consumers of imported Mexican avocados, tequila and beer.

Whether that's on stage in front of thousands or on a screen in front of millions during an episode of one of his popular podcasts—\"Flagrant\" and \"The Brilliant Idiots\"—there are fewer things comics desire more than his current level of exposure. But these days the only thing he looks forward to is being done in time to ditch the crowds, likes and views to go home to his new baby girl. \"When I can end my day by 5:45 p.m. I'm good because that means I get to spend time with my daughter and just be a dad for a while, it's the greatest feeling on Earth,\" says Schulz sitting at the sleek black marble top bar of the Kookaburra Lounge in Hollywood. On the morning of the Oscars with media chaos swirling outside the Dolby Theater below the Kookaburra's perch on Hollywood and Highland, the low-key comic is sitting back in a green velvet chair contemplating life—and how difficult it can be to make. After he and his wife had difficulties conceiving their first child, they finally found success in 2023 through In Vitro Fertilization, commonly known as IVF. The process inspired Schulz's latest one-hour special, aptly titled \"Life.\" His most personal material yet comes on the heels of making headlines. In the last several months, the comedian made waves by interviewing President Donald Trump just prior to the 2025 election and stoking a momentary feud with Kendrick Lamar after the rapper took lyrical aim at him on his multi-Grammy winning album \"GNX.\" No matter where people stand on Schulz's point of view on comedy, his mark on pop culture with his punchlines has become unquestionable. Recently, he sat down with the Times to discuss fatherhood, the effects comedy has on politics and the inspirations behind his latest hour of material premiering Tuesday on Netflix. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. How has becoming a parent helped your comedy when developing new material? I haven't written a single joke since I had my daughter, or since the tour stopped. So now it's all focused on trying to make her laugh. The world gets really small. It has made me reflect on comedy [material] about kids a lot. Because when I was growing up, my favorite comedians would do this comedy about how they kind of hated their kids. And when you first have a kid, you're going to be shocked at how cliché all your feelings are. The second you have a kid, every feeling you have is the hackiest feeling ever. Whenever they laugh, it's the best laugh in the world, when they smile, you melt. You would do anything for them. We're in this new era of comedy where more comedians are talking about being parents in today’s world and being open and honest about not only raising them but also the conceiving process, which is the heart of your special. What was it like being so vulnerable about something that was so personal? Cathartic. It was nice in the beginning, it was nice because there are stages. When I first started writing it, I wasn't even like writing an hour, per se. I was just kind of talking about what I was going through. I was just getting back on stage and taking some time off from the last special, and then [my wife and I] were trying to get pregnant I remember and I was coming back from Burning Man and I was going to a big birthday party for her mom. But I remember that was when we first started trying and I remember doing it and then afterwards being like, \"it's probably OK if we don't get pregnant this time.\" Just because I didn't know what was in my bloodstream at that point. I mean, I was at Burning Man for a week and then I'm going right to like make a baby? So it didn't happen that time. And then another month went by, it didn't happen, another one went by, it didn't happen, and then I was like, oh s— is it hard to get pregnant? I couldn't fathom it was hard, you know, my whole life has been about trying to not get women pregnant and the amount of stress I would go through and Plan B's and all this other s—. How do you feel a special like \"Life\" raises the bar for your comedy? I don't know, I'm, always just trying to do something different. I think that's the exciting thing for me. Before this special, I was never personal in my comedy at all. Like I didn't think my life was interesting. And then when it was tough for us to get pregnant, it was the only thing I could think of. I just couldn't think of anything else. I couldn't think of some weird topical joke—nothing really mattered. And then talking about this got really exciting on stage. I was like, right, maybe I can tell stories. I never really told stories [on stage], so I was like, what if I can make this whole whole story? And then I didn't want to tell anybody it was a story because I didn't want there to be one—man-show expectations and I wanted them to come in thinking this is like hard hitting stand up for an hour and have that expectation, but also see if I could have a story layered into it. In the special you talk about the indignities of collecting a sperm sample as part trying to get your wife pregnant…did you think there could be a joke there as you were going through it? I think so, yeah. Sometimes you're in a moment you're like, \"Oh this is kind of funny\" And then sometimes you're just talking about on stage you're like really frustrated by something you're embarrassed by something and and you feel very vulnerable so you're like, OK, let me share this and then maybe I'll find something funny in it. And there's other parts where you're just you're so miserable in these moments you can't even think about comedy just yet. So I think it was both for sure. . What’s it like now that you have this daughter in your arms? It's so cliche, but it's the best thing in the world. I don't want to be here. I appreciate your time, don't get me wrong. [I would rather be] seeing my daughter on FaceTime and like she walks up and she taps her head on the phone because I kiss her on her forehead. And so she's like trying to make me kiss her through the phone, which is a Soulja Boy lyric, if I'm not mistaken. For people that follow your podcast and all your stuff, it was also probably a left turn because you, it's not political in any way at all. Not really. Stand-up comedy seemed to play a fairly major role in the 2025 Presidential election. Do you think comedy helped get Trump elected? Do you mean by Trump going on the podcast? Yes specifically comedy podcasts, Trump went on several shows, including your Flagrant podcast as well as the Joe Rogan Experience and Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast as well… I have a maybe more humble take than some which is that I don't think we influenced the election at all. I think people were going to vote this way no matter what and I think seeing him on certain podcasts made them feel more comfortable voicing how they were already going to vote. I don't think very many people were like watching Trump on mine or Rogan or Theo and then flipped on him 100-percent. That's just me. I don't know if we have that kind of power, but what he might do is make you feel more confident publicly sharing how you feel about Trump, right, because maybe in those situations he feels a little less radioactive. There's also a lot of younger people who follow you that probably weren't as engaged in any election talk or politics and are taking cues from you. Do you think about the influence podcasts like yours now have? I don't really care about politics. I just care about culture, but sometimes politics is the reflection of culture. That's when I start to kind of key in on it. Now the pendulum is swung the other way, so we're out of like the censorship era. [When we’re in a censorship era,] comedians are usually the first ones to complain about it because it kind of affects the way that we do our thing and that's happened throughout history and usually you get like really prolific comedians that come out of these times. Carlin being one of them. I mean, even Eddie [Murphy], you know, like people in [Richard] Pryor, the way that they would talk about them like I can't believe they're saying these things like this is so this is crazy. So I think the censorship in a way is kind of like good for comedy, but comedians speak about it and then comedy is having a boom and that's a reflection of, you know, the most influential person on the planet, Joe Rogan being a comedian and loving comedians and putting comedy at the forefront of his interests. There's also like a social media aspect in this where it's like everybody wants a funny tweet, a funny picture, a funny meme, like people, there's like currency in being funny, you know, it's just kind of like this perfect storm. What was the hardest part about it like prepping for the interview for Trump? For me it was just that I want to understand who he is. So I spoke to some people close to him. I spoke to [UFC CEO/President] Dana White for a while and I spoke to Don [Trump] Jr. for a while. I just said tell me a story like I want personal stories like tell me your relationship like don't you have to tell me who he is or who you think he is like tell me these moments that have happened between you guys and you'll find a lot about that. What was the goal of the Trump interview when you went into it and did you feel like you accomplished that? The goal was like the goal is with every person I sit down with. I don't wanna like toot our own horn on the pod, but like I think we got like the best interview with a lot of people specifically because we're just trying to find out who you are and make you comfortable enough to hang with us. We're just trying to have the best hang on the internet. That's it. I hate that I even have to mention this, but it's so stupid–we offered tons of Democrats to come on, you know, but they did not. Mark Cuban came on. I'll say that, and then Cuban was trying to push [more Democrats to come on the show]. He's a big surrogate for Kamala. Did Harris and other Democratic politicians just say no? Or did they give a reason? I think I think they're in a situation where they're playing like a little bit of Prevent Defense and I think this is like I think this is a tricky thing. Again, I speak about these things culturally. I don't really understand politics, but I can just understand the people's reaction to things. I think Americans like risk, we like people who are going to take a risk. I think that's why we were seduced by Bernie [Sanders] because he looked like he was taking risks. He was out there like f– the billionaires, f– these big corporations, they're taking your money. I wanna get your money back and all of us were like, ‘Yo, he's gonna get killed like this guy's fire!’ I think that's the tricky thing for the Democrats. They could win this so easily if they made this about class. If they made it a class war, they would win in a heartbeat. It's so easy, but it seems like they're not willing to do that because I think they have very wealthy people donating a lot of money to them and they don't want to ruffle those feathers. So now you have to make it about identity politics because that's the only other thing they would win in a heartbeat if they made it about class. I think you need a young Bernie. Look at AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]—again, I don't care what you think about her politics, but there are people that in her district voted for her and Trump. And I think it's because people see her as working class and actually want to help the working class, regardless if you think her philosophy is right about it. When it comes to having frank conversations and not being afraid to challenge people, describe the dynamic of your podcast “Brilliant Idiots” with Charlemagne who always challenges your political and cultural opinions. What’s that like for you? Dude, it's the best. We've been doing this for over 10 years and now, he's always been this like crazy superstar, but maybe I've gotten a little bit bigger and then now you could see like the the political websites like looking at our stuff and basically watching the pod and they're like clipping it. But the thing that I like about it is here we are these guys that like we might disagree in terms of politics about some things, but like we're friends for over a decade. It's just the proof like we don't need America to be so divided. We hate each other and we're about to fight, but we actually can be best friends and we can talk s— and you know do whatever we've been doing for 10 years on the podcast while also disagreeing slightly. I've been following your career a long time since watching Guy Code. In your pre-mustache days. What made you decide grow facial hair as part of your look? Not all of us can grow a beautiful thick beard, OK, some of us, this is all we got. [As far as what inspired it] I have no clue. I think this is all I got. To be fair, it's a great mustache. There’s a fine art because you can't go too thin or else you look like the principal of like Epstein Elementary. You also can't go too short. That's a big no-no, be prepared for a lot of rough looks [from people.]","summary":"The comedian who made waves last year interviewing President Donald Trump on his \"Flagrant\" podcast dives into his personal life and process of having a baby using IVF treatments.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-04/andrew-schulz-new-netflix-stand-up-special-life-ivf-donald-trump-brilliant-idiots-flagrant","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0ee2b39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5502x2889+0+390/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F23%2F61fec8564380ab3be2d4823749a3%2F1496177-et-andrew-sc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 11:00:41","author":"Nate Jackson","authors":["Nate Jackson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":296547910,"title":"The Trump administration schooled Europe on free speech. Why ignore the lesson at home?","text":"Vice President JD Vance’s wise words to Europe about U.S. commitments to free speech are on a collision course with some of what’s happening stateside. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are headed in the opposite direction of Vance’s prudent remarks. On Feb. 11, Vance valiantly informed an artificial intelligence summit in Paris that “American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship.” A few days later he told an audience in Munich, “In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat.” His scolding is well deserved. The U.K. recently fined a man for praying silently, while not obstructing anyone, near an abortion clinic. Last month, a CBS News “60 Minutes” segment highlighted Germany’s speech policing by interviewing prosecutors involved in predawn raids of homes and electronics sparked by people’s online comments critical of politicians. FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has collected other egregious examples from around the continent. Thankfully, the 1st Amendment protects Americans from such violations of their free speech rights. That’s why recent actions by the trade commission and the communications commission are so odd. On Feb. 20, the FTC launched a public inquiry “to better understand how technology platforms deny or degrade users’ access to services based on the content of their speech or affiliations, and how this conduct may have violated the law.” But because those tech platforms, including Facebook, YouTube and X, are all private companies, the 1st Amendment, which protects citizens from government censorship, as observed in Europe, is not implicated. Just the opposite: The FTC’s implied crackdown on speech decisions of private tech companies is itself the threat to free speech. By way of a real-world example, just as you should not expect the 1st Amendment to apply to your speech while you’re visiting Disneyland, don’t expect it on a social media platform either. Platforms can feel like and are often referred to as the town square, but just like Disneyland’s Main Street, U.S.A, they are not actually a public place. They are, in fact, private property owned by entities with free speech rights of their own and a vested interest in curating behavior to create a specific environment. Tech platforms are within their rights to remove content they do not wish to carry, just as Disney can remove you from its parks if you’re waving a political banner or holding forth on a soapbox or otherwise “speaking” in a way that violates its rules. You may not like the outcome, but the legality of these expulsions is not in serious question. The same situation of private activity as opposed to government infringement of constitutionally protected speech is being ignored across town at the FCC too. Before being elevated by President Trump to chairman, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr sent a letter in November to Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft accusing them of participating in a “cartel of censorship” by contracting with content moderation consulting company NewsGuard. Likewise, the FCC’s foray into newsrooms defies the 1st Amendment. The agency is investigating KCBS All News radio in San Francisco for its coverage of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement activities, which is protected by the 1st Amendment. It has also restarted a previously closed investigation of CBS News’ editing of a preelection interview with Kamala Harris. That action was followed by Trump calling for CBS to “lose its license.” The agency has also opened an investigation into NBCUniversal and its parent company, Comcast, private corporations, over their DEI practices. Even before the 2024 presidential election, Carr announced on cable news that the agency would look into whether a cameo appearance by Harris on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” had violated the “equal time rule,” indicating license revocation was an option. As it turns out, the Trump campaign was given equal time by the network, but the most important question is why the anachronistic rule still exists at all. This political moment provides an opportunity to get rid of outdated legacy regulations that can be used to favor or disfavor either party. If an equal time rule for broadcasters ever made sense, it was on the basis of scarcity of news outlets. But today’s information and entertainment landscape is filled with cable news, social media, websites, satellite radio and many other media beyond licensed broadcasters. Why not get the FCC, whether led by Republicans or Democrats, out of the speech policing business altogether? The United States should take its own advice and reduce executive agencies’ meddling in speech issues online and over the airwaves.

He branded CNN and others \"fake news.\" He repeatedly railed against journalists as the \"enemy of the people\" during his first term — rhetoric that news groups tried to shrug off or wore as a badge of honor. But six weeks into Trump’s second administration, the attacks have carried a greater sting. In a recent rant on social media about MSNBC, Trump accused the liberal news network of being “an illegal arm of the Democratic Party.” He took direct aim at the network's parent, Comcast, and its chairman, Brian Roberts, calling him a \"lowlife.\" “They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they’ve done to our Country,” Trump wrote. Presidents frequently skirmish with the press. Richard Nixon famously waged a pitched battle, placing several journalists on his notorious \"enemies list.\" But Trump's broadsides have reached new heights and media companies have scrambled to respond. Some have raced to reset relations. To settle a lawsuit Trump brought early last year against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos, Walt Disney Co. agreed to contribute $15 million to a Trump presidential library, plus $1 million for Trump’s legal fees. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta contributed $25 million to end a beef that began after Trump was booted from Facebook following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Trump sued Facebook in 2021, alleging free speech violations. CBS owner Paramount Global has been racked for weeks over whether to settle Trump's $20-billion lawsuit over edits to a \"60 Minutes\" interview, a suit that 1st Amendment experts say is frivolous. The Associated Press went to federal court to reverse a ban of its journalists after the White House booted the news service for declining to adopt Trump's name for the Gulf of Mexico — the Gulf of America. \"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,\" the AP said in its lawsuit. \"Asking the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right,\" the White House responded in a statement. The news media, which prides itself on being America's watchdog, risks being neutered by a confluence of social, political and economic forces. An emboldened president and his allies have launched a vigorous campaign to use levers of government to intimidate an increasingly fragmented and polarized media, media experts say. \"Media organizations, especially starting with the first Trump term, defined themselves as the resistance to Trump,\" UCLA 1st Amendment law professor Eugene Volokh said. \"It's unsurprising that Trump is returning that hostility. I don't think he ever particularly liked them, but now it seems that he dislikes them even more.\" The White House declined to comment for this story. However, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a White House briefing last month, \"If we feel that there are lies being pushed by outlets in this room, we are going to hold those lies accountable.\" The administration made other moves against organizations the president views as unfriendly. Trump officials ditched a decades-long policy of having the White House Correspondents’ Assn. select reporters in the press pool that covers the president in smaller spaces, including the Oval Office. Now, Trump and his team will hand-pick the reporters. The U.S. State Department also ordered employees to cancel subscriptions to several prominent news organizations, including the New York Times, Politico, Bloomberg and the AP. Trump long stewed over his treatment by major news organizations, Democrats in Congress and the Department of Justice, which launched probes into his conduct and the Jan. 6 riot. While campaigning, Trump frequently said the government should revoke broadcast licenses of certain news outlets. Brendan Carr, Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, got to work even before he was elevated to chairman. In December, Carr sent a letter to Disney's Chief Executive Bob Iger, accusing ABC of contributing to an \"erosion in public trust.\" Within hours of being sworn in, Carr dismantled the agency’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Two days later, he reinstated news bias complaints against ABC, NBC and CBS — cases that his Democratic predecessor had dismissed. Carr later launched a review of Comcast's internal initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. The flurry of moves reverberated throughout the industry and deepened a rift on the commission, which currently has two Republicans and two Democrats. (A fifth commissioner, a Trump-appointed Republican, is expected to take office soon.) FCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, a Democrat on the panel, said in an interview that Carr was setting a \"dangerous\" precedent. \"What you are seeing is our licensing authority being weaponized,\" Gomez said. \"The biggest threats to free speech are not coming from Big Tech or from the media. They're actually coming from the government itself.\" Carr's office did not respond to a request for comment but last week at a Semafor media conference, he said it was his job to make sure that broadcasters operate in the public interest. \"If you are a broadcaster and you don't want to serve the public interest, you are free to turn your license in,\" Carr said. Long before becoming a politician, Trump was a New York tabloid sensation never far from a camera or microphone. In 2004, he transformed into a TV star with NBC's \"The Apprentice.\" There Trump honed his knack for reality TV — and making hay from opponents' vulnerabilities. His attacks on the press have capitalized on diminishing public confidence in the media. A half-century ago, Americans overwhelmingly supported the press during its coverage of the Watergate scandal, which prompted Nixon's 1974 resignation. Nearly 70% of U.S. adults surveyed by Gallup said they trusted the media then. But by last October, just 31% of U.S. adults polled by Gallup said they trusted the media to “fully, accurately and fairly” report the news. That's a dramatic decline from 45% in 2018, early in Trump's first term. “When you look at those poll numbers coming down and trust in national media absolutely bottoming out, I think the industry should stop and reflect on what they’re doing,” said the FCC's Carr. The decline in confidence coincides with a collapse in news business economics over the last two decades. Three-quarters of newspaper jobs have been lost, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ranks of journalists in state houses and city halls have been thinned. Once-mighty television networks have lost clout amid steep declines in advertising and pay-TV distribution fees. Social media, increased political polarization and Trump’s stronger standing shifted the field. That lack of trust has had a ripple effect. Media lawyers increasingly worry about defending libel cases before unsympathetic juries. Losing a lawsuit could devastate an already cash-strapped institution, they say. “This is a massive shift from even 10 years ago,” University of Utah law professor RonNell Andersen Jones said. “The baseline argument about the importance of press freedom in a society has already been undercut.” Courts have changed. During his first term, Trump appointed 226 federal judges, according to the Pew Research Center. Some are now deciding the biggest tests of press freedom, including the CBS and AP lawsuits. “A lot of things are coming together right now,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of UC Berkeley Law School. “We have an administration that is being very aggressive toward the media, and a media that is afraid. … And that’s frightening.” Trump’s time out of office may have worked to his advantage. The president and his lieutenants “had a four-year breather to organize and get their ducks in a row,” said Daniel Suhr, president of the Chicago-based Center for American Rights, a conservative nonprofit that filed media bias complaints at the FCC against ABC, CBS and NBC. “This team has both the experience and the time to plan well to use the levers of power to achieve their agenda,” Suhr said. Andersen Jones put it another way, saying years of battering by Trump have taken a heavy toll. “The question people are now asking is whether that vilification of the press, and an encouragement of harassment against members of the press, was a dangerous table-setting for more aggressive incursions on press freedom,” she said. Trump and his allies have pounced on media missteps. A year ago, Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly said on air that Trump had been found liable for rape of author E. Jean Carroll. In fact, the civil court jury determined Trump was liable for sexual abuse. Six months later, ABC hosted the sole debate between Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris. Some conservatives cried foul after ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis pushed back on Trump’s false claims, including an assertion that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. Trump complained on \"Fox & Friends,\" saying the government “ought to take away [ABC’s] license.” Disney agreed to settle Trump's defamation lawsuit involving Stephanoupolos in December. Tensions also have erupted at CBS. In October, Trump declined an invitation to appear on CBS' “60 Minutes.” Network producers went forward with an interview of Harris, which turned into a tempest when CBS aired two different portions of a Harris answer to a question about the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. “Face the Nation” used a clip that showed Harris giving a convoluted response. When the Harris interview ran the following night on “60 Minutes,” her answer was stronger and more succinct. Trump and others claimed the interview had been doctored. CBS producers acknowledged editing the interview, which is common in the news business, but they denied the edits were deceptive. Trump sued, demanding $10 billion (since increased to $20 billion). He filed the case in Amarillo, Texas, ensuring that it would be heard by a Trump-appointed judge. Last month, the president amended his suit, alleging the interview amounted to consumer fraud. The FCC separately has been scrutinizing the matter. Carr demanded CBS turn over raw transcripts and unedited footage as part of the agency's investigation into the news bias complaint. Video released by the FCC and CBS support the broadcaster's account that Harris was quoted accurately. But leaders at the network's parent, Paramount, signaled a willingness to settle. Both sides have agreed to have a mediator step in. Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and other executives have expressed interest in settling to expedite the company's sale to David Ellison's Skydance Media, according to insiders who are not authorized to comment publicly. The deal requires FCC approval because it involves the transfer of CBS station licenses. \"Media companies are now owned by people who want to curry favor with the administration to get other benefits\" for other parts of their businesses, Chemerinsky said. CBS journalists protested Paramount's settlement talks, insisting they did nothing wrong. First Amendment experts agreed, arguing that paying a big settlement would only further embolden Trump. \"Any time a news organization settles a suit that was plainly winnable, that represents lost 1st Amendment ground,\" Andersen Jones said. Shortly after Disney settled the ABC-Stephanopoulos case, Trump sued the Des Moines Register and pollster J. Ann Selzer. In his December complaint, Trump accused Iowa's largest paper of election interference. He was irked by Selzer's poll, published by the Register days before the election, that suggested Harris could pull off an upset in the state. Selzer's poll showed Harris with a 3% point lead in Iowa. Trump won the state with 56% of the vote. Trump's suit argued the poll was concocted in collusion with Democrats in violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. The Register and Selzer denied the allegations and have asked for the case to be dismissed. \"No one in America, whether it's a regular person or a newspaper, should be afraid to predict the outcome of an election,\" Selzer's attorney Conor Fitzpatrick, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an interview. \"These lawsuits are all designed to discourage people from speaking out. They're designed to intimidate.\"","summary":"An emboldened president and his allies have launched a vigorous campaign to use levers of government to intimidate an increasingly fragmented and polarized media, experts say.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-03-04/trump-backlash-media-msnbc-abc-cbs-ap","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc1d83c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbe%2F55%2Ffd2b95584630a7d5858f61c085cb%2Fhttps-delivery-getty","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 11:00:25","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":296590182,"title":"Donald Trump Is Going to Ruin Legal Marijuana","text":"For decades marijuana has been federally classified as a Schedule I drug, inexplicably placing it on the same level as highly addictive, potentially deadly substances like heroin and above others that are far more dangerous, like fentanyl and cocaine.

The speech comes as Trump is making a sharp break from the previous administration, both on the international and domestic fronts. On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, rocking international relations and prompting concerns from critics that the White House is moving away from a democratic ally and hewing closer to Russia, an authoritarian adversary. Tuesday's speech — Trump's first address to Congress of his second term — gives him the opportunity to further justify the shake-ups, both at home and abroad, to lawmakers and the public, and to preview what's coming next. The president plans to use the address to tout what he views as his administration's initial successes, while also hosting guests who the White House said benefitted from Trump's first term, according to an administration official and a senior White House official. The president is likely to focus his remarks on immigration, new tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash budgets and fire federal workers, as well as the administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, a senior administration official told NBC News last week. “There will be a lot of surprises and a lot of made-for-TV moments,” another administration official said. In his last joint address to Congress, his 2020 State of the Union address, Trump awarded right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom — the country’s highest civilian honor. (Limbaugh, 70, died a year later.) Trump may not travel the country to amplify his message in the days after the address, as is typical for presidents, according to a White House official. The official said that the president and his team believe he’s accomplishing much of his agenda from the White House, adding that they were comfortable with him explaining his message to Americans from his perch in the Oval Office. “The priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,” the official said, adding that post-address plans could change. Instead, Vance will travel outside of Washington to highlight the key points in the president’s address, a senior administration official said. He will begin with a trip to the southern border on Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump’s second term. Vance played a key role in Friday's combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation of a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration's criticisms of Zelenskyy. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president's opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party's priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan's competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid. Slotkin's speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said. Members of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who \"have suffered under the Trump administration’s policies,\" according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program and two fired federal workers. Trump’s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president’s speech.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday night will deliver a joint address to Congress, where he is expected to lay out his efforts to rapidly slash the size of the federal government.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-joint-address-congress-what-to-expect-rcna194476","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250129-trump-mb-1201-20277b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 11:00:00","author":"Garrett Haake,Kristen Welker,Megan Lebowitz,Yamiche Alcindor","authors":["Garrett Haake","Kristen Welker","Megan Lebowitz","Yamiche Alcindor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.19},{"id":296539442,"title":"Judge opens door to possible bidding war for Paramount as it scrambles to close $8B Skydance merger","text":"A Delaware judge on Monday opened the door to the possibility of a renewed bidding war for Paramount Global that could thwart the media giant’s $8 billion deal to merge with Hollywood movie studio Skydance Media.\n\nEarly last month, New York City’s public pension funds sued to block the Skydance merger agreement, whose exclusive terms have prevented Paramount from considering a rival bid claiming to be worth $8.8 billion from Project Rise Partners, an investment consortium.\n\nOn Monday, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick asked the pension funds for more information — an indication she is seriously weighing their request to at least temporarily block the deal from closing, according to sources briefed on the court proceeding.\n\nLawyers for Paramount had held out hopes that Judge McCormick — who last year famously smacked down Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package from Tesla’s board — would rule from the bench and dismiss the suit, allowing the Paramount Skydance deal to proceed, sources said.\n\n“If you are delaying a decision it’s bad for the people who did not bring the case,” a source closely following the suit said. “Paramount probably has real problems in court.”\n\nJudge McCormick has not yet set a date for a new hearing, the court said Monday.\n\nThe biggest question for the judge, according to University of Pennsylvania Business Law School Professor Jill Fisch, is whether the largely unknown Project Rise Partners is a legitimate suitor.\n\n“Our original offer had a letter from our bank Northern Trust verifying the financials,” Daphna Ziman, who is leading the Project Rise consortium, told The Post on Monday. \n\nThe Paramount Special Committee would not meet with the group, she said.\n\nProject Rise Partners filed under seal with the judge how it has arranged the financing for what would be the $8.8 billion merger, said Ziman, who publicly has not revealed her backers.\n\nThe New York City pensions allege Skydance is buying media heiress Shari Redstone’s controlling stake in Paramount at a much higher premium than it is paying common stockholders and that common shareholders were left out of the process without a vote.\n\n“Even more brazenly,” the suit alleges, “Skydance has agreed to pay for Redstone’s Central Park apartment and to pay for the lease for her private jet. Most egregiously, Skydance has agreed to indemnify Redstone for any breach of fiduciary duty claims arising out of the proposed merger, knowing full well that she would face massive personal liability for extracting so much value for herself.”\n\nThe plaintiffs said Monday they have a Paramount whistleblower who can speak about the sale process not being adequately open as Skydance — headed by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder David Ellison — tries to close the deal, sources said.\n\nThe dispute is the latest wrench thrown into the merger, which has faced heat from the Trump administration, whose Federal Communications Commission is investigating allegations of political bias at CBS News over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOn Monday, Judge McCormick asked the parties when the FCC and its chairman, Brendan Carr, are expected to rule on the merger. Paramount believes the earliest the deal, signed in July 2024, could clear the FCC is March 18.\n\nCharles Gasparino reported exclusively last week that the FCC’s decision could drag out until the summer.\n\nSeparately, President Trump has entered mediation talks with Paramount about settling his $20 billion suit alleging media bias during the election. The result of those mediation talks could impact the FCC, sources said.\n\n“This could be the death by a thousand cuts,” the source closely following the situation said.\n\nPrivate equity powerhouse Apollo Global Management, which had expressed interest last year in buying Paramount, is now no longer actively following the process, two sources close to the situation said, and it may be the only other logical suitor.\n\nEdgar Bronfman Jr. was given the chance to bid last summer and withdrew his proposal. There is talk that he is still interested and may be seeking new backers, sources said.\n\nThe Special Committee, represented by law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, made the case that shareholders would be worse off if Skydance walked away since there is not a real alternative bidder, Ziman said.\n\nCravath did not return calls.\n\n“I think the Judge is weighing how the offers impact the shareholders,” Ziman said. “who are the policemen, firemen and teachers who voted for President Trump.”\n\nThe plaintiffs are the New York City Fire, Police, Teachers and Board of Education pensions.\n\n“Why would Trump [if he knew] want Larry Ellison to take money from the pockets of those hard-working shareholders?” she told The Post.","summary":"The biggest question for Judge McCormick, according to University of Pennsylvania Business Law School Professor Jill Fisch, is whether the largely unknown Prospect Rise Partners is a legitimate suitor.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/business/judge-opens-door-to-possible-bidding-war-for-paramount-as-it-scrambles-to-close-8b-skydance-merger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/99710337.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 11:00:00","author":"Josh Kosman","authors":["Josh Kosman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.473},{"id":296559160,"title":"Oddly Specific Jellycats","text":"Skip to main content\n\nBooks & Culture\nFiction & Poetry\nHumor & Cartoons\n\nPuzzles & Games\n\n100th Anniversary\n\nOpen Navigation Menu\n\nShouts & Murmurs\nOddly Specific Jellycats\n\nBy Mads HorwathMarch 4, 2025\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nMore Humor and Cartoons\n\nPlease make yourselves at home in my Airbnb and have sex.\n\nI, a conservative, am terrified by the crime in a city I’ve never been to.\n\nThe pros and cons of having a kid.\n\nQuestions I have answered about the tooth fairy.\n\nThe script of every movie set in Boston.\n\nEnter the Cartoon Caption Contest for a chance to appear in the magazine.\nFollow @newyorkercartoons on Instagram and sign up for the Daily Humor newsletter for more funny stuff.\n\nMads Horwath, a humorist and cartoonist, has been contributing to The New Yorker since 2019.\n\nThe New Yorker Interview\nWe Might Have to “Shut Down the Country”\n\nAnthony Romero, the A.C.L.U.’s executive director, talks about what he thinks could happen if the Trump Administration defies the authority of the courts.\n\nBy David Remnick\n\nThe Financial Page\nThe Musk-Trump War on Federal Employees Doesn’t Add Up\n\nDOGE operatives claim that mass layoffs are necessary to prevent the U.S. government from going bankrupt.

Then Trump Won Again.","text":"Marriage is hardly a new invention. But leaving your husband is, relatively speaking. There’s one political party in particular that isn’t so happy with that development.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance called no-fault divorce “one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace.” Donald Trump, famously a two-time ex-husband himself, remained mostly quiet on the subject, but for a lot of American women, it felt as if divorce were on the ballot that year. Divorced men, in particular, thought they had a renewed champion: In July 2024, a poll suggested that those men, far more than divorced women or even married men, would be voting for Trump. “Divorced Men Are Falling For Trump,” the Cut proclaimed by October. Meanwhile, on social media, women married to registered Republican men talked about their plans to cancel out their husbands’ votes. “I feel like he is voting against mine and our daughters (F7) best interest and her future,” one woman wrote on Reddit last summer.\n\nFor a few glimmering moments in 2024, it seemed as if white women—Trump’s second-biggest voting bloc, who are often married to white men, his first-biggest voting bloc—were going to learn their lesson from 2016. They organized Zoom calls and raised millions upon millions for Kamala Harris’ campaign. But many seemed primed to use their personal lives as the ultimate political leverage: Moderate and Democratic women were considering divorcing their Trumpian husbands. Last year, divorce was being discussed as a means of resistance. Whispers on- and offline suggested that women across the country were finally fed up with their Trump-voting husbands, that a second Trump term would mean their marriages were beyond repair.\n\nBut leaving is easier said than done, and it all seemed to hinge on what would happen in November. If Trump lost, would their marriages survive a woman in the White House for once? And if he won, could these women stay with the men who helped put him back in office?\n\nIn three parts of the country—Colorado, Pennsylvania, and California—three straight, working, married white women with Trump-backing husbands told me about how politics had infested their marriages. They had met and married their husbands long before Trump became a problem for them to manage personally. They all had children with these men. They moved cities and bought homes. Meanwhile, they all became the primary breadwinners in their family units.\n\nThen, they spent three election cycles trying to persuade their husbands not to vote for a man who threatened their bodily autonomy, their children’s futures, and the very (tattered) fabric of American democracy. From the depths of the election cycle in October all the way to Election Day and beyond, these women weighed their options: stay, or go.\n\nBefore the Election\n\nIn October, 54-year-old Beth was a few weeks away from celebrating two decades married to her husband—that is, if they’d be able to make it to their anniversary in November.\n\nWhen they met, as is true for a lot of now-unhappy couples, their relationship felt breezy. “I was already accustomed to dating men like that, the redneck vanilla guys. He was typical of the pool of eligibles that I fished in as a Midwestern gal,” she said about meeting him in the early aughts at a college alumni event. The two of them eventually wed and settled down in Colorado. “People are inclined to say, ‘You knew what you were getting.’ You don’t. I didn’t realize what I was getting into.” She’s had a divorce attorney on the line since 2016, though it hasn’t gone beyond a few preliminary phone calls.\n\nBeth had already muscled through a few rough years by election time. (Beth is not her real name; all women in this story were granted pseudonyms to protect them from reprisals, and some small identifying details have been adjusted to ensure anonymity.) In July 2020, mid–COVID lockdown, she was diagnosed with advanced-stage bowel cancer. She went through treatment and has been cancer-free since 2021, but it weakened her body and her spirit and added extra strain on her marriage, which was already starting to turn. She called me from her office, where she works as a lawyer, to avoid her husband’s overhearing her malcontent. “The damage done from the treatment and the surgery is permanent,” she said.\n\nAmong its brutal impacts is that the chemotherapy has weakened her immune system. That made her husband’s refusal to get any of the several COVID-19 shots available to him all the more galling. “He became radicalized during the pandemic,” she said. “When I mentioned to a few people that he didn’t get it, people were really offended. Like, You’re getting treatment for cancer, and he won’t get vaccinated?” Over time, she got pretty offended too.\n\nWhen their daughter turned 18, around the time vaccines became widely available in Colorado, the fight infected the rest of the family. Her husband didn’t want any of the kids to get a vaccination, but their daughter insisted on it. “I couldn’t have been prouder, the way she handled my husband,” Beth said in October, back when polling data still had Harris up by a point or two. “She really did a big fuck you. She wasn’t taking any shit from him.”\n\nIt’s been through her relationship with her daughter that Beth has started to see the value of filing for divorce after all this time. “She texted me that she would rather be dead than deal with another Trump presidency,” Beth said. “I thought, Wow, this is it.” She felt she needed to leave him, “if for no other reason than to stand up for my daughter, showing her that at some point, it comes down to your principles.”\n\nHer husband had every intention of voting for Trump again, no matter how many arguments he got into about it with his daughter, or his son, or his wife.\n\nFor 30-year-old Annie, a veterinarian from the U.K. who had a baby earlier in the year with her 37-year-old husband, their conflicts were less about his politics and more about how much disregard he had for half the country. Not the half that votes for Democrats, but rather: women. Her husband’s views were often pretty liberal; the two of them agreed that the U.S. needed to stop giving Israel arms to bomb Palestinians—they were both hoping for an immediate ceasefire—and he also believed in accessible health care for all. But they kept having arguments about gender, and he just couldn’t get his head around voting for a woman. “I’m not sure I really picked up on the misogyny when we first met,” she said. “He wouldn’t think of himself as someone who doesn’t like women or thinks women are less than.” But Annie is an immigrant, living stateside in California as an immigrant, with paperwork tied to her husband. To leave him is to also leave the country, where her baby is a citizen.\n\nWhen Annie tried to make sense of her husband’s distaste for marginalized groups in power, she came back to his first union. Her husband was married once before, and Annie said he’s still angry at how his ex treated him during their marriage. “That’s probably some of the root cause; he almost expects women to hurt him in some way,” she said. Still, by October, she and her husband were quarreling over his criticisms of Harris’ gender and race. “He feels that elevating the rights of others, specifically people of color, erodes his rights,” she said. “That’s been a discussion around Harris as well, that maybe they picked her because she’s Black and she’s a woman.” Annie’s husband had long been more of a third-party voter; in 2024 he was decidedly on the fence about how to vote, toggling between Trump and a third-party candidate (though she couldn’t entirely remember which one).\n\nAnnie was also battling against her husband’s online habits, which consisted mostly of playing video games and watching others game on platforms like Twitch. “I think sometimes those people are a little misogynistic in the way they view the world, so he gets his talking points from that, rather than data-driven sources,” she said. That was bad enough for Annie to tolerate, but they also have an infant son, who isn’t yet paying attention to Dad’s words but will clue in soon enough. “I want my son to grow up to know he takes 50 percent of responsibility of everything in the home, in the relationship,” she said. “I won’t tolerate any kind of misogynistic viewpoints from him at all.” (Annie said that, despite his views, her husband is an equal parent in the home and is perfectly comfortable with her being the primary breadwinner.)\n\nIf Beth sounded defeated by the state of her marriage, and if Annie was anxiously trying to reform her husband, then 52-year-old Heather was filled with the kind of rage that only divorced women understand.\n\n“On our second date, he was telling me he never paid attention to the news. He didn’t know much,” she said in October. “I asked him, ‘OK, who’s the vice president?’ He didn’t know! I kind of found it endearing and cute at the time, but it’s something that, after the last eight years, has stuck in my mind. He’s someone who just doesn’t know things.” But still, she wasn’t prepared for how bad his politics would get. After all, he voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and they even attended the White House Christmas party together that year. “It was the first time he ever voted,” Heather said. “He got really into it with me.”\n\nOriginally from New York—which you can still very much hear in her staccato accent—but now living in Pennsylvania, freelance writer Heather has been married to her husband for 24 years. They have two kids, and she tolerated his uninhibited support for Trump through his first administration, even after one of their children came out as nonbinary and started fighting with their dad about politics. But this time around, things have been harder, particularly with how trans people have been targeted by the Trump campaign, and how much that weighs on their nonbinary child. “They were like, ‘I’m going to show him Project 2025. I’m going to convince him out of it,’ ” Heather said. “I thought I could appeal to his decency, to who he was before. But I can’t look at a person who’s OK with vile racism and vile misogyny and sexual assault and disgusting xenophobia.”\n\nMore than any of the other husbands, Heather’s is the furthest through the looking glass when it comes to YouTube conspiracy theories. “He became a 9/11 truther in 2006. He’d say, ‘I just ordered this video off eBay—you gotta watch it with me.’ It was about how the Bush administration did it, they were the ones who crashed the planes in the tower. Really stupid shit,” she said. “I wrote it off.”\n\nBut then came his conspiracies around Sandy Hook: He claimed that the 20 children murdered in that 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school weren’t real. “I found out about Sandy Hook while I was in my son’s class, doing gingerbread houses,” Heather said. “Every mother in there was devastated because this news came across on our phones. And this man is telling me it’s not real?”\n\nEven more gallingly, Heather, who used to be a reporter, was stuck trying to convince her husband that the entirety of the news media isn’t corrupt, evil, and out to manipulate the American public. She spent days trying to explain to him how news stories are put together, what kinds of photos they use, and why murdered 6-year-old children might not leave behind a treasure trove of online data for amateur sleuths to find. “He thinks he understands how the media works,” Heather said. “He said they’re crisis actors.”\n\nFor all three women, the prospect of four more years of Trump seemed devastating—an impossible task for their already-frayed relationships. That their husbands were determined to vote for Trump again was a betrayal not just of their politics but of their families: They were all raising children under an ethos dichotomous to Trump’s. Their hopes were deep with Harris: If she won, then maybe Trump would be defeated for good, and perhaps their marriages would have an opportunity to heal. “Can I drop this?” Beth asked herself. “Can I drop this and keep going if Harris wins?”\n\nElection Day\n\nBefore we knew what the election’s results would be, all three of the women I was speaking with were toying with the possibility of filing for divorce.\n\nAnnie was steeling herself for bad election results, but also for talking to her husband about possibly leaving the U.S. for good. “I’d be more comfortable and safer in the U.K. than here,” she said. “I would be stupid to stay here and put my own health at risk.” Their fighting was starting to ramp down at home, even if she knew they were still negotiating huge disagreements. Trump was forcing couples to have arguments over the kinds of things marriage counselors across the world could have never predicted. “We had an argument about tariffs recently,” Annie said. “He didn’t really want to listen to my explanation of why it wouldn’t work.”\n\nMeanwhile, as Harris and Biden failed to secure anything close to a ceasefire in Gaza, Annie and her husband were both reaching unknown levels of disillusionment. “I’m not hugely optimistic,” she said.\n\nHeather wasn’t going to wait around to find out what would happen to no-fault divorce. When I spoke with her right before Election Day, she had already started the divorce process and had plans to put the house on the market for an immediate sale. “I have filed. It’s gotten so clear to me why I don’t want to be married to this person anymore,” she said.\n\nThe stress of her marriage was exacerbated by her own media diet too: While her husband was busy watching YouTube videos about the secret group of elite liberals running the government, Heather was succumbing to her own internet echo chamber. A longtime tweeter, she saw her mentions steadily being overrun by MAGA folks, and she seemed to constantly be going viral in the wrong circles. One especially critical tweet of hers was picked up by one of the YouTubers her husband watches so religiously. He saw the coverage of her public upset and confronted her about it. “I was sitting there all sheepish,” she said. “But you vote for the guy who insults people left and right? And he’s mad I told some bot on Twitter ‘Fuck you’? That’s an issue?”\n\nThese wounds for Heather go back to 2016, and to the night Trump was elected the first time, thanks to voters like her husband. It was a shock to both of them. “As soon as we realized what’s happening, his jaw dropped and his face went white. I said to him, ‘What did you do?’ ” she said. “The next morning, the kids wake up, they hear the news. They’re crying. He’s trying to calm them down: You trust Daddy, right? Daddy voted for Trump. And that was the end of my marriage.”\n\nFor Heather, it was already irrelevant even before the election who would win the presidency. Her marriage was ruptured to the point that no possible Democratic win could heal it. “There’s nothing to talk about. What is there to say? I can’t do it anymore. He’s never respected me, and I realize that. It’s not personal. He just doesn’t respect women,” she said. “I haven’t had a normal, sane, intelligent conversation with him in 10 years.” Heather was moving things around in her at-home office, digging up old paperwork, starting to envision movers taking boxes out and transporting her to her own town house or apartment. She dropped a stack of papers on her desk. “I can’t wait to meet someone I can have an intelligent conversation with.”\n\nAfter the Election\n\nAfter the election, anecdotes about divorce filings started pouring in from all across the country. Everyone seemed to have a friend who had finally broken up with her boyfriend because he voted for Jill Stein. Beth’s, Heather’s, and Annie’s marriages were all up in the air.\n\nThe day after the election, Beth told me, her husband “stayed in bed all day and didn’t leave his room.” She was grieving Harris’ loss with her kids, but it didn’t seem as if her victorious husband was feeling all that celebratory. Their first contact after the election, she said, was him accusing her of taking out her election anger on him by hiding his Denver Nuggets jersey. (She vociferously denied this.)\n\nBeth had, days after the election, still barely heard from her husband. Still, she wanted to keep the peace in the coming weeks; she and her family had a beach vacation planned, and it was the only thing keeping Beth going. She was happy to dissociate a bit from her troubled marriage; others were not so accommodating. “My younger sister knows what’s happening, and she’s judgy. She wants me to go through with this, but she’s like, I can’t believe you’d want to go on vacation with him,” Beth said. “I need this trip. My kids deserve this trip. I have no illusions that it’ll change anything about how I feel.”\n\nHer displeasure with her marriage had bloomed—it was no longer just about his voting for Trump, but a lifetime of little failures. “I didn’t get anything for my 50th birthday. No party, no dinner. Thanksgiving is our 20th anniversary, which is ostensibly why we scheduled this trip, but I’m not celebrating a goddamn thing,” she said. “What I’m sore about—sad, really—is that I didn’t get anything to celebrate beating cancer. That was never mentioned at all.”\n\nBut she had other things on her plate, aside from the ongoing physical issues following cancer treatment. She was eager for a break at work too, because a discrimination investigation—far from the first she had had to witness ripple through her colleagues—was taking place at her law firm. The morning we spoke, she had to be interviewed by an investigator about just how unhealthy her workplace has become. “I’m pretty angry because this is the second time I’ve had to do this inside of five years,” she said. Beth had been harassed and condescended to at work more times than she could count; her husband doing it at home added insult to injury. “He thinks I’m an idiot. He tells me that pretty much on a weekly basis, what an idiot I am,” she said.\n\nBeth had finally come up with her own retort: “You know what our new word is for them? Mediocre. I’ve been hearing that a lot lately: mediocre white male.” When I asked her if she meant that her husband was one of “them,” she burst out laughing: “Yes!” It sounded as if she were maybe ready to do something about it. “I can’t take the embarrassment any longer,” Beth said. “This might sound stupid, but I feel like I have to stand up for my daughter. I have to show her that you don’t have to stay in a marriage or any other kind of relationship where someone is emotionally abusive.”\n\nWithin days of Trump’s second election, Heather’s husband had actually moved out. “He said something stupid like, ‘I can’t sleep here anymore. I’m worried you guys are going to stab me in my sleep,’ ” Heather said. “I texted him, and so did my daughter, saying to him how we felt, and please don’t come home because we can’t see you tonight.” Their voting-age daughter refused to speak to her father beyond that; their nonbinary child told him that he had voted against their rights. Her husband’s response? “ ‘You don’t even know if I voted,’ ” Heather recounted. But he had: for Trump, as promised. (Beth’s husband did the same. Annie’s husband voted third party.)\n\nNo one sounded angrier about the results of the election than Heather. She was angry at Biden, at Harris, at left-leaning voters who declined to vote because of U.S. contributions to Palestinian deaths (“There is no genocide!” she told me, something she and her husband actually agreed on), at every nonwhite voter who went red (“Bye, Muslims and Latinos. If you’re stupid enough to vote for Donald Trump after what he said he would do to you, you get what you get!”), and at everyone else “too stupid” to vote blue. She was especially furious with the people who had voted Trump back into office. “I have nothing left for these people,” she declared. “Deport every MAGA out there and put them on an island. They’re a danger to the human race.”\n\nWhile I was on the phone with Heather, there was a knock at her front door: It was a process server, there to serve her husband with the divorce papers she had filed a week earlier. After all, they still share the same address. “I can’t sign for that, right?” she asked. “They’re my divorce papers.” The server promised to come back another day.\n\nAfter the Inauguration\n\nA few days after Trump’s inauguration—when Melania Trump stepped out in her social-distancing hat and sparked a new round of speculation about her own marriage—Heather texted me that she had a “surprising” update. Her house remains on the market, and her husband hasn’t returned home after he moved out following Election Day. The big update, instead, is that despite filing divorce papers, Heather doesn’t want to get divorced anymore. She’s now really hoping her husband comes home.\n\n“I realize I made a major mistake the last nine years. After the election, I turned off cable news and I got my ass off Twitter,” she says. (She’s moved over to Bluesky.) Heather now thinks she pushed her husband toward voting for Trump by having had such a noisy reaction to his support in the first place, eight years ago. “If I had just had a more reasonable reaction, and talked to him reasonably, maybe he would have listened to me,” she says. “He’s not right about Donald Trump, but was it important enough to destroy a 25-year marriage? There was a lot of marriage before there was a Donald Trump.”\n\nThe problem is that Heather’s husband doesn’t seem to have the same regrets. He’s told her that he has no intention of returning to their shared home, or to their marriage at all. So she’s still selling the house, and her life is completely in flux. “I feel heartbroken,” Heather says. “I fought for eight years against Trump, because I felt it was the right thing to do. Where did it get me? Trump is president, and no marriage.”\n\nIn November, Heather was looking forward to going out with someone new whom she might be able to have a “sane” conversation with. It turns out, in the intervening weeks, she did go on a few dates, but it wasn’t the panacea she was hoping for. “Sure, we got to talk about Trump, yeah, OK, whatever. They’re not the person I was married to for 17 years,” she says.\n\nHeather’s despair over her personal life has led to one unexpected result: She just doesn’t give a shit about politics anymore. Her own proud Judaism notwithstanding, even Elon Musk’s Nazi salute didn’t get her goat the way it might have a few years or even months ago. She’s tired. She doesn’t want to argue anymore. And while she’s continuing her yearslong work with local Democrats to get them elected during the midterms, she no longer wants to talk about politics at the dinner table. “I don’t feel like I’m capitulating to Trump by wanting my marriage back,” she says. She has succumbed to what she views as the futility of resistance. “More people think the way he does, and they’re living happier lives,” she says. “And I just want to lead a happy life.”\n\nBeth, too, hasn’t gone through with a divorce, at least not yet. Her exhaustion still lingers from the first Trump administration, the pandemic, and cancer. She’s been overwhelmed by the emotional and tangible process that comes with divorce. She and her family went on that beach vacation, which did help her and her husband with their sniping. For now, they’re suspended in a holding pattern, and maybe that’s enough until she can chart her next move. She’s still conflicted between her own happiness and her sense of duty. “I feel like I’ll be letting people down if I don’t proceed with the divorce,” she says.\n\nBeth did decide to pay a small deposit for a lawyer, the same one she’s been talking to since 2016. “He said, ‘Oh, you are not the first client I’ve had come through the door in the last eight years who has said that Trump is the reason they’ve come to see me,’ ” Beth says. “He said he’s had at least five cases where the woman ended the marriage because she found out who her spouse really was.” It’s not a retainer, but it does mean she has an attorney ready to go if she ever does decide to file. “I still feel deeply humiliated that he supports this new presidency,” she says. “At some point, am I just going to be so disgusted and demoralized that I can’t live with this person anymore? I don’t know.”\n\nInstead of fighting with her husband, Beth is preparing for other possible disasters in her future, like if their kids lose their health insurance should Trump wipe out the Affordable Care Act. “There’s no way on God’s green earth that I am letting my children go without health insurance,” she says. “I will be making sure they have coverage no matter what it takes, even if I have to delay my own retirement.”\n\nIn the end, it’s money that Beth is thinking about most, namely how leaving her husband might penalize her financially in her mid-50s, when she should be gearing up for the retirement she’s so looking forward to. If they do divorce, that means they would have their own bank accounts, and he wouldn’t have to split expenses with her—including health care for their adult kids if they need it in the future. She’s also considering her sizable pension, which could get cut in half if she does leave. “That pension is the biggest asset we own as a family,” she says. Emotional freedom is one thing, but what of financial freedom? What kind of life can Beth have if she’s working harder and longer to make up for an ugly divorce?\n\nBut it’s not as if they aren’t fighting right now, even in their postvacation glow. Their latest ugliness was over whether Republican Sen. Deb Fischer’s husband declined to shake Kamala Harris’ hand while his wife was being sworn into Congress. “To me, that moment just epitomizes the whole gaslighting aspect. That’s a big part of the problem in our marriage, is that he’s trying to convince me to not believe what I saw and heard with my own eyes and ears,” she says. “I am not crazy, and I am not unreasonable. Don’t you dare pull that stuff with me.”\n\nOnly Annie has a more optimistic view of her marriage in 2025. With Musk’s Hitleresque performance still trending, her husband has since grown tired of the shtick. Maybe it’s still funny to her husband when someone as out of control as Trump behaves like someone out of control, but a powerful billionaire like Elon Musk doesn’t get the same reaction out of him. She showed her husband the video of Musk the night it blew up. “That’s made a few pennies drop,” she says. “We were just speechless. Obviously we always knew that was an undercurrent to all of this stuff, but for it to be so blatant, I just couldn’t believe it.”\n\nAnnie says that it feels as if her husband, at long last, is in reality with her, though they’re still working on his grasp of feminism and women’s rights. Her husband’s liberal radicalization has gone so swimmingly, in fact, that he’s also considering an out-of-country move. “We’re looking into Hong Kong and Singapore,” she says. “Divorce isn’t something that I’m thinking about.”\n\nIn October, before the election results were clear, I asked Beth if she still loved her husband. Based on her own retelling of the late stage of her marriage, he was going to vote against the interests of their kids, he ignored the warnings from his wife, he neglected his family through a pandemic, and he offered almost no flexibility on a political ideology that scared the shit out of his entire family. But once, decades ago, they were just a couple. It used to be just the two of them, in 2000 or 2001 or 2002, when politics somehow seemed simpler. There were, at least, fewer mainstream Nazis to contend with back then. It’s hard to walk away from two decades together, two children, and a united path that one day diverged. “I will love him until my last breath,” Beth told me.\n\nAs of late February, she’s still married to her husband. All three of them are.","summary":"This was supposed to be the election where women showed America.","url":"https://slate.com/life/2025/03/donald-trump-divorce-marriage-politics-men-women.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/bc43f76e-f721-4eb9-bd4c-f962c1b465bc.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 10:40:00","author":"Scaachi Koul","authors":["Scaachi Koul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.042},{"id":296504644,"title":"Billie Eilish's savage 13-word reaction to Donald Trump as US pulls aid to Ukraine","text":"Billie Eilish had just 13 words to say about Donald Trump during her concert.\n\n The Bad Guy hitmaker and her brother Finneas publicly endorsed Kamala Harris during the presidential election last year, as they voiced their concerns about reproductive rights, environmental issues, and democracy to their Instagram followers. They have been seen wearing Artists4Ceasefire pins in the past, signaling their support for a ceasefire in Gaza. \n\n This morning, Donald Trump has paused all aid to Ukraine in a \"catastrophic\" blow that will lead to the deaths of \"thousands\" of people, according to panicked local lawmakers. A White House official said the US was \"pausing and reviewing\" military support to \"ensure that it [ Ukraine ] is contributing to a solution\", adding that Trump's entire focus is on reaching a peace deal - a scheme he and Vladimir Putin are belligerently pushing for. \n\n After the election in November, Billie took the stage at one of her concerts to express her thoughts on the result of Trump becoming president again. A fan-recorded video revealed her saying: \"Someone who hates women so, so deeply is about to be the president.\" \n\nUkrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said halting aid to a country engaged in active warfare is \"catastrophic for us\" as he begged Trump to \"give us some time\" before cutting them off. He added that Putin will be \"embolden[ed]\" by the move, and that Ukraine and the US need to work together to find a solution. The move comes just days after a tense Oval Office bust-up between Trump and his sidekick JD Vance and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump slammed Zelensky for saying that a deal to end the war is \"still very, very far away\" and warned \"America will not put up with it for much longer\". British music icon Sir Rod Stewart is among the celebrities to speak out against Trump as he heaped praise on Keir Starmer. \n\nThe Sailing singer is a proud supporter of Ukraine, and has been among those to notice the stark contrast in how the Ukrainian leader was warmly greeted by the Prime Minister at Number 10 on Saturday, compared to the tirade he was subjected to by Donald Trump in the White House just 24 hours earlier.\n\nSharing a picture of the two men stood outside Downing Street, he wrote on his Instagram Story: \"Proud to be British. Well done Starmer in welcoming Zelensky to the number 10\". He rounded it off with the six-word message: \"We must keep supporting the Ukrainians\". Sir Michael Caine shared his own criticisms for Trump as he reprised his immortal line from The Italian Job when he posted on X: \"You're only supposed to sign a ceasefire.\" \n\nIt was a wry nod to his character's quip in the classic British film, in which he said: \"You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\" Daytime TV host Lorraine Kelly also blasted Trump's apparent mocking of Zelensky wearing military fatigues to the meeting - pointing out that Winston Churchill had also worn a similar outfit in a visit during World War Two in 1942. She wrote on Instagram: \"Winston Churchill at the White House - not wearing a suit because we were at war. The disrespect to President Zelensky throughout was appalling and shameful.\"\n\nLike this story?
