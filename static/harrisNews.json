Texas Democratic lawmakers delayed a vote for 15 days by leaving the state in protest, depriving the House of enough members to do business.\n\nState Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes. \"The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,\" Hunter, a Republican, said as debate began.\n\nDemocrats responded that that was counter to the country's values. \"In a democracy, people choose their representatives,\" said State Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat. \"This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, D.C. choose their voters.\"\n\nThe Texas State Senate, also controlled by Republicans, needs to also pass the map and GOP Gov. Greg Abbott must sign them before they become official. The House debate was expected to be the lengthiest and greatest obstacle to the Republican push, but both parties expected the legislation to ultimately pass, given the GOP's significant majority in the chamber.\n\nDemocrats said they're preparing to challenge the new map in court.\n\nSome House Democrats returned from their flight on Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday's session. Seven who refused were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night, led by Rep. Nicole Collier, who represents a minority-majority district in Fort Worth. Her staff removed a pillow, blanket and bag of personal effects early Wednesday.\n\nAs lawmakers trickled into the chamber, several Democrats gave Collier a hug, said \"Thank you,\" and took photos with her. In a social media post Tuesday night, Collier put a call from 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris on her cellphone's speaker. Harris told Collier that, \"We are all in that room with you.\"\n\nRELATED: Texas House redistricting committee advances bill with new congressional maps\n\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced, as debate started, that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip before exiting.\n\nFurious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California's Legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state's voters in November.\n\nNormally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.\n\nDemocrats are energized by the fight in Texas\n\nAs the House session was about to begin, about two dozen demonstrators supporting Democrats sang \"Fighting for Democracy, we shall not be moved\" outside the chamber. GOP House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that the public gallery will be cleared if there are disruptions. The public gallery was mostly empty as the session was gaveled in.\n\nBut the 100 members required to do business were present. About 200 people have gathered in the Capitol's rotunda for a rally supporting Democrats, holding signs saying \"End Gerrymandering - Save Democracy,\" \"Defend the Constitution,\" and \"Fascism is here.\"\n\nTexas Democrats spent the day before the vote continuing to draw attention to the extraordinary lengths the Republicans who run the Legislature were going to ensure it takes place.\n\nCollier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the \"permission slip\" required by Burrows to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. Collier spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.\n\nDallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.\n\n\"It's a weird feeling,\" she said. \"The only way to explain the entire process is: It's like I'm in a movie.\"\n\nDallas-area Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez joined the protest inside the House chamber and called it a \"slumber party for democracy,\" and she said Democrats were holding strategy sessions on the floor.\n\n\"We are not criminals,\" Houston Rep. Penny Morales Shaw said before joining Collier, too.\n\nCollier said having officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements.\n\nRepublican leader says Collier 'is well within her rights'\n\nBurrows brushed off Collier's protest, saying he was focused on important issues, such as providing property tax relief and responding to last month's deadly floods. His statement Tuesday morning did not mention redistricting, and his office did not immediately respond to other Democrats joining Collier.\n\n\"Rep. Collier's choice to stay and not sign the permission slip is well within her rights under the House Rules,\" Burrows said.\n\nUnder those rules, until Wednesday's vote, the chamber's doors were locked, and no member could leave \"without the written permission of the speaker.\"\n\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust Wu and several other Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\n\nDemocrats outside the Capitol reported different levels of monitoring, and some said the officers watching them were friendly. But Austin Rep. Sheryl Cole said in a social media post that when she went on her morning walk Tuesday, the officer following her lost her on the trail, got angry, and threatened to arrest her.\n\nREAD MORE: Even at the grocery store, Texas troopers don't let Democrats out of sight after walkout\n\nGarcia said the officer who tailed her home also came into the grocery store when she went shopping with her 9-year-old son.\n\n\"I would imagine that this is the way it feels when you're potentially shoplifting and someone is assessing whether you're going to steal,\" she said.","summary":"The Republican-controlled Texas House on Wednesday kicked off a heated debate over a new congressional map creating five new potential GOP seats.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/both-parties-expect-gop-map-texas-clear-big-hurdle-national-fight-redistricting/17598755/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17598993_082025-ktrk-new-congressional-map-img.png?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ktrk/082025-ktrk-ewn-430p-redistricting-latest-NNA-wed-mg-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 22:15:02","author":"Jim Vertuno And Nicholas Riccardi","authors":["Jim Vertuno And Nicholas Riccardi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":352730374,"title":"Guest Opinion: Democrats still have an age problem","text":"Grandma and grandpa are running Congress.\n\nThat certainly appears to be the case if you are a Democrat. When data for House members of the 118th Congress were released in 2023, the average age of Democratic representatives was 72, while the average age for Republican representatives was 48. That is a 24-year age difference, meaning the average Democrat was old enough to be a parent of their Republican counterpart.\n\nThe Democratic Party clearly has an age issue. Many people have referred to it as a gerontocracy crisis.\n\nImmediately following their defeat in the 2024 election, the party decided to continue business as usual, resisting conventional policy and maintaining gerontocracy by electing 74-year-old Gerry Conolly (1950–2025) to serve as ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. Most members concluded 35-year-old Alexandria Ocasio Cortez was too radical and supported too many policies in sync with most Americans. In essence, they adhered to an “older is better” and an “with age comes wisdom” philosophy. The elder guard made sure that Connolly had their backing.\n\nThe dramatic chapter that crippled former President Joe Biden and handcuffed former Vice President Kamala Harris was either lost on or willfully disregarded by many party elders. Biden’s age is an indelible reminder about the vital impact this issue played in the 2024 election, reflected in pundits Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper co-authored book about his decision to run for re-election despite being in his 80s.\n\nA recent Reuters poll demonstrates party leaders are facing an arduous battle in recruiting candidates for Congress next year — and for the White House in 2028. Some 62 percent of self-identified Democrats in the poll agreed with a statement that “the leadership of the Democratic Party should be replaced with new people.” Only 24 percent disagreed, and the rest said they weren’t sure or didn’t answer. Conversely, only 30 percent of Republicans polled held such sentiments about their party leadership. Former House leadership members Nancy Pelosi, Stenny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn were well into senior years then and are now well into their 80s and show no signs of retiring. In fact, Clyburn frantically remarked, “Do you want me to commit suicide?”\n\nSpeaking of death and demise, in addition to Connolly, Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., died in office last year at age 87. Longtime Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, died in office in July 2024 at 74. Her successor, Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, 70, died in office this past March. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., 77, and died this year following a lengthy illness.\n\nEarlier this year, David Hogg, the controversial vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, aroused considerable ire and resentment by telling Bill Maher, “There’ve been a few members that have come out, that have said, ‘if I retire my life is effectively over.’ … Get over yourself. This isn’t about you.”\n\nAfter Hogg made this statement, he became the victim of fierce attacks from various quarters of the party. James Carville referred to him as a little twerp. Not long after, Hogg resigned from his position as co-deputy chair of the Democratic Party. It appears to be easier for party elders to ignore legitimate concerns as opposed to addressing the larger symptoms.\n\nThe undeniable truth is the current Democratic Party is in shambles. The Republican Party is far from vibrant, but for different reasons, but nonetheless controls all three branches of government. In spite of its problems the Republican Party currently remains more popular than the Democratic Party. Last November, the party made notable, impressive inroads with many traditionally Democratic constituencies, including Black and Latino men, as well as young voters.\n\nSome critics of younger members, including Ocasio Cortez, Maxwell Frost, and Zohran Mamdani, and others argue they are “too aggressive” or should “wait for their turn” to pursue certain positions. The fact is they are members of the Millennial and Gen Z generations who are being directly affected by the current state of affairs. They are well aware of the fact that the nation is heading in a downward slope that is having a disproportionate negative impact on their generations.\n\nWe do not want Clyburn or anyone else to “commit suicide”, but we do want and need you and others your age to understand what is at stake. Young, energetic, vibrant and talented democratic leaders are ready to move in, move up and begin doing the massive amount of work that needs to be done. They cannot afford to “wait” and the “turn” that is needed is a sharp, decibel-screeching U-turn to turn the nation around — now!","summary":"Grandma and grandpa are running Congress.","url":"https://www.keenesentinel.com/opinion/op-ed/guest-opinion-democrats-still-have-an-age-problem/article_c80ad58d-f50f-4b38-9a12-8086425f1244.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/keenesentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6260defe-c779-11ef-bd8a-c733c01e3345.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 21:30:00","author":"Elwood Watson","authors":["Elwood Watson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":352691266,"title":"Margot Robbie stuns in a corset mini dress as she joins co-star Colin Farrell at photocall for A Big Bold Beautiful Journey in Los Angeles","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIoan Gruffudd dealt new blow in bitter divorce battle as he attempts to make his restraining order against ex-wife Alice Evans permanent\n\n'Perfect family' obliterated by quadruple murder-suicide at stunning New Hampshire home... with confused orphan toddler found near bodies\n\nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nCareful, William...

In early August, 57 lawmakers skipped town, flying to Illinois and New York in a dramatic attempt to block the GOP's map vote. \n\nThey returned 18 days later only to find themselves under near-constant surveillance by the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nRep. Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat from Austin, asked the speaker of the House on Wednesday morning if she would be arrested if she left the chamber before the end of the session.\n\n'Let's find out,' replied Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from Dallas.\n\nProtesters shout in support of State Rep. Nicole Collier, after she refused to sign the required permission slip that would allow lawmakers to leave the Capitol under escort by Department of Public Safety troopers\n\nOne of the most defiant Democrats has been Rep. Nicole Collier of Fort Worth. She refused to sign the paperwork authorizing DPS monitoring and instead stayed inside the chamber for more than 30 hours, even sleeping overnight on the floor.\n\nHer stand drew supporters to the Capitol Tuesday evening, but the crowd was evacuated when someone posted a threat on social media urging others to 'go to the Capitol and shoot and kill those who will not allow lawmakers to leave,' according to local outlet KVUE.\n\nNicole Collier, of Fort Worth, has refused to sign the paperwork authorizing DPS monitoring and instead stayed inside the chamber for more than 30 hours\n\n'For the safety of those at the Texas State Capitol, and out of an abundance of caution, the Texas Department of Public Safety evacuated the public from the Capitol building around 6:30 this evening,' DPS announced. 'It will remain closed to the public for the remainder of the day.'\n\nMeanwhile, support for Collier mounted, with the Fort Worth representative receiving a call from former vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nCollier shared on X that Harris told her: 'You are among those that history will reveal was among the heroes of this moment, so you just stay strong.'\n\nThis happened! pic.twitter.com/u8lluEWW07\n— Nicole Collier (@NicoleCollier95) August 20, 2025\n\nLaw enforcement stand watch during a House meeting in the State Capitol on August 20 in Austin, Texas, to ensure Democrats votes on new congressional maps.\n\nCollier has also filed a lawsuit against Texas, alleging 'illegal restraint by the government' for not being allowed to leave.\n\n'I refuse to comply with this unreasonable, un-American and unnecessary request,' Collier told CBS News.\n\nBy Wednesday, the Texas House was voting on amendments to the new maps, with a final vote expected later in the day. \n\nMeanwhile, California governor Gavin Newsom has promised to redraw congressional districts in his state in response, setting up a redistricting arms race between the nation's two most populous states.\n\nRepublicansDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nBrutal warning to Texas Democrats as troopers shadow every move to ensure vote... handing seats to Republicans\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Tensions are at a tipping point in Texas with troopers shadowing lawmakers and threats to kill over divisive vote to hand more seats to the GOP.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15018417/Texas-Democrats-arrest-redistricting-republicans.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/19/101404751-0-image-m-22_1755714393747.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 20:21:40","author":"Editor,Maryann Martinez","authors":["Editor","Maryann Martinez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.625},{"id":352691268,"title":"Revealed: The top reason why precious local businesses are being forced to shut up shop - and it's NOT the cost of living","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIoan Gruffudd dealt new blow in bitter divorce battle as he attempts to make his restraining order against ex-wife Alice Evans permanent\n\n'Perfect family' obliterated by quadruple murder-suicide at stunning New Hampshire home... with confused orphan toddler found near bodies\n\nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nCareful, William...

Pictured: File photo \n\nA well-placed viral trend worked well for M&S this year, for instance, she said, who brought out its viral strawberries and cream sandwich (pictured) to celebrate this year's Wimbledon tennis tournament\n\nEXCLUSIVE Locals say 'ghost town' High Street with 50 stores closed is so dead 'even the £1 shop is shut' \nA quarter, meanwhile, are desperately searching for ways to cut energy costs behind the scenes. \nMs Fleming said the solution for embattled shopkeepers could be to move more of their attention online in a 'bricks and clicks' hybrid approach. \nIt worked well for M&S this year, for instance, she said, who brought out its viral strawberries and cream sandwich to celebrate this year's Wimbledon tennis tournament. \nA well-placed video that happens to go viral could work wonders - more than 55 per cent of British internet users, or around 30million people, watch at least one every day. \nThe crunch time to catch shoppers looking to splash the cash on Black Friday, Cyber Monday or for Christmas is to plant the seed by teasing offers around early November, she said. \n'The narrative is really clear though', Ms Fleming continued: 'Many Brits really care about small businesses.' \nIn fact, as many as a quarter of UK customers surveyed said they would go out of their way to pay cash to a small business, just to help them avoid transaction fees. \nBut it may not be quite that easy to throw our favourite local shops a lifeline. \n\n'The narrative is really clear though', Ms Fleming continued: 'Many Brits really care about small businesses'. Pictured: File photo \n\nHer forecast was grim: 'Inflation, energy costs, and recessionary pressures are reshaping not just the high street, but the very way UK businesses operate'. Pictured: File photo \n\n Our town is losing its identity... it is packed with US candy stores - our heritage is disappearing \n'Ultimately at the same time, [shoppers] also face the increased cost of living and rising debt', Ms Fleming said. \nThe average British consumer has an eye-watering more than £12,000 in debt, NerdWallet UK showed. \nHer forecast was grim: 'Inflation, energy costs, and recessionary pressures are reshaping not just the high street, but the very way UK businesses operate. \n'Without targeted support, many smaller, family-run shops, cafés, and pubs may not survive: leaving the high street stripped of both local stores and the banks that once defined them.' \nAcross both massive household name firms and smaller independent businesses, the country's favourite shopping spots are feeling the pinch. \nRiver Island recently joined the list of brands looking to cut down its national network under sweeping plans which could put thousands of jobs on the line. \nThe embattled retailer has unveiled a radical restructuring plan in a bid to reverse recent losses due to a slump in trading.\nBosses blamed the closures on the 'migration of shoppers from the High Street to online' and higher costs to run stores.\n\nRiver Island (pictured, file photo) recently joined the list of brands looking to cut down its national network under sweeping plans which could put thousands of jobs on the line \n\nMeanwhile, the Original Factory Shop (pictured, file photo), which sells everything from shoes and garden benches to perfume and kitchen roll, has also announced a number of store closures in recent months \n\nThe family-owned retailer confirmed it is proposing to close 33 of its 230 stores by January next year as a result.\nA further 71 stores are also at risk depending on talks with landlords in order to secure improved rental deals.\nMeanwhile, the Original Factory Shop, which sells everything from shoes and garden benches to perfume and kitchen roll, has also announced a number of store closures in recent months.\nIt is a fresh blow to shoppers wanting to buy their everyday items in person in shops rather than online.\nThe retail sector is being hammered by higher wages and employer national insurance contributions announced, resulting in a large number of job losses and even more empty shops on Britain's ailing high streets. \nMeanwhile, some of what are supposed to be our country's best tourist destinations are struggling just as much to keep smaller business booming. \nMore than two million visitors make a pilgrimage to Stratford-upon Avon every year as they pay homage to the birth place of the most celebrated playwright in history.\nThe medieval market town is beautifully adorned with quaint gift shops and cobblestoned streets, and surrounded by the smell of freshly made fudge.\n\nMeanwhile, some of what are supposed to be our country's best tourist destinations are struggling just as much to keep smaller business booming.

They appear to hate the idea that Americans can enjoy their communities,” said Vance, referring to them as “crazy protesters.”\n\nWithout evidence, Miller suggested that the protesters were “not part of the city.”\n\nVance claimed on several occasions that Union Station had been taken over by “drug addicts,” “vagrants,” as well as the “chronically homeless.”\n\n“We have changed so much in nine days, and I thought it important to highlight how great of a space this could be, how easy it could be to actually enjoy something like Union Station if you just had politicians who stopped prioritizing violent criminals over the public citizens who deserve public safety in their own communities,” said Vance. \n\nVance’s earlier interaction with the troops in Union Station initially seemed as awkward as his campaign stop to a southern doughnut shop last summer.\n\nThe then-senator went viral during the 2024 presidential campaign when he seemed to have a hard time interacting with workers at Holt's Sweet Shop in Georgia last August.\n\nAs Vance thanked a woman behind the counter for allowing them pop in, she told him, “I don't want to be on film.” \n\n“She doesn't wanna be on film, guys, so just cut her out of anything,” Vance told his entourage. \n\nVance then looked at the doughnut display before saying, \"I'm JD Vance, I'm running for vice president, good to see you.\"\n\n“Okay,” the woman said, seemingly unimpressed.\n\nThen he seemed to be unable to pick out a variety of pastries for his entourage.\n\n“We’re gonna do two dozen. Just a random assortment of stuff here,” he continues while browsing the donuts in the display cases.\n\n“Everything. A lot of glazed here. Sprinkle stuff. A lot of cinnamon rolls. Just whatever makes sense,” Vance said.\n\nAs the worker fills up his box of donuts, Vance struggled to make small talk by asking workers behind the counter how long they had been working there.\n\nHe asked one worker how long the place had been around, and was told it had been in business for four years.\n\n“About four years? Okay,” Vance said. “Well, we selected this place. I didn’t know if it had been here for 20 years or four years. You never know.”","summary":"Veep was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Stephen Miller, who promised additional resources to DC crime crackdown while calling protesters ‘stupid white hippies’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-national-guard-dc-b2811259.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/19/09/SEI262760743.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/IqMPyppn-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 20:15:44","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":352682580,"title":"Moment JD Vance and Pete Hegseth savagely heckled by 'stupid white hippie' protestors calling them 'Nazis'","text":"A trio of Trump officials - Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller - got heckled Wednesday at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station as they tried to serve National Guard members hamburgers. \n\nVance made the unscheduled trip to the Amtrak hub's Shake Shack, a move that immediately attracted 'free D.C.' and also some 'free Palestine' protesters. \n\nOne man saw the group and yelled, 'f*** you Pete, f***ing Nazi,' while another joined in by screaming, 'get the f*** out of my city,' videos from the scene showed. \n\nAnother demonstrator posted himself yelling toward Vance: 'Oh look, it's couch f***er. You gonna f*** a couch buddy? Go f*** a couch, go back to Ohio little p**** boy.' \n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on August 11 that he was deploying the National Guard to the capital and federalizing the District's police force, complaining about the city's high crime rate. \n\nFor days, members of the National Guard have been parked outside Union Station - the main train station in Washington, known more for its food court than being an epicenter of violence. Throughout the city, more than 550 arrests have been made since the beginning of the crackdown. \n\n'We wanted to bring you guys some burgers. We appreciate everything you've been doing,' Vance told the troops. 'You guys bust your ass all day and we give you a hamburger. Not a fair trade, but we're grateful for everything you guys do.' \n\nAs Vance, Hegseth and Miller mingled with the military members, the protesting was audible. \n\n'So we're going to ignore these stupid white hippies that all need to go home and take a nap because they're all over 90 years old,' huffed Miller as the trio tried to conduct a Q&A with journalists on the scene. \n\nThe vice president told reporters that D.C. has seen a dip in crime 'because these guys are busting their ass.' \n\n'You can actually bring law and order to communities you've just gotta have the political willpower to do it,' Vance said. 'And I think you hear these guys outside here screaming at us.' \n\n'Of course these are a bunch of crazy protesters, but I'll tell you, a couple of years ago when I brought my kids here, they were being screamed at by violent vagrants and it was scaring the hell out of my kids,' the VP continued. \n\n'And one of the things that we've done already in Union Station in just nine days is we've made it a place where people can walk around safely, they can bring their kids again, they can see this beautiful monument, the architecture, they can have a meal with their friends and loved ones,' Vance added. 'Because we've brought some law and order back to Washington, D.C.' \n\nVance was asked why the troops were deployed to areas frequented by tourists instead of neighborhoods in D.C. that see the highest instances of violent crime.\n\n'Well, if you've ever been to Union Station in the last few years with your family you know the crime is actually extremely high right here in Union Station,' Vance responded. \n\n'You have vagrants, you have drug addicts, you have the chronically homeless, you have the mentally ill who harass, who threaten violence, who attack families and they've done it for far too long,' he added. \n\nVance expressed disbelief that residents of Washington, D.C. were against the Guard's deployment and the federal takeover of D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. \n\n'I'm highly skeptical that a majority of D.C. residents don't want their city to have better public safety and more reasonable safety standards within Washington, D.C.,' Vance replied. 'I don't know what poll you're talking about. Maybe the same poll that said Kamala Harris would win the popular vote by 10 points.' \n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll released earlier Wednesday found that 69 percent of D.C. residents 'strongly oppose' Trump federalizing the police force and bringing in National Guard troops. Another 10 percent somewhat opposed the move. \n\nJust 9 percent of Washingtonians strongly supported Trump's order, with another 8 percent who said they somewhat supported it. \n\n'We hear these people outside screaming \"Free D.C.\" Let's free D.C. from lawlessness, let's free Washington, D.C. from one of the highest murder rates in the entire world. Let's free Washington, D.C., so young families can walk around and feel safe and secure. That's what we're trying to free D.C. from,' Vance also said. \n\n'And as Stephen said,' Vance continued, referencing Miller. 'It's kind of bizarre that we have a bunch of old, primarily white people who are out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they've never felt danger in their entire lives.","summary":"A trio of Trump officials - Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller -  got heckled at D.C.'s Union Station amid the federal takeover.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15018751/jd-vance-pete-hegseth-stephen-miller-heckled-union-station.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/19/101405611-0-image-a-10_1755714441409.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/12/7811744304932762430/1024x576_MP4_7811744304932762430.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 19:44:06","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.13},{"id":352691270,"title":"Iconic James Bond star says he will consider RETURNING for new 007 film... as role is still up for grabs","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIoan Gruffudd dealt new blow in bitter divorce battle as he attempts to make his restraining order against ex-wife Alice Evans permanent\n\n'Perfect family' obliterated by quadruple murder-suicide at stunning New Hampshire home... with confused orphan toddler found near bodies\n\nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nCareful, William...

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON, US SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:20:29 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:20:34 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nThe role of James Bond is still up for grabs, but a familiar face may now be open to returning to the franchise.\nPierce Brosnan, who portrayed the spy in four films, has revealed he would consider reprising his role - depending on what director Denis Villeneuve has in store for the British secret agent. \nIn an interview with Radio Times, Pierce, 72, was asked if he would 'do Bond again - is it time for a senior citizen 007?'\n'My wife Keely [Shaye Smith] and I have been listening to the drumbeat of expectation of who’s going to be the next James Bond,' the Irish actor replied.\n'There are many great candidates out there, and I’m sure they’re going to make it a spectacle of delight. I don’t think anyone wants to see a craggy, 72-year-old Bond, but if [next 007 director Denis] Villeneuve had something up his sleeve I would look at it in a heartbeat.\n'Why not? It’s great entertainment. It could be lots of laughs. Bald caps, prosthetics… who knows?'\n\nJames Bond icon Pierce Brosnan has revealed he would return to the franchise if director Denis Villeneuve 'had something up his sleeve'; pictured March\n\nBrosnan portrayed the British spy in four films, including 1995's GoldenEye (pictured)\nPierce portrayed the iconic spy on the big screen in 1995's GoldenEye, 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, 1999's The World Is Not Enough, and 2002's Die Another Day.\n'I wish them well,' Pierce said of the next film in an interview with SAGA earlier this month. 'I'm so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.\n\n Former James Bond Pierce Brosnan joins co-star Helen Mirren's calls to ensure new 007 is male \n'I adore the world of James Bond. It's been very good to me. It’s the gift that keeps giving.\n'And I'm just a member of the audience now, sitting back, saying: \"Show us what you’re going to do.\"' \nThe role has been vacant ever since Daniel Craig, the latest 007, departed in 2021. \nAlready a star before playing Bond for the first time in 2005 blockbuster Casino Royale, Daniel amassed a reported $100million from his six outings as the secret agent.\nNow actor Aaron Taylor Johnson has emerged as the man most likely to replace Daniel Craig.\nTaylor Johnson has previously played it cool when asked about the possibility of him becoming Bond, telling Esquire: 'It's not really for me to stay anything.'\n\nPierce, pictured 1997 as the spy, joked he didn't think 'anyone wants to see a craggy, 72-year-old Bond'\n\nIn a recent interview with SAGA, Pierce - pictured in a publicity still for Tomorrow Never Dies - said the James Bond universe has been 'very good to me' \n\nThe search for the next 007 has been underway following Daniel Craig's departure from the franchise in 2021; pictured 2012 in Skyfall\n\nThe next James Bond film is set to be directed by Denis Villeneuve\nShould he be named as Bond, the actor will be working with Steven Knight, who has signed up to write the latest James Bond movie, Amazon MGM Studios confirmed in July.\nThe British screenwriter is perhaps best known as the creator of the hugely popular BBC crime drama Peaky Blinders starring Cillian Murphy.\nAnd now he's set to lend his talents to the long-running spy franchise by drafting the script for the newest 007 film, with Knight revealing that it has always been on his 'bucket list'.\nThe latest Bond film is currently in development and is to be helmed by Dune director Denis Villeneuve, with Amazon MGM Studios overseeing the project after longtime producer Barbara Broccoli gave up creative control.\nMeanwhile, Amy Pascal and David Heyman are on board to produce the movie via Pascal Pictures and Heyday Films respectively, while Tanya Lapointe will serve as executive producer.\nPierce BrosnanJames Bond\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nIconic James Bond star says he will consider RETURNING for new 007 film... as role is still up for grabs\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 13\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy EVE BUCKLAND, US SHOWBUSINESS DEPUTY EDITOR \n Published:20:08 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:20:12 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nThe controversial reboot of Sharon Stone's 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct will be 'anti-woke' as the film's writer seeks to hit back at modern day 'political correctness'\nJoe Eszterhas, 80, who also penned Flashdance and Showgirls, recently revealed he had been paid $4million by Amazon MGM Studios to pen the new script and hoped Stone would co-star in the film - days before the actress slammed the project.\nEszterhas told The Wrap: 'It means that dialogue-wise she will be open about her sexuality, character-wise she will be raunchy at times, funny, iconoclastic and all of those things.\n'I can’t talk very much about the storyline at this point because much of it isn’t formed yet. It begins in 2025. The Catherine Trammel character I will write and I hope Sharon [Stone] agrees to do the picture because I thought she was brilliant the first time out.\n'In my reboot she is not the star of the picture but she is the main co-star of the picture. It’s about the serial killers. It’s about copycats. There’s a demonic element to it that I think will be spooky.'\nHe added that a 'segment of the population has had it with woke culture', saying: 'The absurdities come when a woman who is sexual and open about her sexuality, you know, the culture that that I grew up in would describe that woman as a nymphomaniac. If a man did the same thing he would be a stud.'\n\nThe controversial reboot of Sharon Stone 's 1 992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct will be 'anti-woke' as the film's writer seeks to hit back at modern day 'political correctness' - Stone pictured as femme fatale Catherine Tramell\n\nJoe Eszterhas, 80, who also penned Flashdance and Showgirls, recently revealed he had been paid $4million by Amazon MGM Studios to pen the new script and hoped Stone would co-star in the film - days before the actress slammed the project \nThe writer's comments last month came weeks before Stone, 67, lambasted the reboot during a chat on The Today Show this week. \nShe said: 'It goes the way the one that I was in. I would just say, ‘\"Why do you do it?’ Go ahead, but good f*****g luck.”'\n'I’m at that stage in my life where I already retired once. And I already died a couple times. I’m like, what are you going to do? Kill me again? Go ahead.'\nStone reprised her role as femme fatale Catherine Trammel in panned 2006 sequel, Basic Instinct 2.\nBasic Instinct first hit screens in 1992 and sees Detective Nick (Michael Douglas) investigate the brutal murder of Johnny Boz (Bill Cable).\nThe blockbuster follows the police officer, who points suspicion towards Tramell, the victim's girlfriend.\nCatherine manages to seduce Nick into falling in love with her.\nBasic Instinct features a well-known scene where Catherine is being quizzed by police.\n\nThe steamy film starring Michael Douglas and Stone was released in 1992 \n\nEszterhas told The Wrap : 'It means that dialogue-wise she will be open about her sexuality, character-wise she will be raunchy at times, funny, iconoclastic and all of those things'\nAmid the bombardment of questions, she distracts them when she uncrosses then recrosses her legs, leaving the men flustered seeing as she was underwear-free at the time.\nLast year Sharon said that the iconic and controversial interrogation scene now seems 'very ordinary' compared to raunchy present-day films.\nAppearing at the Taormina Film Festival, Sharon said - per Deadline -that while the scene was considered X-rated at the time, nowadays it would have lost its shock factor.\nShe said:'[at the time] it seemed like a scandal, and now it seems very, very ordinary.\n'I think that now that women are writing, directing, producing, filming and more and more a part of filmmaking, films are less about men writing films about their fantasies of the way women are\n'And actresses are less asked to portray the male fantasy, and then critics are less asked to tell us if we fulfilled the male fantasy or not. It’s more, are we fulfilling the human condition?'\nShe previously told The Guardian the film ruined her image, saying: 'They said I was just like the character, like, somehow, they found someone who was just like that, and she slipped into the clothes, and it was magically recorded on film.\n\nThe writer's comments last month came weeks before Stone, 67, lambasted the reboot during a chat on The Today Show. She said: 'It goes the way the one that I was in. I would just say, ‘\"Why do you do it?’ Go ahead, but good f*****g luck.”' - pictured 2009 with Douglas \n\n 'Then, as it played everywhere on the globe for the next 20 years, people started to go, \"Do you think this really has anything to do with the fact that we thought we saw up her skirt?\" I think maybe it's actually a pretty good performance.\"\n'So it went from me being nominated for a Golden Globe and people laughing when they called my name in the room to people giving me standing ovations and making me the woman of the year...\n'And then I got nothing. I never got any more parts. Why? I really wish you could tell me,\" she said. \"Sometimes I think it was because I was too good.'\nSharon Stone\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBasic Instinct writer promised 'anti-woke' reboot days before Sharon Stone launched rant at project\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

She just hands it off,” Greene said. “And then I remember one time on oversight, she called one of her staff over, and she whispered something in their ear, and they ran off, and then they came back with this big white fluffy pillow that they put behind her back.”\n\nGreene and Crockett have often clashed publicly. During a House Oversight Committee hearing, Greene mocked Crockett’s false eyelashes, and Crockett made fun of Greene’s physique.\n\nLast May, Crockett moved to trademark the phrase she used to describe Greene: “bleach-blonde bad-built butch body.” Crockett said there was allegedly a “demand” for the merchandise with the phrase, and her campaign began selling T-shirts with the slogan to raise money.\n\n“So, she claims to be, you know, from her people. She puts on this image that she understands the black American struggle, but let’s face it, the girl went to private school. I don’t know what college and law school she went to,” Greene said.\n\n“She’s a complete fake. Yeah. She’s as fake as her eyelashes. She’s as fake as her hair. She’s as fake as her fingernails. And she is such a massive fraud,” Greene said.\n\nCrockett responded to Greene on X, comparing herself to former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama, who have received similar critiques.\n\n“It is funny that [Make America Great Again] cultist want to challenge my blackness because of my education,” Crockett wrote. “Y’all are a joke. Walk a day in my shoes where your white supremacist friends send me hateful emails, death threats, [direct messages], & posts, and then you can tell me if I’m truly living the black experience in this country, UNTIL then mind your business.”\n\n“ALSO ‘being black’ has nothing to do with education… (BUT for the record, if it did, just know that the MOST educated demographic in THIS country is BLACK WOMEN so stop pretending like we are inferior in ANY WAY!)” Crockett wrote.\n\nCrockett is among the Texas Democratic House members who stand to lose her district to a redrawn congressional map. Texas’s map, backed by President Donald Trump, aims to win five more seats for the Republican Party. \n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Crockett’s office for comment.","summary":"Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:19:20 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:20:08 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nSam Faiers has sparked backlash on social media for sharing 'dangerous' medical advice with her sister Billie, after she opened up about her son Arthur's new medical issue on their new ITV2 show.\nThe former TOWIE star is appearing alongside her sibling in their reality show Sister Act, and in Tuesday's episode, Sam, 34, raised eyebrows with a suggestion for her nephew Arthur, eight.\nIn a clip from the episode, which was shared on Instagram, Sam and Billie, 35, chatted about Arthur having his tonsils removed.\nBillie said: 'Arthur is getting his tonsils out. He had tonsillitis I'd say six times last year, and it made him so poorly.\n'When the doctor looked at them, straight away he said to me ''nah…'' he went ''they are really, really unhealthy tonsils.''\n'But tonsils serve no purpose in your body.'\n\nSam Faiers has sparked backlash on social media for sharing 'dangerous' medical advice with her sister Billie, after she opened up about her son Arthur's new medical issue\nSam, who releases her own brand of collagen, is quick to share her thoughts, and later admitted she's keen to follow methods around holistic health.\nHer first suggestion was to encourage her sister to get an intolerance test for Arthur before having the surgery.\nShe said: 'Everything in your body serves a purpose.\n'When you're not well and something inflames in your body or your tonsils are raised or your hair is falling out, or you've got a rash, it's because your body is telling you something isn't right.\n'So it's Arthur's body's way of telling him I've got an allergy, or you know, I've got a virus and that's his way.\n'So when they're out, how else is his body going to tell you that something is wrong?'\nAgreeing with her sister, Billie noted that she also felt her son may have some sort of intolerance, but fans were quick to criticise Sam's advice, and brand it 'dangerous' in the comments.\nPosts included: 'She's no doctor and shouldn't be allowed to give advice thats dangerous;'\n'Sam who encourages children to not wear sunscreen and doubts effectiveness of nhs mammograms; Mrs Know It All.\n\nIn a clip from the episode, which was shared on Instagram, Sam chatted with her sister about her son Arthur having his tonsils removed, suggesting he should have an allergy test first\n\nFans were quick to criticise Sam's advice for her sister, and brand it 'dangerous and uneducated' in the comments\n\n Billie Shepherd reveals devastating Lyme disease diagnosis that left her bed bound \n'Don't ever mess about waiting for tonsils out mine was left when I was you by 17 rushed into hospital because it made me soo ill had swollen all over from leaking I've had fibromyalgia for 15 years nothing can help and now servere arthritis all over from sport, pus, single parent, disabled daughter.\n'I wish I could dream everything be OK with positivity or a cream or holistic but life not like that.'\nLast month Sam faced huge backlash for revealing she doesn't put sunscreen on her children in a controversial statement, where she claimed some SPF brands are 'harmful' and full of 'toxic ingredients'.\nIn recent months, doctors have been forced to speak out after videos claiming sun tan lotion contains chemicals that are 'more cancerous than the sun', have racked up tens of thousands of views on TikTok.\nAmong those peddling the information are influencers with thousands of followers, including Lauryn Goodman and Kelsey Parker.\nMost recently, Sam was branded 'irresponsible and naive' by a horrified skin doctor after admitting her three children don't wear sunscreen because she wrongly claimed many SPF brands are 'harmful'.\nDr Perry, who is the owner of skin clinics chain Cosmedics , claimed the reality star is 'misleading' fans into not using sunscreen on their children and it can 'double the risk of getting skin cancer' as they 'do not build up a tolerance to sun exposure'. \nSam revealed that she doesn't use suncream on her children by sharing a snap of her youngest son Edward, two, playing in the shade.\nShe wrote: 'So this is always a bit of a controversial one, but honestly, me and my whole family don't actually wear sunscreen.\n'Over the years, the kids have built up a really good tolerance to being in the sun. Of course if it's really hot and the sun feels too harsh I'll make sure we head into the shade... usually around lunchtime we'll go in, have something to eat and just avoid those peak hours.\n'I'm really careful about sunscreen in general, because a lot of them are actually pretty harmful and full of toxic ingredients.'\nSam then revealed the alternative way she makes sure her children stay safe in the sun as she added: 'If you do want to protect your kids, I think SPF swimwear is such a good and safer option.\n'But also, don't be afraid of the sun! Early in the morning or later in the afternoon when it's not as strong, I love letting the kids run around and soak it up, it's good for them.\n'That said, I do always bring a Tallow Zinc SPF with me when I go away, just in case. And hats or caps are a must! Especially for us ladies because no one wants extra sun damage (I've had my fair share over the years because I am such a sun lover!).'\nSam isn't the first celebrity to admit they don't use SPF on their children after Kelsey Parker, TV personality and widow of The Wanted singer Tom Parkewr, previously claimed that her children 'don't burn' and wrongly alleged SPF 'causes skin cancer'. \nDr Perry, who is the owner of skin clinics chain Cosmedics, claimed the reality star is 'misleading' fans into not using sunscreen on her children.\nHe told Daily Mail: 'I am absolutely horrified at Sam Faiers' comments to followers (2.5 million of them!) are both irresponsible and naive. \n'Children do not build up a tolerance to sun exposure, they are just storing up more sun damage for later on in life.'\nHe continued: 'It is a well-known fact that children if they get any degree of sunburn as a child it more than doubles their risk of getting skin cancer at a later date so that is completely false and misleading.\n\nLast month Sam faced huge backlash for revealing she doesn't put sunscreen on her children, before claiming some SPF brands are 'harmful' and full of 'toxic ingredients' \n'Children do NOT build up a tolerance to sun exposure. I would totally advocate the use of sun protective clothing as a alternative for those who do not tolerate suncream being regularly applied, especially for children regularly in and out of the water, but they will only cover certain areas so an SPF is still required.\n'It is misleading to say that children need to have sunlight in order to promote their health as they will absorb more than enough sunlight through day-to-day activities rather as an over exposure or potential sunburn on holidays.\n'The standards that still apply and are good guidance are that people apply SPF when out in particularly hot sun environments and do not take the risk of getting any sunburn and that involves wearing hats, appropriate clothing and avoiding hot times of the day for sunbathing.'\n'Remember that ANY tan or sunburn is creating damage to the skin so SPF should always be worn in the sun,' he concluded. \nIn response to the backlash, Sam posted on Instagram that she wasn't a medical expert, and she was simply sharing her own experience with SPF.\nShe wrote: 'Wow, I've received so many kind and supportive messages from my sunscreen post. Thank you.\n'I'd definitely recommend doing a little research into which tallow you'd like to use, there are lots of amazing options out there.'\n'PS: Just sharing my experience and tips (not an expert).'\n\nHOW TO STAY SAFE IN THE SUN\n\nTo stay sun safe, experts recommend people:\n\nSeek shade between 11am and 3pm, which is when the sun's rays are typically strongest\nWear at least SPF 30 sunscreen\nApply sunscreen 30 minutes, and again just before, UV exposure\nOpt for water-resistant sunscreen if necessary and reapply after swimming, sweating or using a towel \nCover up with protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses\nBe extra careful with babies and young children. Infants under six months should be kept out of direct sunlight\nDo not use sunbeds or sunlamps \nChecks moles and skin for any changes \nSource: NHS Choices \nTOWIESam FaiersKelsey ParkerInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSam Faiers is blasted for sharing 'dangerous and uneducated' advice with sister Billie over her son's medical issue - after facing backlash for saying her children don't wear sunscreen\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy T. ZELLER - DAILYMAIL.COM REPORTER \n Published:19:43 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:20:01 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nKanye West's second wife Bianca Censori seems to be dialing down the drama in her wardrobe as she leans into her stepmom duties.\nKnown for leaving little to the imagination — from her skimpy ensembles to the jaw-dropping birthday suit moment at this year’s Grammys — Bianca has long blurred the line between fashion and provocation, even sparking debates over public decency across Italy and Spain.\nBut earlier this month, after chaperoning three of Kanye's four kids with ex Kim Kardashian in a surprisingly modest look, the 30-year-old designer appeared to be taking a more covered-up approach.\nShe debuted what might be her most unexpected outfit yet on Wednesday, exiting a Los Angeles movie theater fully clad from head to toe. \nSwapping her usual flesh-flashing style, Bianca kept skin under wraps in an oversized trench coat and a newsy cap.\nShe didn't skimp on drama, though, strutting in thigh-high silver metallic boots that brought the sparkle back to her look.\n\nKanye West 's second wife Bianca Censori seems to be dialing down the drama in her wardrobe as she leans into her stepmom duties \n\nShe debuted what might be her most unexpected outfit yet on Wednesday, exiting a Los Angeles movie theater fully clad from head to toe\nEarlier in August, Bianca was spotted loading into a Cadillac Escalade with Kanye and Kim's daughter Chicago, seven; and their sons Saint, nine; and Psalm, six. \nMissing from action as was Kanye and Kim's eldest daughter North West, 12. \n\n Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori goes without a bra at family dining chain after seeing Weapons \nThe rapper, 48, reportedly pays 44-year-old reality star Kim $200K a month in child support as part of their 20/80 custody arrangement for the four kids they welcomed during their six-year marriage, which ended in 2021.\nThe movie theater outing comes on the heels of the explosive YouTube documentary In Whose Name?, filmed over six years by director and producer Nico Ballesteros, who was just 18 when he started following West while he was still married to Kardashian.\nIn the newly released teaser, Kardashian can be seen breaking down as she pleaded with West after he stopped taking his medication. \nIn shocking clips, he says he would rather 'be dead than be on medication' amid his bipolar diagnosis.\nEarlier this year, West claimed bipolar disorder was a misdiagnosis and said he has since been correctly diagnosed with autism, which he emphasized is not a mental illness.\nIt remains unclear whether Censori, who joined the Yeezy team in 2020 as an architect before starting a romance with West, will make an appearance in the documentary. \n\nEarlier this month, after chaperoning three of Kanye's four kids with ex Kim Kardashian in a surprisingly modest look, the 30-year-old designer appeared to be taking a more covered-up approach; (Kim, Kanye, North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm in 2020)\n\nBack in March, West seemed to fuel split speculation when he leaked a new song titled Bianca, in which he claimed she 'tried to get him committed'; (seen in February 2024)\nThe day after the documentary trailer dropped, Censori shared a rare glimpse of the 21-time Grammy winner during what appeared to be a steamy tropical getaway.\nTheir vacation comes on the heels of jaw-dropping split rumors earlier this year. \nBack in March, West seemed to fuel speculation himself when he leaked a new song titled Bianca, in which he claimed she 'tried to get him committed.'\nThe track is part of his upcoming album WW3, which has yet to be released, though DJ Akademiks — who recently sat down for a bombshell interview with West — shared a snippet online. \nLyrics uploaded to Genius seemed to confirm the swirling split rumors at the time.\nDespite the chatter, the couple appears to be going strong — either never actually split, or reunited after a brief separation.\nLast month, West slammed shocking allegations from his former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, who claims he engaged in kidnapping, battery, rape, false imprisonment, and sex trafficking between 2021 and 2023 in an amended complaint.\nA Yeezy spokesperson told DailyMail.com: 'We stand ready to annihilate Ms. Pisciotta's tall tales before a jury — an exoneration so inevitable that even she, lost in her fog of fantasy, must surely see it coming.'\nBut Pisciotta’s attorney, Lisa Bloom, fired back: 'Kanye himself has publicly admitted much of what she's claiming. Kanye's publicist is deafeningly silent on Kanye's own admissions, which will destroy him in court. We look forward to seeing him there, where he cannot hide behind a high-priced spin team.'\nDespite the legal firestorm, the hip-hop star — who still averages 60 million monthly listeners on Spotify — is moving ahead with his music, set to release his 11th studio album, Bully, on September 26. \nYe is next scheduled to perform live on November 29 in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nThe rocky moments in Kanye West and Bianca Censori's relationship\n\nIndecent Exposure\nEarlier this month, Kanye and Bianca walked the red carpet during the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. \nThe Heartless rapper wore an all-black ensemble while Censori wore a long, fuzzy black coat. \nHowever, at one point, she turned her back towards the cameras and dramatically let the outer piece fall to the floor. \nBianca wore a sheer, flesh-colored minidress and opted to not wear anything underneath - with social media users condemning the 'disturbing' look and one calling the action 'indecent exposure.' \nOthers expressed concern for the architect, with one penning: 'Can someone explain why this is cool?'\n'Because to me, it's giving exploitation, trafficking. It's so weird and he objectifies her in front of the world. Someone help her, jeez,' they added, while another shared, 'She's clearly looking stressed out.' \nHis commands to Censori moments before she removed the coat were revealed by lip reader Nicola Hicklin on TikTok. \nAt one point, Hicklin claimed that West told Bianca, 'You're making a scene now,' and she responded by nodding her head. \nThe lip reader added that the music artist also told her, ''Make a scene, I'll say it'll make so much sense.' \n\nFan recently condemned Bianca's 'disturbing' look at the Grammys, with one calling the action 'indecent exposure'\n\nBianca is no stranger to parading around in public in racy outfits since marrying the rapper; Pictured in 2024 in Paris, France\nKanye - who also goes by Ye - then said, 'Drop it behind you and then turn, I got you.' Censori replied with, 'Alright let's go.' \nBianca is no stranger to parading around in public in racy outfits since marrying the rapper. \nSome of her X-rated ensembles in the past included when she wore a nude bodysuit while clutching a purple pillow to her chest while in Italy with West in 2023. \nLast year she exposed her breasts in a completely see-through netted top as she made her way to the Melrose Tanning Company salon, opting not to wear a bra. \nShe also previously eschewed a top in favor of bandage-like halter suspenders that only covered her nipples. \nA source previously told DailyMail.com that Censori's father Leo had demanded that both his daughter and Kanye go to Australia to address his concerns over her racy looks.\nJust one month before, the rapper's ex Kim Kardashian requested that Bianca 'cover up' when around their four children. \n\nLast year Kanye shared a risqué snap of Bianca posing braless in a sheer Yeezy tank top and a very racy micro thong\nKanye claims 'dominion' over Bianca \nWest has claimed Bianca can't wear anything without his approval.\nAfter Bianca shocked the world when she attended the music awards completely naked under a sheer dress, exposing her breasts and genitals, Kanye lashed back at critics and claimed 'dominion' over his wife.\nThe stunt made global headlines and many of Kanye's followers were quick to accuse the rapper of being 'abusive' and 'controlling' while using his wife's body 'as clout'.\nAddressing the backlash amid a vile anti-Semitic, sexist and homophobic rant in February, Kanye claimed that he has 'dominion' over Bianca but insisted he would never force her to wear anything she didn't feel comfortable in.\nHe tweeted: 'I HAVE DOMINION OVER MY WIFE THIS AINT NO WOKE AS FEMINIST S**T SHES WITH A BILLIONAIRE WHY WOULD SHE LISTEN TO ANY OF YOU DUMB A** BROKE B*****S.\n'PEOPLE SAY THE RED CARPET LOOK WAS HER DECISION YES I DONT MAKE HER DO NOTHING SHE DOESNT WANT TO BUT SHE DEFINITELY WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT MY APPROVAL YOU STUPID A** WOKE PAWNS.'\n\nAfter Bianca shocked the world when she attended the music awards completely naked under a sheer dress, exposing her breasts and genitals, Kanye lashed back at critics and claimed 'dominion' over his wife\nHe carried on his rant in the early hours, penning: 'Anyone who called my wife’s Grammy look a stunt is dumb and laaaame yes youuuu.'\n'She been dressing naked for 2 years. Now all of a sudden it’s a stunt. Every single b***h on the planet wish they had her bravery body platform and access to money and a husband that supported they personal expression.\n'There are a lot of things that had to converge for this moment to happen.'\nSince Kanye married Bianca in 2022 fans have expressed concern over her wellbeing, with the Australian architect continuously seen parading around in various states of undress.\nA day later he doubled down on his 'dominion' claims as he launched into another anti-Semitic rant where he targeted Jewish women.\n'TO ALL JEWISH HUSBANDS COME GET YOUR B***H I JUST F****D THE SHIT OUT OF HER AND DONT WANNA HEAR HER YAPPING.'\nHe continued, writing, 'There's a sweet Jewish named Jill with the best taste that lives in New York sending love to you from me and my wife i am speaking on behalf of my wife since i have dominion over her which is quite different than the dynamic i've seen at every shabbat i've been to.'\n\nAddressing the backlash amid a vile anti-Semitic, sexist and homophobic rant in February, Kanye claimed that he has 'dominion' over Bianca but insisted he would never force her to wear anything she didn't feel comfortable in \n\nA day later he doubled down on his 'dominion' claims as he launched into another anti-Semitic rant where he targeted Jewish women \nBianca 'traumatized' by Kanye's vile rants\nEarlier this month it was reported that Bianca was left so ‘traumatized’ by Kanye's vile antisemitic diatribe that she is now refusing to continue shooting their new film.\nBianca is playing the lead in a fictional art film, partly shot in Japan and co-created by West, and their creative circle, with a focus on the female body as ‘something to showcase’.\nBut she is reportedly struggling to recover from his repulsive rampage on X which saw him post a slew of antisemitic, homophobic and sexist slurs, as well as using his Yeezy website to sell a $20 white T-shirt featuring a swastika.\nThe shocking three-day spree has left the fate of their $25 million film in jeopardy, with two producers on the verge of walking out, DailyMail.com can reveal.\n‘Bianca is deeply traumatised by Ye’s actions, and she does not align with these views at all,’ an insider said. ‘She is horrified by what he has done, as are so many people close to Ye.\n‘She is so put off by this that she is currently refusing to continue shooting.’\nThey said the film is ‘entirely funded’ by the couple.\nCensori, an architecture graduate, had been described as a ‘brilliant actress’ after taking on the lead in the all-female cast.\nDailyMail.com was previously told the production would deal with how ‘shame over being naked is not natural to humans’ and that ‘obscenity exists only in the mind.'\n\nEarlier this month it was reported that Bianca was left so ‘traumatized’ by Kanye's vile antisemitic diatribe that she is now refusing to continue shooting their new film\nShooting recently wrapped in Japan but was scheduled to continue at an undisclosed location. This is now on hold with its future ‘uncertain’ if Censori does not return.\n‘The situation is now at a standstill, as two producers involved in the project are on the cusp of quitting over his antisemitic rants,’ the source said. ‘With production paused over Bianca's refusal to continue, the future is uncertain.’\nWest made mention of the film on X hours after their headline-grabbing red carpet stunt at the Grammys which saw Censori turn her back to photographers, drop her fur coat and expose her naked body underneath a sheer nude dress.\n'My wife’s first red carpet opened a whole new world,' wrote the Grammy-winner. 'I keep staring at this photo like I was staring in admiration that night Thinking wow I am so lucky to have a wife that is so smart talented brave and hot.\n'She took a break from shooting her first film to make a movie in real life.'\nWest renewed his attack on the Jewish community last week, referring to himself as a Nazi, claiming he 'loved Hitler,' and insisting that he will never 'trust or work with Jewish people' again.\n'IM NEVER APOLOGIZING FOR MY JEWISH COMMENTS I CAN SAY WHATEVER THE F**K I WANNA SAY FOREVER WHERES MY F***ING APOLOGY FOR FREEZING MY ACCOUNTS SUCK MY D**K HOWS THAT FOR AN APOLOGY,' he wrote.\nHours later he promoted his ‘greatest performance art piece thus far' – a swastika T-shirt – during the Super Bowl.\nHis Yeezy site was swiftly suspended by its hosts Shopify, with Isla Fisher and David Schwimmer spearheading a growing number of celebrities condemning him.\nThe site closure was said to be a ‘blow’ for Censori as it had become a ‘key source of income for them both, and she does not know how to recover from this.’\n‘When he endorsed the sale of items bearing a swastika and the phrase “Hail Hitler” this crossed a line because his repulsive and hateful attack could have dangerous consequences,’ the source said.\nThe controversial artist, who recently claimed he was autistic after allegedly being misdiagnosed as bi-polar, unfurled a succession of shocking tweets over the weekend which included an array of anti-Semitic, homophobic and sexist slurs, as well as pornographic content, which saw his X account deactivated. \n\n‘Bianca is deeply traumatised by Ye’s actions, and she does not align with these views at all,’ an insider said. ‘She is horrified by what he has done, as are so many people close to Ye' \nLewd Act on a Boat In Italy \nThe pair are certainly no strangers to making global headlines.\nWest and Censori caused a firestorm in August 2023 when they appeared to engage in an intimate act while on a boat ride in Venice, Italy.\nThe pair were spotted enjoying an amorous moment on a water taxi as West exposed his bare buttocks in front of gawking tourists.\nImages of the couple showed the American rapper seated at the back of the river taxi while his wife placed her head in his lap.\nVenezia Turismo Motoscafi, the company that rented the boat to West and Censori, later confirmed to Daily Mail that the couple were 'no longer welcome' aboard their watercraft.\nIn a statement, the company condemned the pair's bawdy activity and confirmed the driver was 'completely unaware' what occurred on the boat.\n'On board, the driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities. If this had happened, he would have immediately disembarked and reported the transgressors to those in authority,' the company said.\n\nWest and Censori caused a firestorm in August 2023 when they appeared to engage in an intimate act while on a boat ride in Venice, Italy\n'In addition, there was a third person on board the taxi, who accompanied Mr and Mrs West, who obstructed the captain's view to the stern in any case.'\nThe third person was a woman who has been pictured chaperoning West and Censori during their Italian holiday.\nThe company went on to denounce the couple's explicit display, saying: 'We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behaviour.'\n'Mr West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company's boats.'\nMeanwhile critics said the bawdy display was 'disrespectful' to residents of the conservative Catholic nation. \nA month later, West and Censori were spotted strolling through Italy while the Aussie went topless, holding a purple cushion to cover her breasts. \n\nA body language expert previously said that it appears like Kanye is 'dominating and controlling' Bianca based on their demeanors; The two seen in 2023\nExpert claims Kanye is 'dominating and controlling' Bianca\nA body language expert previously said that it appears like Kanye is 'dominating and controlling' Bianca based on their demeanors - revealing that all the 'affection' has disappeared from their relationship.\nTheir over-the-top outfits and indecent behavior ignited fierce concern for Bianca's wellbeing among social media users - and even her friends.\nBody language expert Judi James has analyzed their interactions for DailyMail.com - warning that Bianca's 'wary glances' and 'blank' stares hint that she has a 'desire to stop' the outlandish acts.\nShe also noticed a 'lack of connection' between her and the rapper - and theorized that while they continue to put on a united front to the millions of people who are watching on, their relationship may be falling apart behind the scenes when the cameras aren't on them.\n'Either these two are creating some bizarre form of performance art in a bid to gain attention and publicity or this is Kanye doing what looks like an extreme version of what he has been accused of before - dominating his partner and controlling her wardrobe choices,' she said.\n\nLast year West was eviscerated by his own fans for sharing 'creepy' photos of Bianca on Instagram\nKanye slammed for posting 'creepy' pictures of Bianca wearing barely any clothes\nLast year West was eviscerated by his own fans for sharing 'creepy' photos of Bianca on Instagram.\nHe raised eyebrows by sharing three photos of Bianca to his 18.4M followers, with one captioned: 'No pants this year'.\nIn the images, Bianca was seen posing around the couple's home wearing an extremely revealing bra, G-string, leather corset, stockings and a fur stole that barely covered her modesty.\nFans were quick to express their distaste, with many urging Kanye to stop sharing explicit photos of Bianca for the sake of his children.\n'This is kind of creepy because she's your wife, and you're treating her like a human dominatrix doll... not it,' one wrote, as another begged: 'Stop prostituting your partner.'\n'At this point, you're turning a beautiful young woman into something you own and play with, not something you cherish,' yet another added.\nOthers claimed Kanye's posts contradicted his Christian values.\n'He preaches Christianity and then does things like this,' one disappointed follower wrote.\n\n'This is kind of creepy because she's your wife, and you're treating her like a human dominatrix doll... not it,' one wrote, as another begged: 'Stop prostituting your partner'\nBianca's father fears that West is turning the architect into 'a tacky naked trophy'\nIn 2024 it was reported that Bianca's convict father wanted a sit down and talk with Kanye over fears the rapper was pushing his daughter away from her family and turning her into a 'trashy commodity,' insiders have claimed.\nHis request came as the Yeezy designer was pictured wearing no underwear underneath a pair of sheer stockings while out to dinner with the controversial musician in Paris, France - a look that could land her in prison or be forced to pay a hefty fine due to France's indecency laws.\nInsiders have told DailyMail.com that Bianca's family is 'hurting' at watching their loved one being paraded around like a 'trophy pony' and have questioned how Kanye would feel in the future if a man was treating his daughters, North and Chicago, in the same way.\n'Bianca's father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,' said a source close to the Yeezy architect - whose father is the brother of a notorious gangland killer.\n\nIn 2024 it was reported that Bianca's convict father, Leo Censori, wanted a sit down and talk with Kanye over fears the rapper was turning her into a 'trashy commodity'\n'He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.\n'He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.'\nKanye has also been accused of 'shutting her out' from her family in Australia.\n'If this isn't bad enough, the man who is supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Censori's daughter is the same man that is shutting her out from her own family,' the insider continued.\n'Leo honestly wants to just sit Kanye down to let him know that he is hurting her family by turning his beloved daughter into a trashy-looking marketable commodity.'\nThey finished: 'No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn't love. That is control.'\n\nKanye has also been accused of 'shutting her out' from her family in Australia; Bianca seen with her sister Angelina \nKim Kardashian tells ex-husband Kanye to make Bianca COVER UP when she's around their children \nLast year, Kim warned Kanye to tell Bianca to ‘cover up’ and refrain from wearing her infamously-scandalous outfits around their children, insiders have claimed.\nKim, 44, is said to have an amicable relationship with Bianca – but is reportedly not a fan of her parading her risqué fashion in front of North, 11, Saint, nine, Chicago, seven and Psalm, five, whom she shares with the rapper.\n‘Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,’ a source told DailyMail.com exclusively. ‘She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.’\nUnlike Bianca's raunchy wardrobe, Kim was asked to change her outfits if Kanye felt she was showing too much skin, with the artist heavily influencing her fashion choices during their seven-year marriage.\n\nLast year, his ex-wife Kim Kardashian reportedly warned Kanye to tell Bianca to ‘cover up’ and refrain from wearing her infamously-scandalous outfits around their children; Kim and Kanye seen in 2019\n'Kanye did the same thing he is doing with Bianca to Kim throughout their marriage,' the source continued. ‘The difference is that when Kanye dressed Kim, he was respected as a person – as an artist.\n'Unfortunately, Kim knows what Bianca is going through – but she feels Bianca should have known what she was getting into.’\nThe billionaire SKIMS founder talked openly about Kanye’s influence over her fashion choices throughout their relationship.\nIn a 2018 interview with W Magazine, she said: 'I always thought I had really good style – until I met my husband, and he told me that I had the worst style.'\nAnd in an episode of Keeping Up with The Kardashians, she said: 'Kanye has always dressed me. In the early 2000s, he would literally just send me random emails with all these looks and what my style should be.'\nWhen Kim disagreed with her husband's advice, he told her: 'You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.'\nKanye previously criticized Kim’s SKIMS brand for being 'overly sexualized.’She also revealed that he disapproved of her 2019 Thierry Mugler Met Gala dress, branding her corset a ‘form of underwear’ the night before the event. \n\nKim was reportedly not a fan of her parading her risqué fashion in front of North, 11, Saint, nine, Chicago, seven and Psalm, five, whom she shares with the rapper \nBianca CensoriKanye WestKim Kardashian\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West's wife Bianca Censori debuts bizarre new look after taking on stepmom role to Kim Kardashian's kids\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

For the past eight years, Gavin Newsom has served as governor, and with his second term up, 2026 presents an opportunity for a fresh face to lead the state.\n\nThere's a large field running of Republicans and Democrats, which includes some well-known figures in the state, but many who voters are not familiar with.\n\nKatie Porter\n\nPorter is a former congresswoman from Orange County who served in Washington, D.C. from 2019 to 2025, leaving to run for Senate and losing in the primary to Adam Schiff.

Villaraigosa ran for governor back in 2018, the year Newsom was elected.\n\nXavier Becerra\n\nBecerra served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Biden -- the first Latino in that role. Becerra also served as California Attorney General from 2017 to 2021, and before that was in Congress.\n\nToni Atkins\n\nAtkins is a longtime California representative who served as the President Pro Tempore of the California State Senate from 2018 to 2024.

'As many as 15 million Americans will lose coverage. It's estimated there will be 51,000 preventable deaths a year.'\n\nThe Kelce brothers have not publicly responded to the campaign, which isn't a surprise, given their usual reluctance to rock the boat, politically. Their significant others, Kylie Kelce and Taylor Swift, have long established their opposition to the current White House regime.\n\nKylie, Jason's wife, told The New York Times in December that she does 'aggressively lean' to the left. Meanwhile Swift, Travis' pop-star girlfriend, has publicly opposed Trump in both of the last two elections.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has gone from praising Swift online in 2012 ('Taylor is terrific!') to predicting doom for her and Travis in September of 2023.\n\n'I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not,' he told the Daily Caller. 'Most likely not.'\n\nTrump grew angrier with Swift in February of 2024.\n\n'I signed and was responsible for the Music Modernization Act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists,' Trump wrote online. 'Joe Biden didn't do anything for Taylor, and never will. There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money.\n\n'Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can't stand me!'\n\nTrump has since described Swift as 'unusually beautiful' before declaring 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!' after she endorsed Kamala Harris in September of last year.\n\nOf course, Peter Chatzky's congressional run has nothing to do with Swift or the Kelces, for that matter. The candidate did not reference his son's famous employers at New Heights, nor the overwhelming success of the show's recent interview with Swift.\n\nStill, like Swift, Chatzky has been a thorn in Trump's side for several years.\n\nIn addition to running a small tech company, he previously served as mayor and deputy mayor of Briarcliff Manor, where he fought against Trump's plans for the Trump National Golf Club Westchester.\n\nAccording to Chatzky's website, the now-former mayor organized neighbors against the plans and prevented Trump's 'army of lawyers from steamrolling the village.'\n\nAs The New York Times later wrote of the battle in 1999: 'During negotiations, Mr. Trump has abandoned some of his more grandiose plans and scaled back both projects. For instance, he reduced the size of the proposed clubhouse at Briar Hall from 81,500 square feet to 39,400.'\n\nChatzky continued his attacks on Trump in his op-ed.\n\n'If we collectively call for bold, transformative policies, including universal healthcare, then we will demonstrate to Americans that we are serious about using the immense power of the federal government not to serve ourselves as Trump does, but to serve the people,' he wrote.","summary":"Jason and Travis Kelce could soon have a powerful ally on Capitol Hill, depending on the upcoming congressional race in New York's 17th district, which covers the lower Hudson Valley.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15018711/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift-Donald-Trump-Congress.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/19/101404829-0-image-m-46_1755714689734.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 18:42:34","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":352677306,"title":"Sydney Sweeney hits back at outrage surrounding oversexualized ads and insists all her moves are 'strategic'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe luxury life of migrant in taxpayer-funded hotel as he earns thousands from 'Silicon Valley-style' start-up business while enjoying Macbooks, Selfridges shopping and Louis Vuitton accessories\n\nIoan Gruffudd dealt new blow in bitter divorce battle as he attempts to make his restraining order against ex-wife Alice Evans permanent\n\nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nCareful, William...

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:18:58 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:19:32 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nSydney Sweeney is clapping back at critics who claim she's cashing in on an oversexualized image. \nThe 27-year-old Euphoria star has become one of the most in-demand faces in Hollywood, fronting blockbuster movies and TV shows while also lending her image to a dizzying number of campaigns. \nIn just the past year alone, the Fifty-Fifty Films founder has done ads for everything from Baskin Robbins' ice cream and Laneige lip balm to the Samsung Galaxy 25 Edge.\nBut while some fans have accused her of leaning too hard into suggestive marketing, Sweeney insisted a lot of thought goes into those racy ad campaigns.\n'I think it's important to have a finger on the pulse of what people are saying, because everything is a conversation with the audience,' the two-time Emmy nominee told The Wall Street Journal of navigating online feedback.\nOne of her most eyebrow-raising deals came with Dr. Squatch, which sold a limited-edition line of soap infused with her actual bathwater.\n\nSydney Sweeney is clapping back at critics who claim she's cashing in on an oversexualized image — insisting her racy ad campaigns are anything but accidental\nThe stunt dominated headlines and was torn apart all over social media, but Sweeney double downed on the decision.\n'It was mainly the girls making comments about it, which I thought was really interesting,' she said, seemingly unfazed. 'They all loved the idea of Jacob Elordi's bathwater.'\n\n Sydney Sweeney could rake in $10M from a deal to rescue Bud Light after trans fiasco tanked sales \nWhen asked if she's 'thinking strategically' while doing these provocative campaigns, the actress answered: 'Yes. Very.' \nThe performer declined to speak about her controversial American Eagle's fall denim campaign, featuring the tagline, 'Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.'\nThe ad was outrageously labeled 'Nazi propaganda' by some critics and slammed for promoting racial undertones, eugenics and white supremacy. \nSweeney has not publicly addressed the controversy. \nDuring her latest interview, the Sharp Objects alum reflected on how she prefers to take a hands-on approach to everything she signs on for.\n'I definitely have a hard time sitting on set in a chair,' she admitted. 'I just want to ask, What's the budget? What's our line item? Where can we make things run better?'\n\nIn just the past year, the Fifty-Fifty Films founder has done ads for Baskin Robbins' ice cream and Laneige lip balm to the Samsung Galaxy 25 Edge (seen above in her American Eagle ad)\nWhen pressed on whether she'll continue to collaborate with ex-fiancé Jonathan Davino behind-the-scenes after their split earlier this year, the star made it clear she wasn't interested in talking about her heartbreak.\n'I'm going to keep all of my personal stuff out of it,' she told the magazine.\nSweeney also touched back on her past comments, made in 2022, about not being to afford to pay her publicist, stylist and mortgage if she took six months off. \nLooking back, she says her comments were less about money and more about her nonstop work ethic.\n'What I was talking about is more that I didn't have time to take six months off,' she explained. 'I was so busy, and still, same. But I do that because I don't want to take six months off. I get anxiety thinking about just taking a few days off.'\nShe added that she always leaves space in her schedule for unexpected offers. 'But if I wanted to lock everything in, I could probably be booked for the next three or four years.'\nAnd despite her packed calendar, Sweeney insists she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nOne of her most eyebrow-raising deals came with Dr. Squatch, which sold a limited-edition line of soap infused with her actual bathwater; seen in a Dr. Squatch soap ad\n'Being on set is my happy place,' she said.\nDirector Paul Feig, who helmed The Housemaid, backed up her claim, praising her commitment even amid personal upheaval.\n'She loves to work. She was completely present emotionally, just up for anything, and really didn't bring any issues to set,' he said. 'And I know she was going through some things when this was going on—I mean, now everybody knows about her engagement falling apart and breaking off and all that... But she would never bring it to the set. I'd say, \"Hey, are you OK?\" and she'd go, 'I'm fine, I'm great!' but not defensively.' \nOver the past two years, her success has dramatically skyrocketed. \nAccording to WSJ, she was reportedly paid $65,000 for the film, Reality in 2023.\nA year later, she secured $2 million for her rom-com Anyone But You, alongside Glen Powell. \nBy the time she signed on to The Housemaid, which comes out on December 25, her asking price had risen to $7.5 million. \nSydney SweeneySamsungEuphoriaJacob Elordi\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSydney Sweeney hits back at outrage surrounding oversexualized ads and insists all her moves are 'strategic'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 74\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:18:41 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:19:06 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nKatie Price's response to her ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video has been revealed after she was left 'blindsided' by the drama.\nThe former cage fighter, 50, shared a clip on Instagram on Monday that showed the TV personality, 47, who at the time had been declared bankrupt, counting a wad of notes.\nIt's the latest in a string of events after Katie hit back at her ex Peter Andre after he shared a statement accusing her of 'baseless lies' over the past 16 years.\nOn Wednesday, Katie's friends told The Sun they were surprised at how calmly she had handled the situation and was 'taking legal advice.'\nThey told the publication: 'This isn’t the first time Kate’s ex husbands and partners have ganged up on her, but the last time it happened, it drove her over the edge and we were all seriously worried about her. This time around though, she is in a completely different place.\n'Her feeling is, if Alex Reid wants to create a drama to get himself some attention, then good for him.'\n\nKatie Price's response to her ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video has been revealed after she was left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nThe former cage fighter, 50, shared a clip to Instagram that showed the TV personality, 47, who at the time had been declared bankrupt, counting a wad of notes (pictured together in 2009)\nThe pal added: 'Instead she is doing the sensible thing, she has taken legal advice and is biding her time. She is aware that Alex has threatened to say more about her in the coming days and weeks, but she has been here before many times and is taking it in her stride.' \nKatie's representative had nothing to add when contacted by Daily Mail. \nIt comes after a friend of Alex's told The Sun that he decided to post the video online after repeatedly seeing four seemingly innocent words in a series of statements shared by Katie's team last week.\nThey went onto claim that Alex's work opportunities dried up in the wake of his split from Katie, and he's grown tired of seeing her flaunt a luxurious lifestyle while he lives 'month to month'. \nLast week, Katie hit back at her ex Peter Andre after he shared a statement accusing her of 'baseless lies' over the past 16 years.\nThe statement in question said: 'Kate is in a much better and clear headspace and is at peace with the situation. \n'This was in the past, and she doesn't feel the need to bring up tit for tat comments, but more importantly she's dealing with this the right way and it's now in her lawyers hands. Kate will no longer be gaslighted and bullied as she once was.'\nAlex's friend said he was 'crushed' when he read the repeated phrase that is ex 'Katie was at peace.'\n\nOn Wednesday, Katie's friends told The Sun they were surprised at how calmly she had handled the situation and was 'taking legal advice'\n\nThey said: 'Her feeling is, if Alex Reid wants to create a drama to get himself some attention, then good for him' \nThe source went onto claim that Alex has grown increasingly frustrated with Katie since their 2011 split, after she took a string of public swipes at him, and particularly his cross-dressing alter-ego Roxanne.\nAlex also reportedly grew irate at seeing Katie show off a £1700 YSL handbag after jetting back from Turkey following yet another facelift, as well as a Van Cleef and Arpels necklace, which retails for £14,000.\nIt's also alleged that Katie has not paid a penny of £175,000 in damages and legal costs Alex was awarded after he sued her for showing a sex tape of him on Big Brother spin-off show Bit On The Side without his consent.\nDaily Mail contacted representatives for Alex Reid and Katie Price for comment. \nThe video Alex shared, which is believed to have been filmed in 2020, shows Katie saying she is 'enjoying counting' the wads of money in front of her during a conversation with her daughter Princess Andre.\nThere is no suggestion that Katie didn't declare the cash. In the video she brags: 'There's loads here… I'm just sorting it out.'\nA representative for Katie Price told Daily Mail: 'This is a video that was shared with Katie’s Trustee in Bankruptcy several months ago and Katie has fully complied with the Trustee’s investigations into the same. \n'The cash featured did not belong to Katie and the property referred to was dealt with in the financial settlement proceedings arising out of Katie’s divorce from Peter Andre.\n'Katie's Trustee in Bankruptcy is aware of the property and has undoubtedly investigated whether the same ought to be comprised in the bankruptcy estate.'\nA source close to Peter also said: 'Peter has seen the video and is totally disgusted, even more so because his young daughter has been involved in it.'\nHis representatives added: 'Peter will be dealing with this with his lawyers.' \nAlongside the video, Alex said: 'For years, I've watched as stories — many false, exaggerated, or deliberately twisted — have been pushed out into the public. Fake news isn't just a headline, it destroys lives, reputations, and families.\n'This has been years in the making. Countless hours of collaboration, gathering evidence, and finding the strength to finally stand up and say: enough is enough.\n'I have stayed quiet long enough. Now is the time to speak. This isn't about gossip, this isn't about drama - this is about the truth. \n'The announcement I'm about to make will challenge the false narratives and shine a light where it has been needed for far too long. The time for speculation is over. The truth is about to come out.'\n\nAnd a friend of Alex said he decided to post the video online after repeatedly seeing four seemingly innocent words in a string of statements shared by Katie's team last week\n\nElsewhere, Katie and ex-husband Peter Andre are currently locked in a bitter feud after he hit out at her 'baseless lies over the last 16 years' in a blistering statement on Thursday \nAs Alex shared the video on social media, Princess Andre took to Instagram to share a post telling her followers that she's 'got her sparkle back.'\nAfter receiving praise from viewers for her ITV2 documentary series, the influencer shared a video of herself gracing a catwalk in a blue bikini, a moment which in the show she admitted made her feel 'exposed.'\nThe post featured the text: 'To the girls who are getting their sparkle back.'\nShe captioned the post: 'Being so honest on the show wasn’t easy, but your love and support has meant the world to me. Thank you for watching and for all the kind messages.'\nIt comes after it was reported that Alex and Katie's third husband Kieran Hayler are teaming up and have consulted lawyers in a bid to block Katie from including them in a tell-all Sky documentary.\nThe three-part show, likely to release next year, is set to delve into the details of her fleeting flings, serious relationships and time in the spotlight.\nA source told The Mirror: 'They feel like they have been backed into a corner and have no choice. \n'They just want her to stop trashing them, and can’t believe she is being given a platform.'\nElsewhere, Katie and ex-husband Peter are currently locked in a bitter feud after he hit out at her 'baseless lies over the last 16 years' in a blistering statement on Thursday. \nKatie responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday.\nRumours of a 'rift' between Katie and their daughter Princess have been growing in recent weeks after Katie didn't attend Princess's 18th birthday party, or appear on the nepo baby's fly-on-the-wall ITV television series.\nKatie later claimed that it was her daughter's management who had told her not to appear on the show.\nIn a lengthy Instagram statement, Katie pleaded 'I'm trying to be the best I can' while noting she hasn't 'always been the best mother'.\nShe wrote: 'Saints and sinners. As we know, in this life we are thought of as Saints and Sinners. I know I will always be a Sinner. That's fair, I allowed myself to fail into reliance on drugs and alcohol. \n'At times I was not the mother I should have been while I struggled with mental illness. I have been at times a poor friend, an awful sibling, an an untrustworthy partner. I've self medicated, been unfaithful, damaged myself and those that I love.\n'I've had many reasons - I was sexually abused when younger; I've had relationships that have been coercive; and my mental health issues - but I don't want to make excuses.' \n\nKatie later responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday \nKatie continued: 'I've recognised my issues and worked to put them behind me. Sometimes I tried and failed, sometimes I succeeded. \n'I've pulled myself out of suicidal spiral because I love my children and want to be there for them.\n'I don't pretend to be perfect by any means - but I'm trying to be the best I can. Then there are the \"Saints\". Some are genuine and some have helped me.\n'But some Saints are not who they would have you believe they are. They have a carefully managed image which must be exhausting to maintain.\n'Some Saints are fake. They play the victim and to succeed in life they need a villain... or at least a Sinner. Without the Sinner they don't get to be the Saint...\n\n Katie Price releases defiant statement in response to Alex Reid's cash-counting video after unveiling new surgery - while 'disgusted' ex Peter Andre vows to call in lawyers over clip \n'As a Sinner - I sometimes get bored of these Saints. But maybe I should feel sorry for them, It must be such hard work having to pretend all the time.\n'Anyway, all you Sinners keep your heads up and keep trying to be better. All you Saints, it's ok not to be perfect xxx' \nPeter shared his side of the story on Thursday, explaining: 'For sixteen years, I have stayed silent in the face of repeated lies from my ex-wife and her family, out of respect for my children and loved ones, but staying silent has been incredibly frustrating. That ends today.\n'The latest comments about my children's welfare and living arrangements compel me to set the record straight. For well-documented reasons, and for their safety, Junior and Princess came into my care in 2018 and remained with me until they reached adulthood.\n'In 2019, the family courts issued a legally binding order to enforce this arrangement. I have never made this public before, out of respect for my children.' \n'In 2011 and 2015, publicly documented court cases found my ex-wife had made false claims. She was ordered to pay substantial damages and legal costs, and to apologise to me and my management. The same falsehoods are being repeated today.\n'Unfortunately, there are many more lies and baseless accusations I have yet to address. Those will now be dealt with in the coming months.'\nAlex ReidKatie PricePrincess Andre\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON, US SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:18:47 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:19:03 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison is breaking the world's expectations of a typical Hollywood actress. \nWhile it's generally expected that starlets attend premieres, parties, and be active on social media, that isn't the path Mikey is following. \nThe Oscar-winner, 26, has revealed she is not on social media and doesn't ever 'regret' skipping a party.\nIn a Vogue Italia interview, Mikey - who recently became the ninth youngest star to win the Academy Award for Best Actress - lamented on her inclination towards seclusion, as well as the pressure she feels to appease the world by embracing a more social lifestyle. \n'I'm extremely introverted, but I also have a big desire for adventure. It's a conflict I've always felt, but it's gotten worse lately,' she told the magazine.\nAs the interviewer shared their observations that the world has been divided amongst those who adore Mikey and those who are unaware of her, she shared: 'I feel like everything around me has changed, and I think that's increasing my need to withdraw into myself. \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison has revealed she prefers seclusion over parties in a new interview with Vogue Italia (pictured winning her Oscar in March)\n'It's as if I'm now aware of how I'm perceived. I'm not on social media, I never regret missing a party or a dinner, but it seems like society is forcing me to ask myself, \"Should I do it too much to be happy? To be fair?\" We pretend to be someone we're not to make others feel comfortable.'\n\n Demi Moore finally reveals how she really felt about losing the Oscar to Mikey Madison \nGrowing up, Mikey was shy and found solace in animals - so her interest in acting came as a surprise to her mother.\n'Having been a competitive horseback rider, I often went to horse shows. One day, coming home, I burst into tears; I felt like it wasn't where I was supposed to be anymore,' she told the publication. \n'I remember my mom, upon finding out I wanted to be an actress, asking me, \"So you want to go to community theater classes?\" She couldn't believe it. I was incredibly shy then, so much so that I wouldn't talk to anyone except animals. But all I could think about was acting. She said, \"Okay, that's a very intense emotional confession from you, let's give it a try.\" And I did.' \nThe future superstar was raised in Los Angeles - 'but not in Hollywood, in the Valley' - in a suburban neighborhood where she enjoyed climbing trees with her brother and finding snails. \n'My childhood was normal; no one in my family is in show business. My father is an artist and a chef trapped in the body of a psychologist, and so is my mother. She took me to over a hundred auditions, helping me memorize my lines,' she said. \nMikey has kept a relatively low-profile since earning her Oscar.\nWhile she did host an episode of Saturday Night Live in March (in which musical guest Morgan Wallen infamously walked off the stage at the end of the show), attend their afterparty as well as a couple of events for jewelry line Tiffany's, she does not seem to be a particularly active presence on the social circuit. \n\nShe won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in Anora\n\nWhile she attended the usual post-Oscar Vanity Fair party, she has kept a rather low-profile when it comes to the social scene\n\nMikey, however, has attended a couple of glamorous Tiffany events since her win (pictured April in New York)\n\nAnd she also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live, in which musical guest Morgan Wallen controversially walked off the stage at the end of the show\nMikey controversially beat out Demi Moore for the Oscar, with the Hollywood legend the favorite to win what would have been her first Academy Award. \nThe actress praised Demi in a interview with The Hollywood Reporter the morning after the Oscars, revealing she reached out to the Striptease star after her win. \n'I texted with Demi, who I adore. She’s one of the sweetest, kindest women I’ve ever met, and I’m so grateful that I was able to meet her and witness her brilliance and talent in person. I adore her and I can’t wait to see what she does next, what kind of characters she brings us. I think we’re all so ready and excited to see that,' she said. \nIn the months since the Academy Awards, she has been linked to several upcoming films, including a possible role in the sequel to The Social Network.\nShe has surprisingly even turned down an unknown role in an upcoming Star Wars film, according to Variety. \nHowever Mikey isn't going to appear in any film, with the star stressing the importance of acting in a movie she feels a gravitational 'pull' towards. \n\nAmong her social gatherings was an afterparty for her SNL episode \n\nMikey controversially beat out Hollywood legend Demi Moore for the Oscar\nShe told THR: 'I don’t know.

Some private sector jobs such as those in defence and aerospace can require access to security clearances as a pre-condition for employment.\n\nIt remains unclear whether all 37 individuals listed in the memo still held active clearances.\n\nGabbard said Trump ordered the revocations because the officials \"abused the public trust by politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards\".\n\n\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" Gabbard wrote on X. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\" \n\nThe memo did not lay out specific charges against specific individuals.\n\nThis is not the first time the Trump administration has revoked security clearances for intelligence officials. The administration has previously revoked clearances of Biden, his Vice-President Kamala Harris, and former lawmakers involved in investigations of the 6 January Capitol riot.\n\nIn recent weeks, Gabbard has led the charge against intelligence officials under former President Barack Obama who concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections, which Trump won. \n\nTrump and Gabbard have described the intelligence community's assessment as a \"treasonous conspiracy\" to undermine the president's electoral success. \n\nDemocrats have dismissed the moves as a political distraction, and accused the White House of deflecting attention from unpopular policies and Trump's alleged ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \n\n\"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\" a spokesman for Obama said last month.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78mj2m85pno","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e613/live/28df3b30-7de0-11f0-99e4-291d86ee4065.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 17:57:46","author":"Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu","authors":["Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":352661384,"title":"Peter Andre insists he just wants his daughter Princess 'to be happy' as he lauds her 'early success' with ITV show - amid his feud with her mother Katie Price","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe luxury life of migrant in taxpayer-funded hotel as he earns thousands from 'Silicon Valley-style' start-up business while enjoying Macbooks, Selfridges shopping and Louis Vuitton accessories\n\nMarco Pierre White Jr pleads guilty to burglary AGAIN: Troubled reality star stole £1,500 worth of Jellycats and 'caused £43k of damage to antiques store' in west London crime spree\n\nKatie Price responds to ex Alex Reid's cash-counting video as she reveals her next moves after being left 'blindsided' by the drama\n\nCareful, William...

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR and CHARLOTTE DEAN, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:18:24 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:18:56 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nPeter Andre has insisted he just wants his daughter Princess to be happy amid his public feud with her mother Katie Price.\nThe singer and TV personality, 52, shared a statement accusing his ex-wife, 47, of spreading 'baseless lies' about him in a bombshell admission last week.\nHowever at the heart of it all, Peter admitted he just wants his kids - namely Princess - who has just released her own BBC docu-series - to be happy.\nPeter proudly lauded his daughter's 'early success' but admitted that while it is all well and good, it is his child's well-being he is most concerned of.\nWriting in his column for new! magazine, he said: 'I'm extremely proud of Princess and her show. I think she's absolutely smashed it. She's come across just how she is and how we know her to be - funny, quirky and kind.\n'The response to The Princess Diaries has been phenomenal. But even though her early success is fantastic, all I really want is for her to be happy.\n\nPeter Andre has insisted he just wants his daughter Princess to be happy amid his public feud with her mother Katie Price \n\nThe singer and TV personality, 52, shared a statement accusing his ex-wife, 47, (pictured with Princess) of spreading 'baseless lies' about him in a bombshell admission last week\n'Hopefully, she can do season two, three, four - whatever she wants to do - and soar like an eagle because she's a great kid and I'm so proud of her.'\nPeter recently spoke about his daughter's foray into the TV world for the first time, admitting he was 'very strict' about what she could feature in her new show.\nShe was praised by viewers for her four-part show, where she offered insight into her 'chaotic' childhood as the daughter of the Mysterious Girl hitmaker and his ex.\nSpeaking to Daily Mail ahead of his new Channel 5 series The Sunshine Murders, Peter said he was wary of letting Princess appear on TV before she 'got to an age where she could do it herself'.\nThe father-of-five added that he's found it hard to 'let go' of his eldest daughter after she turned 18 earlier this year.\nHe said: 'I was very strict about what she wasn't allowed to, you know, I didn't want didn't really want her doing a lot of stuff before she got to the age that she can do it herself.\n'I'm really proud of her. I think she's a really sweet person and I really hope people see that of her and I just want her to shine and, you know, I want her to just go on and just become her own little true gem.\n'She's a great girl and I'm proud of her and I'm proud of Junior too. He's such a good, good kid.'\n\nPeter and his ex-wife Katie are currently locked in a bitter feud after he hit out at her 'baseless lies over the last 16 years' in a blistering statement on Thursday \n\nKatie later responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday \nPeter went onto share he's had to 'let go of the reins' as Princess reached adulthood, admitting he was a 'strict' parent during their upbringing.\nFollowing his statement last week, Peter and his wife Emily are now reportedly furious by Katie's 'disgusting' swipe at their children in a video shared by her ex-husband Alex Reid.\nIn the video, Katie makes reference to Peter's youngest children he shares with Dr Emily, in which she brands them 'irrelevant' in front if her then 13-year-old daughter Princess.\nThe video, believed to have been filmed in 2020, sees Katie telling her daughter: 'Your dad is going to have to pay the school fees because of my bankruptcy. Does he moan about it? What does Emily say? \n'It’s money that could be spent on her and her kids. They’re not going private, are they, they’re irrelevant. No one even knows who they are.'\nAnd now in the wake of the video's release, Peter is thought to be horrified by Katie's words about his kids, while Emily was left 'stunned', as a source said of the mother-of-five: 'It's a new low.'\nAn insider told The Sun: 'Of course the focus has been on the fact Katie is counting cash while claiming to be bankrupt, but Pete has been left horrified by what she said about his family in front of Princess.\n'She would only have been about 13 then - and her mum was talking like that about her own brother and sisters. It’s disgusting. Emily is stunned that anyone could speak about children like that. It's a new low.' \nThe source went on to say: 'Emily’s really hurt by the whole thing. She’s always been classy and taken the high road, but her protective, motherly instincts have taken over and she’s adamant she won’t let her kids be dragged down by Pete’s ex.'\nThe insider noted that the family do not want Princess, 18, to be pulled into anymore drama, adding that Katie, who claimed to have wanted a peaceful life 'isn’t leading by example.'\nDaily Mail have contacted Emily's representatives who declined to comment. \nKatie responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday.\nRumours of a 'rift' between Katie and their daughter Princess have been growing in recent weeks after Katie didn't attend Princess's 18th birthday party, or appear on the nepo baby's fly-on-the-wall ITV television series.\nKatie later claimed that it was her daughter's management who had told her not to appear on the show.\nIn a lengthy Instagram statement, Katie pleaded 'I'm trying to be the best I can' while noting she hasn't 'always been the best mother'.\nShe wrote: 'Saints and sinners. As we know, in this life we are thought of as Saints and Sinners. I know I will always be a Sinner. That's fair, I allowed myself to fail into reliance on drugs and alcohol. \n'At times I was not the mother I should have been while I struggled with mental illness. I have been at times a poor friend, an awful sibling, an an untrustworthy partner. I've self medicated, been unfaithful, damaged myself and those that I love.\n'I've had many reasons - I was sexually abused when younger; I've had relationships that have been coercive; and my mental health issues - but I don't want to make excuses.' \nKatie continued: 'I've recognised my issues and worked to put them behind me. Sometimes I tried and failed, sometimes I succeeded. \n'I've pulled myself out of suicidal spiral because I love my children and want to be there for them.\n'I don't pretend to be perfect by any means - but I'm trying to be the best I can. Then there are the \"Saints\". Some are genuine and some have helped me.\n\nFollowing his statement last week, Peter and his wife Emily are now reportedly furious by Katie's 'disgusting' swipe at their children in a video shared by her ex-husband Alex Reid \n'But some Saints are not who they would have you believe they are. They have a carefully managed image which must be exhausting to maintain.\n'Some Saints are fake. They play the victim and to succeed in life they need a villain... or at least a Sinner. Without the Sinner they don't get to be the Saint...\n'As a Sinner - I sometimes get bored of these Saints. But maybe I should feel sorry for them, It must be such hard work having to pretend all the time.\n'Anyway, all you Sinners keep your heads up and keep trying to be better. All you Saints, it's ok not to be perfect xxx' \nPeter shared his side of the story on Thursday, explaining: 'For sixteen years, I have stayed silent in the face of repeated lies from my ex-wife and her family, out of respect for my children and loved ones, but staying silent has been incredibly frustrating. That ends today.\n'The latest comments about my children's welfare and living arrangements compel me to set the record straight. For well-documented reasons, and for their safety, Junior and Princess came into my care in 2018 and remained with me until they reached adulthood.\n'In 2019, the family courts issued a legally binding order to enforce this arrangement. I have never made this public before, out of respect for my children.\n'In 2011 and 2015, publicly documented court cases found my ex-wife had made false claims. She was ordered to pay substantial damages and legal costs, and to apologise to me and my management. The same falsehoods are being repeated today.\n'Unfortunately, there are many more lies and baseless accusations I have yet to address. Those will now be dealt with in the coming months.'\nKatie PricePeter AndreITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPeter Andre insists he just wants his daughter Princess 'to be happy' as he lauds her 'early success' with ITV show - amid his feud with her mother Katie Price\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Texas, with the support of President Donald Trump, first announced plans to redraw its map to become more favorable to Republicans and thwart losses in the midterms, but Newsom has warned California could redraw its map to benefit Democrats in return.California Democrats' ability to do so may hinge on the outcome of a ballot measure Newsom announced last week that would allow a new map drafted by legislators to temporarily replace the boundaries drawn up by the state's independent redistricting committee following the 2020 census.If the ballot measure is successful, it could neutralize efforts from Texas Republicans. But if it fails, Republicans may be able to net several seats in not only Texas, but also other GOP states like Indiana and Missouri.What to KnowA new poll from Newsom's pollster, reported by Axios, suggests a majority of voters are prepared to support the ballot measure.The poll, conducted by David Binder, showed that 57 percent of California voters are in support of the proposal. Only 35 percent were opposed to it, while 8 percent remained undecided.Among Democrats, the ballot measure had 84 percent support, while only 13 percent opposed it. Among Republicans, 79 percent were opposed, the poll found, according to Axios.The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from August 10 to August 14, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.California remains a solidly blue state where Democrats handily outnumber Republicans. Former Vice President Kamala Harris carried it by 20 points last November, so Democrats are hopeful this ballot measure will fall on partisan lines. But the state has an independent redistricting community that was passed by voters and remains popular.A Politico poll released last week found that 64 percent of California voters support keeping the commission, while only 36 percent support returning redistricting authority to the state legislature.Newsom, who is viewed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has cast the ballot measure as a temporary measure, which would no longer be in effect after the 2030 census, which is only in response to Texas' redistricting efforts. It would not go into effect unless Texas or other Republican states first redraw their lines. Republicans, however, have described it as a power grab that violates the will of Californians.What People Are SayingDavid Binder wrote in the poll, per Axios: \"Voter trends on this measure closely mirror the presidential election results of November 2024, in which Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump in California by 58% to 38%. Poll results indicate that Proposition 50 will fall along similar partisan lines.\"Representative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican, wrote to X on Tuesday: \"Newsom is overthrowing the Redistricting Commission in order to make California 'a whole lot bluer.' To accomplish this, his proposal expressly overrides the entire State Constitution. Partisan gerrymandering will become the supreme law of the land.\"Governor Newsom wrote to X on Tuesday: \"Unlike Texas, we're not following @realDonaldTrump's orders to quietly try to redistrict our way out of losing the next election. In California, we're working transparently to respond if Texas enacts new maps — and we'll give the power to the people to make our final decision.\"What Happens NextVoters will make their decision about the redistricting plan in November. Both Democrats and Republicans will spend the coming months making their case to voters on whether the ballot measure should pass. Meanwhile, the redistricting war continues across the country, with Trump urging Texas Republicans to pass their plan \"ASAP.\"","summary":"The California ballot measure could have key implications for the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-redistricting-ballot-measure-poll-2116436","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2706235/california-governor-gavin-newsom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4a40e681fcf27d836dc37fa134223959","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 17:27:28","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":352698592,"title":"Several Texas Dems Spend Night In Chamber With Rep. Nicole Collier","text":"Source: Brandon Bell / Getty Texas State Rep. Nicole Collier has been confined to the state House chamber since Monday after refusing to sign an agreement that would put her under police surveillance. Several Texas Democrats joined Rep. Collier on Tuesday, ripping up their agreements and staying confined to the House. According to CNN, Democratic state Reps. Mihaela Plesa, Morales Shaw, Rhetta Bowers, Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, Gene Wu, and Salman Bhojani joined Collier on the floor overnight. They were among several Texas Democrats who left the state for 15 days to deny Texas Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new legislative map. On Monday, House Speaker Dustin Burrows issued a mandate requiring the Texas Democrats who left the state to agree to police surveillance if they wanted to leave the chamber. “Members who have not been present until today for whom arrest warrants were issued will be granted written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated DPS officer appointment under the rules of the House who will ensure your return on Wednesday at 10 a.m.,” Burrows said on Monday. Rep. Collier immediately rejected those terms and was essentially held as a political prisoner for the last two days. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts. My community is majority-minority, and they expect me to stand up for their representation. When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination,” Rep. Nicole Collier said in a statement. Several Texas Democrats held a news conference on Tuesday announcing they would join Collier in protesting the requirements set by Texas Republicans. “Yesterday, I left in custody and I came back in custody, because I stand with Nicole Collier and Gene Wu,” Rep. Penny Morales Shaw said during a news conference on Tuesday. “This is illegitimate, this is a wrongful use of power, and I will not condone it, and I don’t want to be a part of setting a very bad and low precedent for future legislators.” “Why would we be considered a flight risk if we walked in of our own volition?” Rep. Bowers during the news conference. “This is a blatant violation of our freedoms as Texans, as Americans and as duly elected officials.” The Texas redistricting saga began in July when President Donald Trump requested that Gov. Greg Abbott initiate a rare, mid-decade redistricting process to protect the GOP’s slim majority in the House. Gov. Abbott called a special legislative session under the guise of flood relief, but it was quickly apparent that redistricting was the priority for Texas Republicans. Texas Republicans revealed a new map that adds five House seats in districts Trump won by double digits. Rep. Nicole Collier and several other Texas Democrats left the state to force the special session to a close without a vote on the new map. Gov. Abbott and the Texas Republicans had the totally reasonable response of ordering the arrest of the Texas Democrats, filing a lawsuit to have Rep. Gene Wu removed from his seat, and requesting the FBI hunt down the fleeing Democrats. Just normal, completely not alarming things that happen in a functional democracy, you know? Gov. Abbott immediately called another special session last Friday, with a vote on the new map expected to take place on Wednesday. The resistance of Rep. Nicole Collier and the Texas Democrats has received support from Democratic legislators nationwide. Former Vice President Kamala Harris called Rep. Collier on Tuesday to show her support. “[Vice President Harris] said, ‘Keep going.’ She said, ‘Don’t give up. Stand strong. Stand tall, and don’t back down,” Rep. Collier told CNN’s Dana Bash. The Texas redistricting effort has spurred several Blue states to take up redistricting efforts of their own. Former Attorney General Eric Holder has met with House Democrats to discuss strategy on combating Republican redistricting efforts. Most notably, California Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced the Election Rigging Response Act last week. California will hold a special election on Nov. 4, where voters will decide whether the state legislature can temporarily take control of the state’s electoral maps for the next five years to actively neutralize the redistricting efforts of Texas and other red states.

Gavin Newsom, who is using a cascade of biting X posts to take on President Donald Trump. \n\nNewsom's @GovPressOffice account has started trolling MAGA with posts meant to resemble what Trump pushes out on his Truth Social network. \n\nPolitico reported Wednesday that Newsom and a team of four or five aides manage the account, which has gained more than 250,000 followers and earned more than 225 million impressions since the beginning of August. \n\n'People in the MAGA movement and the America First movement should start paying attention to this, because it's not going to go away,' Bannon told Politico. 'They're only going to get more intense.' \n\nBannon noted that Newsom is 'trying to mimic President Trump.' \n\n'He's no Trump, but if you look at the Democratic Party, he's at least getting up there, and he's trying to imitate a Trumpian vision of fighting, right?' Bannon said. 'He looks like the only person in the Democratic Party who is organizing a fight that they feel they can win.' \n\nIn recent weeks, @GovPressOffice has posted Trump-like imagery, like the inclusion of Newsom on Mount Rushmore and Newsom being prayed over by the late Hulk Hogan, complete with a halo and angel wings, Tucker Carlson and Kid Rock. \n\n'so nice!' @GovPressOffice commented on the prayerful picture. \n\nWhen a user named Conservative Mike called the image 'very disrespectful and blasphemy' @GovPressOffice chimed back in. \n\nNewsom's people highlighted a post from the White House, which had reshared an image from Trump's personal account - an AI image of the president dressed as the Pope. \n\n'oops our bad, sorry. meant to post this,' Newsom's office replied. \n\nNewsom's account has also used Trump's traditional all-caps to go on screeds. \n\n'HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT SINCE I SAID 'I HATE KID ROCK' HE'S NO LONGER 'HOT?' Newsom's account asked Tuesday night. \n\nTrump, of course, had sent out a nearly identical message in May about pop star Taylor Swift, who endorsed the president's opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. \n\nOn Tuesday, Newsom's team took on Dana Perino, who blasted the California Democrat's antics on Fox News earlier this week. \n\n'DANA 'DING DONG' PERINO (NEVER HEARD OF HER UNTIL TODAY!) IS MELTING DOWN BECAUSE OF ME, GAVIN C. NEWSOM!' the account wrote. 'FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA'S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR ('RATINGS KING') SAVING AMERICA - WHILE TRUMP CAN'T EVEN CONQUER THE 'BIG' STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANYMORE!!!'\n\n'TRUMP HAS 'LOST HIS STEP' AND FOX IS LOSING IT BECAUSE WHEN I TYPE, AMERICA NOW WINS!!!' Newsom's account continued. 'THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.' \n\nTrump often creates nicknames and mocks liberal media figures. The president has also started ending his Truths with 'thank you for your attention to this matter.' \n\nPerino had voiced on Fox that if Newsom wanted a bigger job, 'he has to be a little more serious.' \n\nIt's no secret that the California governor will likely toss his hat into the ring of 2028 Democratic White House contenders. \n\n'If I were his wife, I would say you are making a fool of yourself,' Perino said on The Five on Monday. \n\nNewsom told Fox 11 Los Angeles' Elex Michaelson in an interview last week that his social media strategy changed after Trump 'completely misrepresented the facts' about the Los Angeles fires and then federalized the National Guard to send troops to downtown LA to quell anti-ICE protests. \n\n'Yes, I've changed. The facts have changed. We need to change,' Newsom said. \n\n'This guy is an invasive species,' the governor said of Trump. 'He is completely different. I respect the Republican Party, I married into a Republican family, I have deep love and respect for people I disagree with.'\n\n'He is something altogether different, and he is unmoored; there are no constraints,' Newsom added. \n\nDemocrats are viewing Newsom's social posts as a bright spot as the party tries to find its way back into power. \n\n'It's an example of the guts and experimentation that needs to replace the timidity and over-testing,' Andrew Bates, a former spokesperson for President Joe Biden and principal at Wolfpack Strategies, told the Daily Mail.","summary":"President Donald Trump's longtime political strategist Steve Bannon poured rare praise on a Democrat who has been using X posts to troll the MAGA movement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15018151/steve-bannon-gavin-newsom-social-media-trolling-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/16/101394781-0-image-m-36_1755705176919.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 16:35:54","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":352647046,"title":"Kamala Harris hit with brutal reality check from those who know her best in new poll","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is losing political altitude in her own backyard.\n\nA new poll suggests California Democrats prefer Gavin Newsom over Kamala Harris in a potential 2028 presidential primary.\n\nThe Politico survey shows the California governor leading Harris with 25% support compared to her 19% among registered Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents in California.\n\nMoreover, less than a quarter of California Democrats - just 23 percent - are very excited about the prospect of another Harris presidential bid. The survey shows a clear majority - 58 percent - are 'not excited' about Harris 2028. \n\nCalifornia Democrats are a bit more enthusiastic for Newsom though 51 percent are still 'not excited.'\n\nAs Democrats remain leaderless following Joe Biden's exit from the White House, Newsom has emerged as a leading candidate to unite the party against Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has largely remained largely out of the political fray since losing the general election to Trump in 2024.\n\n‘There’s affection for her, but maybe less confidence that she would be a strong candidate,’ said Jack Citrin, a UC Berkeley political science professor who helped author the poll.\n\nThe survey does show Newsom and Harris would both be leading contenders in the California primary.\n\nHowever, Harris’ inability to garner clear support in her own home state is a doomsday scenario for her chances to grab the nomination.\n\n‘(Newsom is) in the news everyday.

It's not clear whether Gruffudd will hire another lawyer or opt to represent himself.\nThe Fantastic Four and Hornblower actor attended court last month with new wife Bianca, who is pregnant. He and Bianca, an aspiring actress, appear to have met in 2020 when she was an extra on the TV drama Harrow filmed in Australia. He left Alice in January 2021 and he and Bianca went public with their romance in October 2021.\nBianca strongly denies that there was any romance between them when he was still married.\n\nAlice has full custody of the children and the three of them are living in modest circumstances in the suburb of Encino in the San Fernando Valley, having left their apartment in Beverly Hills after being unable to afford the rent\nIoan and Alice met on the set of 102 Dalmatians and have been legally divorced for two years.\nAlice has full custody of the children and the three of them are living in modest circumstances in the suburb of Encino in the San Fernando Valley, having left their apartment in Beverly Hills after being unable to afford the rent.\nIoan said in his legal filing- which included a number of texts from Ella and Elsie, 11 - that he believed Alice was behind the distressing messages. \nIn one text to Gruffudd from daughter Ella, 15, read: 'You left us and now you can't provide for us.\n'You need to get a job daddy. Looking after your girlfriend is not a job. You are a father who has abandoned his children and doesn't see them or talk to them. You don't even send Christmas presents. It's pathetic and everyone sees you.\n'Ps if there is enough money for us never to become homeless then why aren't you helping us out? You hate mummy more than you love us.'\nBoth sides are pleading poverty, with Alice saying that it is simply not possible to make ends meet on the existing payments from Ioan, which comprises $3,000 per month in child support and $1,500 a month in spousal support.\nIn a written statement to court, backed by documentation, she says she owes money to utility companies, and defaulted on the $6,500 a month rent at their previous apartment in Beverly Hills, which led to her eviction. She also owes $35,000 to her lawyer.\n\nThe actress' post came just hours after Ioan's new wife Bianca Wallace (pictured) denied she had ever had an affair with Ioan - insisting their romance began when he was single - and accused Alice of inventing the 'disgusting, vile story'\n\nSince Ioan and Bianca went public with their relationship, Alice has hit out at their relationship on social media (pictured at The Fantastic Four premiere last week) \n\n Pregnant Bianca Wallace insists she never had an affair with Ioan Gruffudd \nHe is seeking to reduce the payments and says that it isn't possible to find more or better paid work.\nIoan has also contended in legal papers that he wants to make the three-year restraining order, which he was granted in August 2022, last a lifetime. It says that she must stay away from him and Bianca, and bans her from speaking about them, including in interviews or on social media.\nIt was granted after Alice sent hundreds of abusive text messages and emails. One observed: 'Some vixen has your nuts between her veneers.'\nIn a legal filing last year Alice wrote of her regrets at the behaviour, and said that she had not contacted him in years.\nShe wrote: 'I understand why the Court issued the DVRO (restraining order), and I wish I had never sent the messages or published the social media posts.\n'I was acting out of emotional anguish caused by the unexpected end of our marriage and Ioan's rather quick public announcement of a new romantic relationship on social media, which our eldest daughter discovered via an Instagram post.'\nBut when asked how many times he believed the order has been breached by his ex since it was filed Ioan indicated: 'Approximately 5,000 times.'\nThat would amount to an average of 138 times a month - or four times a day. Alice denies that this is the case. Ioan believes that his ex wife has been harassing him mostly through anonymous Twitter accounts but also claims she has physically stalked him.\n\nIoan filed for divorce in March 2021, shortly after Evans announced on social media that her husband of 14 years was leaving her (pictured in 2005) \n\nShe hit back: 'There is absolutely no evidence of stalking ... I have no idea where he and his wife live, nor do I have any interest in stalking them. This is plainly ridiculous.'\nShe also denies Ioan's contention that she has made herself homeless in June in order to make him look bad, which she says is simply absurd.\nThere was an ugly incident in 2023 during a custody visit when Ella, now 15, first met her father's new girlfriend.\nShe said that she hadn't wanted to meet Bianca, and Ioan said in court documents that Ella had reacted furiously to Bianca's presence and vandalised the apartment.\nThe teen applied for a restraining order against her father which was not granted.\nAlice appeared to have indicated that she wants to move on and attain a state of peace with Ioan and Bianca. After they announced her pregnancy in May it was reported that she was 'fuming', but Alice quickly said this was not the case.\nWriting on Instagram, she said: 'I am not fuming. Why on earth would I be? As for those who sent me nasty messages or made nasty comments online please remember that a baby announcement is a beautiful thing that brings much happiness and you're sullying it with your hate. Shame on you. The baby deserves better.'\nAlice EvansIoan Gruffudd\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nIoan Gruffudd dealt new blow in bitter divorce battle as he attempts to make his restraining order against ex-wife Alice Evans permanent\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Sam Vinograd, who was assistant secretary for counterterrorism, threat prevention and law enforcement policy in the Department of Homeland Security, is among the 37 former officials. She is also a national security contributor for CBS News. She has not yet responded to Gabbard's memo.Some of the officials worked on matters that have long infuriated President Trump, like the intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. And several showed their concerns about Mr. Trump by signing a critical letter in 2019 that was highlighted on social media last month by right-wing provocateur and close Trump ally Laura Loomer.The action reflects Mr. Trump's ongoing distrust of career intelligence officials whom he perceives as working against his interests. The revocation of clearances is a tactic the administration has used before — it has revoked the clearances of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several others. Critics say the tactic risks chilling dissenting voices from an intelligence community accustomed to drawing on a range of viewpoints before formulating an assessment. In Mr. Trump's first term, he revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's clearance.\"These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,\" Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer whose own clearance has been revoked by the Trump administration, said in a statement.He called it hypocritical for the administration to \"claim these individuals politicized or weaponized intelligence.\"Gabbard on Tuesday sought to defend the move, which she said had been directed by Mr. Trump.\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" she wrote on X. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\"In recent weeks, Gabbard and other Trump administration officials have revisited the intelligence community assessment published in 2017 on Russian election interference, including by declassifying a series of years-old documents meant to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its findings. Multiple government investigations have reached the same conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping fashion, including through a hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails and a social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion. But Mr. Trump has long resisted the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in his favor, and his Justice Department has authorized a grand jury investigation that could bring fresh scrutiny to Obama-era officials.Security clearances are important not only for current government workers but also former employees whose private-sector jobs require them to retain access to sensitive information. Stripping clearances from such employees could make it hard for them to do their jobs, though it's unclear how many of the former officials still have or require one.On his first day of office, Mr. Trump said he would revoke the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a \"Russian information operation.\" Mr. Trump has attempted to revoke the security clearances for lawyers at a number of prominent law firms but was rebuffed by federal judges.Some of those who were targeted in the latest action were part of Biden's national security team. Many only learned of the Gabbard action from news reports Tuesday, two former government officials who were on the list told the Associated Press.

The important point to remember is that the phenomenon of Trumpism reflects a historical infection point from the last stage of Pax Americana to a rapidly changing post-American new world order, ultimately unto the direction of \"post-capitalism\" and \"post-democracy\" in \"post-civilization\" around the \"Asian 21st century\" and beyond.\n1st Way of Manipulation: Trump's Greed, and the Market-Capitalist Vice\nThe first way of Trumpism to manipulate hopes and fears in our era is that, contrary to political correctness in Western mainstream mass media, Trump's greed reflects the market-capitalist vice which elevates \"greed\" as \"good,\" as fashionably portrayed in the 1980 film \"Wall Street.\" The central obsession of Trump's professional life is with \"money, money, and money,\" as Trump himself said (in a January 2016 rally): \"My whole life I've been greedy…I've grabbed all the money I could get. I'm so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States.\"\nIn this sense, Trump's economic modus operandi is based on a ruthless greed-based tool of extortion and bullying. For instance, in trade, he uses \"tariffs\" against the rest of the world -- both friends and foes alike. He blames the massive U.S. trade deficits on the rest of the world, just as a consumer would blame a supermarket for his transaction deficits because he buys from the supermarket but the supermarket does not buy much from him. Trump's solution is to extort as much money as he could from the rest of the world by imposing tariffs on each of them, hoping that his \"beg your neighbors\" tariffs would eliminate or reduce U.S. trade deficits. This is the classic trademark of a greedy bully with no moral scruples for fairness or reasonableness, to the point of criminality (with a wicked sense of pride, as he is a \"convicted criminal,\" after being convicted of 34 felonies in a New York court in 2024).\nBut the consequences of Trump's extortion by universal tariffs would bankrupt or hurt the U.S. in the long term, just as Trump had suffered at least 6 major bankruptcies in his business life, besides many financial problems that his bankers had the misfortune to encounter from him over the years. In the 2024 book \"Lucky Loser,\" Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig documented the failures of Trump's business endeavors, so much that he had to spend much time to fabricate the illusion of his success story. For someone as privileged as Trump who had inherited (starting when he was a toddler) about half a billion dollars over the years from his father's real estate empire with suspect tax schemes (as reported by The New York Times in 2018), not to mention different social connections with the \"higher class\" and \"social elite\" in American society, his business failure is deeply troubling, since, as reported by Dan Alexander in 2021, he could be so much richer than what he currently has if he had simply done nothing and just left his massive financial inheritance from his father to S&P 500 in the past decades instead.\nSimilarly, but now on the global stage, Trump's extortion by universal tariffs can bankrupt or hurt the U.S. in the long term, in 2 major ways.\nFirst, his extortion by universal tariffs practically forces other countries to diversify their trade relations, away from the United States. For instance, Trump's main target, China, had already started the process of \"dual circulation\" (which strives for self-reliance by relying on its huge domestic market and yet simultaneously diversifies its trade relations with the outside world by increasing its trade shares with Asia, Africa, and Latin America, while reducing its trade relation with the U.S. since Trump's first term, as its overall market share in the U.S. had dropped to 13.9% by 2023, from 21.6% some years before, and China's reduction further continues now in Trump's 2nd term). Meanwhile, the EU is trying to reduce its trade dependence on the U.S. by doing more trade with Canada, China, Japan, ASEAN, and the like. Thanks to Trump's crude protectionism, the U.S. will become more isolated from the rest of the world.\nSecond, the U.S. will suffer from slower economic growth, because of the compounded effects of (a) less trade relations with the rest of the world, (b) increased price levels inside the U.S. (partly due to the increased universal tariffs on imported products and partly due to increased domestic supplies as substitutes which are protected from tariffs but are not competitive in both price and quality), and © the loss of the dollar dominance (or exorbitant privilege) as a result of excessive sanctions by the U.S. alliance on the non-West — as already elaborated in my 2023 article titled \"De-Globalization and De-Dollarization in the 2nd Cold War.\"\nIn sum, Trump's extortion by universal tariffs is based on non-rational greed-based protectionism which violates and thus undermines the very foundation of the rules-based international trade order (like the WTO) which the United States had worked so hard for decades to build for its own prosperity since the end of WWII. The point here is not that the rules-based international order is perfect or does not need to be changed or updated, but that Trump's extortion by universal tariffs is ineffective and self-defeating in the long term.\n2nd Way of Manipulation: Trump's Deceit, and the Liberal-Democratic Dysfunction\nThe second way of Trumpism to manipulate hopes and fears in our era is that, contrary to political correctness in Western mainstream mass media, Trump's deceit reflects the liberal-democratic dysfunction in party-politics, where political leaders often lie to manufacture consent.\nThere is a saying in American politics, which is that \"the business of politics is lying.\" Like all generalizations, it is not an absolute truth but indicates a common perception and concern about untruth and untruthfulness in liberal democratic party-politics, where political candidates and politicians routinely manipulate and cajole voters and constituents for their own interests, while colluding with the rich and powerful elites.\nTrump is no exception to this dysfunctional (corrupt) aspect of liberal democracy; in fact, presidential historian Michael Beschloss once said: \"I have never seen a president in American history who has lied so continuously and so outrageously as Donald Trump, period.\" The Washington Post on January 20, 2021 documented \"30,573 false or misleading claims\" in Trump's first term, about an average of 21 lies per day.\nTrump's political modus operandi is based on the playbook by his mentor Roy Cohn: \"Deflect and distract, never give in, never admit fault, lie and attack, publicize no matter what, win no matter what, all underpinned by a deep, prove-me-wrong belief in the power of chaos and fear,\" as discussed by Jim Zirin in his 2024 book \"Plaintiff in Chief: A Portrait of Donald Trump in 3,500 Lawsuits\" and in the 2019 documentary film \"Where Is My Roy Cohn?\" by Matt Tyrnauer.\nThis notorious con man, Roy Cohn, who was disbarred in disgrace in 1986 (before his death), worked in early years as an aide to the infamous senator, Joseph McCarthy (who ruined the lives of countless innocent victims in the name of \"anti-Communism\"), is known for being \"unapologetic,\" \"remorseless,\" and \"moral-less,\" as Liz Smith put it, or for thriving in a social jungle where \"money and power overrules rules and law,\" in Eric Hobsbawm's parlance. Cohn's \"stop at nothing\" philosophy fascinates Trump, to the point that he was reported to have said, \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" (in the 2019 documentary film with the same quote above). But the mentee (Trump) outdid his mentor (Cohn) in ruthlessness in the end, as Trump finally abandoned Cohn when the latter, a gay (\"in the closet\"), was dying of AIDS in 1986 (while being disbarred in disgrace) and thus was no longer useful to him (Trump), or, as Cohn's secretary, Susan Bell, recalled: Trump \"dropped him like a hot potato.\" In the last party for Cohn, Trump gave him a gift (a pair of cufflinks) which, as Trump shamelessly lied to him, was made with \"real diamonds,\" but Cohn felt hurt and betrayed by his mentee (for all that he had done to mentor Trump), when he later learned from Trump's wife Ivanna that it was made of \"cheap pewter and zirconia\" instead (not \"real diamonds\"), as told in the article \"The Final Lesson Donald Trump Never Learned from Roy Cohn\" in Politico Magazine (on Sept. 19, 2019).\nNow on the global stage, Trump follows this ruthless tactic of \"lie, deflect, and attack\" in dealing with others, both friends and foes alike. For illustration, consider the following 3 examples.\nFirst, in August (2025), Trump slapped a 50 percent tariff on India by falsely claiming that \"India is the Tariff King\" (as a way to coerce India into making concessions), but India rejected the claim as untrue, since its average tariff stands at 16%, comparable to Turkey (16.2%) and Argentina (13.4%), just as its weighted average tariff is only 4.6%, as reported by NDTV World.\nSecond, in February (2025), Trump repeatedly made \"false claims about the amount of aid the U.S. has given to support Ukraine\" by saying that \"we are in there for about $350 billion,\" but this contradicts government sources which \"place the amount…at $174 billion -- which includes not only support for Ukraine but also for other countries affected by the conflict, stationing additional NATO troops and more,\" as reported by Alexander Hutzler on Feb 26, 2025. Later, Trump used this false claim to ask for a $350 billion (or more) minerals deal with Ukraine, so as to recuperate the fabricated amount.\nAnd third, in February (2005), Trump made the false claim that Panama allowed China to manage the Panama Canal, so he used this false claim to threaten Panama to retake the canal unless Panama offered concessions and allowed the \"free transit of U.S. warships through the canal\" and stopped doing business with China. But Panama rejected the U.S. claim about Chinese control and also about U.S. ownership of the canal, since it had already managed the canal itself for decades and have continuously \"expanded it to completely different channels than the [old] one\" originally built by the U.S. in 1904. Shortly after, Panama terminated the Belt and Road Initiative deal with China after Trump's lie and threat, which led Lina Vega Abad, president of the Fundacion Libertad Ciudadana, to bluntly observe: \"We are up against a person [Trump] who tries to gain advantage through pressure, blackmail, lies -- a classic bully,\" as reported by International Transparency on February 11, 2025.\nBut Trump's deceit and bullying can weaken the U.S. in the long term, in 2 major ways.\nFirst, his tactic of deceit and bullying practically forces other countries to lessen their dependence on the United States.\nFor instance, after Trump's 50% tariff hike, India immediately paused plans to buy U.S. arms, spoke to Russia's Putin to reassure their bilateral relationship, and planned to meet China's Xi later this month to improve the Sino-Indian relationship as a way to reduce its dependence on the U.S. to counter China.\nSecond, his tactic of deceit and bullying creates an atmosphere of mistrust and uncertainty in the rest of the world vis-à-vis the U.S., which is increasingly becoming an \"unreliable\" country for others to deal with, since Trump's chronic lies and abrupt changes in policy with little consistency (partly due to his chronic non-rational mood changes and partly due to his narcissistic transactionism) have much damaged or broken the hard-earned \"trust\" (over the decades) towards the U.S. around the world. For instance, Canada under the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney now wants \"less U.S. dependency,\" as the U.S. is now regarded in Canada as an \"unreliable\" partner, as reported by Reuters on March 11, 2025.\n3rd Way of Manipulation: Trump's MAGA, and the American-Imperialist Decline\nThe third way of Trumpism to manipulate hopes and fears in our era is that, contrary to political correctness in Western mainstream mass media, Trump's MAGA reflects the end of American dominance in our era. Pax Americana is living its last sad days under Trump and its aftermath in the foreseeable future.\nTrump's critics strongly dislike Trumpism, so they often under-estimate the popularity of Trump among his MAGA supporters, because the populist policy of \"Make America Great Again\" resonates well with those in the U.S. who are frightened by the long-term prospect of a rapidly changing world, where America is fast declining across the board (vis-à-vis China as the rising superpower) and is no longer calling the shots. Trump keenly understands (with his political instinct) this frightening \"fear\" (by many in the electorate) of an America which is no longer great, so he skillfully gives them the consoling \"hope\" for making America great again. In this way, he deserves the credit to win his 2nd presidency (over his rival, Kamala Harris).\nBut the policy of MAGA will not bring back a stronger America; instead, it will make it weaker and seal the final fate of the U.S. decline in the emerging Asian century (as already predicted and elaborated in my 2022 article titled \"The Closing of the Western Mind in the 2nd Cold War,\" which showed the decline of the U.S. across the board under the Trump and Biden administrations, in relation to \"decoupling in trade,\" \"sanctions in finance,\" \"spy hunt in education,\" \"hate crimes in civil society,\" \"extremist populism in political society,\" and \"containment in global relations\"). And the rise of the Asian century was already predicted and discussed in my 1995 doctoral dissertation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or M. I.T. (which was later published in 2 volumes titled \"The Future of Human Civilization\" in 1999) and in my 2007 book titled \"Beyond the World of Titans, and the Remaking of World Order.\"\nWith these prior well-documented (visionary) works in mind, consider the following 5 indicators (for illustration).\nFirst, in the economic sphere, the top 5 economies in the world, if measured by GDP (PPP), according to the IMF estimate (for the 2026 report), are China (43.25 trillion $), United States (31.71 trillion $), India (19.16 trillion $), Russia (7.41 trillion $), and Japan (6.92 trillion $). If measured by global share of manufacturing, the top 5 manufacturing countries in the world in 2023 were China (31.63%), United States (15.9%), Japan (6.5%), Germany (4.7%), and India (2.9%). If measured by largest trading partners in the world, China was already the world's top trading partner (to more than 120 countries) by 2020, when it surpassed the U.S. as the world's most dominant trading country (as reported by Iman Ghosh in Visual Capitalist on Jan.22, 2020). And, if measured by total national debts or credits in the world, China is now the \"world's largest official creditor,\" as reported by the Lowy Institute (an Australian foreign policy think tank) on May 29, 2025, whereas the U.S. is the world's largest debtor (with a national debt approaching $37 trillion in 2025).\nSecond, in the educational sphere, China now occupies 8 of the top 10 best research institutes in the world, as shown in the 2025 Research Leaders world ranking, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) being ranked as the top research leader (1st place), followed by Harvard University in the U.S. (2nd place), University of Science and Technology of China (3rd place), Zhejian University (4th place), Peking University (5th place), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (6th place), Tsinghua University (7th place), Nanjng University (8th place), Max Planck Society in Germany (9th place), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (10th place).\nThird, in the technological sphere, if measured by patent grants (sorted by the World Population Review), the top 5 countries with the most patents in 2025 are China (798,347), United States (323,410), Japan (201,420), South Korea (135,180), and India (30,490). And, if measured by STEM graduates in the world (for scientists and engineers), the top 5 countries (in 2020) were China (3.57 million), India (2.55 million), United States (0.82 million), Russia (0.52 million), and Indonesia (0.3 million).\nFourth, in the military sphere, sometime between 2015 and 2020, China surpassed the U.S. by having the largest army and navy in the world (while catching up both in quality and quantity), and its air force has achieved a great stride in making world-class fighter jets (like the 5th-gen J-20 and J-35, and the 6th-gen J-36 and J-50) and air defense systems (like the HQ-19, notable for its unusual ability to intercept hypersonic and ballistic missiles). Meanwhile, in the armed conflict between Pakistan and India in May (2025), the Pakistani air force used Chinese J10 fighter jets armed with China-made PL-15 missiles to shoot down 3 of Indian new French Rafale jets, even though French Rafale jets are often considered as one of the most advanced fighter jets in our era.\nFifth, in the political-cultural sphere, in an unprecedented historical development since the end of WWII, by May (2025), \"global attitude towards the U.S. is souring, with one key adversary [China] now more popular worldwide than the U.S. and another [Russia] hot on its heels, according to new polling. The U.S. is perceived more negatively globally than China and is only a hair more popular than Russia, according to the Democracy Perception Index, a snapshot of global public opinion on democracy and geopolitics developed by the Copenhagen Democracy Summit,\" as reported by Will Katcher on May 14, 2025.\nSurely, these 5 indicators are not exhaustive, but they suffice to illustrate the decline of the American empire since WWII, especially since Trump in power, starting from 2017 to 2021, and now again from early 2025.\nConclusion: Post-Capitalism & Post-Democracy in Post-Civilization around the Asian Century and Beyond\nThese 3 major ways for Trumpism to manipulate hopes and fears in the socio-political world of our era have profound consequences to the global landscape, which is rapidly shifting to a new world order to replace the 3-fold populist corruption of Trumpism in the last sad days of Pax Americana, with an emergent new world which is \"post-capitalist\" (to supersede the \"capitalist vice\") and \"post-democratic\" (to supersede the \"liberal democratic dysfunction\") in \"post-civilization\" (to supersede traditional civilization after Pax Americana in the \"American-imperialist decline\") around the \"Asian 21st century\" and beyond.\nThis 3-fold historical transformation was already predicted and elaborated in my previous works. For instance, the rise of \"post-capitalism\" was already predicted and discussed in my 2002 book titled \"The Future of Capitalism and Democracy\" and in the 2004 book titled \"Beyond Capitalism to Post-Capitalism.\" The rise of \"post-democracy\" was already predicted and discussed in my 2002 book titled \"The Future of Capitalism and Democracy\" and in the 2004 book titled \"Beyond Democracy to Post-Democracy.\" The rise of China and India in the \"Asian century\" was already predicted and discussed in my 1999 book titled \"The Future of Human Civilization\" and in my 2007 book titled \"Beyond the World of Titans, and the Remaking of World Order.\" The rise of \"post-civilization\" to replace traditional civilization hitherto existing was already predicted and discussed in my 2005 book titled \"Beyond Civilization to Post-Civilization.\" And the rise of authoritarianism in liberal democracy (long before national \"no kings\" protests against \"King Trump\" in the far-right populism of our time) was already predicted and discussed in my 2007 book titled \"The Rise of Authoritarian Liberal Democracy.\"\nWith these well-documented (visionary) books in mind, there is this deep-rooted self-flattering narrative in Western mainstream mass media (also known as the \"end of history\" thesis), which claims that the capitalist, liberal-democratic system produces political leaders who are inherently \"benevolent,\" \"honest,\" \"peaceful,\" and the like, whereas the non-capitalist, non-liberal-democratic system produces political leaders who are inherently \"malevolent,\" \"dishonest,\" \"violent,\" and the like. But nothing is farther from the truth than this self-flattering narrative. Even the disgraced convicted criminal (for child sex offense) like Jeffrey Epstein, as revealed in the \"Jeffrey Epstein tapes,\" once said: \"I was Donald Trump's closest friend…He is a horrible human being…He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends' wives.\" Or listen to Trump biographer, Michael Wolff, who had repeatedly warned \"how, for even the most loyal subjects, working for Trump 'ends in tears,'\" as reported by Jared Siskin and Patrick McMullan on Wolff's 2019 book \"All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America.\" With even stronger reason, one must not forget that Trump is a \"convicted criminal,\" as he was convicted of 34 felonies in a New York court in 2024.\nAt the national level, the rise of far-right populism in the U.S., with Trumpism as the most recent example (say, for brutal, violent ICE raids by masked men with guns on American streets, who have terrified both citizens and non-citizens alike -- comparable to the ruthless raids by the Nazis in Germany and the Fascists in Italy in the inter-war period, both of which are also on the Far Right end of the political spectrum), contradicts this very euphoric propaganda in the \"end of history\" thesis.\nThe brutal, violent ICE raids (cheered upon by Trump's supporters) are by no means a historical aberration in American history, which had already seen other instances like the enslavement of Africans, the encampment of Japanese Americans during WWII, the almost complete extermination of Native Indians, the systemic discrimination against women, the inhumane laissez-faire treatment of the lower class and the homeless, the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the Chinese Massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles, imperial racism (in the Philippine-American War, the Korean War and then the Vietnam War, with the notorious racial slurs like \"FKN gooks\" and later \"FKN chinks\"), and now Trump's \"kung flu.\" Pax Americana under the capitalist, liberal-democracy fabric cannot last, because it has inflicted so much suffering to so many in the world for so long (in spite of all the benefits on the bright side), and a new civilizational world is emerging to replace it (and is accelerated further by Trumpism, ironically).\nIn the end, the phenomenon of Trumpism reflects a historical infection point from the last stage of Pax Americana to a rapidly changing new world order, ultimately unto the direction of \"post-capitalism\" and \"post-democracy\" in \"post-civilization\" around the \"Asian 21st century\" and beyond.\n--------------------\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter Baofu is an American visionary and author of 180 scholarly books and numerous articles (as of July, 2023) to provide 150 visions (theories) of the human future in relation to the mind, nature, society, and culture -- and had been in 163 countries around the world (as of August, 2025) for his global research on humanity, besides knowing 10 languages with different degrees of fluency.

Collier is one of the more than 50 other Texas Democratic legislators who fled the state earlier this month to break quorum and thwart Republican efforts, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to draw new congressional maps that would create five additional GOP seats ahead of the midterm elections next year. This effort, as I noted earlier this month on NewsOne, is racist as hell and not at all shy about its designs to dilute the power of Black and Latino voters to maintain power for an unpopular president who increasingly talks as if he plans to die in office rather than at the end of his second term. Those Republicans have since launched a new special session to move forward with their plans, and returning Democrats like Collier were informed by House Speaker Dustin Burrows on Monday that they would not be allowed to leave the chambers without signing a document promising to be present when the House reconvenes on Wednesday. Well, not only pledge to be present, but to agree to 24-hour police surveillance to guarantee compliance. “Members who have not been present until today for whom arrest warrants were issued will be granted written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated DPS officer appointment,” Burrows explained. Although many of these Texas Democrats called the policy an “unnecessary use of state funds,” only a handful of them actually refused to sign the ridiculous order – most notably Collier, who, after being detained against her will, has remained inside the chambers, drawing national attention for her efforts. When asked by Fox’s Austin affiliate why she didn’t sign her rights away to the state, she explained: “I refused to sign. I will not agree to be in DPS custody. I am not a criminal. I am exercising my right to resist and oppose the decisions of our government. So, this is my form of protest.” In another interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, Collier spoke just as plainly about Trump’s involvement and true aim with the Texas redistricting plan, saying, “I’ve had enough.” “I’m not going to be part of a process that gives him more reinforcement to harm my community and my people. I will not allow you to put my people down without a fight,” Collier added. Understandably, this has caused Collier to gain notoriety, and in the immediate hours after her false imprisonment at the state capitol, praise from the best-known Democrats like former Vice President Kamala Harris, who called Collier and told her, “You are those who history will reveal to have been heroes of this moment.” Additionally, Harris wrote to Collier on X: “Nicole, we are all in that chamber with you. Thank you to you and all the Texas Democrats who are standing up for the people.” Separately, Senator Cory Booker posted: “Texas House Democrats, especially Rep. Nicole Collier, are showing us the power we all have to stand up for the rights of every single American.” And the Sunrise Movement argued: “This is what leadership against fascism looks like. Hope Chuck Schumer is taking notes.” Now, Collier has already publicly embraced remarks by Harris, but I must say, as nice a sentiment as it sounds to say “we are all in that chamber with you,” we are not in fact all with her. Fortunately, some of Collier’s legislative colleagues – mainly women, notably – have since pledged to rip up their previously signed permission slips and stand by Collier in the chambers. And there have been everyday Texans showing up outside the chambers to cheer Collier and others on for what they are doing. Still, I have to ask: where the hell is the rest of the Democratic Party? Why are they not all down there making a bigger fuss about all this? I support Collier and agree that she is being courageous in the face of authoritarianism, but I don’t like the idea of what’s happening to her being flipped into another story about “resistance.” I’m not usually the type to quote former Biden Press Secretary turned cable news host Jen Psaki, but she’s right when she says: “Just to be clear, Texas State Rep. Nicole Collier is not holding some kind of sit-in protest. She is literally locked in the State Capitol against her will.” Yes, Collier has described her actions as a form of protest, but ultimately, this is about an elected official being held against her will because she won’t agree to police surveillance once she leaves. This is the unlawful detainment of a Black woman legislator, or to follow Collier’s lead on bluntness, a kidnapping by the state of Texas at the urging of its racist, power-hungry GOP bloc that will do anything for its master, Donald J. Trump, who most recently complained about how awful museums make slavery look. She is courageous, but when you consider how some of the other folks that signed up for police surveillance have already been threatened with arrest, how much of a choice was she left with? Many of us have been asking how bad is this all going to get under a second Trump term? Here is one of the clearest answers yet. Source: Brandon Bell / Getty I don’t think of Nicole Collier and want to muse about sacrifice in the name of patriotism, but how Black women continue to fight harder for “democracy” than others with fewer resources and support. That includes Black men in elected office with more power, i.e., Senator Booker or House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who recently was rightfully lampooned for telling a reporter that his plan to tackle one of Trump’s administration’s latest fascist plots – the taking over of Washington, D.C., – with a strong-worded letter. Gavin Newsom is garnering so much praise for his tweeting in the style of Trump, but his demo will not be dealing with the worst of what’s planned first, and it’s evident in how Collier is being treated. As a native Texan, I’m used to watching Democrats talk about how important “democracy” is, yet do little to go deep down South and fight the tyrants who have been giving Trump a roadmap on how to wrap power around him for years. I want to be clear that I support Nicole Collier and all that she’s doing, but let us not romanticize her kidnapping by fascists. She is being held against her will but choosing to fight back. And if they are to glean anything from her, it should be this attitude she has articulated to the press: “They say take that high road. That high road has crumbled. We’re on a dirt road and we’re gonna meet them and get down and dirty. My fellow Democrats are ready to fight with the grit that is necessary to challenge the oppressor.” I hope her fellow Democrats are truly ready because it can’t just be the Nicole Colliers of America doing the hardest work.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:16:02 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:16:32 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nRomeo and his brother Cruz have shared the latest insight into the Beckham family holiday as they spend the summer on their £16million yacht in Italy.\nThe famous siblings have been posting updates from their long hot summer on Instagram, where everyone is present apart from their eldest brother Brooklyn.\nThe Beckhams are said to no longer be on speaking terms with Brooklyn, 26, and his wife Nicola, 30, who recently renewed their vows without inviting them.\nBrooklyn and his in-laws spent a week in the south of France last month, but since they left it was firmly Beckham territory before they sailed over to the Amalfi Coast.\nThe family seem to still be having the time of their lives as they kicked back on Tuesday, posting shirtless snaps from the vessel as they relaxed together.\nRomeo, 22, was wearing a pair of yellow star print swim shorts while lounging in the sun, covering his head with a black and white bandanna.\n\nRomeo and his brother Cruz have shared the latest insight into the Beckham family holiday as they spend the summer on their £16million yacht in St Tropez\n\nMeanwhile, after previously causing a stir in a pair of white Prada swim shorts, Cruz switched them for a purple pair as he posted a picture floating in the sea\nMeanwhile, after previously causing a stir in a pair of white Prada swim shorts, Cruz switched them for a purple pair as he posted a picture floating in the sea.\nThe Beckham clan have been ignoring the simmering feud as they continue to post adoring holiday snaps.\nDavid and Victoria are currently away with three of their four children, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper, 14, and Cruz's girlfriend Jackie Apostel, 29 - while their son Brooklyn remains away amid their ongoing feud. \nOn Monday, it was Cruz's turn to showcase the strength of the group, with the youngest son taking to Instagram to document the latest leg of their holiday.\nCruz shared snaps giving a nod to his passions - showing him sitting with his father and brother, as well as David's dad Ted while playing guitar, while he kissed Jackie in another shot and played football in a duo of videos. \nThe Beckhams have been snubbed by Brooklyn and his wife Nicola after they said 'I do' for a second time on August 2 in Westchester County in front of her family, with the Beckham clan notably absent, having not been informed of the event.\nFurther heartache has come in the form of a leak of Brooklyn's speech, in which he reportedly opened up on his love for the Peltz family, as well as speaking 'movingly' of his wife in front of the 200 guests.\nA source told The Mirror: 'He spoke from the heart - and at the centre of his heart is Nicola who he loves very dearly, but also the Peltz family who have really stuck by his side. He wanted to recognise them all, and was determined to do them all justice.' \n\nDavid and Victoria are currently away with three of their four children, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper, 14, and Cruz's girlfriend Jackie Apostel, 29 - while their son Brooklyn remains away amid their ongoing feud \n\nCruz and Jackie locked lips against the stunning backdrop \n\nThe group played ping pong together amid their chilled night \nNews of the 'heartfelt tribute' to billionaire Nelson Peltz, 83, and wife Claudia, 70, will no doubt add to the pain of the Beckham family amid their estrangement from Brooklyn, with it said that no such tribute was given for his own parents. \nWhile Brooklyn enjoyed his lovefest overseas, the Beckhams enjoyed a prolonged stint in the south of France before heading to Italy.\nBoth Cruz and Jackie have been uploading snaps from the Italian leg of their trip, however the gap between the siblings remains. \nCruz was seen in front of an idyllic pool while kissing Jackie before taking some time to perform football tricks. \nWhen he reached for his guitar, followers were tickled by an image showing Romeo giving him 'side eye' while he performed for three generations of Beckhams.\nIn addition to his immediate family, Brooklyn's grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles were also absent and only found out about the wedding vow renewal by reading online. \nIt comes as Brooklyn is reportedly 'heartbroken' over the way his wife Nicola is being 'painted as a viper' within their ongoing family feud.\nBillionaire heiress Nicola has previously been accused of 'isolating' Brooklyn from not only his family, but his friends too. \n\nBrooklyn, 26, and Nicola, 30, said 'I do' for a second time on August 2 in Westchester County in front of her family, with the Beckham clan notably absent amid their ongoing feud\n\nWhen he reached for his guitar, followers were tickled by an image showing Romeo giving him 'side eye' while he performed for three generations of Beckhams as well as their pal Ahmed Alsibai\n\nCruz engaged in a host of sporty activities during the day \n\nBrooklyn's parents David, 50, and Victoria, 51, and his brothers Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and sister Harper, 14, were nowhere in sight at the second wedding\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham look set to face fresh heartache as new details have emerged of son Brooklyn's vow renewal speech to wife Nicola\nNew sources allege Brooklyn is not being held from making his own decisions and is 'devastated' over the way his wife is being portrayed. \nA source told The Mirror: 'It’s so rooted in misogyny that all of the heat for his parents not being invited is on Nicola. \n'Everyone seems to forget that Brooklyn is an adult man and fully capable of speaking out. Nicola would have respected all that he chose. It breaks Brooklyn’s heart to see his wife being painted as this vixen and viper.'\nFranceItalyInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nShirtless Romeo Beckham and his brother strip down to their swimwear with Cruz slipping back into his Speedos in latest snaps from their fun-filled family holiday in Italy\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

These posts are often written in all-caps and end with the governor’s initials, “GCN,” in an apparent reference to the president adding “DJT” to his Truth Social posts. Now, Newsom’s latest target is Kid Rock.\n\nOn Sunday, Newsom’s press office trolled the singer by sharing an Uncle Sam-style poster featuring Kid Rock pointing at the viewer while dressed in a red, white and blue hat. “Kid Rock wants YOU to support Gavin Newsom,” the poster reads. \n\nNewsom’s press office captioned the photo in classic Trump style: “I ACCEPT! — GCN.”\n\nKid Rock fired back the next day, referencing Trump’s nickname for the California governor.\n\n “The only support Gavin Newscum will ever get out of me is from DEEZ NUTZ,” he wrote on X.\n\nKid Rock has long supported the president. In March, the singer appeared in the Oval Office sporting a flashy suit emblazoned with the American flag as Trump signed an executive order to curb ticket scalping. The singer also performed his 2000 hit “American Bad Ass” at last year’s Republican National Convention with altered lyrics to show support for Trump. \n\nNewsom’s press office then shared another Trump-style post about Kid Rock on Tuesday.\n\n“I HATE KID ROCK!!! — GCN,” the office wrote.\n\nIn another post a few hours later, Newsom’s press office wrote: “HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT SINCE I SAID ‘I HATE KID ROCK’ HE'S NO LONGER 'HOT?'”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Kid Rock’s agent for comment.\n\nNewsom’s latest posts appear to be parodies of Trump’s remarks about pop icon Taylor Swift. Trump wrote, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” on Truth Social in September, shortly after the singer endorsed his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe had previously shared an AI image falsely suggesting that she had endorsed him and adding: “I accept.”\n\nTrump also shared another post about Swift in May: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’\n\nTrump repeated that claim earlier this month while comparing the singer to actress Sydney Sweeney, who was under fire at the time for appearing in a controversial American Eagle jeans advertisement. \n\n“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there,” Trump wrote. “It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’”\n\n“Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!),” he added. “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”\n\nNewsom, a rumored front-runner for the 2028 presidential election, is rising within the ranks of potential Democratic candidates. A new poll released in mid-August shows he has a 13 percent favorability compared to other potential candidates, indicating voters are responding well to his social media campaign mocking Trump.\n\nFellow Democrats are also applauding Newsom’s efforts online.\n\nLiberal social media commentator Harry Sisson wrote on X: “I absolutely love how Gavin Newsom is treating Donald Trump with the disdain and disrespect that he absolutely deserves.”\n\n“I don’t think we’re giving Gavin Newsom enough credit for what he’s doing to defend democracy and to stop a wannabe dictator from consolidating power,” journalist and influencer Karly Kingsley said.","summary":"The California governor’s press office has started parodying Trump’s online posting style","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kid-rock-responds-newsom-trump-post-b2811084.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/14/45/kid-rock-newsom-split.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/w6BSt11s-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 15:13:40","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":352614758,"title":"The Latest: Texas GOP poised to approve map gerrymandered for their advantage","text":"The first domino in a growing national redistricting battle is likely to fall Wednesday as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature is expected to pass a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP. The vote follows prodding by President Donald Trump to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives. \n\nDemocrats who refused round-the-clock police escorts to ensure they'd provide a quorum were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream. They've vowed a blue-states payback for the Texas map, with California’s legislature poised to approve a retaliatory gerrymandering for the state's voters to consider in November.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\n Joint Chiefs chairman huddles with European counterparts \n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is participating in a virtual meeting of NATO defense leaders amid a renewed push to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a U.S. defense official said.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, NATO’s supreme allied commander Europe, also was taking part in Wednesday’s meeting as Western countries devise possible future security guarantees for Kyiv that could help forge a peace agreement.\n\nThe defense official, who wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Caine also met with European military chiefs Tuesday evening in Washington to discuss best options to provide to political leaders.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear who took part.\n\n A Texas Democrat gets an encouraging phone call \n\nDemocratic Texas state Rep.

Nicole Collier posted video on social media of her listening to the call from Harris, who told her she should not feel alone as Democrats work to thwart GOP plans to redraw congressional districts to favor Republicans.\n\nCollier said the call from Harris showed “we are making a difference” and that “people are watching and they are ready to hold this government accountable.”\n\n Texas legislature set to pass new congressional map in redistricting battle \n\nSeven Democrats slept in the Texas House chamber House overnight to protest both a Republican plan for redrawing congressional districts that was set for a vote Wednesday and the GOP’s requirement for Democrats leaving the Capitol to be shadowed by police officers. Fort Worth Rep. Nicole Collier led the protest.\n\nState law officers shadowed Democrats outside the Capitol, tailing them as they drove and shopped and watching their homes and apartments to ensure they’d show up Wednesday to give Republicans the quorum they need to approve the maps without any Democratic votes.\n\nDemocrats returned after their two-week walkout raised national attention to the GOP’s plan to fulfill Trump’s wish for Republicans to pick up five seats in the 2026 elections.\n\n▶ Read more on redistricting developments at the Texas capitol\n\n Trump calls on Federal Reserve official to step down, extending pressure campaign \n\nTrump said on social media that Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve’s governing board, should resign after a member of his administration accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by claiming two different homes as her principal residences.\n\nBill Pulte, director of the agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the board by former president Joe Biden in 2022 and was re-appointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038.\n\nThe allegation represents another front in the Trump administration’s attack on the Fed, which has yet to cut its key interest rate as Trump has demanded. If Cook were to step down then the White House could nominate a replacement. And Trump has said he would only appoint people who would support lower rates.\n\n Yosemite visitors may face prosecution for protesting at the national park \n\nShannon “SJ” Joslin was fired after hanging a pride flag from El Capitan while some visitors face potential prosecution for alleged violations of protest restrictions that have been tightened under President Donald Trump. (AP video by Brittany Peterson)\n\nA Yosemite National Park ranger was fired after hanging a pride flag from El Capitan, and the National Park Service and the Justice Department are pursuing “possible criminal charges against several park visitors who are alleged to have violated federal laws and regulations related to demonstrations,” NPS spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz said.\n\nShannon “SJ” Joslin, a biologist who studies bats, was fired for “failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after hanging a 66-foot wide transgender pride flag on the famous climbing wall on May 20 before taking it down voluntarily.\n\nHanging the flag was their way of saying, “We’re all safe in national parks,” Joslin, 35, told The Associated Press, and their firing sends the opposite message: “If you’re a federal worker and you have any kind of identity that doesn’t agree with this current administration, then you must be silent, or you will be eliminated.”\n\n▶ Read more about the crackdown on demonstrations inside National Parks\n\n Feds offer money for crime tips amid DC police takeover \n\nFederal law enforcement are offering a $500 reward for information leading to an arrest in the nation’s capital as part of the president’s crackdown on crime.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service posted a QR code people can scan to send tips about what federal officials have described as a “crime emergency.”\n\nWashington has historically struggled with crime but has driven violent crime rates down recently. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday morning that there have been more than 550 arrests in Washington, D.C. since Trump ordered the police surge earlier this month.\n\n Trump wants the government to own 10% of Intel Corp. \n\nIntel has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act — money the Trump administration wants converted into non-voting Intel shares. \n\nThis would deepen the Trump administration’s involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.\n\nIt also would make the U.S. government one of Intel’s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world’s largest economy.\n\n▶ Read more about why Trump wants the government to own part of major companies\n\n Trump is leveraging presidential power for Republican control \n\nSome of his steps to intervene in elections — like pushing Republican legislators to redraw maps for GOP advantage — are typical but controversial political maneuvers, taken to his trademark extremes. Other uses of his presidential power have no modern precedent, such as ordering his Department of Justice to investigate the main liberal fundraising entity, ActBlue, and demanding detailed voter files from each state.\n\nThen came Trump’s falsehood-filled rant on social media pledging to lead a “movement” to outlaw voting machines and mail balloting.\n\n“Those are actions that you don’t see in healthy democracies,” said Ian Bassin, executive director of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that has sued the Trump administration. “Those are actions you see in authoritarian states.”\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s attempts to predetermine the results of U.S. elections\n\n Evacuating for a hurricane could expose immigrants to deportation \n\nNatural disasters have long posed singular risks for people without permanent legal status. But with the arrival of peak Atlantic hurricane season, immigrants and their advocates say Trump’s militaristic immigration enforcement agenda has increased the danger.\n\nPlaces considered neutral spaces by immigrants such as schools, hospitals and emergency management agencies are now suspect, and many local first responders now collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For people without legal documents, this can mean having to choose between physical safety and avoiding detention. The fear can extend into disaster recovery as agencies share information with deportation agents.\n\nIn past disasters, the Department of Homeland Security said it would suspend immigration enforcement, but that’s now unclear. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said CBP hasn’t issued guidance “because there have been no natural disasters affecting border enforcement.”\n\n▶ Read more about the dilemmas immigrants now face in natural disasters\n\n Hundreds of federal health employees sign a letter protesting Kennedy’s actions \n\nThe employees at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies have signed a letter charging that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has endangered their lives and the rest of the public.\n\nThe two-page letter sent to Kennedy and members of Congress cites his anti-science rhetoric, denigration of federal workers, layoffs affecting public health programs and Kennedy’s decision to replace members of a vaccine advisory panel with a handpicked group that includes some anti-vaccine advocates.\n\nIt faults Kennedy’s delayed response to an Aug. 8 shooting at the CDC’s main campus in Atlanta. And it asks Kennedy to stop spreading false health information, affirm the CDC’s scientific integrity, and guarantee the safety of the HHS workforce.\n\nAbout 400 current employees signed their names, most of them from the CDC but some from the National Institutes of Health and other health agencies. Also signing the document are some noted former CDC leaders, including former acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat.","summary":"The first domino in a growing national redistricting battle is likely to fall Wednesday as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature is expected to pass a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-texas-gop-house-of-representatives-kamala-harris-b2811115.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/15/APTOPIX_Election_2026_Redistricting_06487.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 14:45:36","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":352613288,"title":"New Schiff leak claim from whistleblower echoes years of similar accusations","text":"Longtime Trump political foe Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff for years has been accused of leaking classified documents — long before the release of a \"bombshell\" whistleblower testimony claiming the California lawmaker approved leaking classified information in order to discredit the president during the Russiagate probe, Fox News Digital found. Schiff, who served in the U.S. House for more than two decades before securing his spot in the U.S. Senate in 2024, is facing heightened scrutiny following FBI Director Kash Patel declassifying claims from a Democrat whistleblower that Schiff approved the release of classified information on Trump that allegedly \"would be used to indict President TRUMP,\" according to the report. The whistleblower, who reportedly had worked for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee for more than 10 years, made the claims to the FBI in 2017. Schiff had access to classified information while serving on the House Intelligence Committee during his tenure in the lower chamber, including serving as its chair from 2019 to 2023. \"In this meeting, SCHIFF stated the group would leak classified information which was derogatory to President of the United States DONALD J. TRUMP. SCHIFF stated the information would be used to indict President TRUMP,\" according to the whistleblower documents. WHITE HOUSE REACTS TO DEM WHISTLEBLOWER’S ‘BOMBSHELL’ CLAIM SCHIFF LEAKED TO HIT TRUMP The whistleblower \"stated this would be illegal and, upon hearing his concerns, unnamed members of the meeting reassured that they would not be caught leaking classified information,\" the report added. Schiff has denied the allegations, with his office telling Fox News Digital Aug. 12 that the allegations were \"absolutely and categorically false.\" But this isn't the first time Schiff has been accused of leaking classified information to the public, with accusations following him since at least the first Trump administration. Fox News Digital took a look back at Schiff's political history in recent years and gathered the times he previously had been accused of leaking classified materials. The August declassified whistleblower accusations are \"just the latest in a series of defamatory attacks from the President and his allies meant to distract from their plummeting poll numbers and the Epstein files scandal,\" a Schiff spokesperson told Fox Digital when approached for comment on the allegations, after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the whistleblower's account a \"bombshell.\" TRUMP-FOE ADAM SCHIFF DISMISSES TULSI GABBARD'S DECLASSIFIED RUSSIA COLLUSION INTELLIGENCE AS 'DISHONEST' \"These baseless smears are based on allegations that were found to be not reliable, not credible, and unsubstantiated from a disgruntled former staffer who was fired by the House Intelligence Committee for cause in early 2017, including for harassment and potentially compromising activity on official travel for the Committee,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Even Trump’s own Justice Department and an independent inspector general found this individual to not be credible, have ‘little support for their contentions’ and was of ‘unknown reliability,’ and concluded that his accusations against Members of Congress and congressional staff ‘were not ultimately substantiated.’\" ‘Leaked classified information that had been provided to him’ Just days after former President Joe Biden was sworn-in as president in January 2021, Trump's former acting director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador from his first administration Ric Grenell took to X to list out \"facts\" regarding Schiff. \"Facts,\" a Jan. 22, 2021, post on X that is no longer available on the social media site read. The X post received media attention and was preserved in reports at the time, such as the Washington Examiner. He listed off: \"Schiff wouldn’t return my call to coordinate on DNI reforms. - the reforms were asked for by career officials for years. -Schiff complained when I appointed the 1st female head of counterterrorism (a career person). -Schiff & team regularly leaked classified information.\" Grenell's message was in response to Schiff claiming in an interview with The Hill that Grennell and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe under the first Trump administration \"bent intelligence work products to the president’s will.\" TRUMP INVOKES RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX WHILE CALLING FOR LONGTIME FOE SCHIFF TO FACE JAIL TIME \"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, probably the most devastated of all of the agencies by terrible leadership of people like Rick Grenell and John Ratcliffe,\" Schiff said during a video interview at the time. Fast-forward to 2023, former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who served under the first Trump administration, also accused Schiff of leaking classified docs. \"Adam Schiff lied to the American people, and during my time as CIA director and secretary of State, I know that he leaked classified information that had been provided to him,\" Pompeo said in January 2023 during a Fox News interview. Pompeo continued that he \"held back\" sharing information with the House Intelligence Committee due to not feeling \"comfortable\" when Schiff led the panel. A representative for Pompeo told Fox Digital in August that the former Trump official stands by his 2023 comments on Schiff. Schiff's office slammed Pompeo's remarks at the time as \"another patently false and defamatory statement.\" Trump had also accused Schiff of leaking classified documents under his first administration, claiming in 2018, he was the \"one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.\" \"Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\" Trump continued wrote in one X thread at the time. Schiff shot back at the time that Trump's X post was a \"false smear.\" \"Mr. President, I see you’ve had a busy morning of ‘Executive Time.’ Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else,\" Schiff responded to Trump in February 2018. As Trump railed against the alleged leaks during his first term, reports spread that the Department of Justice subpoenaed Apple for account data of House Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, including Schiff, between 2017 and 2018. The DOJ, which was led by Jeff Sessions at the time, was searching for individuals who leaked to the media about Trump's alleged ties to Russia. The investigation dragged, including after Bill Barr was tapped as Trump's attorney general in 2019 through the end of Trump's first term, the New York Times reported in 2021, citing sources familiar with the investigation. The Justice Department's internal watchdog, under the Biden administration, opened an investigation into the subpoenas and published a report in 2024 that found the Trump DOJ did not comply with established procedures when it sought the records. \"We are glad that the Department of Justice Inspector General conducted a thorough investigation, and that the Inspector General has recommended safeguards to further protect the media, and to safeguard the separation of powers,\" a spokesperson for Schiff said following the release of the report, according to Reuters in 2024. As the 2020 campaign heated up, Trump continued accusing Schiff and other House Democrats of leaking, with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence at the time scaling back its security briefings with Congress that year as high-profile Democrats promoted concerns that Russia was interfering in that election. \"Director Ratcliffe brought information into the committee, and the information leaked,\" Trump said in August 2020. \"Whether it was Shifty Schiff or somebody else, they leaked the information. … And what’s even worse, they leaked the wrong information. And he got tired of it. So he wants to do it in a different forum, because you have leakers on the committee.\" Schiff denied leaking any classified intelligence in 2020, but said he could not confirm the same for other House Democrats. \"I haven’t. My staff hasn’t. I can’t speak for what all the members of the committee have done or not done, including a lot of the Republican members,\" Schiff told CNN’s Dana Bash in 2020, following Trump claiming \"Shifty Schiff\" may have been behind another leak of intelligence given to the House Intelligence Committee at the time. The Trump administration continued its laser-focused hunt to identify and suss out internal federal government leakers during the second administration, with a White House official telling Axios in June, \"We are declaring a war on leakers.\" The comment came in response to a leak of an internal assessment of the Trump administration's bombing a trio of Iranian nuclear facilities that claimed the strikes were not ads effective as the president said. Federal agencies such as the FBI, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security have leveraged using polygraph tests on staffers suspected of leaking information under the second Trump administration. Alleged mortgage fraud, ‘Russiagate’ Trump and Schiff have long been political foes. This was underscored during Trump's first administration when Schiff served as the lead House manager during the first impeachment trial against Trump in 2020. It also was highlighted when Schiff repeatedly promoted claims that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. FEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL SUBMITTED SCHIFF CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO DOJ OVER MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS Schiff landed in hot water earlier this spring, when the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to the Department of Justice in May sounding the alarm that in \"multiple instances,\" Schiff allegedly \"falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.\" He is currently under criminal investigation for mortgage fraud, Fox Digital previously reported. The California Democrat has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the matter is a \"baseless attempt at political retribution.\" Days after Trump first posted about Schiff's mortgages in Maryland and California in July, the president's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified documents that reportedly show \"overwhelming evidence\" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team allegedly laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump–Russia collusion probe after Trump's election win against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"It lays out, these over 100 documents that you're referencing, that I declassified and released, spells out in great detail exactly what happens when you have some of the most powerful people in our country directly leading at the helm, President Obama and his senior-most national security cabinet, James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper and Susan Rice and others, essentially making a very intentional decision to create this manufactured, politicized piece of intelligence with the objective of subverting the will of the American people,\" Gabbard told Fox News' Sean Hannity in July following the release. Schiff was an incredibly vocal lawmaker amid the Russian collusion claims, most notably when the House censured him in 2023 over his promotion that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff served in the House representing California from 2001 to 2024, when he was sworn-in as a senator after his successful 2024 campaign to serve in the nation's upper chamber. Schiff also served on the Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the breach of the Capitol building in 2021 by Trump supporters following then-President Biden's election win. At the 11th hour of Biden's tenure on Jan. 20, Schiff was among lawmakers who served on the committee who were granted preemptive pardons. The subcommittee concluded Trump's actions played a key role in promoting the breach of the Capitol and recommended Trump be criminally prosecuted. TRUMP ACCUSES 'SCAM ARTIST' SCHIFF OF LYING ABOUT MARYLAND HOME TO COMMIT MORTGAGE FRAUD Biden specifically granted preemptive pardons to \"Members of Congress and staff who served on the Select Committee, and the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the Select Committee.\" Schiff, however, had publicly railed against the prospect of Biden doling out preemptive pardons, saying it would set a poor precedent. \"First, those of us on the committee are very proud of the work we did. We were doing vital quintessential oversight of a violent attack on the Capitol,\" Schiff said during an interview on ABC News in December 2024. \"So I think it’s unnecessary.\" \"But second, the precedent of giving blanket pardons, preemptive blanket pardons on the way out of an administration, I think is a precedent we don’t want to set,\" he added. Charges stemming from the Jan. 6 case were dismissed following Trump's decisive win in the 2024 presidential election against then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The White House responded to the whistleblower's declassified testimony claiming Schiff approved the release of classified information to damage Trump, and doubled down on Trump's stance that Schiff be \"held accountable for the countless lies he told the American people in relation to the Russiagate scandal.\" \"This is obviously a bombshell whistleblower report,\" Leavitt said at a Tuesday White House press briefing. \"Hopefully more people in this room will cover it as such.\" \"I understand Kash Patel, last night, declassified a 302 FBI document showing that a whistleblower, who is a Democrat, a career intelligence officer who worked for Democrats on the House Intel Committee for more than a decade, repeatedly warned the FBI in 2017 that then-Rep. Adam Schiff had approved leaking classified information to smear then-President Donald Trump over the Russiagate scandal,\" Leavitt said. In August, a representative for Schiff confirmed a legal defense fund was established for the senator in response to Trump and his allies. \"It’s clear that Donald Trump and his MAGA allies will continue weaponizing the justice process to attack Senator Schiff for holding this corrupt administration accountable,\" Marisol Samayoa, a spokesperson for Schiff, told Fox News Digital Tuesday evening of the legal fund. \"This fund will ensure he can fight back against these baseless smears while continuing to do his job.\" Titled \"Senator Schiff Legal Defense Fund,\" the fund was filed with the Internal Revenue Service Thursday, The New York Times first reported. White House spokesman Harrison Fields called Schiff a \"fraud\" and \"corrupt politician\" when approached for comment Tuesday regarding the legal fund. \"Adam Schiff is a sleazy and corrupt politician who betrayed his oath to the Constitution by prioritizing his selfish and personal animosity toward the President over the interests of the American people,\" Fields told Fox News Digital. \"No amount of money can shield Adam from the truth that he is a fraud.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to Schiff for additional comment on the matter but did not immediately receive a reply. Fox News Digital's Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.","summary":"Sen.

Gavin Newsom has figured out the best way to get under President Trump’s skin. \n\nAct like him. \n\nIn a bid to provoke Trump and mobilize his supporters within the Democratic Party, Newsom has adopted strategies reminiscent of Trump’s tactics, emulating everything from the former president’s social media behavior to his fiery speeches.\n\nRecently, the governor of California has highlighted his own “amazing” midterm redistricting plan and his “amazing” rally as a nod to Trump’s boastful style.\n\nNewsom has started to write his social media posts in ALL CAPS, just like the president. \n\nMoreover, Newsom has coined a Trump-like moniker for the ex-president: TACO, an abbreviation for Trump Always Chickens Out, a nickname that emerged on Wall Street in response to Trump’s tariff actions and is meant to irritate the White House.\n\nThis approach has attracted considerable media attention, winning points from within the Democratic ranks who are keen to see their leaders stand firm against Trump.\n\nThe HuffPost on Tuesday featured him with the headline “He’s on a troll” showing Newsom smiling. During a segment on “The Five,” Fox News discussed his attempts to echo Trump’s style.\n\n“Democrats are done with being the nice guy party,” expressed Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who was Kamala Harris’s communications director in the vice president’s office. “Defending Democratic principles doesn’t require adhering to old norms, and Newsom is particularly demonstrating he’s willing to match Trump’s tactics.”\n\nSince losing the election in November, Democrats have been rudderless and for the most part, leaderless, desperately trying to find their way out of the wilderness.\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll out late last month showed Democrats’ popularity at the lowest point in three decades. The poll showed that 63 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of Democratic Party while 33 percent of voters have a favorable view. \n\nBut Newsom’s recent strategy has given the party a shot in the arm, Simmons and other strategists have said. \n\n“Gavin Newsom is capturing the hearts and minds of Democrats,” Simmons said, adding that “people who don’t do politics for a living are asking about him and they really like him.” \n\nAnthony Coley, a Democratic strategist who served in the Biden administration, agreed, saying “watching him go toe-to-toe with Trump on social media an arena Trump has dominated for a decade is refreshing, energizing and even fun to watch for many Democrats.” \n\nA new survey out this week by Echelon Insights showed Newsom surging in a 2028 poll among likely candidates. The poll taken from August 14 to August 18 a period when Newsom dominated headlines shows the California governor in second place at 13 percent behind Harris who received 26 percent. \n\nIn recent days, Newsom’s press officeclearly aware of the traction the governor has been getting with his new Trumpian tack— has continued to needle Trump by continuing to echo him. \n\nBut the account isn’t just targeting Trump. It’s also going after Vice President JD Vance. On Monday the account edited a photo of the vice president onto the body of Australian breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn, who made headlines last year for a mediocre performance. \n\nThe account also targeted other Republicans including Dana Perino, the former White House press secretary turned television host, after she slammed him for being unserious. \n\n“You have to stop it with the Twitter thing,” Perino said on Monday. “If I were his wife, I would say: You are making a fool of yourself, stop it…He’s got a big job as governor of California, but if he wants an even bigger job, he has to be a little more serious.” \n\nSupport for Newsom’s social media efforts appeared to be growing. As of Tuesday afternoon, the X account Newsom’s press office had nearly 400,000 followers. \n\nBut Kevin Madden, the longtime Republican strategist, said Democrats are making a mistake to focus on “communications tactics” when they should be focused on messaging. \n\n“Newsom’s strategy and approach has been reflective of that,” Madden said. “He’s got a new podcast and a more aggressive social media presence, but other than more clicks and downloads has that shifted the dynamics or public debate in his favor, or improved the national party brand?\n\n“So far, there is little evidence of that,” Madden added. “It has, though, positioned him at the top of the party’s internal process of sorting out the next generation of national candidates and leaders.” \n\nDemocratic strategist Christy Setzer said Newsom’s “trolling” has two main audiences: “Democrats who want someone, anyone, to take on Trump in a real way and the media, who Democrats feel have normalized too much of Trump’s insanity.” \n\n“I’m surprised it’s taken Democrats this long to do it,” Setzer said, calling the strategy “pretty brilliant.” \n\n“He’s hoping to get under Trump’s skin, and may have drawn blood on that account [and] is it just me or did Trump stop using the all-caps in his unhinged posts after seeing Newsom’s?” she said. \n\nSetzer added that while “no one will be Trumpier than Trump” the strategy is working. \n\n“…As an attention grabbing tactic, he’s already succeeded,” she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCalifornia Gov.

Our status in the world has been crippled and that will reverberate for decades. \n\n'Making Canada a 51st state? Do you know how offensive that is? And then taking over Greenland and renaming the Gulf of Mexico. The distractions are hilarious,' he added.\n\nA vocal supporter of Joe Biden who then endorsed Kamala Harris in the election, Hamill has never been shy about sharing his dislike for Trump and criticized the president throughout his campaign last year.\n\nIn the weeks after Trump was elected, Hamill said the date he won would 'live in infamy,' an allusion to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that forced the United States to enter World War II.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, who was president at the time, described the Japanese bombing of the US Naval base as 'a date which will live in infamy'. \n\nHe also took issue with Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia last August to commemorate the anniversary of the deaths of the 13 US service members killed during a 2021 bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nTrump was seen posing with the families of the victims while smiling and giving a thumbs up.\n\n'Nothing to see here. Just the tone-deaf draft dodger gleefully giving a thumbs-up at the graves of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country,' Hamill wrote in response. \n\nIn his latest interview, the outspoken Democrat expressed optimism and shared why he didn't leave the US after Trump's election victory.\n\n'I still believe there are more honest, decent people than there are the MAGA crowd. If I didn't, I'd move back to England,' he quipped.\n\nHe revealed that, at one point, he had considered emigrating like many other celebrities have since Trump retook the White House.\n\nHe told The Times that he gave his wife, Marilou York, the option to move to London or Ireland.\n\n'She's very clever,' Hamill said. 'She didn't respond right away but a week later she said, \"I'm surprised you would allow him to force you out of your own country.\" That son of a bitch, I thought. I'm not leaving.'\n\nHamill and his wife live in Malibu, California. Their home was spared in the Los Angeles wildfires that burned for weeks in January. \n\nHe was one of the thousands who had to evacuate amid the Palisades fire, which scorched more than 23,000 acres of land, destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.\n\nA White House spokeswoman responded to Hamill and slammed him in a statement to Fox News.\n\n'Since Mark has decided to stay in the United States, he will get to enjoy the many wins President Trump is securing for the American people - and really, who can blame him for seconding guessing a plan to move to the same place as Rosie O'Donnell,' the spokeswoman said.\n\nO'Donnell, Trump's arch nemesis from his days as a TV entertainer, revealed that she moved to Ireland full time in March.\n\nEva Longoria, Courtney Love, and Ellen DeGeneres are among other celebrities who have fled the US in part because Trump became president again.","summary":"A famous Star Wars actor made an exaggerated reference to slitting their wrists when discussing Donald Trump winning the 2024 election in a recent interview.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15017731/star-wars-actor-wrist-slitting-analogy-mark-hamill-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/14/101390549-0-image-m-19_1755696185930.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/05/03/3235312126537805998/1024x576_MP4_3235312126537805998.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 14:19:59","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.132},{"id":352602334,"title":"MAGA Loyalists Slam Kamala Harris’ Stepdaughter After Catching Her Alleged ‘Hypocrisy’ – “Poor Ella is Suffering…”","text":"�\b\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0003���6�(�;�\u00140s�-�$ER�j�=��d<�N|����u|zA$$�M\u0011\f\u0001�Z���\u000ew�8{�}�ϻ�}�����B�P(T=��y�\"\u001cOG\u0006��\u001fN\r��dB/G\u0006�\u000e�L��\u000f�M6M�9i��K�������\b��\u0019N9\u0011#�7��}��!\u000fR��\u0013:i���N�`���$}���=x�*z���]̖Iʂs\"��yE'\r���!��~�0\u001e\u0019�hd{5_�̾�76�?\u000f�G��G�qM\"Nv\u0015pR�D8 P�U.��a^��\u001f �ᧀr�\u0001���æ\u001e�l�\u001b\rstr\u0015D�s�Z�}���z�px*3��\\��@��a^�\u0019�����\u001d��\rK��h?� �ࣷ�9Y�l\u0019\u001b\u0016����\u001bk���\u001a��j`��sr*���L�j�X���ݺJ0��\f�yV����\u001f\u001a\u0005Z��Vݬ�������ޕ��S\u0014,o�S�\u000681��w�lX`����\f)I���BHJ�~�IzA�\u0011TVMT�˚\u0011\u0019\u0019)\u0011�4F\u0013\u001cqb\u001cOX�P�(b\u0013$�~�ȅq\u000edD%\b��B��BdJ��,g��E������P�\u001b����\u0012�XB�޶\u0016��\u0007�\n,aZ��\u0019�i^\u001b��F!��\u001a��C\n\r��,$oV \u0019�F��y����g߽9������jϬ\u001b�fݎšq\u0010-B�\u001bT\u000e� �_�hA\u000e\u000f\r���[�~���.\u0019H\u0019�8C�4��\u000b�d\rA8L=42�̺⋱H �+S�g��\r�\u0004I�u8^���M�@�\u0001�c\u0012����O�q�EƟ\u0017$]���\u0000�?�����-���0ץ��䊔�FX�L���\u0015���\u0019�#ӵ��sX\r�\u001f�'���\u0007�%�&�X5����g\u0011��u� &��z�z5%���SM�}�~����DH�k��(c�%�66\u000b��Ɔ%��{�ͪ\u001br�L�Q�ק�]Q\u0004��\u0012\fو����\u0014!��.

Current And Former Officials","text":"The Donald Trump administration revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, according to a memo posted by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. In the memo, shared on X (formerly Twitter), Tulsi Gabbard accused the officials of engaging in the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence” to advance partisan goals, failing to safeguard classified material and neglecting professional standards.\nWho Are In The List Of Officials Stripped Of Security Clearances?\nThe list includes former officials who left government service years ago, some of whom worked on matters that have long angered Donald Trump- including the intelligence community’s 2017 assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit him. Several of the officials also signed a 2019 letter critical of Donald Trump that was circulated online last month by conservative activist Laura Loomer.\nThe action reflects Donald Trump’s longstanding distrust of career intelligence officers as during his first term, he stripped former CIA director John Brennan of his clearance and since returning to office has also revoked those of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.\nDecision Criticised, Tulsi Gabbard Defends\nNational security lawyer Mark Zaid, who said his own clearance was revoked, called the latest move “unlawful and unconstitutional”. He said, “These decisions deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action.” He described the administration’s rationale as “hypocritical”, arguing it was Donald Trump officials who had politicised intelligence.\nDefending the decision, Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X, “Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right. Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.”","summary":"Defending the decision, Tulsi Gabbard wrote on X, “Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right.\"","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/us-spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-strips-security-clearances-of-37-current-and-former-officials-ws-l-9517620.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/03/Tulsi-Gabbard-2-2025-03-44ab816dcb03a2d332ce43777b940c2b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 13:59:02","author":"Mallika Soni,News18","authors":["Mallika Soni","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":352583018,"title":"Texas House Set to Vote on New Redistricting Plan as Protests Continue","text":"The long battle over Texas’ congressional map may reach a resolution on Wednesday, as Texas representatives prepare to vote on the proposed changes following delays caused by House Democrats.\n\nTexas Republicans first called a special legislative session in June aimed at securing five additional House seats for President Donald Trump.\n\nPreviously, lawmakers were unable to vote because many House Democrats broke quorum and left the state in protest, leading the House to adjourn.\n\nTuesday’s vote, part of a second special legislative session, comes as protests are expected outside the Texas state Capitol.\n\nTexas Capitol grounds closed after threat\n\nReports of a social media threat prompted the evacuation and closure of the state Capitol, with lawmakers still inside, on Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities reported that an online message was posted, urging others to head to the Capitol to harm those “preventing lawmakers from leaving,” as reported by affiliate KXAN.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety said it was working to identify the person who posted the message.\n\nTexas Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy LILY JOBSON, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:13:49 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:14:15 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nRhian Sugden showed off the striking difference in her appearance since undergoing a breast reduction and lift surgery in an Instagram video on Wednesday. \nThe glamour model, 38, went from a 32HH to a 32E cup size after going under the knife in June.\nLoving her new look, mother-of-one Rhian continued to display the incredible results on social media.\nSharing before and after videos of her breasts pre and post surgery, Rhian looked incredibly confident and happy with the results. \nShe wrote: 'Love love love my boobs. No implants, just a reduction and uplift by the amazing Dr Hussain @pallmallcosmetics❤️'\nIn a clip posted on social media before going under the knife, Rhian revealed her nipples were in fact 11cm lower than they should have been after 'gravity took its toll' following the birth of her son George, one. \n\nRhian Sugden, 38, showed off the striking difference in her appearance since undergoing a breast reduction and lift surgery in an Instagram video on Wednesday (pictured left post surgery, right pre surgery)\n\nLoving her new look, mother-of-one Rhian has continued to display the incredible results on social media\nShe said: 'I'm a bit paranoid about that and I just can't to wait to have them a bit smaller, perkier, uplifted, it's so exciting.' \nRhian continued: 'My cup size at the minute is a 34GG, I can fit into a H, and it's just so difficult to buy a decent bra these days.\n'Bikinis, I can't even find one to get into because my frame is so small and my boobs are so big so it's quite difficult. My back ache, ugh, honestly I must have to get a massage like once a week to try and ease the pain and tension in my back.\n'I swim a hell of a lot and I think because my boobs are so big, when I swim my back arches up because they push out the water. \n'So even swimming is difficult for me at the moment, not to mention not being able to get into a swimsuit. Having this reduction is literally going to change my life.'\nDespite Rhian being happier than ever with her new figure, she revealed she had been inundated with messages from trolls criticising her decision.\nIn an Instagram Story that expired, she hit back at her critics as she revealed she had no concern with scarring and that she couldn't understand why anyone felt the need to comment on her decision.\nShe added in a cheeky quip that the comments were coming from men who were 'never going to touch or be near her breasts', so it didn't concern her. \n\nSharing before and after videos of her breasts pre and post surgery, Rhian looked incredibly confident and happy with the results\n\nShe wrote: 'Love love love my boobs. No implants, just a reduction and uplift by the amazing Dr Hussain @pallmallcosmetics❤️'\n\nRhian pictured before going under the knife, with her cup size a 32HH, which she said led to back pains as well as stress finding outfits that would fit her perfectly \n\n Rhian Sugden opens up about why she underwent breast reduction in clip from before surgery \nGiving an update to Instagram earlier this month post surgery, Rhian revealed how she has already improved her swimming due to her much more 'streamlined' figure.\nPosing for a selfie in a yellow cami, Rhian said she had 'never felt happier' and was feeling much more confident. \nWhile Rhian previously shared how her husband Oliver Mellor was 'gutted' over her breast reduction, he's now comparing her to Pamela Anderson.\nSpeaking to The Sun post-op, she beamed: 'Oliver was a bit nervous at first because he likes big boobs and he was worried about the scarring.\n'But he can't believe how well they've turned out. He's very pleased with them. He says I look like Pammy (Anderson) again because they're so perky.\n'They look good and they're still a good size. A decent handful for him.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRhian Sugden reveals the striking difference after her breast reduction and lift - after going from a 32HH to a 32E cup size\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 13\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:14:07 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:14:10 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nPrincess Andre has admitted she fears her mother Katie Price's legs 'might snap' as she expressed concern for the star's thin frame.\nThe former glamour model, 47, has sparked concerns among fans over her rapid weight loss in recent months, revealing she weighed just 7st 12lb back in June.\nKatie and Princess have been spending time together after the 18-year-old's reality show was said to have caused a rift between them.\nIn a video uploaded to Katie's snapchat, the star can be seen walking across a tightrope in a local park. \nHer incredibly thin frame was noticeable in the clip as she sported a pair of white shorts and a black T-shirt. \n\nPrincess Andre has admitted she fears her mother Katie Price's legs 'might snap' as she expressed concern for the star's thin frame\n\nThe former glamour model, 47, has sparked concerns among fans over her rapid weight loss in recent months, revealing she weighed just 7st 12lb back in June\nPrincess, who was behind the camera, said: 'Your legs might snap mum!' \nKatie wrote over the clip: 'What Princess said about my legs.'\nThe TV personality previously admitted her parents have shared their concern that she might have an eating disorder - which she denied. \nSpeaking on Katie's podcast The Katie Price Show, her sister Sophie told Katie their mother Amy had called her to share her worries over her continuing weight loss.\nSophie said: 'Mum called me the other day and said I'm going to have a word with Kate because she's too thin. I think mum saw a picture on Instagram and she wasn't happy.'\nHowever, Katie replied: 'My legs do look thin, but I like it,' putting an end to the conversation.\nMeanwhile, Katie took to her Instagram on Wednesday and revealed she pulled stitches out of her face after getting another face lift in Turkey.\nThe star filmed herself in her car and told how she had 'ripped' a stitch out above her lip and also tried to remove another around her eye.\nIn the clip, she said: 'Good morning. I went to take a stitch out myself last night and I sort of ripped it across there and it's so sore. And then I tried to get one out there, so sore.'\n\nIt comes after Princess hit back at claims she was embroiled in a family feud with her mother. \nJust days before the launch of the TikTok star's new ITV2 show, The Princess Diaries, the former glamour model said she was 'upset' after alleging she was banned from filming scenes for the series, which follows a string of recent events, including her daughter's 18th birthday party, where Katie says she was also not welcome.\n\nIn a video uploaded to Katie's snapchat, the star can be seen walking across a tightrope in a local park\nBut speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, Princess explained any fallout from Katie's outburst at not being involved in her TV debut will be dealt with behind closed doors, as she insisted: 'It's my show, it's not based on my parents, it's focused on me. To be honest there's no rift between me and either of my parents.'\nViewers will see Princess celebrate turning 18 on her show and although Katie wasn't at the party, thrown by her father, singer Peter Andre, 52, the teen stands firm that her mother was never banned from attending.\nShe said: 'What I would usually do, as I've done my whole life, would be to spend the morning with one parent and the evening with the other.\n'As it happened, mum ended up being away, and dad had already decided to throw me a last minute birthday party, which we filmed for the show.\n'But anyhow, it would be weird if both parents were in the same room, as I'm sure a lot of people out there with divorced parents can relate to.'\nKatie expressed her frustrations at being 'disrespected' and 'disregarded', saying she longed to be by her daughter's side as she follows in the footsteps of her famous reality TV parents and bids to take over their crown.\nMeanwhile, Princess also weighed in on why she doesn't get involved in her father Peter and mother Katie Price's public feud following their bitter split 16 years ago.\n\nPrincess has spoken about why she doesn't get involved in her father Peter and mother Katie's public feud following their bitter split 16 years ago\n\nPeter and Katie pictured together during their relationship in 2004\n\nTensions hit fever pitch recently when Peter, 52, released a statement branding his ex-wife, 47, a liar after years of 'staying silent' for the sake of their children \nThe influencer admitted it is 'not worth' weighing in on their rows. Tensions hit fever pitch recently when Peter, 52, released a statement branding his ex-wife a liar after years of 'staying silent' for the sake of their children.\nIn response to Katie's claims that they have 'always shared the kids', Peter insisted that they moved in with him in 2018 'for their safety' as he accused her of falsehoods.\nHowever, despite their back and forth, Princess has revealed she won't be having her own say to either parent because she doesn't believe it will do any good.\nWhen asked whether she would contact her mum to discuss it, Princess told the Guardian: 'No, she says, it's not worth it. Mum can be annoyed about something and then we send each other a message and we're fine.'\nWhen asked if it isn't easy having parents, Princess said: 'No. Especially divorced parents.'\nDuring the same interview, Princess also sweetly claimed she didn't want to paint her mother in a bad light because she is 'more stable' than she has been in years.\nPrincess said: 'This is going to come across really bad, isn't it?' she asks. 'Like, it's talking about how Mum's a mess and Dad is stable, d'you know what I mean?'\n'Right now, Mum is completely different to how she was four years ago. If we're talking about the past, yes, my dad was more stable and Mum is naturally more crazy than my dad.'\nKatie PricePrincess Andre\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPrincess Andre's fears for her mother Katie Price as glamour model's legs look so thin they could 'snap' - as she she rips the stitches out of her new facelift\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Paramount said the settlement will also include Trump’s legal fees and costs, adding that the $16 million, minus the legal costs, will go toward Trump’s presidential library.\n\n“As part of the settlement, Paramount also agreed to release transcripts of ’60 Minutes’ interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns. The settlement does not include an apology,” noted the New York Times.\n\nShari Redstone reportedly wanted to explore a settlement with Trump, with some speculating that it may have stemmed from needing the Trump administration’s approval in a multi-billion dollar sale of the company to Skydance. Speaking with the New York Times, Redstone said she was pleased with the final outcome.\n\n“I believe it was always in Paramount’s best interest to settle,” Redstone said. “We may not like the world we live in, but a board has to do what’s in the best interest of shareholders.”\n\n“How did they do it? I don’t know, and I didn’t ask,” she said, adding that the deal was a “no-brainer.”\n\nRedstone also said critics of the deal were speaking out of ignorance. She also thought the president’s lawsuit could help root out anti-Israel bias at CBS.\n\n“We needed more balance,” she said, adding, “Part of me thought, maybe Trump could accomplish what I never got done.”\n\nIn the same interview, Redstone also said that reactions to October 7 — the massacring of an estimated 1,200 Israelis and subsequent kidnapping by Hamas — influenced her decision to sell CBS.\n\n“Once that happened, I wanted out,” she told the Times. “I wanted to support Israel, and address issues around antisemitism and racism.”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

What's up TikTok? - White House goes live with Donald Trump on TikTok","text":"APTikTok. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)\n\nWhite House launched an official TikTok account on Tuesday, taking advantage of the short video app's more than 170 million U.S. users to spread the messages of President Donald Trump. Trump has a soft spot for the popular app, crediting it with helping him gain support among young voters when he defeated Democrat Kamala Harris in the November 2024 presidential election.Lawmakers in Washington worry, however, that its U.S. user data could fall into the hands of China's government. Trump has been working on a deal for U.S. investors to buy the app from TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance.Past intelligence assessments have said the app's owners are beholden to the Chinese government and that it could be used to influence Americans.The new account, @whitehouse, went live on Tuesday evening with an initial video showing footage of Trump as he declares: \"I am your voice.\" \"America we are BACK! What's up TikTok?\" the caption read.The TikTok account Trump used for his presidential campaign last year, @realdonaldtrump, has more than 15 million followers. The Republican president also relies heavily on his Truth Social account to deliver his message and posts occasionally on his X account.Live Events\"The Trump administration is committed to communicating the historic successes President Trump has delivered to the American people with as many audiences and platforms as possible,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\"President Trump's message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign, and we're excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before,\" she said.TikTok Ban in USAA 2024 law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 of this year unless ByteDance had completed divesting the app's U.S. assets or demonstrated significant progress toward a sale. President Trump opted not to enforce the law after he began his second term as president on January 20. He first extended the deadline to early April, then to June 19 and then again to September 17.Extensions to the deadline have drawn criticism from some lawmakers, who argue the Trump administration is flouting the law and ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok.FAQsQ1.

In recent weeks, Newsom's press office has transformed its social media presence into a barrage of all-caps taunts, pop culture spoofs, and AI-generated memes—mocking Trump's style even as it pushes back on Republican policies.\"DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES,\" read an August 11 X post from @GovPressOffice after Trump called for Texas to send \"five more Republicans\" to Congress, which prompted Newsom to hit back with his own plan to send more Democrats from California to Congress.\"BUT IF THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!\" the August 11 post said.Since then, the account has ramped up its trolling efforts against the president and his allies.

The board of Open Society Foundations, the main hub of the Soros grantmaking nexus, elected Alex as its chairman the previous December.\n\nThe elder Soros said he previously didn’t want one of his five children to oversee OSF. However, “he’s earned it,” George said of Alex, then a 37-year-old playboy known for reveling in the Hamptons.\n\n“We think alike,” George told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“I’m more political,” the younger Soros countered in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, his first as successor.\n\nThe ‘more political’ prince\n\nAlex has ingratiated himself with Clinton-era establishment Democrats and curried favor with fresh blood.\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, Alex joined his father in financially backing former President Joe Biden. According to federal campaign finance filings, Alex pumped nearly $727,000 into the Biden Victory Fund. He then visited the Biden White House over two dozen times, making appearances every year of Biden’s presidency, according to archived visitor logs. Two of these visits were with Biden, the “big guy” himself.\n\nIn 2024, Alex Soros gave $500,000 to then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who took over Biden’s campaign coffers after he had dropped out of the race. Days before George Soros publicly ceded control of OSF to his scion, Harris hosted Alex at her private residence for an intimate get-together featuring a few other deep-pocketed Democratic donors, visitation records show. A week later, the younger Soros posted a picture of them “catching up,” though Harris had not acknowledged the meeting on her public schedule.\n\nShortly after the succession announcement, he huddled with several New York Democrats, chief among them House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), “on their quest to take the [sic] back the 2024 majority,” per photos Alex posted of the pow-wow.\n\nAt the 2024 Democratic National Convention, party leaders lined up to kiss Alex’s ring on the heels of his ascension. The younger Soros flaunted photographs capturing him palling around with many high-ranking Democrats, including his “good friend” then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). There, Alex also gave his stamp of approval to “rising star” Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) and posed for a photo-op with Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), whom he fawned over on social media. “Walzified! Walzpilled!” Alex gushed. The next month, Alex welcomed Walz to his high-rise New York City apartment and proudly uploaded photographic proof of the affair.\n\nOn the eve of Election Day, a hopeful Alex predicted a “blue wave” sweeping Michigan and Pennsylvania, with the Harris-Walz ticket winning them by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. His election predictions were way off: Harris lost all seven swing states and the popular vote.\n\nALEX SOROS ADMITS TRUMP WAS A ‘SUPER CANDIDATE’\n\nPerhaps the person who will help Alex sharpen his political acumen is his wife, wired-in political consultant Huma Abedin, once a longtime trusted aide of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhen she was Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Abedin acted as the point person and gatekeeper to the then-U.S. secretary of state. Power brokers reportedly genuflected to Abedin in hopes of earning time with Clinton. According to emails obtained by Judicial Watch, even Clinton’s director of policy planning, Anne-Marie Slaughter, had to appeal to Abedin, a select member of Clinton’s inner circle, to pass along important documents.\n\nFORMER CLINTON AIDE RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ENGAGEMENT TO GEORGE SOROS’S SON\n\nAhead of the 2026 midterm elections, Alex has already spent sizable sums on the reelection bids of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), a vulnerable freshman gearing up to fend off his rumored rival, Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA); Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA), whose congressional district encompasses most of Atlanta; and self-declared “progressive capitalist” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who was an Obama-appointed Commerce Department official now representing Silicon Valley.\n\nLike father, like son\n\nIt is unclear whether Alex Soros is more or less liberal than his father.\n\nThe father-son duo does share a mutual fixation on combating climate change, which is considered Alex’s No. 1 issue.\n\nIn an investigative report for the Media Research Center titled “Eco-Kingpins,” co-collaborator and Soros researcher Matt Palumbo found that OSF, while under George Soros’s care, doled out approximately $194 million between 2016 and 2023 to hundreds of climate activism groups.\n\nAfter a year and a half with Alex Soros in charge, that number ballooned to $619 million, Palumbo discovered, about a $425 million increase in environment-related allocations.\n\nThis means at least 69% of OSF’s climate spending since 2016 came in 2024 on Alex’s watch, Palumbo told the Washington Examiner.\n\nAlex Soros is an ex-advisory board member of Global Witness, an environmental group that pressured Big Tech platforms to censor disfavored content during the 2022 election cycle. Global Witness received one of the Alexander Soros Foundation’s first-ever grants of $250,000 in 2012, when Alex was a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in history at the University of California, Berkeley. (Today, Alex refers to himself online as “Alexander Soros, PhD.”) Alex’s eponymous foundation also annually awarded an environmental activism prize, which Global Witness publicized.\n\nWHAT GEORGE SOROS’S SUCCESSION PLAN MEANS FOR AMERICA\n\nAlex Soros is equally passionate about defending Ukraine against Russia’s forces, vowing in 2022 to “never abandon Ukraine,” as OSF pledged $25 million in assistance.\n\nSince assuming full control of OSF, Alex has had at least four meetings with Andriy Yermak, the “right-hand man” of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and member of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the highest command and control body of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government, during these strategizing meetings, Alex and Yermak discussed Ukraine’s Peace Formula and restoring the nation’s infrastructure and economy, alongside other matters on the war.\n\nOn social media, Alex touts a close relationship with Yermak, who is regarded in Ukrainian media as the second-most influential person in the country. The pair publicly exchange birthday wishes and compliments, like old friends. Last year, Yermak thanked Alex for his “unwavering support for Ukraine.”\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 election season, Alex pledged to spend $50 million of OSF’s funds on increasing civic engagement among women and youth, whom he called the “linchpins of democracy” central to building “a multiracial, multiethnic, and multifaith” United States. Their active participation in the electoral process is critical, Alex urged, citing the overturning of Roe v. Wade and several state-level abortion measures on the ballot after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision.\n\nThe funding, pulled from various 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) entities within the OSF network, focused in particular on engaging “black women and younger women of color” via a handful of social justice organizations. Recipients included Power Rising, which is part of the Black Women’s Leadership Collective, and Run for Something, a political action committee recruiting Democratic candidates who will champion certain left-of-center policies, such as government-controlled healthcare and unrestricted access to abortion. \n\nPortions of the multiyear OSF spending were also set aside for bolstering various liberal causes, such as LGBT rights, “reproductive freedom,” and climate alarmism.\n\nIn response to an inquiry about OSF’s current funding priorities with Alex at the helm, a spokesperson pointed the Washington Examiner to its website, providing an overview of OSF’s philanthropic work in the U.S.\n\nNot-so business savvy, according to critics\n\nIn 2021, Soros Fund Management, of which Alex is the only family member sitting on its investment committee, bet big on a startup electric vehicle company called Rivian, investing $2 billion to buy 19.8 million shares. The score marked one of the largest one-off investments in the firm’s portfolio.\n\nWithin a year, Rivian shares were selling for only $18, and SFM sold at a steep loss of more than 10 million shares, or 75% of its stake. SFM’s total losses are estimated to have climbed to over $1 billion. The website HedgeFollow, which ranks U.S. hedge funds, recently rated Soros Fund Management’s performance as 0.5 out of 5 stars, one of the least successful ratings in the country.\n\n“I would say that Alex is ill-equipped to take on any of his father’s mantels,” Parker Thayer of the Capital Research Center, an influence watchdog, told the Washington Examiner. “He has no talent for investing, as his billion-dollar losses in Rivian prove, and Soros Fund Management is now one of the worst-performing funds in America.”\n\nPalumbo, author of The Heir: Inside the (Not So) Secret Network of Alex Soros, said Alex was a poor choice to lead OSF.\n\n“Anyone that looks his name up on YouTube can see that he’s a horrible public speaker — something he’s even received coaching on to no avail,” Palumbo told the Washington Examiner.\n\nA New York magazine profile of Alex trashing him as the “wrong” leadership pick said his speech pattern, “full of ahs and ums,” can sound like “records skipping, as if he were unable to easily put into language what is clear in his mind.”\n\n“In private he is brooding and cerebral and has a propensity for candor and bursts of hot-temperedness,” the magazine piece, which quoted an anonymous source “with deep OSF ties,” claimed.\n\nA former senior OSF official compared Alex to Roman Roy, a character on the HBO show Succession who is an immature nepo baby. “‘Smart but f***ing impossible and not particularly interested in the details,” the source said. One other Soros insider saw Alex as the prodigal son “who is rewarded with his father’s love despite his wayward years.”\n\nA dynasty in disarray: OSF overhaul\n\nOSF has experienced significant changes under Alex’s leadership, including staffing cuts, consolidated operations, and the embrace of a new operating model “that ensures that every grantmaking dollar is maximized.”\n\nOne month into Alex’s rise to power, OSF announced it had laid off 40% of its staff worldwide. In the throes of the generational transition, OSF also halted the distribution of new grants for at least six months — until February 2024. Finally, following a year of reorganization and grant pauses, OSF started spending again, committing $400 million to go toward green jobs and away from carbon-intensive industries.\n\nAlex said the downsizing at OSF was in line with what his father had envisioned: “He was very upset with the amount of bureaucracy at the foundation. … My only regret is that we didn’t do it faster, because I feel like he wanted that.”\n\nMEET ALEX SOROS, THE 37-YEAR-OLD SUCCESSOR SON TO THE $25 BILLION GEORGE SOROS EMPIRE\n\nAlex Soros’s alleged lack of communication about the organizational overhaul led to tension among OSF’s ranks, sources told the Washington Examiner last year.\n\nSenior staffers said the restructuring has been “incredibly disruptive” to the network’s mission and “caused a lot of discomfort and concern.”\n\n“Why aren’t we hearing from Alex?” one OSF employee questioned during the disarray. “Why aren’t we having meetings with Alex for him to say, ‘Hey, this is the direction of the organization’? I think it’s not clear what direction they’re really trying to go. It would be great if they gave more clarity. Are we planning for the long term? It’s concerning to a lot of staff that there doesn’t seem to be clarity for the long term.”\n\nAccording to internal emails sent to staff around the time of this pivot in priorities, Alex asserted that OSF “won’t always” find ideas “in the old places we found them in the past.” \n\nThayer said the younger Soros seems to be narrowing OSF’s field of focus, particularly placing emphasis on U.S. operations.\n\n“Alex wants to take OSF in a more politically involved direction and focus less on the international work that his father was famous for,” Thayer said. “Their ideas are largely the same, but Alex’s methods are much less subtle.”\n\nBeyond courting U.S. politicians, Alex has rubbed elbows with many world leaders, sharing one-on-one pictures with heads of state from all over the globe, including those of Albania, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Kosovo, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Ukraine, to name a few.\n\nAlex, however, has faced accusations claiming he is not aligned with his predecessor’s Eurocentric agenda. In an interview for the Financial Times this year, Alex affirmed his identity as “a committed European.”\n\nGEORGE SOROS FOUNDATION’S CUTS IN EUROPE ANGER BENEFICIARIES\n\nIn August 2023, amid rumors of a “Soros retreat” from Europe, Alex denied suspicions that OSF was withdrawing from the continent altogether. “We are not leaving,” he declared in a Politico op-ed, clarifying that OSF is simply shifting priorities in Europe accordingly, “as OSF retools the way it works globally.” That entailed “exiting some areas of work” and a wide-ranging headcount reduction, he acknowledged. “It is my great hope that the Open Society Foundations, in its reconfigured form, will be able to help the European project realize its full promise,” he wrote.\n\nThayer said, “The only place I can see Alex taking the Soros brand is into the void. \n\n“He’s burning through money, laying off staff, changing leadership, and has very little to show for it thus far besides a used-up checkbook. Alex is getting all of the photo-ops and meetings that he wants, but despite narrowing his focus to the U.S., the idea of ‘open society’ has never been more dead.”\n\nA transparency tactic?\n\nAccording to the New York magazine profile of Alex, unabashedly posting about his hobnobbing has caused “PR headache[s]” in the past, “a testament to a certain indifference to public opinion on Alex’s part — or perhaps a lack of awareness.” He likes to collect “shiny objects,” a former OSF higher-up told the magazine.\n\nAlex told the Wall Street Journal it was better for the Soros family to operate in full view of the public rather than allow stories to run wild about them being shadowy financiers. “There’s a view that we are some sort of hidden conspiracy,” Alex said.\n\n“Unlike his father, Alex hasn’t hidden in the shadows and posts many of his meetings with top politicians and world leaders on his social media,” Palumbo said, “so his persona is a relevant factor in his capacity as a leader.”\n\nIf his hyperactivity across social media and globetrotting exploits are any indication, Alex is venturing to be as ubiquitous as the George Soros name, observers suspect. Still, only time will tell if Alex is ushering in a new era of the Soros empire or bringing about the beginning of the end.\n\n“[Alex] doesn’t seem to have the same talent for political maneuvering and networking,” Thayer said. “He certainly has a good photo album of meetings with prominent Democrats, but that doesn’t mean much. He seems much more focused on showmanship than real power.”","summary":"Democratic megadonor George Soros just turned 95.
