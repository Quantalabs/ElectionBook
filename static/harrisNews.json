If you’re among those who believe that, brace yourself. \n\nThe worst is yet to come.\n\nA serious push is underway to move the party even further away from the political center, embrace economic plans close to pure socialism and launch radical woke culture battles. \n\nIt sounds like a bad joke, but it’s really happening. And it’s a movement that goes beyond the socialist fever dreams of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria -Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAlthough some of the push is a reaction to Donald Trump’s election in November and his embrace of America First policies, the fury reflects more than just Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nConsider the lead sentence in a recent fundraising email. \n\n“Democratic voters want a more progressive party,” began a pitch from a far-left group called Justice Democrats.\n\nTo my surprise, a legitimate national poll supports the claim, and others hint at the same trend.\n\nSurvey USA, in a poll taken earlier this month, found that 50% of Dems said they want the party to “become more progressive,” 24% said it should “stay the same” and just 18% said “become more -moderate.”\n\nLowest approval rating\n\nI’ve been trying to wrap my head around the findings, but can only wonder how much further left Dems can go before they fall off the face of the Earth.\n\nSanders, Ocasio-Cortez and their angry fellow travelers apparently aim to find out. \n\nTheir big, boisterous rallies are all about tearing down what Sanders calls “ubercapitalism,” but history and current events show that socialism always adds to human misery. \n\nPerhaps the left’s new power couple should go on a fact-finding trip to Cuba and Venezuela to see for themselves. \n\nOr they could ask the 12 million illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in why they risked life and limb to get here if America is such a terrible, rotten place to live and work.\n\nOne thing the radicals can’t deny is that the Dem party that voters soundly rejected last November has its lowest national approval rating ever at under 30%.\n\nMost of that dismal view is because it’s widely seen as too far left already.\n\nThe reasons are obvious: The party is largely anti-police and pro-criminal, it’s riddled with antisemitism and some congressional members are foolishly fixated on defending gang members who came to America as part of the illegal migration wave. \n\nIn addition, party leaders never met a tax hike they didn’t embrace and made Elon Musk Public Enemy No. 1 for daring to try to cut fraud and waste from the bloated, debt-riddled federal budget. \n\nDems, elite universities and a web of NGOs fattened on taxpayer money are reacting as if the world would end if even a penny were cut. \n\nThese and similar positions put the party well outside the American mainstream, so what would it mean to be even more progressive?\n\nAnd where are the voters who are willing to support such madness? They’re certainly not among those common sense Americans fleeing high-tax, crime-infested blue states.\n\nThe answers about finding new voters are vague by necessity. As the Justice Democrats insist in their email pitch, “Too many Democratic leaders keep chasing the center, running Republican-lite campaigns that don’t reflect the values of the people who put them in office.”\n\nYounger, more radical\n\nSo moderation is the enemy and no self-respecting Dem should be caught anywhere near the center of the political spectrum? Got it. \n\nExcept Biden and Kamala Harris had the most far-left administration in the modern era, and the results were disastrous for the nation — and the party. \n\nYet the desire to drink more of the same Kool-Aid is especially prevalent among young Dems. \n\nThe Harvard Youth Poll released last week shows that of the 18- to 29-year-olds who voted for Harris last November, only 23% approve of what congressional Dems are doing.\n\nThis, too, is divorced from reality. Dems in Congress have opposed virtually everything Trump has proposed, including his Cabinet nominees. \n\nMost wouldn’t even stand when Trump, speaking to a joint session of Congress, saluted families who lost loved ones to migrant murderers. Nor were they moved by a 13-year-old boy with cancer the president honored.\n\nThe only time Dems have compromised this year was when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine other Dems voted to keep the government open instead of killing a GOP spending bill that would have shut down the government. \n\nSchumer was right when he said Dems would be blamed for the shutdown, but the left is so eager for a fight that it wanted him to burn it all down. \n\nFor his trouble, Schumer has been targeted by his party, with calls for AOC to challenge him in a primary.\n\nThat wouldn’t be until 2028, but the idea of using primary battles to remake the party younger and more radical is now out in the open. \n\nA prime antagonist is David Hogg, the 25-year-old anti-gun activist who was recently named a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee. \n\nThe move aimed to show young voters the party was open to their generation and ideas, but it immediately backfired in spectacular fashion. \n\nHogg said he would start a multimillion-dollar fund to challenge “asleep-at-the-wheel” incumbents in primaries.\n\nJeopardizing victory\n\nHis pledge rattled the old guard, which aims to expand its members, not trade trusted old ones for radical new ones. \n\n“No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a call with reporters. “Voters should decide who our primary nominees are, not DNC leadership.”\n\nAlthough Trump and congressional Republicans are the targets, the Dems determination to marginalize themselves isn’t necessarily good for the country as a whole.\n\nThe two-party system works best when the competition is over voters who are slightly to the right or left of center. The need to attract these swing voters has a moderating influence on the government as a whole. \n\nPresidents temper their agenda so that voting for it doesn’t cost their members their seats, especially in the House, where control has been shifting in recent years.\n\nTrump lost the House two years after the GOP swept the 2016 election, and Biden lost it in the 2022 midterms.\n\nFrom that point on, most of their domestic agendas were dead.\n\nThe pattern shows that voters punish presidents and parties that are seen as straying too far from the middle.\n\nThe oddity now is that Trump’s poll numbers are slipping and with the GOP holding the narrowest possible House majority, control could easily shift next year. \n\nAll of which makes the Dems’ behavior so bizarre. Most are willing to jeopardize their chances of victory in favor of moving further to the left. \n\nGood luck with that.","summary":"To most Americans, the big problem with the Democratic Party is that it has moved too far left in recent years.

Bringing an end to the lawsuit is seen as a way to expedite the approval process, though it remains unclear how the mediator will rule.\n\nA spokesman for Paramount declined to comment but would not deny Wednesday’s mediation; a lawyer for Trump didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nShari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount, has let it be known she wants to settle the case and appease other demands by the Trump FCC to push the deal through the regulatory approval process.\n\nThat would include meeting demands by Trump FCC chair Brendan Carr to end Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, which the Trump administration believes leads to illegal racial quotas in hiring.\n\nCarr also wants assurances that CBS will abide by FCC fairness rules for networks that broadcast over so-called public airwaves (as opposed to cable) that they refrain from political bias in news coverage.Now people inside Paramount and Skydance say they can see a path forward with Redstone likely settling with Trump, and the FCC becoming fully engaged in the deal on DEI and other matters. \n\nPeople at Skydance — which will be running Paramount and CBS if the deal is approved — are said to be ready to agree to Carr’s demands on ending DEI and making sure programming meets fairness metrics. (A Skydance rep declined to comment.) \n\nConservatives have long complained about political bias in new programming at CBS and “60 Minutes.” The network flouted so-called FCC “public interest” rules that demand unbiased news programming, they say. The FCC launched its probe earlier in the year following a public interest complaint about the Harris interview, and has been throttling the Skydance deal for months as it probes the charges made by a conservative legal group.\n\n“Finally we can see light at the end of the tunnel,” said one person working on the transaction.\n\nThat path could be costly in terms of money and prestige. Legal experts have questioned Trump’s case against CBS alleging deceptively edited word-salad answers in Harris’s October 2024 interview with “60 Minutes.” Among other things, they say the lawsuit failed to meet the high bar that the interview caused damages to Trump’s election efforts. Trump, after all, won the 2024 election. CBS. meanwhile, denies that it deceptively edited the piece.\n\nPlus, by caving to Trump — agreeing to pay money to settle the matter, or possibly issuing an apology — Redstone could damage the credibility of one of the most esteemed properties in TV journalism. If the mediator rules in favor of Trump and awards him anywhere near his $20 billion in damages, it would easily eat through the roughly $2.4 billion Redstone will earn as part of the Skydance deal.\n\nRedstone is obviously looking to shell out a lot less, and get the deal approved. \n\nThat means she might just offer up an apology for the coverage that Trump believes was biased and pay a smallish settlement. \n\nInsiders are hoping for a settlement along the lines of what ABC agreed to settle a defamation case brought by Trump, when it shelled out a total of $16 million and issued a statement of regret after star anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately stated that the president was found liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll.","summary":"Paramount and representatives of President Trump are scheduled to meet Wednesday before a mediator who will determine the fate of Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/26/business/high-stakes-paramount-trump-mediation-scheduled-as-prezs-60-minutes-lawsuit-looms/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103371687.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Oj8KX3vM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-26 20:01:43","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":315155150,"title":"We checked in on American voters almost 100 days into Trump 2.0","text":"Before his return to the White House, US President Donald Trump promised the \"most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history\".\n\nIn many ways, he's delivered.\n\nWith the swish of his black marker, Trump has signed a record-breaking number of orders, up-ending American institutions, reshaping international relationships, and sending US and global markets seesawing.\n\nSince January 20, his administration has:\n\nWithdrawn foreign aid and dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID)Directed agencies to shut down their offices focused on diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) and accessibilityDiscussed plans to take control of Greenland, the Panama Canal, and even CanadaUsed a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants, some of them to an El Salvador prison without due processCaused global economic turmoil by imposing tariffs on almost every country, before pausing most of them\n\nThe 100-day milestone has always carried cultural significance in US politics. \n\nIt's a moment to take stock of a new leader's progress and how American voters are feeling about their choice.\n\nWith Trump due to hit the 100-day milestone on April 29, 40 per cent of Americans approve of his job performance — a 7 per cent decline since February.\n\nWhile he retains high support among his base, his economic management has taken a hit, with 59 per cent of Americans disapproving of his tariffs policy, according to a poll by Pew.\n\nBefore he was elected, the ABC spoke to a sample of voters across America about whether they planned to back Trump, or his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.\n\nThree months later, we've revisited the same voters to hear how they're digesting Trump's return to the White House.\n\n'He will say something insane … but then he backs off'\n\nWhen the ABC last spoke with Christine Cloud, she was looking forward to casting her vote for Trump in the crucial swing state of Nevada.\n\nAngry about having to move in with her stepfather due to a rising cost of living, the former Democrat believed Trump would bring the price of everyday items down.\n\nNow months later, the 64-year-old retiree is \"keeping her fingers crossed\" that Trump knows what he's doing.\n\n\"Every now and then I'm like, 'I hope this is going in the right direction,'\" she said, referencing Trump's aggressive trade policy that's rattled the global economy.\n\n\"But you have to go through a little pain to get to the other side.\"\n\nDespite rising inflation, fears of a recession and a trade war, Ms Cloud is quick to say she has no regrets about voting for Trump and doesn't believe she's any worse off financially than she was when Joe Biden was at the helm. \n\n\"As long as I can still make my bills and I don't get in financial trouble,\" she said.\n\nShe's pleased with the administration's \"lightning speed\" and feels the president has fulfilled the promises he made on the campaign trail \"more so than any president I've seen in my lifetime\".\n\nBut she's not thrilled with everything she's seen in the last 100 days.\n\nShe said she cringed at the public blow-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that talk of taking over Canada was \"just nuts\". \n\nBut she believes that behind the bluster, there's a strategy. \n\n\"He will say something insane … but then he backs off. And I think it just gets the conversation going on purpose,\" she said.\n\nOverall, Ms Cloud feels hopeful. \n\n\"Americans just aren't used to someone being bold and trying to get stuff done because we had great grandpa in charge for so long,\" she said.\n\n'Trump don't have respect for nobody'\n\nMaurice Combs, a Democrat, can't stand bullies. \n\nThe 51-year-old barber from the Deep South has spent his life trying to impart positive values to those whose hair he cuts, \"from drug dealers to politicians\". \n\nBut with Trump back in office, he's worried basic standards of human decency are being abandoned — teaching younger generations all the wrong lessons. \n\nNow, he sees a nation in decline with a bully at the helm. \n\n\"We, the people, make up the government,\" Mr Combs said from his home in Atlanta, Georgia. \n\n\"But we got a bunch of tyrants now, it's like an oligarch — do as I say, not as I do.\"\n\nFor Black communities and minority groups, Mr Combs fears dark times are ahead. \n\nHe describes the treatment of immigrants by the Trump administration as \"disgusting\".\n\n\"It feels like everything is falling down and it's falling down at the base,\" he said. \n\n\"The basis of the whole American dream, the basis of the amendments and everything that we hold true. It's a joke now … and that's the scary part.\"\n\nAs for his finances, Mr Combs says he's \"definitely\" been struggling more in the past few months.\n\nFirst he noticed a rise in groceries. Then came his insurance bill. \n\n\"I've had to cut back on a lot of things,\" he said.\n\n\"Trump don't have respect for nobody but people with money. He forgot about the small people.\"\n\nHe hopes Trump's presidency will serve as a \"wake-up call\" to Americans, and believes the only thing that can restore stability and integrity to the nation is divine intervention. \n\n\"God bless, not just America but the world. For real. Because you got a lot of nefarious people in high places making decisions … and we got billions of people on this planet,\" he said.\n\n'I don't think he sleeps'\n\nRepublican Cristina Junge is ecstatic. \n\nDuring the past 100 days, she has marvelled at the breakneck speed the president has set to fulfil promises made on the campaign trail. \n\n\"I don't think he sleeps. He's always go, go, go, go and doing, doing, doing,\" she said. \n\nThe 80-year-old retiree lives in a retirement village outside of Phoenix, Arizona — not far from the Mexican border where claims of a migrant \"invasion\" were salient in the 2024 election campaign.\n\nSo on day one in office, when Trump began making good on his promise to carry out \"the largest mass deportation\" of undocumented migrants in history, Ms Junge was delighted. \n\n\"They don't belong here because they're not even American,\" she said. \n\nA migrant herself, Ms Junge moved to the US \"the legal way\" from Colombia in the 1960s. \n\nShe believes Trump's claim that he's fighting a war against \"terrorists\", fentanyl and crime caused by undocumented immigrants. \n\nThen, days after his inauguration, Trump proclaimed the US government will recognise only two sexes, male and female.\n\n\"That was absolutely beautiful,\" Ms Junge said. \"Trump believes in family, in faith and in country … the three most important things.\"\n\nPrior to Trump's return, Ms Junge saw a nation \"headed for bankruptcy\" that didn't care for its own citizens. \n\nShe said Trump had now given young people \"a future to look to\", a more united country, and a much-needed change for the world. \n\n\"If anyone is going to unite this country it's Trump … this is a fight between good and evil and I think that good will always triumph,\" she said.\n\n'I'm just disappointed in America at the moment'\n\nAs far as Erica Sampson's concerned, Trump is not her president. \n\n\"I don't care that he has the title, he's just not my president,\" she said. \n\n\"He should be like a party clown, he would be great at kid's parties … but as someone who's the leader of America? No, that ain't it.\"\n\nWe first met the single mum at a phone bank in South Carolina. \n\nThe 37-year-old HR professional dedicated weeks of her life campaigning for Harris in the hope the nation would elect its first Black female president.\n\nToday, Ms Sampson is deflated, the frustration in her voice palpable. \n\n\"I'm just disappointed in America at the moment,\" she said. \n\n\"These are terrible times … you turn on your TV and you're constantly reminded that all that work, it just went nowhere.\"\n\nTo her mind, Trump's worst action has been the stripping away of DEI initiatives. But after all her advocacy, she's decided to just sit back and let it play. \n\nShe was hoping to buy a house for her and her three children, but with a teetering economy, she's put that dream on hold.\n\nShe describes Trump's \"my way or no way\" leadership style as being bereft of empathy or respect for the rule of law.\n\n\"It's definitely giving authoritarian and dictatorship,\" she said. \n\n\"Because he's in this position, it's like we [Americans] are an extension of him, we're like an association of him.\"\n\nBut Ms Sampson says she's not frustrated at Trump. She's frustrated by the Americans who voted for him.\n\n\"He showed y'all, and then he told y'all,\" she said. \n\n\"You didn't think he was going to do it but now that it's affecting you it's a problem. No, it was a problem when you put his name on the ballot.\"\n\n'We're nervous'\n\nFourth-generation grain and dairy farmer Les Danielson has just finished planting this year's crop of soybeans on his farm in northern Wisconsin. \n\nWith a simmering trade war, Mr Danielson has no idea if they'll be worth anything come harvest time in September when they will be bound for export to nations like Malaysia and Thailand.\n\n\"We're nervous,\" Mr Danielson said of his farming community. \n\n\"He's made a colossal bet on this trade thing, and it could greatly affect the US economy for better or worse going forward.\"\n\nMr Danielson, who voted for Harris, believes the true impact of Trump's aggressive and unprecedented trade policies won't be felt right away. \n\nBut if the worst happens, he's facing the prospect of earning no profit and sinking further into debt.\n\n\"Imagine going to your job, working all year, and at the end of the year you made no money, you actually lost money,\" he said. \n\n\"If the worst hits, farmers will basically work all year for nothing.\"\n\nTrump has urged Americans to \"hang tough\", but speculation is mounting that the president might need to re-introduce a taxpayer-funded bailout brought in during his first term to compensate farmers facing financial ruin. \n\n\"It's no secret that farmers have overwhelmingly supported Trump in the past,\" Mr Danielson said.\n\n\"A lot of them are still supportive but once you start paying high prices in stores and you receive lower prices for your products, that's where the loyalty test will really happen.\" \n\nUntil then, he's hoping that come September, some brakes will have been applied to Trump's policies and all trade alliances will be restored.\n\n'He's doing the hard work to make our country better'\n\nWhen Trump first ran for office in 2016, neither Stephen nor Holly Purcell were big fans.\n\nMs Purcell once considered herself a lifelong Democrat, but she became fed up with what she calls \"the wokeness\" in the party, and flipped Republican. \n\nShe believes Trump is \"exactly what we need right now\".\n\nMr Purcell has been a registered Libertarian for 20 years. \n\nBut it was talk from Trump of reviving America's industrial heartlands that earned him Mr Purcell's vote. \n\n\"It was refreshing. I thought, wow I've got to start listening to this guy,\" he said.\n\nNow, 100 days into his presidency, the pair has been both impressed and surprised.\n\nThey own a machine shop in central Pennsylvania that makes metal parts for lolly factories and automotive plants. \n\nOver the years, they have seen more and more business disappear to competitors in China and South America.\n\nMr Purcell fondly recalls a time when kids could graduate from school and get a job in a factory that would bring in a decent wage to buy a house and raise a family. \n\nNow he says those factories and industries have disappeared, leaving ghost towns in their wake. \n\n\"They're just dumps,\" Mr Purcell said.\n\n\"It's been going in the other direction for too long. We haven't seen any light at the end of the tunnel for decades. It'd be nice to have work coming back to our country instead of leaving it.\"\n\nAs he sees it, Trump's tough trade talk is simply the art of the deal. \n\n\"He goes way beyond where we need to be and then everyone meets in the middle so I don't think he's overstepping, he's just in the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the Purcells are concerned about what could come next after Trump's second term. \n\n\"I just hope Americans are proud enough to weather any kind of difficulty so that we'll be stronger in the long run,\" Mr Purcell said.\n\n'It just seems very Orwellian'\n\nNineteen-year-old university student Eva Eapen aspires to one day work in government or academia, but today she's demoralised at the prospect.\n\nMs Eapen studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and said it had been hit with funding cuts \"left and right\".\n\n\"There's a culture of fear and distrust of authority, of institutions, of UNC, of the government,\" she said.\n\n\"It just seems very Orwellian.\"\n\nThe political science and public policy student cast her vote for the first time last year in support of Harris. She felt confident the former attorney-general would uphold the constitution.\n\nNow that Trump is back in the White House, she says America has seen a president \"wage war\" on the judiciary and show a chilling disregard for the rule of law.\n\n\"To me, that is extremely frightening,\" Ms Eapen said, referring to the government defying a court order to deport a man with legal status to a prison in El Salvador, and later calling it an \"administrative error\".\n\n\"We are in an ocean of news that all seems catastrophic but the gravity of the executive branch wilfully defying the judiciary is … to me, it's democratic backsliding.\n\n\"He is willing to erode institutions and trample amendments and reach for power in a very brazen way.\n\n\"We are slipping and sliding into a constitutional crisis … it's imminent.\"\n\n'We've been on a bullet train'\n\nPittsburgh lawyer Eric Jackson Lurie was elated when Trump was elected, and he's impressed with how quickly the president is ticking off his to-do list.\n\n\"The first 100 days, we've been on a bullet train,\" Mr Lurie said. \"He's just checking off boxes.\"\n\nTwo early actions stand out.\n\nThe first: declaring foreign gangs in the US as terrorists.\n\n\"I'm a criminal defence attorney, so I see this stuff firsthand,\" Mr Lurie said.\n\n\"Declaring them as terrorists freed law enforcement … to go after a lot of these criminal elements in this country.\"\n\nThe second: the \"common sense result\" of removing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies from government and the military. Mr Lurie believes they had gone too far.\n\n\"That has made so many people in America breathe this big, deep sigh of relief,\" he said. \"The army is there to protect this country, not to be worried about how someone wants to qualify their gender.\"\n\nHe was initially unsure about Trump's tariffs, though. \n\n\"In a perfect world, in a perfect economy, I am a free market conservative, so the idea of tariffs goes against my thoughts with how the economy should work,\" he said. \n\n\"But the problem is, and I remind myself, that this was not a perfect free market between the other countries. I've come around on that, but initially the tariffs were a concern for me.\"\n\nOverall, he's feeling optimistic about the economy. \n\nHe just bought a holiday park in rural Pennsylvania, but he's not sure he'd have been confident to invest if Trump had lost the election.\n\n\"When Trump got elected, I pulled the trigger.\"","summary":"The ABC revisited American voters from across the political spectrum about their thoughts and feelings almost 100 days into Trump's second term. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-27/how-us-voters-feel-about-donald-trump-100-days/105215796","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ffb13ca887a871eb67313fdf732f752d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 19:39:00","author":"Phoebe Hosier","authors":["Phoebe Hosier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":315155540,"title":"Trump “ndez motorët” për mandatin e tretë","text":"Bluza, kapele, të gjitha me logon “Trump 2028”.

Kushtetuta e Shteteve të Bashkuara, në fakt, dhe në veçanti Amendamenti i 22-të, e ndalon një lider të Uashingtonit të udhëheqë vendin tre herë: “Asnjë person nuk mund të zgjidhet President më shumë se dy herë”. Trump, megjithatë, ka lënë të kuptohet në mënyrë të përsëritur, në mënyra pak a shumë të fshehura, për qëllimin e tij për të kandiduar përsëri pas tre vjetësh si kandidat republikan. “Ka mënyra për ta bërë këtë”, tha ai, duke theksuar se nuk po bënte shaka. Drejtori i Komunikimit i Shtëpisë së Bardhë, Steven Cheung, përsëriti në një deklaratë për Axios se Trump mendon se “është shumë herët për të menduar” për një mandat të tretë. Por studiuesit thonë se po i marrin seriozisht komentet e Trump.\n\n“Ngacmimet” e Trump\n\nTrump e ka përmendur vazhdimisht idenë se ai do të kandidonte për një mandat të tretë si president. Në fund të marsit, Trump nuk përjashtoi mundësinë e rizgjedhjes në vitin 2028. “Shumë njerëz duan që unë ta bëj atë”, tha Trump për NBC News atëherë. “Por, dua të them, në thelb u them atyre se kemi një rrugë të gjatë për të bërë, e dini, është shumë herët në administratë.” I pyetur nga NBC nëse donte një mandat të tretë, Trump tha: “Më pëlqen të punoj”. “Nuk po bëj shaka”, tha Trump. “Por është shumë herët për të menduar për këtë.” “Ka metoda që ju mund ta bëni atë,” tha presidenti, duke iu referuar një mandati tjetër. “Unë dyshoj se nuk do të kandidoj më, nëse nuk thoni, ‘Ai është aq i mirë sa duhet të kuptojmë diçka tjetër’”, thuhet se u tha Trump republikanëve gjatë një takimi privat pas fitores së tij elektorale të nëntorit ndaj ish-zëvendëspresidentes demokrate Kamala Harris.\n\nMandati i tretë\n\nNë maj 2024, ndërsa fliste me anëtarët e Shoqatës Kombëtare të Pushkës, Trump tha: “Nuk e di, a do të konsiderohemi me tre mandate apo me dy mandate? Jemi me tre mandate apo me dy mandate nëse fitojmë?” Ish-këshilltari i Shtëpisë së Bardhë Steve Bannon tha në “Real Time with Bill Maher” më 11 prill se “Presidenti Trump do të kandidojë për një mandat të tretë dhe Presidenti Trump do të zgjidhet përsëri”. “Në pasditen e 20 janarit 2029, ai do të jetë president i Shteteve të Bashkuara,” parashikoi Bannon. Bannon tha gjithashtu, “Ne kemi një ekip njerëzish që kërkojnë të mundësojnë një mandat të tretë për Trump”. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., në fillim të janarit prezantoi një rezolutë të Dhomës për të ndryshuar Kushtetutën për të lejuar Trump dhe çdo president tjetër të ardhshëm të zgjidhet për një mandat të tretë. Rezoluta e Ogles është përshtatur posaçërisht për të lejuar Trump të shërbejë një mandat të tretë, por jo për të lejuar tre ish-presidentët e gjallë me dy mandate të shërbejnë një mandat të tretë.\n\nAmendamenti i 22-të si pengesë\n\n“Asnjë person nuk mund të zgjidhet në detyrën e Presidentit më shumë se tre herë dhe as të zgjidhet në asnjë mandat shtesë pasi të jetë zgjedhur në dy mandate radhazi”, thuhet në amendament. Ai u propozua në 1947 pas vdekjes së ish-presidentit Franklin D. Roosevelt gjatë mandatit të tij të katërt dhe u ratifikua në 1951. Ai gjithashtu vendos kufij për ata që marrin presidencën, si në rastin e vdekjes së presidentit para përfundimit të mandatit të tyre. Nëse një nënkryetar merr detyrën në një mandat të papërfunduar dhe shërben për më shumë se dy vjet, ai mund të kandidojë për zgjedhje vetëm një herë. Ndryshe nga Trump, ish-presidentët Bill Clinton, George W. Bush dhe Barack Obama shërbyen të gjithë nga dy mandate radhazi. Ish-presidenti Joe Biden shërbeu një mandat.","summary":"Bluza, kapele, të gjitha me logon “Trump 2028”.

There, Gladstone said to reporters: 'As we sit here, Travis Hunter is Jacksonville Jaguar. And really what comes to mind for me, right, thinking about the sport of football. And the power of the game itself. It is capacity to ignite belief. Belief in ourselves, belief in others, belief in achieving what many deem as impossible. \n\n'Travis Hunter, he embodies belief. He is a rare person. He is a rare player. But he is also a reminder that the boundaries of the game of football were built to be challenged. And so the decision to select him was actually a statement. A statement for how we plan to move, who were are. \n\n'And we want him to be nothing more than him. Because when he is, he elevates the space around him. From the football field, to the city, to the game of football itself. Travis Hunter is who we have been hunting up. Couldn’t be more jacked to be sitting right here beside him and to introduce you to the man of the hour.' \n\nThere were some NFL fans, even outside of the Jaguars, who thought it was an epic introduction for a generational talent. But plenty thought it was over-the-top, including Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars took Travis Hunter with the 2nd pick in Thursday's NFL Draft\n\nJacksonville Jaguars GM James Gladstone gave a lengthy speech to welcome Hunter\n\nStatement made.#DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/qmje44HXOX\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) April 25, 2025\n\n'Between the Duval thing and this the Jags seeming more like a weird cult than a football team,' Portnoy said. \n\nThe 'Duval thing' is a the 'Duval' chant Jags fans sing at NFL games. Coen tried to copy it at his own introductory press conference earlier this year but was visibly uncomfortable, making it an awkward viral meme rather than the inspiring moment it was meant to be.\n\nThere were plenty of fans in agreement with Portnoy, with one responding to the Jags video by saying: 'I’m going to tell my kids that this is Kamala Harris. Word salad much?'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Dude thinks he’s Shakespeare... what the hell is this?'\n\nA different take suggested Gladstone might have been trying too hard to underline his own authority, saying: 'That GM has read too many leadership books. Needs to chill lol but good for him on that role at a young age.'\n\nGladstone was confirmed as the Jags' GM in February, leaving his role as director of strategy at the Los Angeles Rams to steer the ship in Jacksonville.\n\nAlongside newly-appointed head coach Coen, there is certainly more reason for optimism around the franchise after their 4-13 campaign in 2024.\n\nTheir woes last season were compounded by quarterback Trevor Lawrence missing the end of the season with a concussion.\n\nNot all fans were impressed - some compared it to a 'Kamala Harris word salad'\n\nHe got concussed from a hit from Texans linebacker Azzes Al-Shaair on Dec. 1 and then underwent surgery on his AC joint on his non-throwing shoulder. \n\nWith or without Gladstone's speech, there will be huge excitement around the Jaguars with Hunter on the roster when the new season begins in September.\n\nThe NFL is going to announce the 2025 season schedule on May 14. \n\nKamala HarrisJacksonville Jaguars\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nJaguars GM's toe-curling Travis Hunter speech compared to Kamala Harris 'word salad'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Jacksonville Jaguars GM James Gladstone gave an epic Hollywood-style speech on Friday as he introduced Travis Hunter - but not everyone thought it was a good look. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14650685/Jaguars-GM-cringe-Travis-Hunter-speech-compared-Kamala-Harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/16/97726371-0-image-m-12_1745680991615.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 15:27:16","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.062},{"id":315127230,"title":"Even MAGA loyalists are getting sick of Trump’s lies","text":"President Donald Trump just can’t stop lying about egg prices.\n\n“Gas and grocery prices are WAY DOWN, just like I said they would be.

Their responses were shockingly and consistently negative.\n\nHere’s a screenshot in case the thread gets deleted—a common occurrence in conservative forums:\n\nLet’s take a closer look at some of these comments.\n\nGreed is going on. Trump is going to have to publicly put the squeeze on the individuals who are refusing to lower prices on things like gas and eggs (and many others).\n\nRemember when Vice President Kamala Harris proposed cracking down on corporate greed, and conservatives screeched about “socialism?” \n\nPrices will absolutely not drop as long as the free market is allowed to price-gouge consumers, so I wouldn’t hate it if Trump set the precedent for a little socialism. \n\nSadly Trump is talking about bulk prices. In the end, people will pay whatever they think something is worth, and everyone takes advantage. Corporate greed.\n\nLook at MAGA loyalists suddenly discovering corporate greed! Feels like progress, doesn’t it? Or will they forget all about it the second they can use high prices to attack Democrats? \n\nYeah, yeah … of course they’ll revert to form once Democrats are back in power.\n\nGroceries are still way higher than before inflation. eggs are not back either, just not $1 an egg anymore. just because they can’t stay up once they stop killing chickens. but surprisingly still $4.99 a dozen at albertsons. used to be $1.50 before inflation per dozen.\n\nIt really is fascinating how Trump has lied in such a way that even his most loyal supporters are starting to get pissed off. \n\nDespite all of the screaming about trans kids and immigrants, Trump won predominantly on his promise to lower prices. And for the first time perhaps ever, a Republican presidential candidate won the vote among those making less than $50,000 per year—people who are now really feeling prices increasing.\n\nTrump sold those voters on the promise that he would lower prices on Day 1, and as stupid as that promise was—and as stupid as Trump is—people were desperate enough to vote for it.\n\nBut these aren’t people who will suddenly forget that prices are still kicking their asses. So Trump telling them that those prices are “WAY DOWN” isn’t flying.\n\nThe good news is that’s what’s going to take down the GOP in the 2026 midterms. \n\nAs much as I want the election to be about democracy, abortion rights, due process, and all that good stuff, if we want a massive blue tsunami, it’s going to be on the economy and nothing else. \n\nI’m not saying that we should ignore the other stuff! Trump certainly didn’t ignore the base-building stuff like transphobia and anti-immigrant xenophobia. But when we message the broader electorate, it has to be economy, economy, economy. \n\nShit went up like 30%, down by 1 %… overall still up 29%… MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\n\nPeople are pissed. You can feel the disdain. \n\nUnpopular take, but accurate. He's talking as if the problem is solved and it's nowhere near solved. He's going to lose a lot of support among the fencesitters if he's just going to dust his hands off now and say, \"OK...that's enough of that.\n\nTrump’s problem is that he never gave a damn about grocery prices or helping people, so he’s having a hard time pretending to care about inflation.\n\nFor the love of god, Trump, STFU\n\nImagine that—we’re finding common ground with MAGA!\n\nYeah, just like the Democrats he thinks the people that voted for him are retards. Birds of a feather.\n\nNothing wrong with a little bit of gaslighting but celebrating now smells bad. Lower taxes and fix the tariff situation first (please).\n\nIs there anything more MAGA than “nothing wrong with a little bit of gaslighting?” \n\nThe impression is that nothing more will be done to fix the prices. We should accept crumbs instead of the whole cookie.\n\nThat has always been the Trump way! Why are people now acting shocked that he doesn’t give a damn about anyone? \n\nI think President Trump and the admin don't realize that people are keeping a really sharp eye on gas and grocery prices and NOBODY is going to believe bullshit statements about how prices are going down. This is not a smart strategy because what we see as exaggeration, most are going to interpret as a lie.\n\nIt is a lie. Also, it’s an exaggeration. The two are not mutually exclusive. \n\nI doubt he's set foot in a supermarket in decades.\n\nI mean, Trump does think that the word “grocery” is an old-fashioned term. \n\n“It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it,” he said.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that he has never set foot in a supermarket—other than for a photo op. He hasn’t had to ever worry about buying groceries because someone has always done it for him.\n\nCongrats, MAGA, you are just learning this now. \n\nI wish he would stop lying about this. Inflation at the grocery store has just about come to a halt, but I am not seeing prices for anything go DOWN, other than maybe 20-30% for eggs, which are still about $ 4 a dozen here. For reference, they were $ 1-1.50/dozen during his first term.\n\nPeople are taking close note of prices because they have no choice. And they sure as hell will notice when prices start going back up because of Trump’s tariffs and the mass deportation of agriculture workers. \n\nTo be very clear, I’m still not seeing any major erosion in Trump’s support in any polling. Republicans still back him to the hilt. But this kind of unease and discontent will only grow as the economy heads south. \n\nIf anything, I’m just surprised that one of the most ardently pro-Trump corners of the internet is already having these sorts of misgivings. But, hey, I’ll take what I can get.","summary":"President Donald Trump just can’t stop lying about egg prices.\n\n\n\n“Gas and grocery prices are WAY DOWN, just like I said they would be.

'He’s created chaos, jacked up prices, lined his own pockets while everyone else struggles.' \n\nBut he said the 'real danger' for Democrat leaders' is saying they're going back to the old ways. \n\nEven 2028 contender and former Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, has been echoing similar statements. \n\nOn a recent episode of Flagrant, a podcast, he advised Democrats to 'revisit... what is it we're offering.' \n\n'It sounds like what we're offering if just: \"Let's go back,\"' the politician said. \n\nLast month, a CNN poll found the Democratic Party's favorability had a hit brutal low. \n\nAmong Americans overall, the Democratic Party's favorability rating stands at just 29 percent, CNN found.\n\nIt's the lowest favorability the party has seen since CNN first started conducting its polling back in 1992.\n\nIt's also a 20-point drop in approval since Trump left office more than four years ago at which time approval of the Democratic party was 49 percent.\n\nIt's also a 10-point drop from just before the November election.\n\nDemocrats are desperate to change their reputation among voters, while actively fighting against Trump, whom they have branded an oligarch. \n\nSenator Mallory McMorrow is among the Democratic brood that is looking for a party rebrand. \n\n'When I talk to people all across the state, people just don’t believe that success is possible for them anymore,' she told NBC News. \n\n'What we are laying out is that in the rubble that will be left behind by Donald Trump - who is now, between him and Elon Musk, taking a chainsaw to the government - that there will be an opportunity to build something new and acknowledge that trust in institutions is gone for a lot of people' \n\nParkland shooting survivor and DNC Vice Chair, David Hogg, also thinks the Democratic Party needs to become younger and older politicians not meeting voter standards need to move out of the way. \n\n'What we’re trying to do here is make sure that we’re holding ourselves accountable and letting people know that if there’s somebody who’s failing to meet the moment in this moment of crisis that our country is in,' they will be gone,' he said. \n\nThe DNC even announced recently that it would up investments across all 50 states, especially in red ones. \n\n'I’m done with Democrats myopically focusing on just a few battleground states every few years.

Shortly before Trump was sworn into office, Biden’s FDA proposed a rule that it described at the time as \"bold\" that \"would make cigarettes and certain other combusted tobacco products minimally or nonaddictive by limiting the level of nicotine in those products.\" Cigarettes and \"certain other combusted tobacco products\" would not be allowed to have more than 0.7 milligrams of nicotine per gram of tobacco under the proposed rule, according to the FDA. The agency said that lower nicotine levels would \"be low enough to no longer create or sustain addiction.\" While the FDA insisted at the time that the rule \"would not ban\" cigarettes, critics disagree and are optimistic that Trump will continue his push for nicotine freedom and upend the rule. TRUMP FDA NOMINEE TURNS VACCINE QUESTION ON DEM, RECALLING CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN DECISION \"The Biden legacy on tobacco policy is one of hamfisted regulations, crippling bureaucracy, and prohibition fueling massive criminal markets — from cigarettes to Chinese vapes,\" Rich Marianos, former assistant director of the ATF, executive director of the Tobacco Law Enforcement Network, told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump can put the nail in the coffin of that failed era by killing this insane ban on cigarettes and focusing resources on vigilant enforcement.\" Peter Brennan, Executive Director of the New England Convenience Store & Energy Marketers Association (NECSEM), told Fox News Digital that \"prohibitionist tobacco policy\" ends up punishing small businesses by \"taking sales out of our stores and pushing them into the streets and the illicit market.\" FDA PHASING OUT SOME ANIMAL TESTING IN 'WIN-WIN' FOR ETHICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: COMMISSIONER \"Biden’s plan to ban all cigarettes is a real threat that is still hanging over our heads.\" Brennan said. \"We are hopeful that President Trump will help America’s convenience stores by putting a stop to this disastrous idea.\" Trump has taken several actions in the nicotine space since taking office, including withdrawing a proposed rule seeking to ban menthol cigarettes, after the Biden administration said it intended to make the ban become a reality after years of advocacy from anti-smoking groups. Months later, FDA Tobacco Director Brian King, who critics believed was a key figure behind the administration’s efforts against banning menthols and the \"war on nicotine\" was removed from his post in a move that experts who spoke to Fox News Digital praised earlier this month. \"President Trump has succeeded in his nicotine freedom crusade since taking office, repealing Biden’s misguided menthol ban and firing the FDA architect behind it,\" a Republican strategist who worked to elect Trump in 2024 told Fox News Digital this week. \"The logical next step is to officially repeal a Biden-era rule on banning low nicotine products, which will be the final blow to Biden’s war on nicotine.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the FDA for comment.

Many Latinos who once backed him now feel let down, especially because of how immigration policies have played out. According to a fresh Pew Research Center poll, about 72% of Latinos disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job, and 54% disapprove strongly. Only Black Americans showed a higher disapproval rate at 82%. This sharp drop matters because Trump had actually made surprising gains among Latino voters in the last election. Exit polls show that Latinos swung 19 points toward Trump compared to the 2020 election results. Even though Vice President Kamala Harris still captured a slight majority of Latino votes, 52% to 46%, it was a big change from Biden's 33-point lead in 2020. Overall, the Pew poll shows 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump, while 40% approve. Among Whites, the numbers are more evenly split, with 49% approving (including 39% strongly approving). Among Asian Americans, the disapproval rate stands at 69% compared to just 29% approving. Why is support for Trump among Latinos collapsing so quickly? The main reason? Immigration policies. Many Latinos who had placed their hopes in Trump feel abandoned. One big sore spot is Trump's move to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans, a decision that is currently being fought in court. Ronald Bellorin, a Venezuelan immigrant who fled to the U.S. during Trump’s first term, told the Washington Post how betrayed he feels. Today, I feel the same way I felt in Venezuela—that they're going to come take me somewhere I won't be able to escape from, he shared, tearing up as he recounted his family’s journey. I thought we would be safe here. Stories like Ronald’s are becoming more common, especially among immigrant communities who once thought Trump would be their champion. What happened to Trump's strong Latino support in places like Florida? Florida tells an interesting story. Trump had made major inroads with Latino voters there, especially among Venezuelan Americans. In Doral, Florida—often nicknamed Doralzuela because around 40% of residents have Venezuelan roots—Trump flipped the city. He lost Doral in 2016, but in 2024, he won with 62% of the vote, beating Kamala Harris by 25 points. Many Venezuelan Americans felt Trump understood their struggle with socialism back home. That's why this feeling of betrayal cuts even deeper now. John De La Vega, a Venezuelan American immigration lawyer and Army veteran, said it plainly: The Venezuelan community gave President Trump their support. This is completely different from what I thought it was going to be. How are changes to immigration programs fueling Latino anger? Beyond TPS, the Trump administration has taken action against several immigration programs that many Latinos depended on. For instance, the CBP One app, a Biden-era tool that let asylum seekers schedule appointments, is now being targeted. Migrants using the app are being told to self-deport or risk being permanently barred from entering the U.S. Another blow? The administration is also working to undo the CHNV program, which allowed over 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans sponsored by Americans to enter legally. Programs helping Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians, and Cubans reunite with U.S.-based family members are also under threat, causing even more worry in immigrant communities. Are Republicans still backing Trump despite these shifts? Yes, but there's some erosion there too. According to the Pew survey, about 75% of Republicans still approve of Trump's performance. However, about 24% now disapprove, and 14% disapprove strongly. Meanwhile, more than 9 in 10 Democrats disapprove of Trump, with just 7% approving. The growing dissatisfaction among some Republicans, especially those with ties to immigrant communities, shows that Trump's base isn't entirely immune to these policy shifts. What could this mean for Trump moving forward? Losing Latino support could have serious consequences. The Latino vote has been growing steadily in importance, especially in battleground states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. If Trump's immigration policies continue to alienate Latino voters, he might find it harder to hold onto the gains he made in 2024. And while strong support among White voters remains, it may not be enough to offset losses in diverse states.","summary":"As Trump nears 100 days back in office, his Latino support collapses due to immigration policies.

Over just 138 pages, a passing dream next to the Heritage Foundation’s 922-page doorstop, Graham considers the origins of Project 2025, its aims and effects so far.\n\nThere’s a reason Project 2025 came out so long.\n\n“They’re looking at a 100-year timeframe,” Graham said. “They’re looking at things from the New Deal and saying, ‘This is where the government went wrong, and we need to fix these things. We need to change them permanently and reframe what the government does and what its relationship with every American is.’”\n\nThe New Deal is the name given to the vast expansion of the federal government under Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1930s, in response to the Great Depression and laying the foundation of the modern US state.\n\nProject 2025 was published in 2023. As the 2024 election loomed, Democrats raised alarms about its hardline policy recommendations on issues including climate, LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive healthcare and more. Incendiary rhetoric raised awareness too. Kevin Roberts, Heritage president and author of the Project 2025 foreword, said he and his allies were “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be”, then peppered his own book with images of fire and destruction. In praise of Roberts, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, said it was time to “load the muskets”.\n\nTo Graham, such bellicose rhetoric was “terrifying” but also, in retrospect, a clear signpost to things to come. “To say that publicly before the election is really a strange public relations choice. It’s such a chilling thing to say. But you know, it told us what they wanted.”\n\nAmid controversy, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 and its authors. But then he won the election. At the outset of his second term, he duly unleashed slashing cuts to federal staffing and budgets and a barrage of executive orders advancing policies directly linked to Project 2025 or firmly in its spirit.\n\nGraham is an award-winning reporter, used to working fast. He started writing The Project “at the very end of November”, weeks after Trump defeated Kamala Harris, “and turned the book in in mid-January”.\n\nHe wrote the book, he said, because “we the press, we the American public, had talked a lot about Project 2025 during the election, and it felt like it had kind of gone away – but it remained really relevant. And I felt like there was a lot in it that I didn’t understand, and a lot that had been missed.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election, experts did indeed advise that such policy plans for possible administrations have existed for decades but have rarely been enacted. The sheer size of Project 2025 might also have lulled some into a false sense of security. Like many reporters, Graham “had dabbled in parts of it”. Unlike many, he found “it was a different experience to read the whole thing altogether.\n\n“I think it is both more radical in some ways than it came across – like, when you’re just reading atomized policies, you don’t get what a social program it is – [but] one of the other things that I think is interesting is how there are ideas that I think are either [only] fairly objectionable or might have widespread appeal, right next to ones that are totally out in right field. You’ll be in the same paragraph or in the same chapter.\n\n“And the third thing I think is interesting is the way there are disagreements within the text, either between the authors or between the authors and Donald Trump. Those cleavages within the right I think are worth paying attention to now.”\n\nTrump opponents looking for cleavages will not find them in the influential office of management and budget, now directed by Russ Vought, a Christian nationalist, advocate of “traumatizing” political enemies, and Project 2025 co-author. The original director of Project 2025, Paul Dans, fell victim to political necessity in 2024, forced out of the Heritage Foundation as Trump came under pressure – but remains a true believer, recently declaring Trump’s actions in office to be beyond his “wildest dreams”.\n\nBut there is also Elon Musk. The world’s richest man has led Trump’s so-called department of government efficiency, or Doge, in attacking federal agencies and departments with startling speed and recklessness.\n\n“This is one of the places I have been most surprised,” Graham said, “because I think the methods that they lay out [in Project 2025] are really important. I thought that an important part of this was going to be how deeply people like Russ Vought had thought about, ‘OK, how can we work within the bounds of the law to achieve these things? How can we rework the bureaucracy?’ And in fact, Musk came in and just blasted right through it and made it a lot easier for them, and a lot faster. I certainly didn’t expect that. It’s not contemplated in the book or in the original document.”\n\nNor are Trump’s beloved tariffs much loved by Project 2025 and its free-trade-loving authors.\n\nGraham said: “There are these big differences within Project 2025. The most obvious place is the chapters on tariffs … they [also] disagree with Trump on Ukraine. They’re much more hawkish on Ukraine, and anti-Russia. You have this sort of standard, ‘We stand up for Israel, We oppose Iran,’ sort of thing, but foreign policy is barely mentioned. It’s all about China. And Trump talks the talk on China, but then many of the things he’s doing, like tariffs, which are discussed in Project 2025 but not as a major priority, are alienating the rest of the world, which makes it very hard to take on China.\n\n“But then, even something as small as how to handle childcare, you have different people having different views [within Project 2025]. One of the things that jumps out at me is they did a really good job of figuring out how to meld these longstanding social and religious conservative priorities on to Maga. They find places where they can work with Trump.\n\nTrump is very interested in talking about trans rights and Democrats, and men are very interested in fighting back much more broadly on gender norms, LGBTQ+ rights, and so … Project 2025 becomes sort of like a tip of the spear to get Trump’s attention. They care about “wokeness”, and DEI, maybe for different reasons than he does, but they’ll attack that, and it gets him onboard.\n\nOn another key issue of Trump’s second term, Graham sees the White House and the ideologues of Project 2025 much more closely aligned.\n\nProject 2025 is “very focused on illegal immigration, but also on legal immigration. Overall, the point is to have fewer people who are born overseas in the US, by whatever means necessary. And so they talk about mass deportation, and they talk about detention centers, but they also talk about reducing the number of visas that people get and trying to … find people who have lied on their citizenship applications, to revoke citizenship, denaturalization.\n\n“There are things where you see maybe not a direct correlation but the same spirit. So we see in Project 2025 an argument that we need to crack down on student visas from quote, unquote, unfriendly countries, and use student visas as a sort of tool of political warfare.”\n\nTrump may not be implementing Project 2025 word for word but its authors have much to delight them. Conversely, Graham’s book is sprinkled with lines that prompt grim laughter.\n\nConsider the case of James Sherk, a Trump adviser on civil service and labor issues in the first term who drafted “Schedule F”, a proposal to reclassify about 50,000 civil service jobs as political, thereby allowing a president to fire such people at will. Under Joe Biden, Schedule F was shelved. Ahead of Trump’s second term, Project 2025 advocated putting it swiftly to use.\n\nLast year, Sherk spoke to ProPublica. “The notion we’re going to can 50,000 people is just insane,” he said. “Why would you do that? That would kneecap your ability to implement your agenda.”\n\nUnder Trump, more than 260,000 government workers have been fired, taken buyouts or retired early.\n\n The Project is published in the US by Random House","summary":"David A Graham’s latest book considers the vast far-right plan to change US politics – and why its architects are playing the long game\n\nDavid A Graham doesn’t say he read Project 2025 so you don’t have to, but it might be inferred.\n\nThe Atlantic staff writer’s new book, The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America, is a swift but thorough overview of the vast far-right plan for a second Trump administration that achieved notoriety last year.

And I think it's the first time that ever happened, where a Republican won the vote,\" he said, adding: \"And I won it by a lot.\"\n\n\"You know, I have great relationships to the Catholics, very simple,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he would go out of respect for his Catholic voters after they supported him in the last presidential election.\n\n\"I won the Catholic vote, we got 56 percent of the vote, I don't know why we didn't get more, actually,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know how they [the Democrats] got any, but we did well with the Catholic vote.\n\n\"My relationship is very good, so therefore, you know, I think it's appropriate.\"\n\nTrump's response was met with mixed reactions, with some commentators on social media blasting him for making the Pope's funeral 'about him'.\n\n\"It's always about him.

Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, is calling out her party for going “weak and woke,” saying it’s time for Dems to “f—-ing retake the flag,” adopt some “g—d—- Alpha energy,” and develop a “war plan” to “contain and defeat Donald Trump.”\n\nLeave it to the gender-confused Democrats to leave it to a woman to be the party’s first to grow a pair.\n\nThat aside, Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, may in fact be the first Democrat in over a decade who makes sense — so much so that she sounds much more like a Republican than the normal whiny, petulant, transgender tapping, snowflake-sniffling, child sex grooming, rainbow T-shirt wearing type who make up the majority of today’s left.\n\nShe’s a Democrat, yes. And for that reason, and that reason alone, she’s wrong on about every major piece of policy that’s sprung from the political world in past years. But at least she’s not wearing one of those stupid pink p—— hats the left so loves, and taking to the streets with bricks purchased by a George Soros outfit and distributed among the Marxist sheep masses to throw at police cars.\n\nAt least she’s using her words, not her fists.\n\nAccording to Politico, Slotkin is “road-testing” a batch of speeches she hopes will awaken her fellow party members to the errors of their ways so they’re better positioned come next election to win back the House and Senate.\n\nHope she loses — but on the way to losing, hope she awakens some Democrat voters out there to how weak and whiny and loser-y they’ve all become. A quieted and calmer Democrat voter is good for the whole nation, Republicans and Democrats alike, dontcha know.\n\nPolitico writes: “In the first of a series of speeches about the Democratic Party’s path out of the wilderness, the Michigan senator said she will span everything from strategy to tactics and tone, acknowledging public perception of the party as ‘weak and woke’ needs to change. She is urging Democrats to ‘f—-ing retake the flag’ with appeals to voters’ sense of patriotism, to adopt ‘the g—d—- Alpha energy’ of Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell and to embrace an ‘airing out’ of potential 2028 presidential candidates in a broadly contested primary. Slotkin’s description of the speech as a ‘war plan’ came in a recorded dry-runoff of remarks viewed by Politico. In an interview, she hedged on whether she would continue to call it that, saying ‘it’s a military-style operational plan.’ I don’t understand how to rally us into a coherent approach if we aren’t on the same page on where we’re going.”\n\nOn the heels of bumbling, mumbling Joe Biden and word salad Kamala Harris, a “coherent approach” for the Democrats would represent a significant win for the party.\n\nAnd a Democrat Party that at long last recognizes how “weak and woke” its members have become, and seeks to adjust accordingly, would represent a significant win for all of America.\n\n• Cheryl Chumley can be reached at cchumley@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

The Bidens were visible behind them - both Joe and Jill in sunglasses. \n\nThey did not appear to interact. \n\nTrump, on his way to Rome, said a meeting with his predecessor in the Oval Office was ‘not high on my list’ \n\nAnd he shrugged off his former rival attending Pope Francis’ funeral.\n\nTrump also revealed he hadn’t known that Biden and wife Jill Biden would also be at the basilica for the service.\n\n‘Oh he is? I didn’t know,’ he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with the former president, Trump replied: ‘It’s not high on my list. It’s really not.’\n\nThe two men had a bitter rivalry in the 2020 election, which Biden won, and then again in the 2024 contest until Biden dropped out of the race. Trump ultimately won a second term.\n\nBiden has called Trump a threat to democracy. Trump has questioned Biden's mental capabilities and blamed him for the high inflation and shaky stock market. \n\nThe president, dressed casually Friday for the eight-hour flight with his tie off and shirt unbuttoned, told reporters on Air Force One he was attending the service partially because he won Catholic voters in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump won Catholics by more than 120,000 votes when he faced former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIt was Trump’s anti-abortion policies and his appointment of conservative judges onto the Supreme Court – who ultimately overturned Roe vs. Wade – that put the voting bloc in his corner.\n\nIn 2020, the Catholic vote was evenly split between Trump and Biden, who was the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy.\n\nTrump himself identifies as a ‘non-denominational Christian.’ First lady Melania Trump is Catholic.\n\nThe Trumps met Pope Francis during a visit to the Vatican in 2017 during the president’s first term.\n\nAt the time, Melania described it as an experience she would ‘never forget.’\n\nShe brought a pair of rosary beads for the pontiff to bless.\n\nShe is the first Catholic first lady in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nBut most may remember that meeting because of a cute moment involving the pontiff and the first lady, when the pontiff asked her what she feeds the president.\n\n‘Pizza?’ the first lady was heard answering.\n\nBut it may have been a ‘lost in translation’ moment as some think the first lady said potica, which is a traditional sweet nut roll pastry from Eastern Europe.\n\nPresident Trump and Pope Francis also had their differences.\n\nIn 2015, Trump said Francis was too political, and the pontiff later suggested Trump wasn't Christian over his \"build a wall\" rhetoric.\n\nTrump, responded that ‘for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.’\n\nThe trip to Rome marks Trump’s first foreign trip of his second term. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia next month.","summary":"President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden sat just five rows between them at Pope Francis' funeral on Saturday, easily in the other's sight line.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14650173/Donald-Trump-Joe-Biden-pope-funeral.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/10/97717879-0-image-a-44_1745658994234.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 10:31:48","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":315041304,"title":"2028 auditions for Democratic presidential nomination kick off as blue-state governor visits key early state","text":"It's 2025, but it's starting to feel a little bit like 2028 in New Hampshire, the state that traditionally holds the first presidential primary in the race for the White House. That's because Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, the billionaire two-term Democrat from the solidly blue Midwestern state, is coming to New Hampshire this weekend to headline the state party's largest annual fundraising gala. Pritzker, who has become one of his party’s most vocal critics of the sweeping and controversial moves by President Donald Trump during the first three months of his second tour in the White House, is seen as a potential contender for the Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination. And trips to New Hampshire — which for over a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House — are seen as an early indicator of a politician’s interest in running for the presidency in the next election. HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY EVENTUALLY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 \"We’ve got to be ready for the fight,\" Pritzker said when asked by Fox News Digital what his message will be when he delivers the keynote address at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner. The governor, a member of the Pritzker family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain and who has started several of his own venture capital and investment startups, argued that the nation is \"in a constitutional crisis\" and that \"we have too many people who are ill affected by the policies of the Trump administration.\" \"This is the moment for people to stand up and fight,\" he added. Pritzker, 60, is the first potential Democratic presidential hopeful to visit New Hampshire, or any other early primary state, since Democrats lost the White House and their Senate majority and failed to retake the House in November. And Trump and Republicans down-ballot made gains with key parts of the Democrats’ base, including with Black, Hispanic and younger voters. HEATING UP: PRESEASON MOVES IN 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RACE GETTING UNDERWAY In the wake of those setbacks, Democrats have experienced increased intra-party tensions with an angry and energized base itching to fight back against Trump. That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at Democrats, with many in the party's base upset that leaders haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president. It’s also led to reflection about what the Democratic Party stands for and its direction moving forward amid flagging favorable ratings in national polling. Two-term California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another high-profile Democrat who likely also has national ambitions in 2028, said earlier this week in an interview with \"The Hill\" that he wasn’t sure what the party truly represents. \"I don’t know what the party is,\" Newsom said. \"I’m still struggling with that.\" Asked if he's also struggling, Pritzker responded, \"I've been clear my whole life. The Democratic Party stands up for working people. Stands up for working families. We're the party of civil rights. We're the party of human rights. No doubt about that, in my mind.\" Pritzker, who is not prevented by term limits from running for re-election in 2026, has yet to say if he’ll make a bid for a third term steering Illinois. But the clock is ticking, with the filing period opening up later this year and the state’s primary just 11 months away. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION ON JB PRITZKER \"Given the circumstances of getting on the ballot for people, I would need to make a decision and announce it by, you know, by latest July,\" Pritzker said when asked about his timetable for making a decision. But it’s a possible presidential run by Pritzker that is grabbing headlines. Chicagoan Bill Daley, who served as former President Bill Clinton’s commerce secretary and former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, told The Wall Street Journal last week that \"there is no doubt that he [Pritzker] is going to run.\" Pritzker, asked about Daley's prediction, said, \"I’d guess I'd remind you that he didn't support me when I ran for governor the first time… I don't know where he gets his information.\" And on the possibility of launching a national campaign in the 2028 election cycle, Pritzker said, \"All I can tell you is, I'm focused on the question of whether I will run for re-election as governor, and on defeating the policies of Donald Trump.\" DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR GETS ULTIMATUM: STAY NEUTRAL IN PRIMARIES OR STEP DOWN The governor is no stranger to New Hampshire. He headlined the 2022 New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, and he returned last September to campaign on behalf of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced then-President Joe Biden as the party's presidential nominee in July. Pritzker made multiple stops, including addressing union members at the New Hampshire AFL-CIO’s annual Labor Day breakfast. Pritzker was among those vetted by the Harris presidential campaign as a possible running mate. The governor, who led a successful effort to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, was also among the potential 2028 White House contenders to speak during the convention week at the New Hampshire Democratic Party delegation's daily breakfasts. Veteran New Hampshire-based Democratic consultant Jim Demers noted that \"for many New Hampshire Democrats, his [Pritzker’s] visit is an early audition for 2028.\" \"It comes at a time when voters are really looking for leadership, someone who will challenge what Donald Trump is doing. So, what he says will be weighed very heavily,\" he added. Demers, pointing to Pritzker’s handful of trips to the Granite State over the past couple of years, said that \"every time he has visited with New Hampshire voters, he has delivered a message that has resonated very well.\" Neil Levesque, the longtime director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said that \"Pritzker is coming into a highly political state at an opportune time because of how fired up and charged up Democrats are in opposition to President Trump.\" And he noted that the stop \"will kick off the first of multiple visits by multiple potential candidates, considering that Democrats are hungry for an opposition.\" While Pritzker’s visit is the first as the very early moves in the 2028 White House race get underway, behind the scenes there’s already action. A Granite State-based Democratic strategist who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely shared that activists in New Hampshire are receiving fundraising emails on a regular basis from some of the potential candidates for 2028. \"Every week I receive a dozen,\" the strategist said, adding that the messages are signed by Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Rep. Ro Khanna of California and other potential 2028 contenders. The strategist said the possible White House hopefuls are \"driving messaging and their names through this constant barrage of emails.\" While the stop by Pritzker may seem very early, it's actually occurring later in the calendar than the first stop in an early-voting state in the 2024 presidential election cycle. Mike Pompeo, the former congressman from Kansas who later served as CIA director and then Secretary of State in Trump's first administration, spoke in Iowa in late March 2021. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pompeo, who took a hard look at running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination before deciding against launching a campaign, was the first of the potential Republican White House hopefuls that cycle to visit one of the early-voting primary and caucus states.","summary":"Illinois Gov.

Here was the amazing protest sentence: “Longtime White House reporters say the result has been an erosion of their independence.”\n\nThe presence of a reporter who didn’t vote Democrat doesn’t “erode” the anti-Trump animus (“independence”) of liberal activist journalists. It might balance it, suggesting journalism and liberalism are not exactly the same thing.\n\nThis spurred a trend. Politico’s Ian Ward profiled these invaders under the headline “Meet the 8 MAGA Outlets Disrupting the White House Briefing Room.” It carried the usual labeling about “the divide between the MAGA-friendly media and their more mainstream counterparts.” The extreme hatred of Trump is “more mainstream.”\n\nThen came CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, who loves to wade into MAGA crowds, trying to find the dumbest-sounding Trump supporter he can find. The headline over the video was “‘Do you consider yourself a journalist?’ CNN meets MAGA media at White House.”\n\nO’Sullivan showed clips of these pro-Trump reporters admitting their bias, and he proclaimed, “These are White House correspondents like you’ve never seen before.” Really? He spotlighted Cara Castronuova of Lindell TV asking if they’ll release Trump’s fitness routine, since he “actually looks healthier than ever before.” In 2009, a Washington Post reporter touted Obama’s “chiseled pectorals.”\n\nO’Sullivan asked Natalie Winters from Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast “Do you consider yourself a journalist?” He said many say, “You don’t deserve to be here because you’re not a real journalist.” She attacked the pro-Biden media: “I’m pretty sure the people in there spent four years covering for someone who was essentially dead, and that’s being charitable. … You guys failed, and that’s why we’re here.”\n\nCNN exemplified the point last year when anchor Dana Bash was deeply troubled over bumbling-Biden videos. They were “amplified on conservative media that in some cases are just not right and in other cases are highly, highly misleading of President Biden.”\n\nO’Sullivan lectured about the “new media” people: “A lot of them are more cheerleading President Trump than challenging him.” He ended by quoting White House Correspondents’ Association leader Eugene Daniels: The public “needs news produced by experienced, professional journalists who ask tough questions and produce fair coverage.”\n\nUnder Biden, Daniels wasn’t known for asking “tough questions.” At the 2024 Kamala cuddlefest before the National Association of Black Journalists, Daniels began by gently asking if the American people were better off after four years. Daniels went on shows such as “Washington Week” on PBS and insisted Harris was a victim: “We’ve already seen a lot of racism and sexism, and that’s going to be a huge part of this campaign.”\n\nReporters asking softballs at the White House is nothing new.

She wanted them to know their history – her early life and world were so different from theirs, she might as well have been from another planet. Knowles, the youngest of seven, born to a docker and seamstress, grew up poor in segregated Texas. Her grandchildren, born to Knowles’s superstar daughters, Beyoncé and Solange, are growing up in Los Angeles and New York with unimaginable wealth, but under unimaginable scrutiny.\n\nA couple of years ago, Knowles started writing a book that was supposed to be her behind-the-scenes take on the outfits she had created for her daughters’ music careers – the dazzling triple-denim looks she had cobbled together from fabric remnants and army-surplus stores, with almost no budget, for Beyoncé’s group Destiny’s Child in the 1990s. She was still improvising costumes once Beyoncé had gone solo and could have her pick of designer clothes; even the singer’s spectacular recent Renaissance tour had input from her mother.\n\nBut those stories from Knowles’s early life – the ones she was dictating for her grandkids – kept bubbling up, and she became more comfortable, she says, with the idea of sharing them. “Because, you know, my family’s very private,” she says; Beyoncé, notoriously so. Knowles dug out that old phone with the recordings and started listening. Eventually, she decided: “I can still be respectful and not tell their story, but tell my story.” The result is her memoir Matriarch, a brilliant account of how a resilient little girl, born in terrible times, became a powerhouse, guiding her daughters to their potential without, it seems, all of them losing their sanity.\n\nKnowles is sitting in the back of a car, speaking on Zoom, looking phenomenally glamorous – red lips, cascading hair – having just come from a photoshoot. But I suspect Knowles always looks like this. (She has even taken to borrowing Beyoncé’s glittering stage costumes for red-carpet events.)\n\nNow a multimillionaire businesswoman, Knowles raised arguably pop music’s greatest of all time. Beyoncé has won 35 Grammys, sold more than 200m records, performed at the Super Bowl, sung at inaugurations, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her mother’s life is now one of award ceremonies, beautiful houses, yachts, private jets, and business meetings for the hair and fashion lines they share. But Knowles has realised, she says, that a lot of the time, particularly with Destiny’s Child, the group she helped shepherd with her now ex-husband Mathew Knowles, her input was minimised, even criticised. “I didn’t take credit for things; I stayed in the background. Now I’m 71 and I want to be bold.” She laughs. “I don’t have those hang-ups any more, I’m just living out loud.”\n\nKnowles, who is known by fans as Mama Tina or Ms Tina, is a great talker – warm and funny, with her charming Texas accent. She is acutely aware of her children’s privacy, but can’t help addressing some of the media stories about them. When Beyoncé was pregnant with her first daughter, Blue, in 2011 (she also has seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir), the strange theory that she was faking it, complete with false baby bump, enraged her mother. “It was one of the worst times of my life, because I couldn’t say anything,” says Knowles. “But, you know, we deal with rumours all the time. So at some point you just roll with the punches and say …” She pauses. “When they start messing with your kids, your kids signed up for this. But when they start messing with your grandkids, that’s when it gets really bad.”\n\nKnowles will sometimes address these things on social media. “I get in trouble with my kids all the time for speaking out. They’re like, don’t dignify that with an answer. And most of the time I’m able not to do that, but sometimes my little fingers just …” She flickers perfectly painted nails in the air as if she’s about to type. Mostly, though, she says, “it’s so silly, and the stupidity and the ignorance that people put out there, some of it is just funny. That’s what my kids say all the time. They’re like, some of this stuff is a joke, so why are you letting it make you mad?”\n\nThere are topics, however, that she is tight-lipped about. There is no mention in the book of the 2014 incident in a lift after the Met Gala, where leaked CCTV footage showed Knowles’s younger daughter, Solange, attacking Beyoncé’s husband, the rapper Jay-Z, nor of his supposed infidelity. (The statement released after the lift footage emerged said they had apologised to each other and “moved forward as a united family”.) She also skirts over the breakup of the original Destiny’s Child in 2000 and the time Beyoncé removed her father as their manager in 2011.\n\nAs matriarch of one of the most scrutinised celebrity families – as well as Beyoncé and Solange, Knowles also considers her niece Angie, and Kelly Rowland, the Destiny’s Child singer and actor whom she helped to bring up, as daughters – what does a family get-together look like? Who does the cooking? “I do a lot of cooking, but, thank God, I don’t have to do all of it any more,” she says. “We’re together most holidays, we vacation together a lot. We make sure that we stay close.”\n\nDo people often arrive by helicopter? I’m thinking of her description in the book of Beyoncé’s 40th birthday party in Italy, arranged as a surprise by Jay-Z, which Solange initially couldn’t make, only to arrive by helicopter the day afterwards. “No, that’s not normal!” says Knowles with a laugh. “But when we’re together, it’s very normal. It’s like any other family. We’ve got our shoes off and we’re relaxed and we’re talking and we’re having a good time with each other. Kids are running around.”\n\nWhen Knowles started writing, she thought she would finish the book in triumph – fabulous in her 70s, surrounded by family and grandchildren, her daughters on top of the world. Instead, it ends with a shock diagnosis of breast cancer.\n\nLast summer, Knowles had been at Beyoncé’s house in the Hamptons, playing in the pool with her granddaughter Rumi. She writes movingly of feeling a stillness in the air, “the singular awareness of being watched with love”. Knowles turned, half-expecting, she writes, to see her late mother standing there, but it was Beyoncé. It felt like four female generations all there together.\n\nThe next day, Knowles went back to LA to have biopsies of a mass in each breast, which had been picked up in a mammogram three months earlier. She had had unusual mammograms before, which turned out to be nothing, and if the doctors weren’t hassling her to make an appointment, she thought, it couldn’t be anything to worry about. One lump was found to be benign, the other was cancer. It was caught early and removed, and she was reassured that the prognosis was good, but, she says, “it was like a punch in the face”.\n\nShe had no intention of sharing the news publicly, she says. “I was, like, absolutely not, that’s nobody’s business but mine.” But she wanted to encourage other women to check, and to keep on top of their screening tests. Knowles thought she had had a mammogram in 2022, but because of the pandemic it was postponed and then forgotten. The cancer could have been diagnosed at an even earlier stage, she says. “That is my big reason for talking about it, because I want women to take the time and not put themselves last.”\n\nWhen she arrived at her room at the hospital, Solange, Beyoncé and Kelly were there. They prayed together and sang. Solange cheered Knowles up with memes, laughing together at the TikToker Jools Lebron’s viral “very demure, very mindful” video. A month later, Knowles had more surgery to remove a blood clot, and later got an infection; Beyoncé would insist on being on speakerphone to ask Knowles’s doctors questions. She moved into Beyoncé’s house, and an old friend came to help care for her. “It was really hard, really challenging,” says Knowles. “Something that I thought was going to be easy turned into something pretty traumatic, but I am doing so good now, and I am just so grateful and blessed that I am healthy. It could have been way worse.”\n\nWhat pulled her through? “Absolutely my faith, and my kids. My kids were …” Knowles pauses. “I can’t even explain how supportive they were.” Her voice cracks and she holds back tears. “This was a seven-day-a-week thing, and I felt, with them by my side, I could get through anything – and I did.” Did it affect her confidence? No, she says with a smile. “My confidence is better, actually. I decided that my silver lining of all of this would be a breast reduction, and, let me tell you, I wore a dress to the Billboard awards that I could never have dreamed of wearing before.” She laughs. “So that part, for me, has been awesome.”\n\nNeither has it brought fresh perspectives on life – those came a decade earlier, she says, when she turned 60. “I had the view that I would live each day as fully as I possibly can, and just live out loud, which doesn’t mean I’m loud or boisterous or anything. It just means that I am a priority, and I don’t feel bad about the good things that I’ve accomplished. I feel proud, I feel happy, I feel fulfilled.”\n\nShe might have a new outlook, but has not forgotten her female ancestors. Rosalie, enslaved in Louisiana in the early 1800s, managed to hold on to her daughter Célestine when the white family who had enslaved them downsized. Célestine became pregnant by the slaver’s grandson; later, he would buy Célestine and their two children at a public auction. “I type those words, say them aloud,” writes Knowles, “and I feel that fear and rage in my blood, the trauma passed down through my DNA.” Living with the man’s white wife and children, Célestine would go on to have 10 more children by him – one of them, Odilia, Knowles’s grandmother.\n\nKnowles’s mother, Agnes – whose stories instilled a firm sense of Black pride and female strength – named her Célestine (Tina for short), after Knowles’s great-grandmother. Tina’s maiden name, Beyoncé, was a misspelling of the family’s surname – all her siblings had variations. When Agnes had asked for it to be corrected, she was told to be grateful that they had birth certificates at all. Tina named Beyoncé to honour her own name and her history.\n\nKnowles’s family lived in the island city Galveston, just off the Texas coast. She remembers the rocky bit of the beach that Galveston’s Black population was allowed to use, the areas in the backs of restaurants where they could order food, which they would have to eat outside. Having to stand at the back in buses.\n\nIt was worse in Louisiana, where her parents were from. When Knowles was there visiting relatives in 1959, her cousins told her they had to wait outside a shop until the white children inside had finished. “I was really confused,” says Knowles. “It was very shocking to me.” And then there was her cousins’ reaction: “They were just OK with it, and they thought I was a troublemaker.” She pauses. “As an adult, I totally get it, because if I had pushed it, that could have been a very bad outcome.” Only four years earlier, 14-year-old Emmett Till, visiting relatives in Mississippi, was abducted and murdered after being accused of offending a white woman in a grocery store. “My mom would prep us for Louisiana,” says Knowles. “She was always saying, ‘You can’t do what you do at home, it’s a different place.’ I had the message, but I didn’t fully understand it until [the shop incident] happened.”\n\nFor Agnes, drilling those rules into her children, however painful, was a matter of survival. One night, Knowles’s 17-year-old brother was arrested after falling asleep outside somebody’s house. Knowles, then in her early teens, remembers their mother praying, convinced the police were going to kill her son. “We were so afraid that we’d lost my brother,” she says. When he was released the following day, he had been beaten up so badly that his ribs were broken.\n\nFrom then on, the police would harass her family. Her father would be constantly stopped in his car. Waiting for her brother to pick her up outside the cinema, Knowles was questioned by police and taken to the police station when she refused to give her name. There were other traumatising, dehumanising incidents. Once she was violently ill, and her father took her to hospital. She was given an invasive vaginal examination, without explanation or consent, that left her bleeding. The doctors, seeing a Black teenage girl, assumed she was pregnant or had a sexually transmitted disease. They missed that she had viral hepatitis.\n\n“I had a lot of anger,” remembers Knowles. “I was just mad when I was a teenager, but didn’t really connect the dots about why I was so angry. It was tough years.” She wasn’t rebellious in terms of drugs and boys, she says, “but I was rebellious in my mouth. I was rebellious in being angry at my parents, and it wasn’t even their fault, but I was just mad.” Had she told her children about these experiences, or did they come as a surprise when they read her book? “I told my children. They know all of these things.”\n\nOne of her early nicknames was Badass Tenie B, perfect for that spirited little girl. “That was not a term of endearment,” she points out. “It was like, that’s a bad little kid. She’s wild, talking back, she’s doing all these things.” Does she still feel like Badass Tenie B sometimes? Knowles smiles. “Now I can revel in it, I can enjoy it, and I can pull her out when I need to protect myself or my children, because I pulled her out all the time for my kids. Badass Tenie B would come out because that’s my protector.”\n\nBy the time Beyoncé was born, in 1981, Tina was married to Mathew Knowles, then a successful sales executive, and living in Houston. It’s fun to read about Beyoncé as a challenging baby, whose two-hourly night wakings would only be soothed by jazz. Knowles also writes about Beyoncé’s shyness as a child; it’s hard to believe that now she performs to millions. What caused the transformation? “Performing changed her life. Even when she was shy, she was dancing and putting on shows, and she would just come alive at that time, which is why we got her in the dance class. When she was dancing, there was no shyness.” She pauses. “I don’t know if shy is the right word, but she is still reserved. She always has been and always will be. She’s not that person that walks into the room, like, ‘I’m here!’ I don’t think that changed. I just think that she has this other personality when she gets on stage.”\n\nSolange, born five years later, was always more outgoing, says Knowles, and a creative spirit. Later, she would become known for her performance art and groundbreaking album A Seat at the Table, which includes spoken-word interludes from her parents among its songs of Black womanhood. Knowles writes about not wanting Solange to be overshadowed by her older sister before she had a chance to develop her own talent.\n\nDid she worry about sibling rivalry? “I don’t know if I worried about it, but everybody who has kids that are five years apart, there is a time where they’re super close, and then when the older kid gets to be around seven or eight, that little kid is going to get on their nerves. I started seeing signs that Beyoncé was getting irritated with her, and didn’t want her around as much. I started seeing them being mean to each other, and that was scary for me, so I got them in therapy. It didn’t take long, because the therapist showed Beyoncé how that could be so damaging to her sister, and she loved her sister, so she became way kinder and more protective of her.”\n\nWas it a problem later, as Beyoncé’s megastardom eclipsed the careers of both Kelly Rowland and Solange? “No, I never worried about the competition or sibling rivalry with them as adults,” says Knowles. “They are so close, and they love and support each other, all three of them in every way. People try to make up that story, but it doesn’t fit, because they’re so different, and there is no rivalry between them.” How much of that came from Knowles? She writes that she made a point of never comparing them, always celebrating their differences. Did that help? “Absolutely, and I also taught my girls that other girls are not your competition. You are your own competition. Go and work harder so that you can top your own self. Don’t focus on them, because the time that you’re spending focusing on what they’re doing, you could be working on yourself and becoming better. They learned that very early. I think that philosophy had a lot to do with who they are now.”\n\nIn the early days of Destiny’s Child, and its predecessor group Girls Tyme, Knowles worried the girls were driving themselves too hard. “It was their choice – they lived and breathed music and what they were doing, and I would have to make them go and do stuff.” She would force Beyoncé and Kelly to go to high-school parties, she says, to give them a sense of normal 16-year-old life. “They would rather stay home and listen to music and rehearse, and I just didn’t feel like it was as balanced as it should be.” Meanwhile, Mathew created a “boot camp”, as Knowles describes it in the book, taking the girls running and getting them to sing the whole time to increase their lung capacity so they could perform challenging choreography on stage.\n\nKnowles had endured some tough years. She writes about being hit by a tax bill and the family going bankrupt. She had forgiven Mathew’s infidelities over the years, but eventually she left and moved with the girls into a small flat. She had set up a hairdressing salon, which was doing well, but it was a stressful time. “Your kids have to be your priority. I believe that with all my heart, but I do think that if I had to do it all over again, I would have balanced a little more in terms of myself. It was tough. I just didn’t have the time to focus on the pain of whatever else was going on in my life.”\n\nFor years, even after she left, Knowles’s marriage would be on and off. Several months after she filed for divorce in 2009, she started secretly seeing Mathew again: the couple took romantic cruises on their boat for several nights at a time before ending up at their Galveston beach house. If one of the girls called, worried their mother was lonely, their father would have to be quiet. There was one extraordinary incident when they rang to surprise Knowles on Mother’s Day, announcing they were on their way. It meant their father had to flee before they got there. The “affair” only ended when he confessed what reporters already knew – that he had recently fathered a child with someone else. Knowles would later get married again, to the actor Richard Lawson in 2015, but she divorced him nine years later when she was 70.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s clear from Matriarch, it’s that Knowles feels things deeply – whether that’s love for the people in her life or the rights of wider communities around her. Her Instagram page is often political – recently, it included admiring posts about Senator Cory Booker’s 25-hour evisceration of President Trump. She is a friend of Michelle Obama and she, Beyoncé and Kelly appeared at a rally for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (Although, when I ask about the current situation in the US, she says: “I’m not going to talk about politics.”) She has also long been a supporter of LGBTQ+ movements and lost her nephew Johnny to the HIV/Aids epidemic. They were a similar age and had been inseparable childhood friends who both loved fashion and dreamed of getting out of Galveston. They lived together as adults, and he had helped Knowles’s family, running the household and designing clothes for the girls. (Years later, Beyoncé dedicated her Renaissance album to the cousin she called “uncle”, who introduced her to the house music and disco made by queer people of colour that inspired the album.)\n\nBy the late 90s, the HIV/Aids epidemic had killed many people within the gay community. “Johnny lost all his friends, and I was always fearful of it,” says Knowles. Then Johnny became ill. “We tried to protect him as much as we could, and tried to educate ourselves so that we weren’t condoning the ignorance that was going on at the time.” It was shocking to visit him at the hospice, where so many other young men had been disowned by their families. “I just find it really hard to believe that people could abandon their kid, no matter what they’re going through,” says Knowles. Johnny died in 1998 at the age of 48.\n\nAround the time of Johnny’s death, Destiny’s Child had a record deal and were starting to get big. Knowles had to fight for the girls, particularly their look, which she took charge of. They were sent drab clothes, and designers wouldn’t dress them. She writes: “The reality was that many did not want to give their clothes to these curvy Black girls.” Instead, Knowles came up with her own creations. So many are enduring: the camouflage looks for Survivor, or the strappy and cut-out leather-look creations for Bills Bills Bills. Some people at the label didn’t appreciate her input (one of Knowles’s arch chapter titles about this is “Tina is the problem”). The colours she chose, Knowles writes, were “too bold, too bright, too Black for them”.\n\nSometimes, says Knowles with a smile, “I’ll look at some of the clothes and I’m like, ‘Oh lord, what were we thinking?’” But mostly their look worked and the group and their fans loved them. “I think the label just didn’t have this open mind to things – it had to be proven to them. And, in all honesty, we were country, we were from Texas. We had big hair, I love sparkle and it wasn’t what was happening at that time – we were going against the grain. But these were four Black girls from the south, and we worshipped Motown, so we wanted something different. They were unique.”\n\nMany parents, especially in the entertainment industry, who have been involved with their children’s careers end up falling out (Beyoncé’s relationship with her father hasn’t seemed so straightforward). Why hasn’t Knowles, who still works with Beyoncé three decades on? “I’m very close to my kids,” says Knowles, “and I also know when enough is enough, like, sometimes they don’t want my input, and I know how to keep my mouth closed and mind my own business. I also realised that my kids are adults. You’ve got to let your kids grow up.”\n\nThe book gives a mother’s-eye view of Solange’s artistic development, Kelly steadily forging her own path, and Beyoncé’s work ethic and steely determination. Knowles was there when Beyoncé, watching Whitney Houston sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, declared that one day she would do the same (in 2004, she succeeded). And in the meeting at the record label where her daughter was told her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, didn’t have any potential hits, but refused to back down (it spent eight weeks at No 1).\n\nI ask her what she thinks are the most valuable lessons she has taught her daughters, and what she has learned from them. “They’ve taught me some great stuff. Beyoncé has taught me how to take a compliment, Solange has told taught me to be bolder, Kelly has taught me patience, and Angie has just taught me to laugh at stuff and not take it so seriously.”\n\nAs for what she has left them, it’s “family first. Also what my mom taught me, which I think is the message they are passing on to their children – my mom would say, pretty is as pretty does. My mom would always say to me, ‘You’re a pretty girl, but one day you’re not going to be so cute, and what people are going to remember is how you acted and how you treated them.’”\n\nThere is something moving about the wisdom passed through her family’s female line, and something energising about Knowles’s power seeming to grow as she gets older. Finally, she says, she has reached an age where she is content to be single. “I think, up until 70, I really felt like no matter how great my life was, I need to have a partner to make it whole. I don’t feel that way any more.” There is too much to do, even if Knowles seems to have unlimited energy. “You know, 71 is harder than 70, and 70 is harder than 69, but, I tell you, I’m going to try to keep my young spirit.” She smiles, dazzling. “The phrase ‘I can’t’ – I try not to use that too much.”","summary":"Pop’s top matriarch is finally getting the credit she’s due. She talks about her shock diagnosis, conspiracy theories about her family, and the Instagram posts that get her in trouble with her kids\n\nIt’s been a decade since Tina Knowles started dictating her life story into her phone for her grandchildren and future great-grandchildren.

Failures of governance and a certain flexibility, to put it at its mildest, in financial controls have produced a loss of public confidence.\n\nAt the same time, audiences are migrating to streaming platforms.\n\nThe programme announced this week, which is underwritten by the taxpayer, is an attempt to put matters on a more even keel. \n\nThe four-year plan aims to reduce staffing by 20% and take the workforce down by 400 from its current establishment of 1,700.\n\nRTÉ is far from the first media organisation to grapple with this challenge in what is proving a turbulent first three decades of this century. \n\nAnd companies and employment under risk is not confined to publicly-funded players whose market has moved.\n\nRTÉ has operated in various guises since broadcasting commenced in 1926.\n\nIntel, one of the founders of the digital age, which employs more than 5,000 staff in Ireland, is looking to reduce its own costs by more than €1bn globally.\n\nRTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst is struggling with a problem which will be well known to chief executives, chief financial officers, and owners around the world — delivering substantial payroll savings to bring the cost base down below the revenues.\n\nWhat is not so familiar to many is the scope he has to operate.\n\nIn Ireland, the statutory redundancy payment is a lump sum based on your pay and length of service. \n\nIf you have been employed for two years, you will be eligible for two weeks’ pay for every year of service, plus an additional week’s pay.\n\nThe maximum amount used to calculate redundancy pay is €600 a week (or €31,200 a year), even if your pay is more per week.\n\nThe terms being offered at RTÉ are somewhat different, more in keeping with Celtic Tiger Ireland, and labelled by some as a “megabucks” offer.\n\nOn the table at Donnybrook will be propositions that staff with two to five years’ service will be entitled to four weeks’ pay per year; those with five to 10 years will qualify for five weeks per year; while those with over 10 years’ service will receive six weeks’ pay per year. Payouts will be capped at €300,000.\n\nApplications will be received until May 23, with approved members to leave the broadcaster by the end of 2025. Staff under the age of 55 may qualify for redundancy, while those aged 55 can obtain early retirement.\n\nSome reports indicate that RTÉ expects a “stampede” for the first 100 voluntary redundancies.\n\nWhile Mr Bakhurst makes the usual noises about these terms not becoming available again, many people in other industries may be wishing that they had a similarly generous, or even roughly comparable, offer to help them through times of transition.","summary":"Both countries go to the polls shortly","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41620576.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9194/4597192_15_seoimage1x1_Copy_20of_20CANADA_20Election_20073185.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:00:00","author":"Donald Trump,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Donald Trump","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":314904204,"title":"Paramount’s Shari Redstone Was Paid $523,000 in 2024","text":"Paramount’s board of directors raked in a combined $3.8 million in compensation for 2024, per an amended 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nShari Redstone, the media giant’s non-executive chairwoman and controlling shareholder, received $523,387 in total director compensation – the fourth highest paid member of the board.\n\nThe package included $300,000 in fees, $198,227 in stock awards, $160 reflecting a change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings and $25,000 in “other” compensation, which comprised matching contributions for donations made to eligible tax-exempt organizations on her behalf by the company in 2024. \n\nTheWrap previously reported that Redstone will exit the media giant’s board of directors following completion of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media.

Skydance has asked the FCC to dismiss the objections. It also blasted PRP’s bid as “belated” and “unserious” and said it contains “overwhelming evidence of fraud.”\n\nOther Paramount shareholders who have called out the deal include The Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, who the Delaware Court ordered the media giant to turn documents over to for a similar investigation into potential corporate wrongdoing, Scott Baker, who has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit arguing the Skydance deal could cost shareholders $1.65 billion in damages, as well as the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), which believes the damages could exceed that figure.\n\nSeparately, President Donald Trump has called for CBS News’ broadcast license to be revoked and is suing the network for $20 billion over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

It is a family decision,' Bacon said. \n\nHe would face a tough environment, as Kamala Harris won his district by four points in 2024, while he held on against Democrat opponent Tony Vargas by less than 6,000 votes. \n\nThe Nebraska Congressman has largely voted with Republicans, though he has been critical of Trump and was one of the few members of the GOP to vote to establish the January 6th Commission. \n\nBacon was the first Republican to call for Hegseth's firing on the same day that Trump defended his head of defense on the day of the White House Easter Egg Roll. \n\n'I had concerns from the get-go because Pete Hegseth didn't have a lot of experience,' the Nebraska lawmaker told Politico, becoming the first House Republican to call for Hegseth to go.\n\n'I like him on Fox,' Bacon said of the former cable TV commentator. 'But does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? That's a concern.'\n\nBacon's scalding remarks follow a stunning op-ed in the publication by Hegseth's former Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot. \n\nUllyot, a Marine Corps vet who served as a White House national security spokesman during Trump's first term, announced his resignation from the Pentagon Wednesday.\n\nThe spokesman called himself 'a longtime backer of the secretary,' but went on to write that the Pentagon was in 'a full-blown meltdown' and 'total chaos' amid the Signal chat scandals.\n\nHe said 'the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.' He even went on to predict: 'It's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.'\n\nHe had helped push the MAGA agenda inside the Pentagon by forcing legacy media outlets out of their workspace, then issued confusing comments defending the decision to take down a page honoring the military service of baseball great Jackie Robinson.\n\nTrump brushed off the development Monday at the White House Easter Egg roll, dismissing the criticism by his own former aide. \n\n'It's just fake news, they just bring up stories I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. You know he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and that's what he's doing.

We want you on the show.\"The alleged meeting occurred after Stern was \"pissed\" his audience was \"forgetting about us,\" after years of him dominating the airwaves. He also made it clear if his show did not find success soon and spread, employees would lose their jobs, as he also made an effort to clean up his ways after becoming known for his shocking material.\n\nThe host is also said to have encouraged his employees to reach out to certain celebrities including Brad Pitt and the late Rush Limbaugh in hopes of increasing the same type of buzz he had in his peak.\n\nHowever, radio executive Tim Sabean – who worked with Howard from 2006 to around 2013, thinks he made a bad decision and \"allowed the wrong people to guide his brand and it's a shame.\"Meanwhile, John Melendez, who worked on The Howard Stern Show from 1988 until his exit in 2004, claimed Stern's plea to employees to pretend to be fans was \"a scar in his career.\"\n\nHe explained: \"Howard asking people to make fake Twitter accounts is the most embarrassing thing in his career.\n\n\"Here’s a guy we all thought was about reality, here’s a guy that was supposed to be real and now he’s telling people to make fake Twitter accounts so he can get better guests?\"\"It’s an embarrassment – and I love Howard – but it’s an embarrassment. He should be ashamed to even do that,\" Melendez added.\n\nThe 71-year-old has apparently been struggling for a while with not being the top name in the industry like he once was. In October 2024, Stern is said to have been left raging after rival SiriusXM podcast Call Her Daddy scored an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris before he did.An insider told RadarOnline.com at the time: \"This is the latest sign Howard is losing his grip on his mega-money deal as the face of Sirius.\n\n\"He was raging behind the scenes Kamala did Call Her Daddy first, and he’s now gripped with fear this could be the start of the end of his career.\"\n\nAlex Cooper, the host of Call Her Daddy, rakes in about $42million per year at SiriusXM, making her the highest earner among hosts.","summary":"Howard Stern is being accused of making his employees pretend to be fans of his show with 'fake Twitter accounts' in order to grab the attention of celebrities.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/howard-stern-ordered-staff-members-fake-twitter-accounts/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/JK8RuyX2G/0x0/howard-stern-ordered-staff-members-fake-twitter-accounts1-1745603850573.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 22:45:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":314896878,"title":"The Court’s deportation lunacy, progs are losing — but won’t quit and other commentary","text":"Legal take: The Court’s Deportation Lunacy \n\n“The Supreme Court says illegal aliens” deserve due process “before they are spirited away to their countries of origin,” and “liberal activists are celebrating a fundamental right,” grumbles the Washington Times’ editorial board.\n\nBut liberals’ goals seem more about “perpetuating lawlessness at the border” than justice.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge ruled “President Trump couldn’t reverse President Biden’s unilateral decision” to “parole” over 500,000 illegal immigrants “from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela” into the US.\n\nThe judge insists “that what Mr. Biden accomplished with a stroke of his autopen can’t be undone by Mr. Trump without ‘case-by-case review’ ” — which “would take 350 years” to complete. \n\nYet the law that lets the administration set parole policy “is unambiguous.” The Supreme Court must “apply common sense and curb these judicial interventions.” \n\nCrime beat: Progs Are Losing — but Won’t Quit \n\n“After spikes in homicides and other offenses, which sparked fears of a return to the bloody New York of the 1990s, major crime in New York City has headed toward historic lows,” reports Rafael A. Mangual at The New York Times.\n\nThe failed “progressive policy experiment that kept criminals out of prison and jail” has been replaced “with increased enforcement, concentrated in areas of New York City with the most crime.”\n\nBut progressives still “push to abolish gang databases,” limit “gunshot detection technology” and refuse “modest” tweaks to “the state’s 2019 discovery changes.”\n\nSome seem “more concerned about criminals” than victims. Like the left and right in the 1980s and ’90s, we need to reach a “consensus on crime control” before things go bad. \n\nFree-speech watch: Trump vs. the Censors \n\nTeam Trump “has demonstrated a dogged devotion to dismantling and destroying” the “censorship-industrial complex,” notes Ben Weingarten at The Federalist.\n\nNext up? The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which served as “ ‘nerve center’ of fed-led speech policing.”\n\nTrump “tasked the attorney general and secretary of homeland security with investigating” CISA and “laid off more than 100 CISA staffers,” while cutting “entities involved in 2020 censorship-related efforts.”\n\nYet “to date, no one has faced justice for imposing arguably the greatest censorship regime in U.S. history upon the American people.”\n\nAnd “the legislative branch must codify the administration’s policies to ensure the speech policing apparatus does not once again spring into action under a future president.” \n\nConservative: Social-Media Is Hurting Dems \n\nThanks to social media, “one public school teacher with a TikTok account, green hair, and a septum piercing can hijack a political movement,” quips National Review’s Christian Schneider.\n\nThat fact has “tipped” the Democratic Party “hard toward the loudest and most ideologically rigid participants.”\n\nTake social-media star AOC: She has “the worst approval rating of any Democratic politician measured by a February Gallup poll.”\n\nBut “the overly online left actually believes that the tonic for the losses of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris in the past decade is to run an even less qualified candidate who is significantly further to the left.”\n\n“Democrats can still win elections,” but “the long-term prognosis for a party that is increasingly defined by its most performative wing is not good.” \n\nEnergy desk: An EV ‘Off-Ramp’ for Dems \n\n“Realizing that electric-vehicle mandates are costly and politically unpopular,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore “is doing a U-turn on his state’s EV mandate” by “delaying penalties for manufacturers that don’t meet their EV sales quotas,” cheer The Wall Street Journal’s editors.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin first “unchained his state” from the rules, which would have hurt “Maryland auto dealers and state sales tax revenue,” since “Maryland residents could cross the Potomac to buy the gas-powered car they want.”\n\nMoore claims “Trump forced his hand” with tariffs, but the real problem is EVs aren’t selling.\n\n“Even with subsidies EVs are already too expensive for most middle-class Americans, and their limited range can make them impractical.”\n\nStill, “Moore is showing fellow Democrats an off-ramp from their EV blunder.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Liberals’ goals seem more about “perpetuating lawlessness at the border” than justice, grumbles the Washington Times’ editorial board.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/opinion/the-courts-deportation-lunacy-progs-are-losing-but-wont-quit-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/2025-asked-supreme-court-permit-103226593.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 22:38:48","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":314890446,"title":"Trump blows off Joe Biden's attendance at Pope's funeral: 'It's not high on my list'","text":"President Donald Trump said a meeting with Joe Biden in Rome was ‘not high on my list’ as he shrugged off his former rival attending Pope Francis’ funeral.\n\nHe and first lady Melania Trump had late-night arrival in Rome ahead of Saturday’s state funeral at St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nTrump revealed he hadn’t known that Biden and wife Jill Biden would also be at the basilica for the service.\n\n‘Oh he is? I didn’t know,’ he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with the former president, Trump replied: ‘It’s not high on my list. It’s really not.’\n\nBut the president will have some sit downs, including with Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni.\n\n‘I’m going to be meeting with some people,’ Trump said of his trip, ‘and a little bit quickly. Frankly, it’s a little bit disrespectful to have meetings when you’re at the funeral at the pope.’\n\nHe didn’t address if he’d met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also will be attending the funeral. Trump has been pushing hard for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

The Trumps are spending less than 24 hours in the Eternal City, coming in specifically to honor the late pontiff.\n\n‘I think we’re going to try and see a couple of people who are important to what we do,’ the president said without getting specific.\n\nAfter the official arrival at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, the first couple headed toward the ambassador’s residence, Villa Taverna, where they’ll be spending the night.\n\nThere the president will take photos with members of the military before getting some sleep. The Trumps are scheduled to fly back to the United States as soon as the funeral is over.\n\nThe president described Pope Francis as a ‘good man. He loved the world actually. He was just a good man. I met him twice. I thought he was a fantastic kind of a guy.’\n\nThe Trumps will join a range of political and cultural figures at the Vatican on Saturday, including Prince William, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Javier Milei, the conservative President of Pope Francis’ native Argentina.\n\nDelegations from about 130 countries, including 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs, will attend the state funeral.\n\nBut the president could find himself seated toward the back of the Basilica for the Catholic mass.\n\nThe Vatican has strict protocols and seating order, which was heavily enforced when Pope John Paul II was buried.\n\nCatholic royalty, such as the Spanish King, get the first row.\n\nNext come non-Catholic royals such as the Prince of Wales, who will attend the funeral on behalf of King Charles III, along with the King and Queen of Sweden and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.\n\nAfter them will be Trump and other world leaders.\n\nThe leaders will be seated alphabetically, according to the name of their country in French as that was the traditional language of diplomacy when the protocols were made.\n\nThe president, dressed casually Friday for the eight-hour flight with his tie off and shirt unbuttoned, told reporters on Air Force One he was attending the service partially because he won Catholic voters in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump won Catholics by more than 120,000 votes when he faced former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIt was Trump’s anti-abortion policies and his appointment of conservative judges onto the Supreme Court – who ultimately overturned Roe vs. Wade – that put the voting bloc in his corner.\n\nIn 2020, the Catholic vote was evenly split between Trump and Biden, who was the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy.\n\nTrump himself identifies as a ‘non-denominational Christian.’ First lady Melania Trump is Catholic.\n\nThe Trumps met Pope Francis during a visit to the Vatican in 2017 during the president’s first term.\n\nAt the time, Melania described it as an experience she would ‘never forget.’\n\nShe brought a pair of rosary beads for the pontiff to bless.\n\nShe is the first Catholic first lady in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nBut most may remember that meeting because of a cute moment involving the pontiff and the first lady, when the pontiff asked her what she feeds the president.\n\n‘Pizza?’ the first lady was heard answering.\n\nBut it may have been a ‘lost in translation’ moment as some think the first lady said potica, which is a traditional sweet nut roll pastry from Eastern Europe.\n\nPresident Trump and Pope Francis also had their differences.\n\nIn 2015, Trump said Francis was too political, and the pontiff later suggested Trump wasn't Christian over his \"build a wall\" rhetoric.\n\nTrump, responded that ‘for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.’\n\nThe trip to Rome marks Trump’s first foreign trip of his second term. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia next month.","summary":"Donald Trump made the remark as he landed in Rome ahead of the harrowing ceremony.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649369/trump-joe-biden-pope-francis-funeral.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/25/22/97707585-0-image-a-8_1745617132812.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 21:56:05","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.034},{"id":315110484,"title":"'60 Minutes' is a TV news powerhouse brand. Can it withstand Trump pressure?","text":"For nearly six decades, there have been few media institutions as durable and respected as the CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes.\" Even as traditional appointment TV viewing fades, \"60 Minutes\" remains the most watched news program, approaching 10 million viewers in some weeks, according to Nielsen data. Correspondent roles on the program are the most coveted positions in TV journalism. Its deeply reported stories have influence in an age when other mainstream news outlets' clout has diminished in a fragmented media landscape. But \"60 Minutes\" now faces an unprecedented crisis. This week, the program lost its executive producer, Bill Owens, only the third person to hold the job in the show's storied history. His farewell note to staff cited interference from the corporate owner, Paramount Global, which is seeking regulatory clearance from the Trump administration to complete an $8-billion merger with Skydance Media. Clouding the deal, which requires approval by the Federal Communications Commission, is President Trump's $20-billion lawsuit against CBS over the program's October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The case goes before a mediator next week. Trump alleges the program was deceptively edited to favor Harris, a charge that 1st Amendment experts say is spurious. But Shari Redstone, controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, and the Skydance partners want to clear the legal obstacle to close their deal, even if it means a settlement. A Paramount Global representative declined to comment. The staff of \"60 Minutes\" was shaken by Owens' departure. But no one is expected to follow him out the door, largely because it would be seen as giving in to Trump, said one longtime member of the program who was not authorized to comment publicly. In the short term, Owens' exit is not likely to change the hard-charging journalistic values of the program, as many of his lieutenants share his ethos. Executive editor Tanya Simon, who is running the program on an interim basis, is the daughter of the late Bob Simon, a well-known correspondent for the program. \"She is one tough cookie,\" said Tom Bettag, a former network news producer who worked on the program and is now a lecturer at the Merrill School of Journalism at the University of Maryland. \"The troops admire her.\" While Owens cited corporate interference, there was little evidence of it on the screen. \"60 Minutes\" remained dogged in covering the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency, with critical reports on the administration's handling of Ukraine and the bird flu outbreak. The program brought together a Marine Corps band that was dissolved as part of the administration's purge of diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the military. \"60 Minutes\" staffers credit the drive of Owens, a 25-year veteran of the program, to get tough Trump stories on the air. CBS executives not authorized to comment noted that \"60 Minutes\" has a long history of operating independently and Owens was likely not used to the additional oversight implemented in recent months. Former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky was enlisted last fall to oversee standards at the news division after Redstone became irritated over some of the network's coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, including a \"60 Minutes\" piece that criticized former President Biden's handling of the conflict. But the larger fear at \"60 Minutes\" is that the company will settle the lawsuit with an apology and payment to Trump. Any willingness to placate the president could have the \"60 Minutes\" journalists and producers looking over their shoulders as they try to do their jobs. Confidence, swagger and even a bit of arrogance are part of what made \"60 Minutes\" a TV news powerhouse since 1968. Those characteristics may be undercut by uncertainty over corporate support, making it difficult to aggressively cover the Trump White House. \"People want to work at CBS News and especially at '60 Minutes' because they want to work in a place that will stand up and fight for themselves,\" Bettag said. \"I have students who look at '60 Minutes' and say 'that's the kind of person I want to be.'\" \"60 Minutes\" has been subjected to corporate pressure in the past when network owners were involved in merger talks. When Laurence Tisch owned CBS and was looking to sell the company to Westinghouse in 1995, the network killed a \"60 Minutes\" story that featured tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, a former Brown & Williamson executive who revealed that its cigarettes contained additives to boost the nicotine that keeps smokers hooked. Brown & Williamson threatened CBS with a lawsuit, claiming the interview would interfere with Wigand's confidentiality agreement with the company. Under orders from its legal department, ''60 Minutes'' did not broadcast the interview or air Wigand's most damaging charges until after the Wall Street Journal reported on a deposition he gave in another case. The conflict was dramatized in the 1999 Michael Mann film \"The Insider\" and stained the program's stellar reputation. \"60 Minutes\" survived that episode and maintained its stature as the gold standard of TV journalism. In recent years, the program has dominated investigative journalism in prime time as its competitors \"Dateline\" on NBC and \"20/20\" on ABC have moved exclusively into telling true crime stories. What is baffling people who have worked on the program is why Paramount Global or Skydance would want to risk damaging the value of an asset that continues to generate millions in profit for the network and provides enviable stature. \"I pray they back off and see that there would be real glory in speaking up and supporting '60 Minutes,' which is truly a national treasure,\" Bettag said. \"It is also a cash cow and it has an identity for a network, which is truly important.\"","summary":"The venerable CBS newsmagazine is in an unprecedented bind between a Trump lawsuit and a pending sale of parent company Paramount Global.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-25/between-shari-redstone-and-trump-can-60-minutes-survive","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c44d7cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2Fa2%2F7c733d1a447d8b029cfe5b201894%2F60-minutes-bill-whita","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 21:53:04","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":314907762,"title":"Peter Dutton was fired up before the election was called – but has the Coalition wilted in the campaign furnace?","text":"It was 12 January – 75 days before the federal election would be called – and Peter Dutton was literally feeling the heat.\n\nAs the opposition leader addressed a Liberal party rally from a stuffy room in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visible beads of sweat ran down his forehead.\n\nDutton made it through the 38-minute speech, outlining in broad strokes his vision to “get Australia back on track” while wiping perspiration from his brow with a blue and white checkered handkerchief.\n\nIt was his first public appearance of 2025, a scene-setter for the election year ahead.\n\nThe sight of the hard-edged former Queensland cop sweating under the spotlight would prove a striking analogy for the campaign proper, where Dutton appears to have wilted in the election furnace.\n\nThe campaign has been defined by major shifts on policies, scarce detail on others, outbreaks of ill-discipline, candidate scandals, and signs of a leader sapped of confidence just as his opponent found his. The overall performance has perplexed veteran Coalition strategists, frustrated conservative supporters and deflated some MPs, for whom hopes of forming government after 3 May now appear illusory.\n\n“Perhaps we’ve been kidding ourselves,” one Liberal source has lamented.\n\nLofty expectations\n\nCoalition insiders concede Dutton’s personal ratings have fallen since Anthony Albanese called the election on 28 March. The opposition leader admitted as much at Tuesday night’s leaders’ debate, blaming Labor’s “$20m” negative ad blitz for dragging down his vote.\n\nThe Labor machine has executed a ruthless anti-Dutton campaign, mercilessly peddling claims about $600bn nuclear reactors and shuttered Medicare urgent clinics that the Coalition have rejected as bald-faced lies.\n\nA week out from polling day the Coalition is not losing hope, adamant its internal research paints a rosier picture about its prospects, including in marginal seats, than the increasingly grim numbers in published national polls.\n\nThe proportion of undecided voters is still almost 30%, according to some research, making strategists wary of seat-by-seat predictions.\n\n“It is closer than the national polls are suggesting,” one senior source says.\n\nIn Victoria, the opposition remains confident of winning Aston, Chisholm and McEwen and is growing optimistic about its chances in Goldstein, Hawke and Gorton.\n\nThe Coalition is banking on gaining Bennelong, Gilmore and Paterson in New South Wales and is hopeful in Brisbane in the Queensland capital and Bullwinkel, Tangney and Curtin in WA.\n\nWinning those seats would almost certainly be enough to force Labor into a minority government, an outcome the Coalition might have accepted when Albanese was revelling in an extended political honeymoon after the 2022 election.\n\nBut it would fall short of the lofty expectations that built internally and externally in the 18 months after the voice to parliament referendum, to a point some MPs returned from the Christmas break believing Dutton could defeat a first-term government for the first time since 1931.\n\nThere was a view the global inflation crisis – and 13 interest rate rises domestically – would cruel a lacklustre Albanese government just as it had incumbents around the world, including the US and UK.\n\nThe high-water mark for optimism was in February, when a poll in the Nine newspapers put the Coalition ahead 55-45 on a two-party preferred basis.\n\n Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\n\nSome Coalition insiders now believe those numbers were “illusionary”, reflective not of rising support for Dutton, or even anger at Albanese, but rather a general reflection of the mood of a fed-up and financially stressed electorate.\n\nThe Coalition might have “stripped a lot of bark” off Labor in the past 18 months, as one veteran conservative strategist put it, but still needed to offer a reason for voters to “walk across the road to their side”.\n\nFlaw in the campaign\n\nJust days after Cyclone Alfred forced Albanese to cancel plans for a 12 April election, internal unrest about the Coalition’s lack of major economic policies spilled out into the public.\n\nDutton and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, brushed off the “free advice”, which was privately dismissed as the predictable grumbling of agitators with personal agendas.\n\nWhatever the motives, the series of articles – including one in Guardian Australia – exposed the bare-bones nature of the Coalition’s agenda.\n\n“We were told everything was under control. We were told to give them the benefit of the doubt,” one Coalition source said.\n\nAhead of the 25 March budget, the opposition had no centrepiece cost-of-living relief offering; no short-term plan to reduce power prices; no commitment on defence spending.\n\nDutton’s budget reply dealt with two of those missing pieces, committing to a 12-month cut to the fuel excise and an east coast gas reserve.\n\nA one-off income tax offset of up to $1,200, new first home buyer incentives and a commitment to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP over the next five years have also been announced during the campaign.\n\nSenior Coalition MPs said the announcements were timed to coincide with voters tuning in to the election debate.\n\nSources confirmed the campaign waited until the past week to pivot to crime and national security because the traditional Coalition strong-suits were unlikely to shift votes.\n\nCritics inside and outside the party argue the policies have come too late to be properly explained and understood, particularly given the campaign has overlapped with the Easter and Anzac long weekends.\n\n“I think the flaw in the Coalition campaign was releasing their policies so late. It just puts a lot of pressure on you to punch through the media cycle,” Tony Barry, a former Liberal strategist now working with RedBridge, told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.\n\nThe dearth of fully formed policy created a vacuum for Labor’s negative campaign to shape the election narrative from the start.\n\nDutton also made several unforced errors that distracted from his cost-of-living focus, including declaring he would live at Sydney’s Kirribilli House as prime minister and floating, and quickly walking back, referendums on four-year terms, Indigenous recognition and stripping the citizenship of dual nationals.\n\n‘Not ready for government’\n\nJohn Roskam, a senior fellow at rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, is a respected figure in Liberal circles who has the ear of conservative MPs in Canberra.\n\n“The campaign problems can’t be attributed to any one factor, it’s a combination of complacency … a failure to develop strong policies, the absence of a cultural agenda and a feeling that the Coalition has been too willing to play safe when in fact a bold and ambitious agenda was what was required,” Roskam said.\n\nOf the policies that were announced pre-campaign, some haven’t been mentioned (tax deductible lunches), others actively avoided (nuclear power) and others dumped due to their unpopularity.\n\nWithin a fortnight of the shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, announcing a plan to restrict work-from-home options for public servants, colleagues began privately lobbying for changes amid fears it was being misinterpreted as applying to all workplaces.\n\nLabor and its union allies successfully characterised the policy as an attack on working women, a devastating perception for a party attempting to win back female voters.\n\nDutton waited almost five weeks before admitting the policy was a “mistake” and jettisoning it entirely. He also walked back plans to sack 41,000 public servants, confirming the headcount would instead be reduced through natural attrition and hiring freezes.\n\nOn Thursday – with more than 1m votes already cast – Dutton seemingly shifted again, confirming all 41,000 of those positions would come from Canberra.\n\nResponding to the comments, Albanese said publicly what he has been saying privately since the start of the campaign.\n\n“They are showing, Peter Dutton is showing, that they are just not ready for government,” he said.\n\n‘He hasn’t followed his gut’\n\nThe sense of optimism among Coalition MPs was palpable as Donald Trump swept to victory at November’s US presidential election.\n\nTrump had successfully tapped the anger and disillusionment of voters suffering through a cost-of-living crisis, providing what some of Dutton’s colleagues viewed as a template for what could be achieved at the forthcoming Australian election.\n\nTrump’s win over Democrat Kamala Harris was also interpreted as further confirmation of a global rejection of “wokeness” – a cause also disdained by Dutton.\n\nWhen the Liberal leader stood up in parliament to congratulate Trump on his victory, an air of confidence filled the opposition benches.\n\n“We will make sure that President Trump is not somebody to be scared of,” Dutton said, emphasising the final two words. “But somebody that we can work very closely with, and that’s exactly what we will do.”\n\nThe “not somebody to be scared of” remark was a barely concealed reference to Albanese’s 2017 admission that Trump “scares the shit out of me”. Dutton was taunting Albanese, implying that he could not only manage Trump’s return but capitalise on it.\n\nFive months on, Dutton is trying to distance himself from Trump and Elon Musk, so toxic have parallels with the Maga and Doge agendas become for the Liberal brand.\n\nDutton’s remark at the ABC-hosted leaders’ debate that he didn’t “know” Trump was a statement of fact. But for some conservatives, it was a further sign of an uncharacteristic timidness, or an aversion to risk, that has crept into Dutton’s campaign.\n\nSome attribute the safety-first approach to the transfer of power that occurs at each election, where data-led party officials assume greater influence over strategy and messaging.\n\nSeveral sources confirmed reports of friction between Dutton’s inner circle and Liberal HQ, led by Andrew Hirst.\n\nWhatever the cause, some Liberals and conservative campaigners lament that voters haven’t seen “Dutton be Dutton”.\n\nRoskam agrees.\n\n“There is a view [inside the Liberal party] that the public haven’t seen the best of Peter Dutton … that he hasn’t followed his gut.”","summary":"Liberal supporters are worried about policy shifts, outbreaks of ill-discipline and signs of a leader sapped of confidence just as his opponent found his\n\n\nElection 2025 live updates: Australia federal election campaign\nPolls tracker; election guide; full federal election coverage\nAnywhere but Canberra; interactive electorates guide\nListen to the latest episode of our new narrative podcast series: Gina\nGet our afternoon election email, free app or daily news podcastIt was 12 January – 75 days before the federal election would be called – and Peter Dutton was literally feeling the heat.\n\nAs the opposition leader addressed a Liberal party rally from a stuffy room in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visible beads of sweat ran down his forehead.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/26/peter-dutton-coalition-liberal-party-australian-federal-election-campaign-2025","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe765f243fc905a43f342e2023f0085e98b15c5/0_381_5711_3427/master/5711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 21:32:36","author":"Dan Jervis-Bardy","authors":["Dan Jervis-Bardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":314889050,"title":"Florida Democrat changes affiliation, saying his old political party ‘is dead’","text":"Florida State Senate Minority Leader Jason Pizzo announced Thursday he is leaving the Democratic Party, promptly stepping down from his position.\n\nPizzo, who had served as a member of the Florida Senate since 2018, said during a speech on the Senate floor that “the Democratic Party in Florida is dead.” He added that he had mailed in a voter registration form to switch his party affiliation to “no party affiliation.”\n\nThe Miami-area lawmaker claimed that Florida’s political system was similar to “the infighting, power struggles, corruption and decline of civic virtue that pervaded and eventually ushered in the fall of Rome.”\n\n“So, too, are we players, or perhaps props, in the mess that is bottom partisanship,” Pizzo added during his speech. “Our constituents are craving practical leaders, not political hacks.”\n\n“The party my dad volunteered for with JFK when he was 18 years old in 1960 is not the party today,” the senator went on to say, referring to the Democratic Party. “It craves and screams anarchy and then demands amnesty. That is not okay.”\n\nFlorida State Sen. Lori Berman was elected as the Florida Senate’s new minority leader shortly after Pizzo’s announcement, Florida Politics reported.\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a statement Thursday in response to Pizzo’s announcement that the state party was “more united without him.”\n\n“Jason Pizzo is one of the most ineffective and unpopular Democratic leaders in recent memory, and his resignation is one of the best things to happen to the party in years,” Fried wrote in the statement. “His legacy as leader includes continually disparaging the party base, starting fights with other members, and chasing his own personal ambitions at the expense of Democratic values.”\n\nPizzo’s decision to leave the Democratic Party follows months of speculation that he may launch a gubernatorial bid in 2026 to succeed incumbent Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited from seeking reelection.\n\n“Senator Pizzo didn’t leave the Democratic Party; the party left him,” Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said in a statement Thursday. “Senator Pizzo is the third Florida Democrat to leave the party in the last few months.”\n\nIn December, two Florida state representatives, Hillary Cassel and Susan Valdés, announced they were switching their party affiliations to the GOP, increasing Republicans’ majority in the state House.\n\nWhile Florida was a hotly-contested swing state within the last decade, President Donald Trump won the state in the past three presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the Sunshine State by less than two points securing 48.6% of the vote in Florida, compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 47.4%.\n\nIn 2020, Trump notched 51.2% of the vote in Florida, while former President Joe Biden secured 47.9%.\n\nTrump notably widened his margins in Florida in the 2024 presidential election, receiving 56.1% of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 43%. The president carried Pizzo’s home county of Miami-Dade by 11 percentage points in 2024 after losing it by seven in 2020 — marking a swing of 18 points and making him the first Republican to win the majority-Hispanic county since 1988.\n\nPizzo did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

All the folks who ain’t vote for him are pissed.\n\nThe Trump administration announced Monday the resuming of federal student loan debt collections for borrowers who defaulted on their loans. Federal employees are most at risk given Trump’s reboot of the Treasury Offset Program too, which would give the government permission to withhold tax refunds, salaries and even Social Security from those in debt, per Forbes. \n\nUnder wage garnishment, which is expected to follow this executive order in the summer, the government can order a borrower’s employer to withhold 15 percent of their after-tax income to repay the loan, according to the Department of Labor. Now, folks might start seeing their credit scores take a hit for late or missed payments on loans from Federal Family Education Loans, Direct Loans, Perkins Loans, Pell Grants and more.\n\nAll of this is expected to go into place on May 5. \n\nAs expected, voters who wanted former Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House or were even hopeful about former President Joe Biden’s promise to cancel student debt - are quite upset. However, they also didn’t expect Trump to do anything else. \n\n“Oh, so jacking up grocery prices, crashing the stock market, threatening to slash Medicaid & SNAP, and slapping on ridiculous tariffs wasn’t enough? Now Trump’s coming for your paycheck and your tax refund—just because you fell behind on student loans during a pandemic,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett in a social media post. \n\n“Yall told me it would NEVER happen. Told me I was delusional for paying my student loans. Told me they couldn’t mess up people’s credit. Here it is. Right on time,” wrote one X user.\n\nThe collection of federal student loans was paused back in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 10.5 million PPP loans were forgiven for folks who owned small businesses as well as the celebrities who finessed themselves into some funds too, per NPR. Yea, some folks clocked the tea on that too. \n\n“Forgiving PPP loans to wealthy people is cool, but not student loans for middle and working class folk. Gotcha,” wrote another X user.\n\n“So to all those conservatives & Republicans screaming at those that had student loans forgiven you’re going to demand that those Republicans that had PPP loans pay those back as well right? RIGHT? Pay back a loan right you frauds?” wrote one X user.\n\nAlso, no one is trying to hear that whole “pull up your bootstraps” argument about paying back loans.

He criticized Democrats for being “so reticent” in comparison to Republicans. (RELATED: ‘Bunch Of Losers’: Dems’ Emerging 2028 Field May Not Bode Well For Liberals)\n\n“The problem with Democrats — so back in 2020, look, right, I wrote a bunch of ads. I think I was one of the folks — certainly not just me — who kept pushing the other F-word: fascist,” Schechter told Acosta. “Like, we wanted Joe Biden to say it so bad. And finally, he referred to Trump as a semi-fascist. I’m like, I’ll take it, right? We got it out there.”\n\n“Because we’re so reticent to say — I mean, they’re making up lies about abortion after birth,” he added before Acosta cut him off.\n\nTrump claimed during his September debate against former Vice President Kamala Harris that some Democratic states allow infants born after failed abortions to be killed, pointing to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s home state specifically. Walz signed an omnibus bill in 2023 that enabled doctors to refuse life-saving care to infants born following failed abortions.\n\n“There are real world results. People forget a man walked into a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood muttering about baby parts after [Republican Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz and the Republican debate, and they’d been talking about that,” Schechter added. “I mean, stochastic terrorism — I don’t want to do that. But you can’t let them accuse you of these kinds of things and not hit back hard.”\n\n“There should be constant creative responses. And then we even have the individuals — [Democratic Texas Rep.] Jasmine Crockett. I mean, these people that have shown they’re so good at this. Unshackle them,” he said. “Let them go and stop saying, ‘You must stick to this. We have to be cautious. It’s poll-tested.’ As you said, people — I hate to say it, but I think it was [former President] George W. who might have said, ‘People like strong and wrong.’ What about being strong and right?”\n\nIt was former President Bill Clinton who said people prefer “someone who is strong and wrong” when they “are feeling insecure.”\n\nCrockett asserted Saturday that she felt alleged MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia was “less criminal” than Trump. On top of allegedly being a member of the gang, Abrego Garcia’s wife has also alleged that her husband physically abused her.\n\nSchechter clarified that although he thinks it is important to inspire “passion” and “anger,” he does not want it to reach the point of “violence.”\n\nHarris also said during an October CNN town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist.\n\nHoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson warned during a Thursday podcast that there is a heightening risk of political violence — like the two failed assassination attempts against Trump — as Democrats become increasingly desperate, citing dismal polling for the party and their embrace of alleged violent criminals.\n\n“I’m just watching this and I see that the more impotent they are and the less actual power they wield, and the less the public likes them — if you look at the polls of the Democratic Party, 29%, 27%, one poll I think was 23% approval — they react to that by being crazier and more strident and upping the, you know, not just ‘fascist,’ but the other day Jasmine Crockett said that Trump was like worse than the MS-13 gang member, you know,” he said.\n\n“So, they are lowering the bar on what’s permissible. And we’re going to see something like we saw with these two assassin[ation] [attempts],” Hanson added. “I don’t want to predict it; I hope it never happens.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Overall, Trump's average approval rating of 45 percent in his first three months back in office has been below all other post-World War II presidents elected in the United States, Gallup said last week.Results also show Americans losing confidence in Trump's ability to handle key issues such as the economy.Voters last year viewed the 78-year-old billionaire as strong on the economy, but his imposition of sweeping tariffs on trade partners this month has rattled global markets. Some 54 percent of Americans now feel the economy is getting worse, compared to 37 percent in January, according to the Economist/YouGov poll. Trump's approval rating is notably lagging on the cost of living, a Reuters/Ipsos survey showed, with just 31 percent of Americans approving of his performance on that issue.Inflation was a hot topic in the November election, with Trump vowing to immediately lower prices as president.He has seen a similar downward trend on immigration –- another typically strong area for Trump, who has led a hardline deportation strategy targeting undocumented migrants which has pitted him in legal battles with the courts.The Economist/YouGov poll found that 45 percent of Americans approve of how Trump is handling immigration, compared with 50 percent two weeks ago.Polls also show a drop in support among some key demographics that helped Trump return to power by picking him over Democratic election rival Kamala Harris.They include Hispanic voters, whose approval score has dropped from 36 percent in early February to 27 percent, according to the Pew poll.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/25/trumps-popularity-with-us-voters-slumps-in-opinion-polls","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-25/d9t4tfvp/0632211949838.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 20:45:38","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":314885592,"title":"Alex Soros trashed as ‘impossible’ and ‘wrong person to lead’ dad George’s foundation in magazine profile","text":"A New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, son of George Soros, who has been chosen to take up his father’s leadership mantle, doesn’t paint the heir in a positive light. \n\n“The real story is that every single person who knows the family knows that Alex was exactly the wrong person to lead the foundation,” the New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, published Tuesday, reads, quoting an anonymous source “with deep OSF ties.” \n\nGeorge Soros started what the Open Society Foundations (OSF) website calls his “philanthropic network” in the mid-1980s. It eventually became OSF, which has been led by George Soros for decades. In June 2023, he passed the leadership torch to his son, Alex. \n\n“In private he is brooding and cerebral and has a propensity for candor and bursts of hot-temperedness,” the New York Magazine piece, authored by Simon van Zuylen-Wood, says of Alex Soros, who is chair of the board of directors at OSF. \n\n“His halting, Peter Thiel–like baritone is full of ahs and ums, and his sentences can sound like records skipping, as if he were unable to easily put into language what is clear in his mind. This slightly tortured persona has invited comparisons with his elder half-brother Jonathan, who sprang from Harvard Law School and a federal clerkship to work alongside his father in finance and philanthropy.” \n\nVan Zuylen-Wood writes that people, including OSF’s first president, Aryeh Neier, thought that Jonathan Soros, a co-founder and partner of the investment firm, One Madison Group, would be his father’s successor. \n\n“When Soros insiders try to explain the family dynamic, they draw on the standard texts of empire and heredity,” van Zuylen-Wood says. “‘Roman is Alex,’ says a former OSF senior official, referring to Roman Roy, the sardonic failson in Succession. ‘Smart but f**king impossible and not particularly interested in the details.’ Another Soros insider cites not HBO but the Gospel of Luke, casting Alex in the role of the Prodigal Son, who is rewarded with his father’s love despite his wayward years.”\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Alex Soros held a fundraiser at his New York City apartment for vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and posted photos of the event on X. \n\nThe New York Magazine piece says that Alex Soros “created a PR headache by posting photos from the event on social media, as is his custom after meeting heads of state and elected officials. (As a former OSF higher-up says, Alex likes to collect “shiny objects.”).” \n\nThe piece points out that Alex Soros’ X account is filled with photos of powerful Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Presidents Joe Biden and Bill Clinton, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, the late Pope Francis, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak.\n\nPrevious reporting from Fox News highlighting a Media Research Center study on Alex Soros, found that he politicized mass shootings, praised Biden’s “disastrous” 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, supports abolishing the Electoral College, embraced disparaging claims against conservative Supreme Court Justices and supports decriminalizing “sex work.”\n\nSince the 2018 elections, Alex Soros has given more than $5 million to federal political coffers, and records show that his largest contribution was $2 million to the Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC during that time.\n\nWith billions to spend, the New York Magazine profile questions the 39-year-old’s ability to be an effective leader. \n\n“​​Exactly how to push back against the [Trump] madness he leaves unclear,” van Zuylen-Wood wrote. “Nor does he offer any coherent agenda for the Democrats, whose roiling, inconclusive debates can seem personified by Alex himself. He was a regular presence at the Biden White House, one-half of an odd power couple, yet few in the broader political universe have a grasp of how he thinks about the world and plans to spend the wealth at his disposal.\n\n“That money could help determine the fate not only of a rudderless Democratic Party but of a country that every day is disappearing legal residents and immigrants, shaking down universities, defying court orders, and otherwise taking aim at the very open society his father’s global philanthropy exists to uphold.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Open Society Foundations for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"A New York Magazine profile on Alex Soros, son of George Soros, who has been chosen to take up his father’s leadership mantle, doesn't paint the heir in a positive light. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/alex-soros-trashed-as-impossible-and-wrong-person-to-lead-dad-georges-foundation-in-magazine-profile/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103311542.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/E9gQnV4v-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-25 20:45:06","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.114},{"id":315037366,"title":"A Red State Begged Trump For Help. He Said No — And Now They’re Screwed.","text":"This article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.\n\nLast month, 14 tornadoes struck Arkansas over the course of two days, killing three people and leaving 32 more injured. The deadly outbreak damaged or destroyed 500 homes, cars and businesses, leaving behind more than $8.8 million of storm damage. \n\nAs is customary, Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the federal government for help. After a major disaster, the usual procedure is for the federal government to issue a disaster declaration, setting the wheels in motion for the Federal Emergency Management Administration to step in with funds to help the state clean up.\n\nBut President Donald Trump said no. In a letter from April 11, the federal government said it had “determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies.” \n\nArkansas was on its own.\n\nSince his return to power, Trump has been on a rampage, cutting federal funds, firing government employees and threatening his enemies with political retribution. The federal government, his thinking seems to be, is no longer there to provide services to Americans, but rather a weapon to use against any person or institution that dares to question his policies.\n\nAnd among his targets has been FEMA — which he has signaled he’d like to dismantle altogether.\n\nWhile visiting the sites of the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, Trump told reporters that Americans don’t need FEMA, they “need a good state government.” He added, “FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.”\n\nThe environment for demonizing FEMA was ripe. In September 2024, just before the presidential election, Hurricane Helene left a trail of destruction in Western North Carolina along with a deluge of misinformation. \n\nFueled by outright lies from the Trump campaign, right-wing activists claimed the state had been abandoned by the Biden administration. They claimed that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were diverting funds for the state and sending them to undocumented immigrants instead. FEMA paused door-to-door visits during the cleanup after several workers were threatened with violence. But that was tame compared to the egregious lie that the storm was somehow created by the government and sent to destroy North Carolina.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), known for embracing nonsensical conspiracy theories, hinted that she believed the storm was created by the government.\n\n“Yes they can control the weather,” she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”\n\nTrump floated his plan for FEMA while visiting North Carolina shortly after his second inauguration. “I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” he said. “Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.” And, in liberal California, Trump went further and said he would like to see concessions from Democratic-run states before allowing FEMA aid to flow. \n\nBut still, Trump had made punishing his enemies — including blue states — and rewarding his allies a key theme of his campaign. So, when tornadoes hit Arkansas, a state that voted for Trump three times, with the last election being the highest margin for a GOP candidate since 1972, and whose governor was his former press secretary, residents perhaps didn’t think FEMA denials would apply to them.\n\nClearly, they were mistaken.\n\nSanders filed an appeal one week after the denial, detailing the destruction, deaths and injuries that occurred across the state. “[W]ithout the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event,” she wrote. This major Trump ally had been reduced to begging him for help.\n\nArkansas’ federal lawmakers are also asking the president to reconsider. “[T]hese storms caused catastrophic damage across the state, resulting in disastrous amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the deaths of three Arkansans, and injuries to many more,” the state’s two U.S. senators and four U.S. House representatives said in a letter.\n\nIf this is how Trump treats his friends, how will he treat his enemies? \n\nTypically after a disaster, a state will need to ask the president to declare a major disaster, a request which is usually fairly pro forma. If they agree, FEMA is able to disburse aid, which often comes in the form of workers to help clear debris and staffers who process claims for individuals and provide monetary aid to state and local governments. \n\nBut federal funds are Trump’s favorite weapon — he’s threatened to withhold them from universities, school districts, states and cities he doesn’t like — putting blue states on edge. And now it’s increasingly seeming like even red states won’t be spared from the president’s reckless cuts.\n\nThe idea that the federal government is the enemy is a common sentiment among the right, because they believe it tramples on their idea of freedom and personal liberties. The idea has been supercharged since Trump’s return to power. Aided by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which essentially calls for the decimation of the federal government, Trump’s move to dramatically reduce the size and scope of the federal government has been cheered on by Republican electeds and MAGA voters who saw the federal government as a shadowy entity that doesn’t do anything for the common people. In this view, the government is overrun with radical leftists doling out checks to undeserving liberals in the form of government assistance and fat paychecks for lazy bureaucrats. \n\nBut one of the first things Sanders did after tragedy hit her state was reach out to the federal government. Because, in reality, the government provides goods and services like public education, national parks — and disaster relief. \n\n“It almost becomes unthinkable that states would ever be able to recover without long, costly recovery periods that would come out of state and local budgets,” Craig Fugate, the former FEMA administration under the Obama administration, told NBC News in November.\n\nWithout FEMA, states and cities would be left to fend for themselves. Charitable groups would still be able to respond after a storm or wildfire, but they don’t have the capacity of the federal government. As a result, places with more wealth and resources would likely be able to recover after disasters faster than smaller, poorer or more rural places. \n\nArkansas is one of the poorest states in the country, with about 15% of the population living in poverty, according to U.S. Census data. Sanders also noted in her appeal letter to the Trump administration that the state was still recovering from storms that struck in 2024 and resources were already stretched thin.\n\nArkansas’ predicament could signal a coming shift. According to a CNN report published Friday, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton wants to upend how the agency handles disasters, making it harder for states to qualify for help by drastically increasing the amount of damage that qualifies, denying all major disaster declarations that are related to snowstorms, reducing the amount the federal government will pay and more. The proposal also comes as hurricane season approaches, threatening to leave communities in dire need of help out to dry. \n\nAlready, Washington state received a denial letter earlier this month after a windstorm left $34 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn an era of billion-dollar disasters fueled by climate change, FEMA has already been busier than ever while being stretched thin due to staffing challenges. In 2022, the Government Accountability Office report said the agency was short-staffed and dealing with retention problems. Staffing issues have led to slowed recovery efforts in communities experiencing disasters.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from cutting workers and threatening to eliminate the agency altogether. As part of the Elon Musk-led DOGE cuts, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the department, announced that 200 FEMA staffers had been fired in February.\n\n“FEMA staff are some of the most critical and needed in the federal government,” Rob Moore, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a February report. “Slashing these employees indiscriminately will put more Americans in harm’s way, and means we will have slower and less-coordinated recovery efforts.”\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders is stuck between a rock and a hard place, and one that may be increasingly common for GOP politicians in the coming years: Her state is being completely screwed over by Trump, but she can’t call him out and risk the political fallout. Nor can she lay the blame on the policy of government and budget cuts, which the Republican Party has largely stood behind. Meanwhile, Arkansas residents are set to bear the brunt of the suffering. \n\nIt turns out the federal government wasn’t the enemy — until now.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/red-state-begged-trump-help-203010727.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/fab3d4c51c4a594c295e1661b3df19c7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 20:30:10","author":"Nathalie Baptiste","authors":["Nathalie Baptiste"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":314871058,"title":"AOC claims 'We are one' in campaign-style video despite years of invoking race, gender in politics","text":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., posted a campaign-style video on social media this week that sparked rumors about her political future. But conservatives quickly struck up a different conversation when she claimed, \"We are one,\" after years of criticism for playing identity politics. \"Don't let them trick us into thinking we are enemies. Don't let them trick us into thinking we can be separated into rural and urban, Black and white and Latina. We are one,\" Cortez said in the video that's amassed over 7 million views. While Ocasio-Cortez seems to imply Republicans are seeking to divide America based on race, the four-term New York congresswoman has a long track record of invoking race in politics. The words highlighted in Ocasio-Cortez's video this week spotlight a fixture of her developing stump speech to record-setting crowds alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. The progressive Democrat has often argued that Republicans weaponize racial resentment to halt Democratic progress. 'WE ARE ONE': AOC CAMPAIGN VIDEO SWIRLS 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUMORS \"The only chance they have to get away with such an unpopular and hurtful agenda is to stoke deep divisions along race, identity and culture to keep us fighting and distracted,\" she said at a rally in Boise, Idaho, earlier this month. POLLSTER NATE SILVER CALLS OCASIO-CORTEZ MOST LIKELY TO BE 2028 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE During the 2024 presidential campaign, Ocasio-Cortez told The Independent that \"as an elected official, who is a prominent woman of color, I've seen a lot,\" adding that Vice President Kamala Harris has her own experience with misogyny and racism. \"I think we brace ourselves for some of the unfair misogynistic and racial undertones, overtones, explicit attacks on implicit attacks that she may be subjected to, and it's important for us to keep our eyes open for what is fair, but also what is unfair,\" she said. Since Ocasio-Cortez was elected in 2018 to represent parts of Queens and the Bronx in the U.S. House of Representatives, unseating a 10-term incumbent, she has framed her success as shattering barriers to gender and racial justice in the United States. During her victory speech in Queens in November 2018, Ocasio-Cortez noted she was the \"first person of color to ever represent\" New York's 14th Congressional District, which she said was 70% people of color, half of them working class. Then the youngest congresswoman, Ocasio-Cortez said she was mistaken for an intern or a spouse and used the opportunity to spotlight the bias against her, posting on social media, \"Next time try believing women + people of color when they talk about their experiences being a woman or person of color.\"​ Jussie Smollett, a Black and gay actor, falsely claimed in January 2019 that he was attacked by two men at 2 a.m. on a cold Chicago night and said the men yelled he was in \"MAGA country,\" used racist and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured an \"unknown substance\" on him. Smollet was sentenced in 2022 for faking a hate crime and lying to the Chicago Police about it. Smollett received support of several Democrats before his allegations were debunked, including Ocasio-Cortez, who said it was \"a racist and homophobic attack,\" while urging Americans to work to change what is \"happening to our country.\" Ocasio-Cortez deleted her pro-Smollett tweet when he was convicted of staging the crime. During a \"60 Minutes\" interview in 2019, Ocasio-Cortez labeled President Donald Trump \"racist.\" Later that year, Ocasio-Cortez accused former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi of unfairly singling out the freshmen progressive \"Squad,\" calling it an \"explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\"​ She later clarified that she wasn't calling Pelosi racist but maintained that women of color were disproportionately targeted. But Ocasio-Cortez didn't hold back in her racist allegations when Trump said the \"Squad\" should \"go back\" to other countries. \"We don’t leave the things that we love. When we love this country, what that means is we propose the solutions to fix it,\" she said at a press conference. She later said on social media it was the \"hallmark language of white supremacists,\" warning, \"Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism.\" During the pandemic in 2020, Ocasio-Cortez said on social media, \"COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities,\" adding, \"the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions,\" tying health disparities to racial injustice. After the attacks on the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live she \"didn’t even feel safe around other members of Congress\"​ and added that she avoided hiding during the attack where \"there were QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, and frankly white supremacist members of Congress in that extraction point\"​ And in the aftermath of a shooting at a Buffalo supermarket in a predominately Black neighborhood, she said in a post, \"White supremacy has cost countless lives from El Paso to Mother Emanuel and now Buffalo. Our hearts break for the victims. And we demand accountability.\" In a GQ interview that year, Ocasio-Cortez reiterated that misogyny and racism shaped her experience as a politician. saying, \"I admit to sometimes believing that I live in a country that would never let\" a woman become president. In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez's views on race and gender came to a head during a viral speech on the House floor in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., before the House voted to oust Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. She said Omar's ouster had nothing to do with \"the condemnation of antisemitic remarks,\" but \"the racism and incitement of violence against women of color in this body.\" \"Don’t tell me this is about objectivity. … This is about targeting women of color in the United States of America,\" Ocasio-Cortez said as she slammed her notebook on a table. Ocasio-Cortez faced pushback from conservatives for claiming \"We are one\" in her video this week while still designating Americans along racial and ethnic lines in the same video. Colin Rugg, a conservative influencer and co-owner of Trending Politics, responded, \"This has to be a joke. \"You capitalized ‘Black’ and ‘Latino’ but not ‘white.’ You guys were always the ones drumming up the race stuff. Everyone was fine,\" Matt Antar, finance chair of the New York Young Republicans Club, added on X among the flood of furious replies from conservatives questioning why \"white\" was lower case in her post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since 2020, AP Style, the standard for American journalism style preferences, has capitalized \"Black\" to represent the \"shared sense of history, identity and community among people who identify as Black.\" AP Style does not capitalize \"white\" because white people \"generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color,\" according to the Associated Press.

Since taking office nearly 100 days ago, Trump has been a frequent presence in the sporting arena—literally and figuratively. A week after he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, Trump was at the “Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing,” leading a lap around the circuit at the Daytona 500. Days later, Trump brokered a meeting at the White House to help resolve a yearslong dispute that has upended professional golf.\nSports have been a major throughline in Trump’s public life, from his tumultuous ownership of a USFL team to his hosting of boxing matches, UFC fights, and golf tournaments at his casinos and clubs. As Trump entered politics, professional athletics became a useful optics tool—a way to draw media attention and warm ovations, a vehicle to drive the culture wars, and a platform to excite his male-dominated base. In Trump 2.0, sports have also served as a barometer for the “vibe shift” that has occurred since his first term in office.\nWe’ve gone from national anthem protests and high-profile spats—like Trump’s with the Eagles, who were disinvited from the White House seven years ago—to a “Trump dance” craze sweeping the NFL. As presidential historian Timothy Naftali told Vanity Fair last year, “No other president or presidential wannabe has been as associated with sports as Donald Trump.” Below is a guide to how sports have animated Trump’s second term—and vice versa—so far.\nGolf diplomacy\nJack Nicklaus once said that Trump “loves the game of golf more than he loves money,” a claim the president has backed up in actions. During his first three months in office, per the website Trump Golf Track, he has spent at least two dozen days golfing. Trump has long been plugged into the professional ranks, regularly playing rounds with some of the best golfers in the world. And it’s clear that the game of golf loves Trump back. “He is, I would argue, one of the best friends golf has,” Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee told Vanity Fair.\nBecause of all that, much of the sport viewed Trump as a potential savior in the dispute between the PGA Tour and its Saudi-funded rival, LIV Golf. The two sides were at odds for years, as LIV poached some of the biggest stars from the PGA Tour, before they announced plans to merge in 2023.\nThe deal attracted both regulatory and political scrutiny, but Trump’s victory in November raised the hopes of both PGA Tour and LIV officials. Since taking office, he has been hands-on in the negotiations, hosting talks at the White House involving PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, LIV Golf chairman and governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan, and Tiger Woods. Trump appears determined to resolve the schism, prioritizing the matter in the face of other crises. Earlier this month, with global financial markets in turmoil, Trump hosted LIV Golf leaders for dinner at his Miami-area club.\n“Why is the world of golf optimistic that a deal’s going to come together?” Chamblee said. “Well, because President Trump got elected.”\nTiger earns his stripes\nTrump and Woods go way back, having played numerous rounds together over the years. And like most golf diehards, Trump holds Woods in something approaching reverence. In 2019, following Woods’s fairytale win at the Masters, Trump presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nBut the past three months have seen Woods become even more entwined in Trumpworld. Along with his participation in the PGA Tour–LIV negotiations, Woods was also on hand for a reception at the White House in February to commemorate Black History Month.\nAbout a month later, and after days of tabloid speculation, Woods confirmed that he is dating Vanessa Trump, the former daughter-in-law of the president. “Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together,” Woods said in the social media post announcing the relationship. “At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”\nPresident Trump weighed in on the budding romance last month, recounting a conversation he had with Woods on the matter.\n“He told me about it, and I said, ‘Tiger, that’s good, that’s good.’ I’m very happy for both. Just let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. They’re both great,” Trump said.\nMan in the arena\nTrump has been a frequent presence at live sporting events for decades, appearing ringside (and in-ring) at WWE’s WrestleMania and taking in Yankees and Mets games. In his political career, however, those appearances have become hype sessions for him and his bro-led coalition.\nLast month, on the heels of his cameos at the Super Bowl and Daytona 500, Trump attended the NCAA men’s wrestling championships in Philadelphia, where he was showered with loud cheers and chants of “USA.” Trump, who was accompanied at the event by Elon Musk and conservative sports commentator Clay Travis, is no stranger to the world of combat sports. He previously attended the NCAA wrestling championships in 2023 and has long been a fixture at UFC events, where he also typically draws a hero’s welcome.\nEarlier this month in Miami, Trump, Musk, and a coterie of cabinet members sat ringside at UFC 314. In what has become a familiar ritual, Trump entered the arena to the Kid Rock song “American Bad Ass” and drew a rapturous ovation.\nThe champs are here\nThe Eagles’ celebration on Monday captures the distinct shift in attitudes toward Trump since his first term. During those four years, the traditional White House visits by title teams became a third rail for many players and coaches across the country’s major sports leagues. Following the Eagles’ Super Bowl triumph in 2018, Trump disinvited the team from going to the White House after saying, “Only a small number of players decided to come.”\nBut after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February, the Eagles signaled that they would be up for a trip to the White House, and Trump promptly extended an invitation. (While the team is expected to attend, star quarterback Jalen Hurts was noncommittal when asked Thursday if he’ll be there.) Meanwhile, Trump also said he plans to invite the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate their Super Bowl win in 2020 “because they missed their turn because of COVID.”\nTwo other reigning champions have gone to the White House since Trump took office in January. Members of the Los Angeles Dodgers were honored there earlier this month to celebrate their World Series victory—including star Mookie Betts, who passed on a trip to Trump’s White House in 2019 as a member of the Boston Red Sox. A week after the Dodgers, it was the Ohio State University football team’s turn to celebrate their national championship, a gathering that will likely be remembered for Vice President JD Vance’s fumble of the Buckeyes’ trophy.\nThe invite and RSVP status of the NBA’s soon-to-be-crowned champion will be one to watch. None of the league’s title-winners visited the White House during Trump’s first four years in office, a period in which he clashed with the likes of LeBron James and Steph Curry. Both players endorsed Kamala Harris in last year’s election, and their teams—James’s Los Angeles Lakers and Curry’s Golden State Warriors—are regarded as contenders to claim this year’s NBA title. Oh, and the Warriors’ coach, Steve Kerr, has never shied away from taking aim at Trump, whom he’s referred to as a “bully.”\nWhere have you gone, Jackie Robinson?\nThe wedge issues that shaped Trump’s campaign quickly manifested into actual policies, some of which have cast ripples throughout the sports world. His oft-repeated pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports” led to an executive order that bore his promise as its title. The Trump campaign’s staunch opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, or “DEI,” gave way to a purge of government websites that included last month’s removal of a story about Jackie Robinson’s military service.\nThe executive order, which was signed in February, bans transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports and empowers the federal government to take punitive measures—including the ability to rescind funding—against schools and other institutions that do not comply. It also directs the Secretary of State’s office to “use all appropriate and available measures” to see that the International Olympic Committee establishes its own transgender policy. In signing the order, Trump declared the “war on women’s sports over,” but the legal battle is just getting underway. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sued the state of Maine for not complying with the order.\nThe removal of the story about Robinson from the Department of Defense’s website was met with near universal condemnation. A Pentagon spokesperson explained at the time that the department’s dismantling of DEI also led to the removal of a story about the Navajo Code Talkers, among others. But after a public outcry, the department restored both the pages for Robinson and the Code Talkers.\nFighting lessons for the feds?\nGolf may be Trump’s favorite, but the lifeblood of his political movement is found in the octagon. His ties to UFC span nearly a quarter-century, dating back to when the company was still a cultural pariah. In 2001, with mixed martial arts banned in New York State, Trump hosted an event at his casino in Atlantic City.\nSince Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago, UFC has become its own planet in the MAGA-verse. He is adored by both fans and fighters—including Conor McGregor, who caused a stir in his native Ireland with critical comments about immigration during a St. Patrick’s Day visit to the White House. The president is also extremely close to UFC CEO and president Dana White, who introduced Trump at last summer’s Republican National Convention. (More recently, White was present at the Kid Rock–brokered dinner between Trump and comedian Bill Maher.)\nSo perhaps it was only a matter of time before UFC began to exert influence on administration policy. In February, FBI Director Kash Patel said on a conference call with agents that he is considering a partnership with UFC to revamp the bureau’s training protocols. Under the program, the FBI would bring in “trainers from the Ultimate Fighting Championship to beef up agents’ martial arts and self-defense skills,” according to Reuters. White later said that Patel, who attended UFC events in March and earlier this month, is “dead serious” about the idea.\nThe World Cup: from unity to disharmony\nTrump’s presidency will coincide with two global sporting events on US soil, beginning next summer with the FIFA World Cup and continuing in 2028 when the Summer Olympics head to Los Angeles. In the case of the World Cup, the United States will be a cohost along with Canada and Mexico, marking the first time the tournament will be held across three different countries. The joint bid for the tournament, in which the first Trump administration played a role, centered on a message of “unity, certainty, and opportunity.”\nBut Trump’s tariff policy and harsh rhetoric toward Canada and Mexico have threatened to unravel the spirit of comity that helped them land the competition. Trump, who has a small replica of the World Cup trophy on display in the Oval Office, doesn’t seem too worried about the intracontinental strife. The tensions between the US, Canada, and Mexico, he said last month, will make the tournament “more exciting.”\n“Tension’s a good thing,” he told reporters. “It makes it much more exciting.”\nWhether it will be an accessible event for the legions of soccer fans around the world planning to attend remains an open question. As part of the lobbying efforts to secure the bid for next year’s World Cup, Trump sent a letter to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2018 offering assurances that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.”\nBut the administration’s immigration crackdown has cast doubt on that pledge. The Athletic, citing multiple State Department sources, reported that there are “widespread fears that a ‘non-insignificant’ number of people who legitimately acquire tickets for the tournament will be refused visas altogether.”\nLast month, Trump announced the creation of a World Cup task force that will handle logistics and security for the tournament.\nInfantino, who attended Trump’s inauguration in January and was on hand at the White House for the announcement of the task force, has sought to assuage concerns among fans traveling to the World Cup. “America is a welcoming country,” Infantino said earlier this month. “America welcomes the world. Fans from all over the world will come.”\n“They will be welcome here. America welcomes the world,” he added. “That’s how it has been, is and will be.”\nUSA and Canada in a face-off\nRelations between the US and its northern neighbor have turned frosty since Trump returned to office. Following Trump’s tariff threats and his repeated references to Canada as the “51st state,” many a Canuck has engaged in one of the few acts of dissent available to the masses: they booed.\nAt NBA and NHL games held north of the border, the playing of the US national anthem was met with loud jeers in February, bringing an additional layer of spice to the hockey matches between the United States and Canada in the Four Nations Face-Off that month. Ahead of the two sides’ matchup in the championship game, which Canada won in OT, Trump addressed the US players over the phone before they took the ice.\nThe kerfuffle has placed Wayne Gretzky, one of Canada’s preeminent national heroes, in an awkward spot. Some in the country have been miffed that Gretzky, who attended Trump’s election night party in November and an NHL game with Patel this month, has not pushed back against the “51st state” talk. Last month, a bronze statue of Gretzky in downtown Edmonton was smeared with feces, an act of vandalism that many have attributed to his close ties to Trump.\nIn a post on Truth Social last month, Trump addressed Gretzky’s silence on the matter.\n“Wayne is my friend, and he wants to make me happy, and is therefore somewhat ‘low key’ about Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State, paying much Lower Taxes, a Free and Powerful Military, NO TARIFFS, and having a Booming Economy,” Trump said.\nHe added that he is making Gretzky a “‘free agent,’ because I don’t want anyone in Canada to say anything bad about him.”","summary":"By playing host to champions, doing a lap at the Daytona 500, and targeting transgender athletes, Trump seizes on sports to satisfy his base and cement his brand.

The party has been plagued with infighting and finger pointing following Harris' loss to President Donald Trump.A number of polls have shown Harris, the 2024 presidential nominee, at or near the top of most voters' minds. Other names besides Ocasio-Cortez that have drawn significant interest from include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowA survey published Thursday by Quantus Insights, which conducts research and modeling for election forecasting, shows Ocasio-Cortez leading Harris when the 1,000 survey respondents were asked who best reflects the Democratic Party's values.Ocasio-Cortez received 19 percent of respondents' support, compared to 17 percent for Harris. They were followed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker (12 percent), Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders (10 percent), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (9 percent), and former President Barack Obama (7 percent).However, when asked about the preferred 2028 nominee, 30 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents selected Harris. Ocasio-Cortez, Buttigieg and Booker each garnered support in the 13–14 percent range.\"The absence of a clear leader—reflected in the 20% who either selected 'none' or were unsure—highlights a perceived leadership vacuum within the Democratic Party,\" Quantus notes in its assessment. \"While AOC and Kamala Harris lead the field, their narrow margins suggest a fragmented coalition.\"This lack of consensus may complicate efforts to project a unified message ahead of 2026 and could weaken voter confidence in the party's strategic direction in the House.\"Jason Corley, co-founder and lead pollster at Quantus Insights, told Newsweek on Friday that the data tells a story \"that's less about collapse\" and more about a postelection leadership identity shift that is often customary after a major electoral loss.He compared what the Democrats are currently enduring to the GOP after the 2012 election, and the dramatic shift in Republican ideology from the days of President George W. Bush and even Mitt Romney, to Trump.\"Unless Democrats coalesce around a clear message and messenger—particularly one who can speak to economic concerns beyond progressive litmus tests—they risk entering the midterms with a fragmented strategy,\" Corley said. \"With [former President Joe] Biden off the ballot and his legacy less remembered by then, there's opportunity to reset—but that vacuum also exposes the party's structural fragility.\"Overall, 65 percent of respondents found the Democratic Party \"very favorable\" (25 percent) or \"somewhat favorable\" (40 percent). About 22 percent find the party \"very unfavorable.\"Another question asked about the party's political and ideological stance, with about 46 percent of respondents saying it's balanced.Another 32 percent said that it is too progressive and/or too far left. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have been top names in that farther-left coalition over the years, including as part of their current Fighting Oligarchy nationwide tour of red and blue states.The future of the party remains in flux. The survey asked Democratic and Democrat-leaning independents which direction the party needs to go, garnering an exact 50-50 split between moving toward the center or moving farther left.\"The immediate challenge for Democrats is messaging discipline,\" Corley said. \"The party is not just ideologically divided, it's strategically split.\"What People Are SayingPatricia Crouse, political scientist in residence at the University of New Haven, to Newsweek: \"I think people see her as the face of the Democratic Party right now because she seems to be the only one (along with Sanders) willing to stand up for the party and stand against Trump,\" Crouse said. \"But many within the party, both members and voters, view her as too progressive or even extreme left.\"Denny Salas, former Washington, D.C., consultant, to Newsweek: \"There's always room for loudmouths with no serious plans to improve the everyday lives of working-class Americans. AOC is currently running the same exact and tired playbook of 'Trump-Hate' some Democrats have been running since 2016. It may win an election here and there, but it is unserious.\"What Happens NextHarris' future political endeavors, as that of the other top Democrats mentioned in 2028 polls, remain unknown.

Joe Manchin (D–W.Va.) raised the hackles of left-wing activists for opposing some trillion-dollar progressive priority during the Biden administration, liberal writer Matt Yglesias would defend the senator on the grounds that he was performing above replacement value.\n\nInstead of comparing Manchin to other progressive senators, Yglesias argued lefties should compare him to his most likely replacement, which would almost certainly be a very conservative West Virginia Republican.\n\nAll things considered, he was the best West Virginia senator progressives could reasonably hope for.\n\nI have a similarly sunny assessment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe looming close of the Trump administration's first 100 days in office, and Elon Musk's announcement that he is stepping away from DOGE, have provoked a lot of critical retrospectives.\n\nThe $1 trillion that Musk claimed DOGE would save has been downgraded to $150 billion, and even this figure might not stand up to closer scrutiny. The many grants and employees terminated by DOGE have been reinstated, at least temporarily, by the courts.\n\nFederal government experts argue that few of its cuts have actually made the government operate more smoothly. As one Reuters headline pointedly declared, \"100 days of DOGE: lots of chaos, not so much efficiency.\"\n\nLibertarians may well feel that the whole DOGE effort has been a massive letdown.\n\nCompared to an ideal effort to shrink the size and scope of the federal government, DOGE has indeed disappointed. However, when one considers the most realistic alternatives to DOGE, its record actually looks pretty good.\n\nThe most obvious point of comparison to DOGE is the Kamala Harris administration that didn't happen.\n\nHarris would most certainly not have launched anything approximating DOGE. If she governed remotely similarly to her predecessor, we could have expected another four years of rapidly expanding government.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, federal spending rose by $4.7 trillion, and $2.5 trillion was added to the deficit, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Innovation Center. Meanwhile, regulations finalized under former President Joe Biden added an estimated $1.8 trillion in regulatory costs.\n\nThe new spending was obviously done with the consent of Congress. Much of the additional regulatory burden was a result of the Biden White House's \"whole of government\" initiatives whereby agencies were told to go around finding rules that could be tightened in the name of equity, environmental justice, and more.\n\nSo, it's true that DOGE didn't come anywhere close to meeting its $1 trillion savings goal. But the cuts it has made already put it in the black compared to what a Harris administration would have done.\n\nDOGE can also be ranked as a success when compared to what the Trump administration could have done instead on the small government front, which is to say nothing at all.\n\nDonald Trump is not a libertarian. He's not even a remotely small government guy, as his recent actions on trade and immigration demonstrate. He's staffed his administration with fewer traditional free marketers than past Republican presidents.\n\nNevertheless, the president was willing to give Musk a remarkable amount of string to fire federal workers, terminate federal grants, and downsize whole agencies.\n\nMilton Friedman, when asked about the free market reforms undertaken by Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, liked to say that the real miracle in Chile wasn't that those reforms worked but that a military dictatorship was willing to try them in the first place.\n\nSomething similar could be said for DOGE. Its success isn't that it's been super effective at shrinking the government, but rather that Trump let it happen at all.\n\nThe fact that DOGE did happen raised the hopes of small government reformers that we might see a lot of executive energy devoted to a steady, methodical, and congressionally supported effort to shrink the state.\n\nBut that was never in the cards. Steady and methodical is just not how the Trump administration approaches anything.\n\nWitness the utter chaos that's erupted over the administration's tariff policy. Tariffs are one of the few things that Trump himself clearly believes in. His administration is full of similarly committed protectionists.\n\nAnd yet, even on this issue, the administration can't decide how exactly it wants to impose punishing trade barriers, or if it even wants to impose punishing trade barriers at all.\n\nOne couldn't reasonably expect Trump to approach a cause he's clearly not committed to with more care.\n\nFor all the chaos that DOGE has unleashed, it's hewed pretty closely to the initial vision that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy laid out for it in their joint Wall Street Journal op-ed published shortly after the 2024 election.\n\nThe two promised to use executive orders to shrink the federal workforce and rescind agency regulations that should have properly been passed by Congress.\n\nThat's more or less what's happened. The DOGE teams within federal agencies have fired staff en masse. The White House has also issued a steady stream of executive orders instructing agencies to identify and repeal federal regulations not supported by an underlying statute.\n\nOne could argue that all this could have happened without DOGE's characteristic chaos bordering on bungling incompetence.\n\nBut even bungling incompetence has an upside.\n\nMaking the federal government a less secure place to work and a less reliable funding partner means fewer people will want to work for it, and fewer organizations will rely on it for funding.\n\nEncouraging the best and brightest federal workers to leave government employment might not make the government operate more efficiently. But it will make the economy operate more efficiently by shifting talented people from unproductive bureaucratic work to a profit-seeking private sector.\n\nDOGE was not the libertarian moment. One could dream about what a Rand Paul administration could have accomplished with the aid of a Congress stuffed with Justin Amashes and Thomas Massies.\n\nBut the country didn't elect Rand Paul as president. It elected Donald Trump.\n\nThe relevant benchmark for DOGE's performance isn't how much a highly competent effort to shrink government could have accomplished. Rather, it's what the most likely alternatives to the DOGE would have accomplished.\n\nEvery plausible alternative would have resulted in more government than what we got with DOGE. On that metric, it's been a smashing success.","summary":"When compared to the most likely alternatives, DOGE has cut as much government as one could hope for.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/25/doge-has-been-a-smashing-success/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/reason-trumpmusk-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 17:45:53","author":"C.j.

He talked about the platform as the new digital town square. He said social media companies’ moderation policies should be no more restrictive than national laws. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he wrote after agreeing to a $44 billion takeover. In the three years since making the deal, Musk has continued to cloak himself in the armor of a free speech warrior, out there fighting for the rest of us. “Turns out free speech is very expensive,” he said a year ago, urging all of us to support this bedrock principle by … subscribing to X Premium.\n\nIt’s been a lot of sizzle and the opposite of steak. Musk unbanned a bunch of right-wing (and even some left-of-center) accounts, pitching that as an anti-censorship move. (He allowed back some legit Nazis, but also the Krassenstein brothers. Fair is fair.) But he also banned and suspended accounts, like the one that did nothing more than share public information about his own private jet usage. He tried to restrict people’s linking to other social media platforms, only bailing from that effort after a heartwarmingly cross-ideological backlash. He has sued researchers who have reached damning conclusions about Nazism on X. He has juiced the platform’s algorithm to send ideologically friendly posts soaring, while throttling posts with links to outside information. Few people have ever done less to promote the free and open exchange of information on the internet.\n\nSo it’s notable that lawmakers in Minnesota—Democratic ones, at that—have given Musk an opening to sell himself as a free speech guy in a manner that is not just a fugazi. Through his company, X, Musk filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal district court that puts him on the free-speechier side of a debate. These lawmakers have created a double whammy: a law that could genuinely curtail free expression online and a public relations coup for Musk, whose own interests intersect with a free speech argument.\n\nOne can see the idea behind Minnesota statute 609.771 (“USE OF DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION”). A.I. deepfakes could bork our information ecosystem even worse than it is already borked, making it so that people can sparsely tell what is real online and what is not. Minnesota lawmakers have been rightfully concerned about deepfakes in two contexts: sex and politics. The state’s statute against nonconsensual sexual deepfakes has not generated as much controversy. Most people agree, or at least don’t fight the idea, that there is no social utility in letting people indulge their creative urge to ruin other people’s lives with A.I.-created sexual imagery.\n\nThe state’s statute about deepfakes and elections—first signed into law by Tim Walz in 2023 and updated in 2024—is thornier. The whole thing is just a few paragraphs and list points. The law sets out a detailed, noncontroversial definition of a deepfake, and then states that “a person who disseminates a deep fake or enters into a contract or other agreement to disseminate a deep fake is guilty of a crime” under certain circumstances. In Minnesota, it’s a crime if the person knows (or “acts with reckless disregard” in not knowing) that a deepfake isn’t real and shares it during an election season “without the consent of the depicted individual” and “with the intent to injure a candidate” or influence an election. Punishments range from small fines to up to five years in prison. (Candidates for state or local office are barred from office if they’re convicted of this crime.) The state attorney general, Keith Ellison, is nominally supposed to enforce this law, and so he is the named defendant in Musk’s lawsuit.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the Minnesota law is that if you CTRL-F your way through it (and again, it’s not long), you will not find the words parody or satire or any collection of words pointing in that direction. Now, I do not personally have a great problem with simply banning all deepfakes out of hand. I find that deepfakes, even ones that are supposed to be funny, are almost never funny. They strike me as a waste of electricity and a piss-poor substitute for more thought-intensive forms of art. If a constitutional amendment were on the table to make all deepfakes of any intention punishable by up to 10 years of watching an awful A.I.-generated Harry Potter spinoff on a loop, I would support that amendment.\n\nBut in the world we have now, criminalizing political deepfakes without a satire exemption is like fighting gravity. No, it’s not essential to democracy that you be able to look at a sloppy deepfake of FBI agents hauling Donald Trump into custody. No, the American experiment does not rest on your ability to see a made-up image of Kamala Harris and Barack Obama carrying on an affair. But criminalizing parody opens up enough dangerous doors that even the most self-interested people who oppose it are onto something, and it sure does seem like this law could criminalize parody. It doesn’t carve out permission for people to share obvious fakes in service of some larger political point. In this way, it differs from California’s similar law, which does exempt parody but is still in jeopardy of going down in the courts.\n\nEnter Musk, who is not the first person to sue over Minnesota’s law but knows a layup when he sees one. Musk brings the suit through X. He has a business case for being involved, arguing that the law turns the government into a social media moderator and imposes unfair liability on sites like Musk’s. In the filing, X’s lawyers share just the kind of deepfakes I described—these ones, of Trump’s imaginary and violent arrest in the streets—and makes the case that because the deepfake exists on its platform, it is “disseminating” it and could be in big trouble under the text of the Minnesota statute. The lawsuit only spends a little time on satire and, given Musk’s position, more on his platform’s liability.\n\nWell … he’s right! He’s just right. You may not be particularly concerned with the liability of a social media platform controlled by the right-wing billionaire whose free speech maneuvering has not been on the level for years. But in this case, Musk isn’t the only theoretically liable party. So is any creatively challenged dork who believes they’ve got a hilarious parody deepfake in the hopper that they absolutely must share during a political campaign. If you post one of these deepfakes, your friends should make fun of you until you cry. You should be cyberbullied, even. But jailed? Maybe for a few days, if the deepfake is especially cringe. But generally not. Some problems are best confronted with social sanctions rather than criminal.\n\nMusk’s lawyers use some overcooked language that may remind you who they are working for. They claim that the law will create “blanket censorship,” a line that may make your eyes roll out of the back of your head when you remember that Musk now co-runs the executive branch with someone who sues media companies over coverage he disfavors and muses about making it easier for public figures to prove libel. You do not, in general, have to hand it to the man. But that’s exactly why it’s such a gift that Minnesota has given Musk this opportunity to fight for free speech, rather than “free speech.”\n\nX demands a jury trial. It wants the court to declare that the law violates the First and 14th amendments and is null and void, and it wants an injunction that would prevent the state AG from enforcing the law. Musk, as always, has a self-interest. It seems unlikely that Ellison has the time to drink from the firehose of political deepfakes on the internet and do a bunch of prosecutions of individuals every election season. There may very well be a way that he can devote time and resources to coming after a social media company like X, though, and Musk and his lawyers would like to preempt that possibility.\n\nThe Venn diagram of what advantages Musk and what advantages the free flow of ideas in a democracy has historically just been two circles that have nothing to do with each other. But here, the diagram has the tiniest overlapping section in the middle. You just have to squint at it for a minute.","summary":"For once, the billionaire’s first amendment crusade isn’t total nonsense.

Will John James?”\n\nBoth individuals are early key players in the 2026 election. \n\nJames, a U.S. House representative for Michigan and a Shelby Township Republican, announced his bid for the governor seat earlier this month. With no incumbent in the race — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cannot seek another term — the seat is in play for the GOP in 2026, Borquez said.\n\nRogers, a former Republican congressman and a close runner-up in the state’s 2024 U.S. Senate race, this month announced he will mount a second campaign for the Senate during next year’s elections. With no incumbent in the race — Democrat Gary Peters announced he will retire after this term — Republicans have a shot at clinching one of the state’s two U.S. Senate positions, Borquez said.\n\n“It might be too early for Trump to give an outright endorsement, but certainly, being on a stage with him would help them with fundraising,” Borquez said. “And it kind of gives the signal that, ‘Rogers is the Trump guy’ and ‘James is the Trump guy.’”\n\nIt’s unclear if either Rogers or James will attend the Tuesday event, but both were regulars at Trump rallies in the state last year. And both Michigan politicians received endorsements from Trump for their respective 2024 campaigns.\n\nJames’ Congressional district includes Macomb County, the host of Trump’s Tuesday visit.\n\nTrump promoting his agenda and claiming policy victories in the state also could serve the purpose of rallying Michigan support behind Republicans at a time when polls show his approval ratings in decline, experts say.\n\nRallying that support now in Michigan could help the president boost the GOP profile for the 2026 U.S. House races, said Andrea LaFontaine, Central Michigan University’s Griffin Endowed Chair in American Government.\n\n“Those margins are tight in the House right now,” LaFontaine said of the 119th Congress, where 220 Republicans and 213 Democrats serve today. “(The Trump administration is) in that kind of protect-and-retain-the-seats-they-have kind of mode.”\n\nThere are 13 U.S. House members representing Michigan today, with the GOP earning a 7-6 advantage over Democrats after last year’s election for the 2-year seats.\n\nIt’s unclear how many of those representatives will seek re-election next year, but at least two seats will not feature incumbents. James and Democrat Haley Stevens announced their 2026 campaigns for the governor and U.S. Senate races, respectively.\n\nTrump’s decision to host the 100-day “celebration” in Macomb County could also be part of a 2026 U.S. House election strategy. Along with James, Republican Lisa McClain represents a congressional district that encompasses the southeast Michigan county.\n\nWhile McClain bested her 2024 Democratic opponent by nearly 40 percentage points, voters in James’ district offered a tighter margin of victory for Republicans. James defeated his Democratic competition by 6 percentage points. \n\nIn the 2022 election, the margin was even smaller for James: 0.5 percentage points.\n\nNo Republican has yet to declare a 2026 campaign for James’ district.\n\nBorquez said Trump’s choice of Macomb County for Tuesday’s event also could relate to a significant piece of real estate there: Selfridge Air National Guard Base.\n\nTrump earlier this month referenced the base, which officials in recent years have said holds an uncertain future. Trump, though, floated the idea of transporting new jets there.\n\n“We’ve got some good feedback from Pete Hegseth at the Department of Defense. They’re talking about F-16s, they’re talking about F-35s and, you know, et cetera,” Trump said earlier this month. “It’s a great piece of property, it’s a great location, and it’s a great state.”\n\nTrump has said he planned to work with Michigan leaders to keep Selfridge Air National Guard Base open. Whitmer and Republican state House Speaker Matt Hall met with Trump’s cabinet this month in the Oval Office, where they discussed the base’s future.\n\nBorquez said the Tuesday event may give Trump an opportunity to take credit for injecting optimism about the base’s future.\n\n“He could talk up his role with Selfridge and, you know, maybe take a little credit away from from Gov. Whitmer in the process, which I’m sure is in the back of his mind somewhere,” Borquez said. “That’s standard political gamesmanship, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he talks about it.”\n\nBoth Borquez and LaFontaine said the Tuesday event likely will be distinctive in other ways. Neither political science expert could recall a U.S. president before Trump hosting an event advertised as a “celebration” of their first 100 days in office.\n\nTypically, the 100-day milestone is noted by media pundits and acknowledged by presidents more discretely.\n\nBut Tuesday — technically, the 99th day of the Trump presidency — would mark Trump’s second time hosting an event sold as a celebration of such a milestone.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term — on April 29, 2017 — the president hosted a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to commemorate 100 days in the White House.\n\nThe event featured Trump reiterating 2016 campaign promises involving immigration, health care, border security, and trade policy. He also spent much of the session criticizing the media for its coverage of his first administration.\n\n“We know he’s like a showman, and that’s one of his appeals as president,” LaFontaine said, explaining the uniqueness of Trump hosting such an event. “Why is he choosing Michigan for this? I think he realizes Michigan matters.”\n\nTrump in November 2024 won Michigan’s 15 electoral college votes, flipping the battleground state again in a victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump in 2016 was the first Republican to win Michigan’s vote since 1988. With his victory last year, he added to that bragging right.\n\nTrump’s favor in Michigan has wavered over the years, but his supporters have kept the vote counts close.
