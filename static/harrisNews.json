Other Schools Could Be Next.","text":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, in New York City, cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.\n\nThe schools, a mix that includes both public universities and Ivy League institutions, have been placed on an official administration list of schools that the Department of Justice said may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty.\n\nFaculty leaders at many of the schools have pushed back strongly against claims that their campuses are hotbeds of antisemitism, noting that although some Jewish students complained that they felt unsafe, the vast majority of protesters were peaceful and many of the protest participants were Jewish.\n\nThe Trump administration has made targeting higher education a priority. This past week, President Donald Trump threatened in a social media post to punish any school that permits \"illegal\" protests. On Jan. 30, he signed an executive order on combating antisemitism, focusing on what he called anti-Jewish racism at \"leftists\" universities. Then, on Feb. 3, he announced the creation of a multiagency task force to carry out the mandate.\n\nThe task force appeared to move into action quickly after a pro-Palestinian sit-in and protest at Barnard College, a partner school to Columbia, led to arrests Feb. 26. Two days later, the administration released its list of 10 schools under scrutiny, including Columbia, the site of large pro-Palestinian encampments last year.\n\nIt said it would be paying the schools a visit, part of a review process to consider \"whether remedial action is warranted.\" Then on Friday, it announced it would be canceling millions of dollars in grants and contracts with Columbia.\n\nHarvard University, whose former president, Claudine Gay, resigned last year after a bruising appearance before a House committee, is also on the list.\n\nSo are George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; UCLA; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.\n\nThe Trump administration's moves to hobble university funding and target schools over claims that they tolerated antisemitism had already caused internal recalibration at schools across the country. Some have stepped up lobbying efforts, including hiring lobbyists with connections to Trump.\n\nMany campuses had already cracked down on students over protest activity. More are dialing back or renaming efforts related to diversity, an effort to avoid the ire of Trump officials who have vowed to end such programs\n\nAnd a number have paused hiring and reduced the number of doctoral students admitted in response to the financial uncertainty.\n\nSome school officials have said they face an \"existential threat.\" Still, many presidents have been silent or muted in their public statements about Trump's moves against the sector, appearing to retreat in fear of the new administration.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Harvard said it was \"committed to ensuring our Jewish community is embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard, and to our efforts to confront antisemitism and all forms of hate.\"\n\nSeveral days after Trump's inauguration, the president, Dr. Alan Garber, posted a message to the university cowritten with other administration leaders.\n\n\"In these challenging times,\" they wrote, \"our efforts will be guided by our values and commitments: supporting academic excellence and the pursuit of knowledge; championing open inquiry, constructive dialogue, and academic freedom.\"\n\nThe selection criteria for being on the list for visits is nebulous, but a number of the schools had been included in a report in October by the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, which claimed they had allowed antisemitic behavior by students and faculty.\n\nThe report criticized Harvard leaders, citing their initial failure to condemn the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023.\n\nNorthwestern and its president, Michael Schill, also had been under attack by the House committee, then led by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. The committee report criticized the university for placing \"radical anti-Israel faculty\" in charge of negotiations with protesters.\n\nUC Berkeley was identified in the House report for not disciplining students who took part in an encampment or disrupted a talk by an Israeli speaker.\n\nUC Berkeley issued a statement Saturday saying, \"We are confident we have the right processes in place now to respond to any antisemitic incidents.\" The statement cited an advisory committee the chancellor formed on Jewish student life and campus antisemitism.\n\nWhile several of the schools have been focal points for campus protests, others are more of a surprise.\n\nRichard Painter, a professor of law at Minnesota, was among those who filed a complaint about antisemitism at the university. He had chafed at incidents on campus, including anti-Israeli statements posted by faculty on official department websites.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nEven so, Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, wondered if the school was targeted partly because it sits in the congressional district of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a vocal critic of both Israel and Trump's, and in the home state of Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Part of it is political,\" he said in an interview Saturday.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOfficials at Minnesota could not be reached for comment, but efforts are already underway to address the complaints. The Board of Regents is expected to vote Friday on a resolution prohibiting individual departments from making political statements on issues of the day.\n\nThere was evidence suggesting that the administration's action against Columbia was accelerated by last month's sit-in at Barnard, which led to additional protests recently. The protests were sparked by Barnard's decision to expel two students who interrupted a class on Israel.\n\nOn Monday, six days after the initial Barnard disturbance, the government sent a notice to Columbia that it would review $51 million in federal contracts, citing harassment of Jewish students.\n\nThe next day, Trump released a statement on Truth Social saying, in part, \"All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nIn a news release Friday announcing the cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts, the task force also accused Columbia of failing to respond to the earlier notice while antisemitic harassment continued on or near campus.\n\nOn Friday, Columbia said it was reviewing the administration's announcement and that it pledged to work with the government.\n\nAlso on Friday, Linda McMahon, the newly installed secretary of education, met with Columbia's interim president, Dr. Katrina Armstrong. McMahon issued a statement saying that schools \"must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws\" to receive federal funding.\n\nThe task force's list was released in late February amid a flurry of executive orders from the White House.\n\nMembers of the task force include Leo Terrell, a senior Justice Department lawyer. Efforts to reach Terrell were not successful Saturday. It was also unclear if any of the campus visits had been scheduled.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, in New York City, cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-pulled-400-million-from-columbia-other-schools-could-be-next/article_a519bb4c-a2bb-574c-9717-6bbb686b00d8.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 00:25:02","author":"North Adams Pride,Stephanie Saul","authors":["North Adams Pride","Stephanie Saul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":298168956,"title":"“Prominent Trump Advisor Joins Battle for Location of Presidential Library”","text":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The search for President Donald Trump’s post-administration presidential library site is intensifying in South Florida, with Trump’s son Eric and a top Trump administration adviser, Steve Witkoff, getting involved in recent weeks.\n\nTrump’s team has had site selectors scoping out potential South Florida locations for months, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is meeting with Trump in Palm Beach County this weekend to discuss places to build a potential Trump library, five sources tell NBC News.\n\nThough no final decision has been made, the current top targets are Florida Atlantic University, located in Palm Beach County, and Florida International University, located in Miami-Dade County. Palm Beach County is Trump’s official residence, and the location there is in close proximity to Mar-a-Lago. Miami-Dade County is home to Trump’s Doral golf resort, another one of his major properties.\n\nThere are also sites not connected to a university under consideration, sources tell NBC News. But FAU and FIU are lobbying heavily to win the site, and they have started to offer enticements, including potentially donating land to build the presidential library.\n\nTrump’s team has said it would like a new hotel associated with the presidential library, two sources tell NBC News, which is a part of the active negotiations.\n\nThe presidents of Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University are both well-connected former Republican elected officials, and both have been heavily engaged in the process. Florida Atlantic University is led by Adam Hasner, a former high-ranking member of the state House, and Florida International University’s president is Jeanette Nuñez, who was DeSantis’ lieutenant governor until he appointed her to the FIU post last month.\n\nNeither Hasner or Nuñez returned requests seeking comment. A DeSantis spokesperson also did not return a request seeking comment.\n\nThe White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump administration official confirmed that South Florida has become the focus of the presidential search.\n\nEric Trump joined Witkoff and Nuñez on a tour of FIU’s potential sites over the past few weeks, a process that included Florida House Speaker Danny Perez, a Miami-Dade County Republican who has spoken directly to Witkoff and is among the leaders trying to get the library in Miami.\n\n“Eric Trump was here. He took a tour of FIU, so they have been at least looking,” said one person familiar with the tour.\n\nEric Trump has also toured FAU-aligned sites.\n\n“There has been a strong push to put the library at FAU, even offering land for construction of the library,” said a person familiar with those negotiations. “There seems to be a lot of interest in doing that because it’s in the president’s home county.”\n\n“They are evaluating all options right now, but it appears the governor and the state university system are clamoring for the chance to get the president’s library,” that person added.\n\nRepublicans in the state have been making efforts to ensure that Florida becomes the home of the presidential library. Trump was a New York resident until 2019, when he officially made Florida his primary residence.\n\nBeyond direct talks with DeSantis, the GOP-dominated Florida Legislature is moving quickly to pass a bill that would allow Republicans in Tallahassee to be in charge of decisions about presidential libraries, removing the ability of local authorities to oversee the construction of any presidential library.\n\nThe change would box out Democratic-leaning local officials in South Florida from the decision-making and approval processes around a proposed Trump presidential library. Trump carried Miami-Dade County in 2024, but Palm Beach County was one of just six Florida counties won by former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential contest.\n\n“After the flap over the size of Trump’s flag, I don’t want my president getting in trouble for being too patriotic ever again,” said Orlando-area Republican state Sen. Jason Brodeur, who is sponsoring the legislation in his chamber.\n\nIt’s a reference to a 2006 legal fight between Trump and town of Palm Beach officials over an 80-foot flagpole flying an American flag over a Trump golf course, which local officials said exceeded the maximum size allowed by town ordinances. Trump and the town later settled, allowing a 70-foot flagpole in a different location.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Alex Andrade, another sponsor of the bill, said he would be in favor of a nonuniversity site for Trump’s library to avoid a turf war between FAU and FIU.\n\n“Putting it at either university is going to result in whining and protesting,” he said. “With such an important proposition that will inevitably benefit the immediate surrounding area, it’s embarrassing that it will be met with whining and protesting.”\n\n“Either institution would be lucky to have it,” he added.\n\nAnother person familiar with the negotiations confirmed FAU and FIU are top targets, but the subject of talks this weekend between Trump and DeSantis do include other sites.\n\n“They are currently looking at sites in South Florida,” the person said. “Both FAU and FIU want it, but my understanding is they are looking at nonuniversity sites.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The search for President Donald Trump’s post-administration presidential library&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Prominent Trump Advisor Joins Battle for Location of Presidential Library&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/prominent-trump-advisor-joins-battle-for-location-of-presidential-library/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Top-Trump-adviser-gets-involved-as-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 22:50:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":298152914,"title":"The Democratic Fork in the Road and the Woke Repudiation Imperative","text":"Yogi Berra, the mid-century New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher known for his pithy and often humorous life observations, once famously quipped: “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” It was sound advice, perhaps, for a traveler on the go and in search of a quick meal. But the modern Democratic Party, rudderless and confused and reeling from a pitiful collective performance during Tuesday evening’s presidential joint address to Congress, now confronts a fork in the road that’s no joke.\n\nOn the one hand lies the path of least resistance: doubling down on the status quo—the progressive culture-warring, woke/identity politics-driven agenda that has dominated the party ever since Barack Obama upset Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. On the other hand lies the more difficult but ultimately more promising path: repudiation of that post-2008 legacy and a conscientious return to a politics of the prudential center. Which path Democrats choose from here will go a long way toward determining their relevance as a national political party for the foreseeable future.\n\nObama’s shocking upset over the madam-president-in-waiting was an inflection point for the institutional trajectory of the Democratic Party. Voters rejected the cultural centrism that was a Clinton-era hallmark in favor of the “hope” and “change” promised by Obama’s “coalition of the ascendant.” Initially, perhaps, that may have looked like a smart bet: Obama trounced John McCain in the 2008 presidential general election. But the one-time “coalition of the ascendant” transmogrified into an identitarian and deeply off-putting “coalition of aggrieved interests.” Culturally militant wokeism eventually reached its pernicious apex during Joe Biden’s presidency—which saw the first explicitly “DEI” Supreme Court justice selection (Ketanji Brown Jackson, after Biden vowed to nominate a black woman) and a diversity, equity, and inclusion vice presidential running mate (Kamala Harris, after Biden was pressured to choose a black woman).\n\nThis version of the Democratic Party, which featured the progenitor of wokeism, Obama himself, as the leading presidential campaign trail surrogate for Harris, was thoroughly rejected in November by the American people. It turns out that voters didn’t really know what they were signing up for when they embarked on an extended political journey of “hope” and “change.” They weren’t interested—and aren’t interested—in legitimizing the juvenile genital mutilation and chemical castration that has been euphemistically sold as “gender-affirming care.” They weren’t interested—and aren’t interested—in assenting to wide-scale importation and resettlement of foreigners whose cultures and customs are antithetical to our own.\n\nSome leading Democrats do finally seem to get the memo. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, has called for Democrats to distance themselves from the excesses of woke civilizational arson. But many others disagree. There is no indication at all, for instance, that the ladies of “The View” have done any introspection: Shortly after November’s electoral shellacking, cohost Sunny Hostin attributed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump to “racism” and “misogyny.” Surveying the left-of-center punditocracy scene, it often seems that there are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety.\n\nDemocratic elected officials are also deeply split. California Gov. Gavin Newsom made headlines this week by repudiating certain facets of wokeism during an interview with Charlie Kirk, but congressional Democrats attending Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening took the opposite approach, beyond refusing to applaud: Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, obnoxiously heckled the president and was kicked out of the House chamber within the speech’s first few minutes–deservedly so. In general, their conduct was positively buffoonish.\n\nIn what world do Democrats think they do themselves any political favors with these antics and, more important, these underlying substantive political stances? One guest of Trump on Tuesday, Payton McNabb, is a female former high school athlete who was grievously injured during a match against a team with a biological male player. On this issue, recent CNN polling indicates that roughly four-fifths of Americans oppose biological male participation in female athletic competitions. Even Newsom, in his podcast episode with Kirk, called the practice “deeply unfair.”\n\nNewsom seems to be reading the tea leaves—unlike congressional Democrats. There is a similar divide on the issue of illegal immigration and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions; consider, for instance, New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ high-profile flip on the issue, which has brought him into line with Trump.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a majority of Democratic elites too often now come across not merely as schoolmarmish and excessively self-righteous—but as heartless and lacking compassion, to boot. Party leaders undoubtedly think of themselves as “compassionate,” especially for those perceived as being “oppressed” (on the neo-Marxist intersectional scale of victimization status). But where is the compassion for McNabb? Where is the compassion for the family of Laken Riley, the Athens, Georgia, student whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal alien who never should have been on our soil?\n\nIn order to recover their standing and regain lasting relevance as an electorally feasible national political party, Democrats are going to have to repudiate the entirety of their post-2008/post-Obama cultural legacy. That is the simple truth. The American people want a stable pocketbook, a stable border and a stable world stage. They’re not interested in the Obama-Biden-Harris Democratic Party’s idiosyncratic conception of waging a culture war.\n\nAre Democrats up to such a challenge? The intraparty civil war is on—but I certainly have my doubts. Unless and until they do repudiate their cultural militance, however, Democrats will continue to flounder about in irrelevance. Perhaps they’ll need to get their clocks cleaned at the ballot box a few more times. That wouldn’t be the worst thing.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Kirk laughs, adding that the teen could come to a Turning Point event in Florida.\nThen, the governor asks Kirk for advice on how to better appeal to Americans.\n“Get better ideas,” he responds.\n“You have an opportunity to run to the middle … you right now should come out and be like, you know what, the young man who's about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports,” Kirk continued, misgendering a high school track player in California. “That shouldn't happen.”\n“Right,” Newsom said.\n“Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?” Kirk asked. “Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,” Newsom responded. “It’s deeply unfair.”\n“So, would you speak out against this young man?” Kirk pressed, adding, “I see you wrestling with this.”\n“No, I’m not wrestling with the fairness,” the governor said. “I totally agree with you.”\nThe governor, who is widely understood to be eyeing a presidential run for 2028, described his new podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” as a forum to “have honest conversations” with people who both agree and disagree with “us.”\nNewsom’s comments come as, across the country, transgender Americans continue to face increased offenses from conservative leaders in government, healthcare, and education—including directly from President Donald Trump’s administration.\nIn early February, Trump signed an executive order barring transgender student-athletes from playing on girls’ sports teams. The action, which notably doesn’t mention transgender boys and men playing in sports that align with their gender identity, claims to “protect” women.\nShortly after Trump signed the order, the National Collegiate Athletic Association changed its participation policy for transgender athletes and barred anyone who wasn’t assigned female at birth from participating in girls’ or women’s sports. (Some local leaders have pushed back on Trump’s order, including the governor of Maine, who said she would see the president “in court” over her state’s decision to allow transgender athletes to play on the teams they choose.)\nAccording to Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes he is aware of who currently compete in college sports, and nationally, just around 1 percent of adults identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. This statistically small group of Americans has continued to receive an outsized level of attention from those on the right and Trump’s new administration.\nSince taking office, the Trump admin has wiped public health information for transgender Americans from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website, removed the option to select “X” as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants, and ordered all State Department employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures, among other actions. The president also, on his first day in office, signed an executive order exclaiming that the US would only recognize two genders—an outdated and scientifically inaccurate move that required government agencies to enforce a gender binary on certain official documents like employment records.\nFollowing Thursday’s interview, Newsom received potent backlash from queer advocacy groups in his state and across the country for both choosing Kirk as his first guest and his comments on transgender girls and women.\n“Instead of standing strong, the Governor has added to the heartbreak and fear caused by the relentless barrage of hate from the Trump Administration,” Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, the state’s leading LGBT advocacy group, said. “In California, we have strong policies in place that protect transgender youth and ensure a level playing field for all students—policies that have allowed students to participate in school sports here for over ten years without incident.”\n“We woke up incredibly sickened and disappointed, because somebody who’s been a consistent ally of our community made these remarks,” Assemblymember Chris Ward, a Democrat who leads the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, told CalMatters. “I know that he knows that until Donald Trump began obsessing about this issue, it actually hasn’t been a problem in California.”\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT advocacy group, said that their message to the governor “and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.”\nThroughout the interview with Kirk, Newsom discussed how effective the right’s messaging against transgender people was in the 2024 election, pointing specifically to Trump’s advertisement where he claimed former vice president Kamala Harris was for “they/them” while he was for “you.”\nAt one point, the governor bemoaned a meeting where “people started going around the table with pronouns.”\n“I’m like, ‘What the hell, why is this the biggest issue?’” Newsom said.\nAt other times, he reminded Kirk—and the listener—of his past support for LGBT issues in the state.\nTwo decades ago, in 2003, Newsom officiated same-sex weddings before they were allowed by law. He has also long-participated in San Francisco’s Pride parade and has supported several pieces of legislation expanding rights for queer people across California. As the New York Times noted on Thursday, Newsom is also the godfather to Nats Getty, an oil heir and designer who came out as transgender in 2021. A couple of years earlier, in 2019, he delivered a toast at Getty’s wedding to Gigi Gorgeous, a YouTube personality who is also transgender.\nIn 2022, he signed a bill making California a refuge for those seeking gender-affirming care. Last year, Newsom signed another law barring school boards in conservative areas of California from requiring educators to tell parents if their kid went by a different gender identity at school. (Yet, he initially resisted the effort to support schools who chose not to inform parents and has vetoed measures that would require “judges consider a parent’s affirmation of their child’s gender identity in custody disputes and to expedite licensure for transgender health care providers,” per reporting from CalMatters.)\nThis week, Newsom told Kirk that he thinks there ought to be a “humility and a grace” when talking about transgender people. “These poor people,” he continued, “are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression.”\n“So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue, but at the same time deal with the unfairness?” Newsom said.\nThe governor did not comment on whether he would support two Republican lawmakers in California who have introduced bills to prevent transgender athletes from competing in girl's and women’s sports. Newsom’s spokesperson, Izzy Gardon, told CalMatters in an email that “our office does not typically comment on pending legislation.”\nAccording to researchers at The Trevor Project, the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBT young people, a significant cause for suicide risk among transgender and nonbinary young people across the country is anti-transgender state-level laws.\nThey found that the dozens of anti-trans laws enacted between 2018 to 2022 led to an increase in incidents of suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth by as much as 72 percent.","summary":"The governor, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, made the comments during a podcast interview with Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/california-governor-gavin-newsom-transgender-athletes-sports-unfair","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67cc919835e7f1f1fbf0611a/16:9/w_6000,h_3375,c_limit/1431097320","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 19:25:56","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.135},{"id":298138450,"title":"James Carville gets blowback after saying trans athletes in women’s sports, bathrooms is ‘not a concern to me’","text":"During a recent episode of Piers Morgan’s talk show, the British journalist slammed Democratic strategist James Carville for arguing that the trans athletes and trans bathrooms issues are not huge policy points to be concerned about.

Still, Carville dismissed the issue, stating that the trans issue isn't that important, at least in his view.

(Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nVance posted a picture of his face edited over a widely used meme of Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a screen in a scene from “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”—but unlike most viral Vance memes, his face in this meme isn’t edited to be comically large.\n\nViral memes of Vance edited to resemble a child have flooded the internet for weeks, including an edit from Vance’s White House clash with President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where a picture of a childlike Vance is captioned: “You shoulda said pwease.”\n\nMany of the memes depict Vance with exaggerated baby fat, including one of him arriving at Trump’s address to Congress, others of him at the vice presidential debate, and several of his vice presidential portrait.\n\nSome of the edits imagine Vance, who at 40 is one of the United States’ youngest-ever vice presidents, as childish to an absurd degree, editing him holding comically oversized lollipops or wearing propeller hats.\n\nOther viral memes depict Vance’s face as bright-red or wildly distorted, complete with messy long hair and piercing eyes—while some superimposed Vance’s face onto other people, including “JD Al-Assad” and “Marjorie Taylor Vance.”\n\nHow Did The Vance Memes Start?\n\nThe Vance memes date back to at least October, months before he took office as vice president. Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., posted a photo of Vance’s face edited to have an especially chiseled jawline and sharp cheekbones, sparking jokes and more memes. Hours later, an X user posted a photo of Vance’s government portrait with a much more rounded face, stating: “For every 100 likes I will turn JD Vance into a progressively apple cheeked baby.” The post earned more than 211,000 likes—and the user did not enlarge Vance’s face thousands of times, but they did enlarge it multiple times before posting edits of Vance as a woman and a multi-headed monster inspired by the film “The Substance.” Edits of Vance’s face continued to take over social media over the following months, but they appeared to go particularly viral in March following Vance’s contentious White House meeting with Trump and Zelenskyy.\n\nHow Has Social Media Reacted To The Vance Memes?\n\nThe memes appear to have been spread by both left and right-wing social media users. Though many of the memes seem to have been posted by left-wing users to make fun of Vance, some right-wing social media users have embraced the jokes. Catturd, a right-wing X account with more than 3.6 million followers, has posted several Vance memes, calling them “hilarious.” Auron MacIntyre, a columnist for The Blaze, suggested the memes could propel Vance’s political career to the presidency, stating he would be “thoroughly memed that he becomes immune to the effect before ever entering office.” Some X users have noted how widespread the memes are and joked they don’t even remember what Vance really looks like. Collins, who posted one of the original Vance memes in October, tweeted Friday: “My feed is broken. I just keep seeing JD Vance.” Singer Dionne Warwick posted: “Every time I open this app I see a brand new picture of JD Vance made to look like some sort of Cabbage Patch doll. “I have completely forgotten what the real JD Vance looks like at this point,” one X user posted, garnering 300,000 likes.\n\nKey Background\n\nVance is the latest vice president to receive the meme treatment—after former Vice President Kamala Harris went widely viral for her bizarre, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” quote, which her supporters embraced as she mounted her presidential bid last year. She also embraced memes and edits comparing her campaign to Charli XCX’s album “Brat,” and drew comparisons to Julia-Louis Dreyfus’ character in the HBO sitcom “Veep.” At a campaign stop in October, Harris said, “I know the memes,” invoking her other widely memed phrase: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Internet Is Doing Weird Things to J.

CNN pushed out Jim Acosta, after all. Then NBC’s Chuck Todd decided he was leaving the network — which, to be clear, is not as significant of a loss.\n\nBut you’ve probably heard of the “rule of three.” Culture writers once used it as the lowest threshold in the trendspotting game. This so-called rule has little to do with the supernatural but it's a reminder to pay close attention to certain corners of our world. It’s not so much a law as a wake-up call: open your eyes, something is happening. \n\nBut who’s going by the old rules anymore? America's mainstream newsrooms have been trying to and failing for nigh on a quarter century, steadily ceding attention to an ascendant right-wing media led by Fox News, websites and podcasters.\n\nSince Donald Trump was re-elected, the news industry’s scythe-swinging hasn’t paused. It feels like the whole field is getting mowed to the dirt, with the latest layoffs hitting ABC’s news department. Disney abruptly shut down FiveThirtyEight.com and laid off its staff, Status reported on Wednesday, as part of a slew of cuts in its news division.\n\nThat bloodletting isn’t as high profile as MSNBC firing Reid and canceling “The ReidOut” on Feb. 23, along with shuttering Jonathan Capehart’s, José Díaz-Balart’s, Ayman Mohyeldin’s and Katie Phang’s shows. \n\nMSNBC’s president Rebecca Kutler also yanked Alex Wagner from her weeknight slot, to which she was supposed to return once Rachel Maddow resumes her weekly cadence in April. Jen Psaki has been tapped to replace Wagner in the 9 p.m. slot instead.\n\nThat’s six cancellations, for those keeping count, although Reid’s ouster continues the “progressive” cable news outlet's trend of firing Black women who use their platforms to dig into race and class in politics. “The Cross Connection” host Tiffany Cross was fired in 2022. The network also sidelined Melissa Harris-Perry from covering the 2016 election before driving her out. There’s your three. I guess.\n\nHowever, Reid’s loss has implications distinct from these demotions and from CNN setting Acosta adrift in late January, although anyone with eyes can reasonably deduce that both moves are appeasement gestures to a thin-skinned authoritarian driven to destroy legitimate news organizations. Reid did not pull punches or mince words when it came to explaining what this administration’s anti-diversity push means and its attack on civil rights.\n\nAcosta was a consistent pain for Trump during his first presidency, so even though CNN’s chiefs insisted his out-of-left-field shuffling off to midnight was simply a matter of restructuring, media analysts could see what was happening. Something similar may be afoot at MSNBC, although Status also reported Kutler told \"ReidOut\" staffers that the Trump administration did not play a role the network's decision to cancel their show.\n\nIn mid-February, Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr informed Brian Roberts, the CEO of NBC and MSNBC’s parent company Comcast, that his enforcement bureau would investigate whether NBC Universal was “promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations.” The letter is dated Feb. 11; “The ReidOut” aired its final episode on Feb. 24.\n\nNBC isn’t alone in being subjected to the scrutiny of Carr’s FCC. The agency is investigating PBS’ and NPR’s broadcast underwriting announcements as well as looking into complaints against ABC and CBS.\n\nAs a cable entity, MSNBC isn’t subject to FCC regulation, but it and other Comcast-owned cable channels are on the verge of being split from NBC News to become a new company called SpinCo.\n\nWith that in the works under a president bent on diminishing legacy news organizations and supplanting true journalism with propaganda that portrays him favorably, it certainly appears that MSNBC is getting rid of the anchor Trump would most like gone.\n\nMSNBC is elevating “The Weekend” hosts Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez and Michael Steele to the 7 p.m. slot, perhaps to develop its answer to “The Five,” Fox News’ dominant roundtable show.\n\nBut that trio isn’t likely to focus on race or class with Reid’s sharpness, or to open the door to contributors who aren’t already Beltway-approved. As an enraged former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann pointed out on his podcast shortly after the news broke, Reid’s ratings may have been up and down, like the rest of her primetime peers. But she brought a unique value to MSNBC that can’t be replicated. \n\n“It's important that she's there for the people who want to identify with somebody who looks like Joy Reid and say, ‘That woman is out here trying to argue my point and is talking to me, and is bringing people who look like me and look like her on the television for the first time, some of them who are going to become superstars,’” he said.\n\n“And if we ever get out of this . . . mess caused by lack of courage, often on places like MSNBC, often in places in the public discourse,” Olbermann continued, “if we're ever going to get out of this mess and restore this democracy, it's going to be because of people like Joy Reid, even you don’t agree with a . . . word she said.”\n\nAs for the other part, Maddow put it succinctly on Reid’s last day, saying, “I will tell you, it is also unnerving to see that on a network where we've got two, count ‘em, two, nonwhite hosts in primetime, both of our nonwhite hosts in primetime are losing their shows, as is Katie Phang on the weekend. And that feels worse than bad. That feels indefensible, and I do not defend it.”\n\nMSNBC personnel shifts differ from the voluntary departures of CBS’ Norah O’Donnell and NBC’s Lester Holt from their network anchor chairs and Todd’s exit from NBC altogether, but it fits a general pattern of shrinkage in the information space. Budgets are being slashed, and salaries with them. (O’Donnell remains a senior correspondent at CBS while Holt, whose tenure as the anchor of NBC Nightly News ends this summer, plans to remain with “Dateline.”)\n\nNewspapers have felt it for decades, part of a system whose fractures have yawned into complete breaks. The Washington Post, that one-time bastion of peerless journalism, has been shedding talent and the public’s trust at an alarming clip since Jeff Bezos blocked a Kamala Harris endorsement in the 2024 presidential election and gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.\n\nHis latest feat came on Feb. 26 when he announced on Elon Musk’s X that the Post’s opinion pages would henceforth be devoted to supporting \"personal liberties and free markets.\"\n\n“Viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos said. But his next observation is chilling. “There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.”\n\nIt really does. And Bezos’ Silicon Valley peers control the algorithms that determine which opinions gain the most extensive reach. Should you have one of them meddling in your operating systems, as Social Security employees discovered this week, you may be blocked from accessing “General News,” as Wired reported Thursday.\n\nMusk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) blocked the browsing of sites such as The Washington Post, The New York Times and MSNBC from “government-furnished equipment.” One employee told Wired they couldn’t access local news sites either. But they could read news on Politico and Axios. Go figure.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration continues to bar the AP from entering the Oval Office and traveling on Air Force One with the press pool, the makeup of which has traditionally been determined by the White House Correspondents' Association. Favored access in the new regime has instead been granted to conservative influencers such as conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Collin Rugg. \n\nPart of the job the Internet is doing coincides with and is contributing to hastening the decline of linear TV. Advertisers are following audiences to digital and streaming. And viewers have been tuning out the news since Trump’s re-election and consuming far less of it beforehand.\n\nThat will continue for the foreseeable future, either because the frenetic chaos of the news cycle has burned them out, or they’ve been conditioned by right-wing media to distrust any news outlet that isn’t part of their ecosystem.\n\nAs for the major broadcast figures who spent years cultivating the trust of millions, meaning O’Donnell and Holt, their departures won’t help their respective networks’ newsrooms.\n\nI do not doubt that Tom Llamas, the NBC News Now evening anchor set to take over for Holt, will do a fine job. But he’s also an unfamiliar face to a broadcast audience that came to know Holt over decades. Broadcast news is a specific, middle-of-the-road animal whose viewers connect with the headline readers as opposed to the depth of the coverage itself.\n\nWitness CBS News’ ratings drop-off following O’Donnell’s final broadcast in January for a preview of what Llamas is likely in for.\n\nIt’s also telling that he’s adding to his anchor duties instead of leaving his streaming show behind. Once he signs off from “Nightly News,” he’ll segue directly into helming “Top Story,” the online show he’s hosted since 2021.\n\nThis is where the news business has been heading, and where all those defenestrated newscasters I’ve mentioned already are. Acosta signed off his final CNN show and immediately launched his Substack video channel. Reid is also producing Substack content.\n\nThis trend is extending across the mediascape as top journalists with name recognition are striking out as solo operators who are subscriber-supported and not beholden to corporate interests (yet). There are many skilled and dedicated reporters tracking the list of this administration’s illegal actions, explaining how each mass firing, tariff threat and slashed budget affects the average American. They simply don’t have the wide reach of a broadcast media apparatus. They are outgunned.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nRight-wing media holds the loudest bullhorn and it has been setting the news agenda across the board for years. News consumers of all ages are turning to podcasts and YouTube for their information updates instead of network and cable. Those other hosts have name-brand recognition, but they aren’t buoyed by an ecosystem that gives weight and relevance to Megyn Kelly or Joe Rogan.\n\nAnd if the Internet was already a basement, it is now one flooded with influencers devoted to delegitimizing reporting on unflattering truths by transforming Trump loyalists into heroes via memes. That’s been true for well over a decade, only now the belittling strategies that were once the province of 4chan trolls are sunnily marketing the executive branch’s overreach. \n\nOn Thursday, the Washington Post published an article about the White House’s “rapid-response influencer operation, disseminating messages directly to Americans through the memes, TikToks and podcasts where millions now get their news.”\n\nIt continues, “After years of working to undermine mainstream outlets and neutralize critical reporting, Trump’s allies are now pushing a parallel information universe of social media feeds and right-wing firebrands to sell the country on his expansionist approach to presidential power.”\n\nOptimists may tell you that this tumult amounts to the birthing agony that precedes a new age of journalism, and they’re probably correct to some degree. But what will the next generation look like, and how long will it take to recover from this age of expanding disinformation and propaganda?\n\nA free press that deals in facts and promotes diverse viewpoints is the water that nourishes a healthy democracy. But for it to function, citizens have to seek out those wells and insist on them. And that feels harder to do as the public is conditioned to consume the fertilizer that's piling up.","summary":"Broadcast news anchors are leaving and critics like Joy Reid have been fired.

Hundreds of blouses.\n\nLace blouses from the Victorian era and big-shouldered blouses from the 1980s. Blouses in paisley and leopard print. Blouses with familiar pedigrees -- Ungaro, Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio di Sant' Angelo -- and blouses with no pedigree at all. A rainbow of blouses arranged according to color on six clothing racks.\n\nWelcome to the mind -- or, rather, the home office -- of Chemena Kamali, the creative director of Chloé.\n\nIf you want to understand how, in only two seasons, she transformed Chloé from an earnest but increasingly minor womenswear house into one of fashion's hottest labels, not to mention the uniform of cool girls like Suki Waterhouse and Sienna Miller (and, during her run for president, Kamala Harris), you have to understand Kamali's obsession with the blouse.\n\nShe has been collecting them for 25 years and has more than 1,500 blouses: at her parents' home in Germany, in storage in France, almost 500 in her house alone. For her, the blouse -- that relatively unappreciated top, redolent of school uniforms, Edwardian nannies and 1970s career girls that lost its primacy of place in the woman's wardrobe to the T-shirt decades ago -- is actually the Platonic ideal of a garment.\n\n\"The evolution of the blouse is the evolution of femininity in a way, and the evolution of fashion,\" Kamali said recently, tucked into one of the two giant leather chairs in her office. Aside from the blouses, a big modular desk from the 1980s and some pottery and family tchotchkes are the only objects in the room. She and her husband, Konstantin Wehrum, and their two sons, ages 3 and 5, moved into the house when she got the job at Chloé last year -- they had been on their way to California -- and she has not had a lot of time to unpack.\n\n\"Historically, the blouse was a man's undergarment,\" she said. When she talks about something she loves, you can hear her working through her ideas in real time: \"Then, in Victorian times, the blouse became feminized. Postwar, it got more tailored. In the 1970s, again, more fluid, and in the '80s, more powerful. It can be formal and strict or playful and romantic. It reflects personalities. It reflects all of the things that make us who we are as women.\"\n\nThat's a lot of meaning to load onto a garment, but to Kamali, the blouse is not just a bit of fabric with buttons.\n\nThe Shirt on Her Back\n\nNo one wears a blouse better than Kamali, not even converts like Karlie Kloss and Liya Kebede, who have begun to line the Chloé front rows in her lacy tops and wooden platforms. Kamali's typical uniform starts with a Chloé blouse of her own design or one from her collection, often in an aged ivory with a touch of embroidery to lend it a vaguely bohemian air.\n\n\"A blouse is so much easier than a dress,\" she said.\n\nShe pairs them with high-waist Chloé jeans, shredded at the hem, white Chloé high-top sneakers and a tangle of necklaces, some new, some sourced at the same vintage markets where she finds her blouses. With waist-length brown hair parted in the center and framing a face that seems makeup free, it creates a vibe that is both Venice Beach hippie -- even though Kamali grew up mostly in Dortmund, Germany -- and efficient. If Stevie Nicks had a day job at a venture capital fund, she might look like this.\n\n\"She's aspirational,\" said actress Rashida Jones, who met Kamali a year ago. \"But it doesn't feel unattainable. It feels grounded.\"\n\nKaia Gerber, who has modeled for Kamali and wears her clothes off the runway, put it this way: \"Chemena herself is a testament to holding your power without having to adhere to the judgments society makes about women based on the way they dress.\"\n\nKamali, 43, started collecting blouses in 2003, which was around the time she got her first job at Chloé. She knew she wanted to be a designer when she was a child, and in Germany, she said, that meant being like Karl Lagerfeld, the most famous German designer, who was then at Chloé. She went to the University of Applied Sciences in Trier, Germany, and talked her way into Chloé as an intern during the Phoebe Philo era.\n\n\"The first designer piece I ever bought, actually, was at the company's employee sale for 50 euros,\" she said, pointing to a white T-shirt with a \"necklace\" of silver teardrops woven into the front. \"That's when my vintage obsession started, because I remember members of the team coming back from trips with big duffel bags and unpacking treasures they'd found. I realized how certain source pieces can trigger a creative process that can flow into the concept of a collection.\"\n\nShe got a degree from Central Saint Martins, worked at Alberta Ferretti; Chloé again, under Clare Waight Keller; and then Saint Laurent before returning to Chloé in the top job. But wherever she went, Kamali kept buying blouses. She does not buy, as many collectors do, for historic or material value but rather according to details that catch her eye -- \"the volume or the construction of the sleeve or yoke.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAs a result, her pieces are not forbiddingly expensive. They range from \"super cheap to maybe $700,\" she said, though the average is about $300. She sources them from eBay, vintage fairs like A Current Affair in Los Angeles and what has turned into an extended network of vintage dealers.\n\n\"You go to a store, you go to a market and you meet this person who says, 'OK, you want more of this, I have some stuff in my basement,'\" she said. \"Then, connecting to this community, this group of obsessive people all about the rare find, becomes an addiction.\" It also made her perfect for Chloé.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAll Blouses All the Time\n\nThe blouse is such an important part of the Chloé aesthetic that when the Jewish Museum in New York held the first major retrospective devoted to Chloé in 2023, it dedicated an entire room to the blouse. As a garment, it encapsulates the easy-breezy-feminine tone set by the founder, Gaby Aghion, in 1952, and was replicated to varying extents by the designers who came after, including Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney, Keller and Gabriela Hearst.\n\nBut while they all made blouses, none made them as central to their aesthetic as Kamali had. It is the way \"she connects to the fundamental values of the house,\" said Philippe Fortunato, the chief executive of the fashion and accessories maisons at Richemont, the Swiss conglomerate that owns Chloe.\n\nIndeed, Kamali's first collection for Chloé was built around a blouse. Specifically, a piece Karl Lagerfeld designed for Chloé with a black capelet of sorts built into the top. The blouse, she said, got her \"thinking about how the cape is an iconic piece in Chloé's history.\"\n\nJust as the lace in a Victorian blouse had inspired the lacy tiers of the last collection, which were visible not just in actual blouses, but also in playsuits with the affect of blouses and dresses that looked like longer versions of the blouses.\n\nAnd just as, for her third collection, unveiled Thursday, Kamali was thinking about something Karl Lagerfeld once said about \"the basic idea being the simplest of all: a blouse and a skirt.\"\n\n\"That kind of triggered in me the idea of really looking at the blouse not as a component of a look, but as the main component,\" she said. That in turn led her to the idea of the blouse as a container of historical fragments: a dolman sleeve, say, or an exaggerated collar or shoulder. All of which made their way into the collection.\n\n\"It's not about copying,\" she said. \"It's about using the blouse as a way to root things in the past or in tradition.\" And signal that it has a place in the future.\n\nAnd as Lauren Santo Domingo, a founder of Moda Operandi, reports, it's working. Chloé is \"one of our fastest sellout designers,\" Santo Domingo said, noting that sales of Chloé tops had grown 138% since Kamali's first collections appeared.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nFor photographer David Sims, who shoots the Chloé campaigns, Kamali has essentially created \"the representation of a new French kind of woman, with a play around nudity and embroidery that suggests ownership over a sexual energy and power that feels like an answer to so many of the questions that have sprung up recently.\" Questions about gender and stereotype; questions about the male gaze. Doing that through the prism of a garment that was essentially relegated to the dustbin of fashion and old rock stars is, he said, kind of \"radical.\"\n\nBut that tension is actually the point of Kamali's Chloé, which has taken the Chloé girl and grown her into a woman.\n\n\"The term 'Chloé girl' is so connected to how the world perceived the house in the first place,\" Kamali said. \"But the word 'girl' is reductive. I never want the Chloé woman to be only one thing. No woman is. She has shifting moods and feelings. Ease and optimism always exists with tension. These contrasts and these opposites are what makes everything interesting.\"\n\nIncluding, maybe especially, the shirt on your back.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"PARIS -- On the second floor of a 19th-century villa near the Bois de Boulogne, overlooking a garden housing a child's trampoline and various plastic scooters, there is a room filled with blouses.

University presidents fearing that millions of dollars in federal funding could disappear are holding their fire. CEOs alarmed by tariffs that could hurt their businesses are on mute.\n\nEven longtime Republican hawks on Capitol Hill, stunned by President Donald Trump's revisionist history that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion by Russia, and his Oval Office blowup at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have either muzzled themselves, tiptoed up to criticism without naming Trump or completely reversed their positions.\n\nMore than six weeks into the second Trump administration, there is a chill spreading over political debate in Washington and beyond.\n\nPeople on both sides of the aisle who would normally be part of the public dialogue about the big issues of the day say they are intimidated by the prospect of online attacks from Trump and Elon Musk, concerned about harm to their companies and frightened for the safety of their families. Politicians fear banishment by a party remade in Trump's image and the prospect of primary opponents financed by Musk, the president's partner and the world's richest man.\n\n\"When you see important societal actors -- be it university presidents, media outlets, CEOs, mayors, governors -- changing their behavior in order to avoid the wrath of the government, that's a sign that we've crossed the line into some form of authoritarianism,\" said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and the co-author of the influential 2018 book \"How Democracies Die.\"\n\nTrump campaigned in 2024 promising retribution against his enemies and has quickly sent menacing signals from the White House. He revoked the security details of high-profile critics like Gen. Mark Milley, a retired Joint Chiefs of Staff chair who faces death threats from Iran, and said he would pull the security clearances of lawyers at a law firm who are representing Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him.\n\nOne prominent first-term critic of Trump said in a recent interview that not only would he not comment on the record; he did not want to be mentioned in this article at all. Every time his name appears in public, he said, the threats against him from the far right increase.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., was wavering in his support for Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee for defense secretary, until the president threatened him with a primary, Tillis did a turnabout and Hegseth won confirmation. (Tillis' office said the senator was simply performing careful vetting.)\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told Zelenskyy in a meeting at the Hay-Adams Hotel that he was there with other senators \"as a show of support.\" But after Trump's confrontation with Zelenskyy later that day, Wicker took down a social media post showing him shaking hands with the Ukrainian leader.\n\nMore than a half-dozen Republican defense hawks in the Senate -- not a group usually shy about communicating its views -- declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment about Trump's statements on Ukraine or why other Republicans were not speaking out.\n\nMost elected Republicans are fully supportive of Trump and his agenda, and on issues like immigration, some Democrats are moving in his direction, reflecting public opinion. Democrats were divided over the wisdom of the protest by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, during Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nBut the lack of pushback from targets of Trump's retribution and policy agenda is striking, if understandable in other cases.\n\nUniversity presidents are largely silent because they are protecting their institutions, said Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education. \"Don't wrestle with a pig,\" he said. \"You'll just get muddy and annoy the pig.\"\n\nBusiness leaders rarely criticize presidents of either party, and in any case, they like Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, if not his tariffs. They also recognize, one of them said, that \"periodically culling the workforce is actually good for a healthy organization.\"\n\nBut that business leader thinks that CEOs see the way that Musk is going about slashing the federal workforce as \"totally crazy\" -- but would say so only on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.\n\nPressure on Intellectual Life\n\nNot everyone is staying silent. Consider Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University.\n\n\"This is the greatest pressure put on intellectual life since the McCarthy era,\" Roth said in an interview. \"And I think it'll be seen in the future, as that time was seen, as a time when people either stood up for their values or ran in fear of the federal government.\"\n\nRoth has called some of the Trump administration's rhetoric authoritarian and has spoken out in favor of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In an interview in The Washington Post's opinion section last month, he criticized Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for using their Ivy League degrees to advance professionally while portraying themselves as populists against \"woke\" universities.\n\nPeople sometimes tell him he has courage, Roth said, but he insisted it wasn't so. \"When people tell me, 'Oh, you're brave,' it frightens the hell out of me,\" he said. \"I'm a little neurotic Jewish kid from Long Island. I'm afraid of everything.\"\n\nRoth is going public, he said, \"because it's a scandal that the federal government is trying to keep people from speaking their minds.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. and a frequent critic of Trump, said the real fear among Republicans in the House who might otherwise voice criticism of the administration on some issues was violence against their families.\n\n\"I'm friends with a lot of these guys, and I had wrongly assumed that what was holding them back from speaking out against Trump was they were afraid of losing their jobs,\" he said in an interview. \"But what they're afraid of is their own personal security. They tell me that their wives tell them, 'Don't contribute to us getting harassed at church or at the grocery store or at the club.'\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSwalwell, who receives plenty of threats himself, said that he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars of his campaign and office funds on security for his own family, and that his daughter recently included a member of his security detail in a drawing of her family for her kindergarten class.\n\nSen. Todd Young of Indiana is one Republican who has experienced browbeating from Musk for not staying in line. After Young asked tough questions last month at the confirmation hearing of Tulsi Gabbard, now Trump's director of national intelligence, Musk said on social media that Young was a \"deep state puppet.\"\n\nMusk soon deleted his post and said he had spoken to Young, whom he was suddenly calling \"a great ally in restoring power to the people.\" Young went on to confirm Gabbard, although in an interview, he pointedly said he had not discussed her with Musk.\n\n\"I don't think anyone should be afraid to register their convictions,\" he said. \"OK?\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who is friendly with a broad group of Senate Republicans, said in an interview that \"those who I have traveled with and worked with and prayed with and been involved with in foreign aid and foreign policy are struck by the swiftness, the forcefulness, the cruelty and the lack of organization of the cuts.\"\n\nWhy do they not speak out? Musk, he said, has issued \"a credible electoral threat\" to finance primary opponents.\n\nAnd yet, senators only face reelection every six years. \"Frankly,\" Coons said, \"it is a combination of hoping that things change and somehow this all comes apart and the chain-saw approach to government stops.\"\n\n'Totally Reasonable to Be Worried'\n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who oversaw the Biden campaign's successful efforts to beat back lawsuits filed by allies of Trump seeking to overturn his 2020 election loss, is sharply critical of Republicans who say they acquiesce to Trump out of fear.\n\n\"I know what it's like to be targeted by him and the mob he unleashes,\" Elias said in an interview. \"It is totally reasonable to be worried. But for a Republican senator to say they are so worried that they're going to betray their oath of office is such cowardice. Why are you in office?\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOther Republicans see the warnings of authoritarianism as overblown.\n\n\"I'm becoming less and less sympathetic,\" said former Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in egging on the Jan. 6, 2021, mob at the Capitol. \"The rending of cloth and the gnashing of teeth, good lord.\"\n\nAfter the anti-Israel protests against the war in Gaza on college campuses, Meijer said, \"there's a lot more that the fringes on either side share with each other.\"\n\nThat is the perspective of Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur who supported Kamala Harris for president in 2024 and who spoke recently in Washington at the Principles First summit, an annual anti-Trump gathering. The Republicans, he said, saw \"all the identity politics and all the wokeness\" on the left \"as the real silencing factor.\"\n\nCuban added that \"now that Trump has won, there isn't value in calling him names. Name-calling is good for running for office, sometimes. Good for trying to get people excited at a rally. But neither fit me.\"\n\nOlivia Troye, a first-term Trump White House official who broke with him and spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, said that the \"Never Trump\" movement had splintered and that it was difficult for her to watch what was happening.\n\n\"We're in a moment when there's self-preservation, and I don't blame people for that,\" she said. \"But we need to remind ourselves that we have the power. The only reason that they have the power and are continuing to do what they do is that people are going silent.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAs Trump has continued his aggressive effort to reshape the government, there are some signs that more people are speaking out.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers last month, five former defense secretaries who served under Republicans and Democrats -- Lloyd Austin, Jim Mattis, Leon E. Panetta, Chuck Hagel and William J. Perry -- condemned Trump's firing of senior military leaders last month and asked that the House and the Senate hold \"immediate hearings to assess the national security implications of Mr. Trump's dismissals.\"\n\nHouse Republicans are facing voters angry about Musk's assault on the federal bureaucracy at town hall gatherings around the country, a hint of a growing backlash.\n\nJim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor, was critical last month of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on cars and components from Mexico and Canada, saying they \"will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen.\"\n\nTrump made good on that threat and imposed 25% tariffs this past week on all products from Canada and Mexico. But after a conference call Wednesday with executives from the three largest automakers, including Farley, Trump said he would pause tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico for one month.\n\nLevitsky said he had some hope. The United States, he said, has a \"wealthy and diverse opposition,\" and rather than outright authoritarianism, there could be \"a slow and gradual slide into a gray area.\"\n\nAs he put it, \"no democracy this old or this rich has ever broken down.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The silence grows louder every day.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/people-are-going-silent-fearing-retribution-trump-critics-muzzle-themselves/article_4177741d-4895-5cb1-a54b-9e6f39b7bd5a.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 18:08:49","author":"Elisabeth Bumiller,North Adams Pride","authors":["Elisabeth Bumiller","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":298124792,"title":"Tim Walz says he and Harris were too ‘safe’ during 2024 presidential campaign","text":"Tim Walz has said he and Kamala Harris were too “safe” during their 2024 election campaign, with the former vice-presidential candidate claiming they should have held more in-person events around the US.\n\n“We shouldn’t have been playing this thing so safe,” Walz, the governor of Minnesota, said in an interview with Politico, as Democrats seek to learn the lessons of Donald Trump’s win in November, which has sent the party into the political wilderness.\n\nWalz, who was widely seen as one of the Democratic party’s most effective messengers against Trump and Vance in 2024, becoming best-known for his frequent description of the pair as “weird”, also said he and Harris had been hampered by the shortened length of their campaign.\n\nHarris effectively became the official Democratic party nominee on 5 August, just three months before the election, and Walz said that limited the amount of risks the campaign was able to take.\n\n“These are things you might have been able to get your sea legs, if you will, 18 months out, where the stakes were a lot lower,” Walz said.\n\nHe added: “[But] after you lose, you have to go back and assess where everything was at, and I think that is one area, that is one area we should think about.”\n\nWalz’s verdict was that he and Harris should have spent more time directly engaging with Americans, as they sprinted through their 107-day campaign.\n\n“I think we probably should have just rolled the dice and done the town halls, where [voters] may say: ‘You’re full of shit, I don’t believe in you,’” he told Politico. “I think there could have been more of that.”\n\nWalz has been returning to the national spotlight of late, conducting more TV appearances and last week headlining a fundraising event in front of 1,000 Democrats in his home state. His use of social media, and folksy appearances in TV interviews, were praised during the early party of the 2024 campaign, and Walz suggested he and Harris could have done more.\n\nHe told Politico that Democrats “as a party are more cautious” in engaging with mainstream and non-traditional media. The former high school football coach added: “In football parlance, we were in a prevent defense [a strategy whereby a team focuses on a gritty defense, rather than attacking], to not lose – when we never had anything to lose, because I don’t think we were ever ahead.”\n\nHarris and Walz lost to Trump by 312 electoral college votes to 226, losing in the national vote by about 1.5%. Republicans also won both houses of Congress. Walz said he bears some of the blame for the loss, because “when you’re on the ticket and you don’t win, that’s your responsibility”.\n\nThe 2028 Democratic presidential primary is expected to be extremely crowded, with Democrats boasting several high-profile governors, and Walz, who is yet to decide whether he will run for a third term as Minnesota governor, was coy about whether he would run, telling Politico he was “not saying no”.\n\n“I’m staying on the playing field to try and help because we have to win,” Walz said. “And I will always say this: I will do everything in my power [to help], and as I said, with the vice-presidency, if that was me, then I’ll do the job.”","summary":"Former vice-presidential candidate claims pair should have held more in-person events around the US\n\nTim Walz has said he and Kamala Harris were too “safe” during their 2024 election campaign, with the former vice-presidential candidate claiming they should have held more in-person events around the US.\n\n“We shouldn’t have been playing this thing so safe,” Walz, the governor of Minnesota, said in an interview with Politico, as Democrats seek to learn the lessons of Donald Trump’s win in November, which has sent the party into the political wilderness.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/tim-walz-2024-presidential-campaign","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f42b076ac16a8a3513b4f7a4a2a22b42a46cd9/0_283_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 17:59:15","author":"Adam Gabbatt","authors":["Adam Gabbatt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":298119444,"title":"Obama strategist's blunt advice to Gavin Newsom over right-wing podcast backlash","text":"Barack Obama's former political guru gave California Governor Gavin Newsom some blunt advice after he received backlash from an appearance on a conservative podcast. \n\nNewsom, 57, sat down with right-wing influencer, Charlie Kirk, for the first episode of his new podcast This is Gavin Newsom, which was released on Thursday. \n\nDuring the 90-minute chat, the Democratic governor declared transgender athletes participating in women's sports was 'deeply unfair' - breaking away from the traditional liberal standpoint on the issue. \n\nLike many people, strategist David Axelrod saw this shift as politically motivated and a clear attempt by Newsom to gain more of a footing with conservative voters.\n\n'If I was giving the governor advice, I'd say: \"Don't be so overt that people can see the wheels turning.\"' \n\n'When did you have this epiphany?' Axelrod also asked while he was a panelist on CNN's Source with Kaitlain Collins. 'And the answer is when he found that Republicans could weaponize the issue.' \n\nThe former advisor to Obama believed Newsom was using the episode as a way to 'stake out that territory on that issue.' \n\n'And let's be honest, this isn't a new tactic,' he criticized. 'It was clear what he was doing, he just didn't do it very artfully.'\n\nKaren Finney, who was a senior advisor to Hillary Clinton, called Newsom's move a 'gimmick.' \n\n'The thirstiness is dripping off him,' she told CNN. 'Just stop it, it's gross... Why are you sitting with Charlie Kirk and taking potshots at the VP [Kamala Harris]?' \n\nDuring the interview, Kirk asked Newsom: 'Would you say no men in female sports?'\n\nNewsom replied: 'Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.\n\nKirk challenged him to call out the case of AB Hernandez, a high school trans athlete dominating women's long jump and triple jump in California.\n\nNewsom avoided that case but said he agreed with Kirk's overall stance that it was unfair for women to compete with an athlete born a man.\n\nBut he went on to say that it was important to ensure that vulnerable communities were protected.\n\n'There's also humility and grace...that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well,' he said.\n\n'So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think, you know, is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?'\n\nNewsom is widely expected to run for president in 2028. And he has shown a willingness to engage with conservatives and appear on Fox News as he dissects the wreckage of the Democrats' 2024 election campaign.\n\nIn the first episode of Kirk's podcast, he admitted that Democrats simply could not compete with the reach of Trump and Elon Musk right now.\n\n'We're toast,' he said.\n\nHis new show is designed to bring him together with people on the opposing side. And he promised to interview architects of the MAGA movement.\n\nAxelrod also revealed in a separate CNN interview the 'very odd' moment Vice President JD Vance contradicted the president during Trump's Zelensky meltdown that no one seemed to clock.\n\nHe pointed out that during yesterday's heated Oval Office showdown, Vance said Russia invaded Ukraine - with Axelrod admitting: 'That's something that the president won't say.'\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Alexrod let out a large sigh before he revealed the sound bite that 'caught his ear' and said it marked a rare time that Vance publicly spoke against the president.\n\n'He was trying to make a point that Ukraine had a lot at stake in trying to end the war, but in making the point, he actually contradicted the president who refuses to say that same,' he said.\n\n'The one thing I think people have missed that kind of caught my ear,' he told CNN's Dana Bash. '[It] was [how] Vance began by saying that Russia had invaded Ukraine and destroyed much of the country, that's something that the President of the United States won't say.'\n\nObama's former advisor went on to label Vance the 'provocateur' of the day.\n\nAxelrod also said Vance went against 'the spirit' of the United Nations vote earlier this week in which the US sided with authoritarian regimes - which included Russia, North Korea, Belarus and Hungary - by opposing a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine.\n\n'So that was very odd to me,' he added, and said the peace talks 'got very nasty very fast.","summary":"Gavin Newsom sat down with right-wing influencer, Charlie Kirk, for the first episode of his podcast, where the liberal admitted he thought transgender athletes in women's sports was 'unfair.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14476641/obama-strategist-david-axelrod-advice-gavin-newsom-podcast-backlash.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/08/16/95983843-0-image-m-74_1741452918396.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 17:34:47","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":298145676,"title":"5 Reasons You Should Be Reading GNR Every Day + a poll - March 8 GNR","text":"GoodNewsRoundup started posting bracing, hard news diaries in 2017 and hasn’t stopped doing this work ever since. \n\nGood Day, Gnuville! I am sitting in for Goodie today, but I feel like a Saturday without GoodNewsRoundup is a lesser Saturday. So, my plan for today is to treat you to plenty of Goodie’s inimitable writing and show you why I think the GNR is essential resistance reading. \n\nDaily Kos member, GoodNewsRoundup, started posting GNRs back in 2017, when a lot of us were still reeling from the shock of the 2016 election. The combination of pep talks and solid news stories showing that people were doing stuff to fight back against the first maladministration (45) took me by surprise. The pep talks were great (and really did pep me up 😁) but I wondered, “Why weren’t these encouraging news stories more prominent in the media?”\n\nI started to look for the little green shoots peeking up out of the snow, because even on days when the front page was plastered with headlines screaming outrage, gloom and doom, the GNR invariably contained hard news items that I had not seen before. Chances are you were missing a lot of good news, too.\n\nStories about lawsuits filed, or judges’ opinions in our favor. Stories about state legislatures passing laws to protect voting rights or vulnerable people. Stories about cities figuring out ways to help its citizens in the face of federal attacks from the maladministration. Stories about civil servants who were holding the line against the right wing onslaught.\n\nI noticed that no matter what was going on — and sometimes really shitty stuff was going on — reading the GNR would help me stay even-keeled. It proved every single day that there are lots of people fighting for a better world. It gave me the information I needed to get involved myself in a way that suits my abilities.\n\nGoodie has continued this work since May of 2017. They wrote every day at first (while working full time and raising a family, too!), and soon other writers began to step up to take a day here and there and eventually regularly. The original GoodNewsRoundup (aka “Goodie”) still writes nearly every week on Saturdays and often writes other diaries on special topics. A stable of writers now covers the other 6 days of the week, and each person brings their own take to the news.\n\nLet me invite you to check out the daily GNR. Here are 5 good reasons why you should do it!\n\n1. GNRs cut through the excuses and bullsh*t\n\nYou can rely on GNR writers to sift through the spin and the obfuscation ( I am pretty sure that’s a fancy way to say bullish*t). For example, check out Goodie’s take on the oligarchs’ kowtowing to wannabe king, Donald the Indolent: \n\nThere has been a lot of talk about how Bezos and other billionaire media assholes were a part of “obeying in advance” because they were afraid of Trump. \n\nBillionaires are not afraid of trump — they were (and are) afraid of Harris because she and Biden did what no other president has been able to do — they shrank the income gap. They empowered workers. They created a jobs environment where ordinary people had power to say no to awful job. They supported unions. They closed tax loopholes. They hired IRS agents to go after rich people who don’t pay taxes.\n\nWhen rich assholes capitulate to trump it isn’t because they are afraid of him — he is pathetic; already a lame duck before his term even starts! Even his most MAGA of congressional reps defied him this week!\n\nNo, no one is really afraid of that loser. \n\nWhat they are afraid of is the very real change that Biden and Harris were bringing and that \nHarris would have kept bringing. Change that is good for Americans and America and bad for them.\n\nIt is why they buried news of it and spent years on the (shocking) news that Biden is old.\n\nBut the good news, for us, is that people will see how pathetic republicans are and how unable to govern and lead they are. Hell, they have already starter showing that off and trump isn’t even in office!\n\nI am full of hope for what we can protect, and elect, and do in these next few years and the amazing victory that we can have after this administration.\n\nI am not naive. I know how awful he is. I know there will be losses and frustrations and heartbreaking bad.\n\nBut I also know that we will fight. We will organize. We will win.\n\n- Billionaires Didn't Obey in Advance Because of Fear of Trump - It Was Fear of Biden and Harris: GNR December 21, 2024.\n\n2. GNRs help us keep a balanced, steady perspective\n\nAnother problem with spin and bleed/lead outrage cycles in the news, is that it gets people riled up and/or panicky. That’s not good for clear thinking, planning/strategizing and effective protest. Preventing clear thinking seems to be the goal of the fascists and their media arms (now including much of the MSM). However, if we can keep our heads and not be manipulated by the firehose of sh*t they spew, we can more effectively resist. GNRs help with that.\n\nHere’s Goodie:\n\nThe headline today is taken from the amazing Jay Michaelson. Here is more from him:\n\nShock and Awe is up to YOU. I am not shocked, I am not in awe. \n\nJust like we should not obey in advance, we should not panic in advance either.\n\nThis is not the end of democracy. That is just what the bad guys want you to think.\n\nGet over it and fight.\n\nThis is not to minimize how awful Trump and his administration are. They are the worst and the things that they are doing are hurting real people and doing real harm.\n\nI am sharing those words to discourage the catastrophizing and panicking and despair that I am seeing from way too many people. \n\nKNOW THIS: He is weaker than you think. We are stronger than you think.\n\nWith hard work, we can get through this. There will be damage. There will be harm. But we can do what we can to minimize much of it and we can get to the other side of this.\n\nIn the meantime, find ways to help (more on this at the bottom of this article). Take breaks when you need them. Find community. Keep love and hope in your heart. Don’t let them steal your kindness and your humanity. \n\nRemember who the enemy is — it isn’t people on our side who are more to the left than you. It isn’t people on our side who are more to the right of you. It isn’t the Democratic party. It isn’t people who didn’t do enough in the past or who were tricked to believe that staying home was the right thing to do for the election. Who is the only real enemy? The people trying to dismantle all that is good about our country.\n\nAnd if you allow yourself to get distracted and spend your precious and beautiful energy fighting ANYONE other than Trump and his crew, then you are actually doing him a favor. You are doing his work.\n\nAnd good lord, I KNOW that is the last thing that you want to do!\n\nBecause when we make calls and march and work to get great people elected and help the vulnerable and protect our planet and support people filing lawsuits, WE WIN. Everyone wins. \n\nStay kind. Stay focused. Stay outraged. Stay strong.\n\nI love you all. \n\n- Shock and Awe is up to YOU. I am not shocked, I am not in awe. GNR February 8, 2025.\n\n3. GNRs show how much power we have as individuals and as a collective\n\nI think, to a great extent, this crisis in which we find ourselves is the result of psychological warfare waged upon us by the fascist right wingers in collusion with our foreign adversaries (mainly Putin). \n\nUnfortunately, we do have psychological vulnerabilities as a species. These vulnerabilities were actually strengths, evolutionarily speaking (tribalism and conformity helped survival, for example), but they can be used by expert manipulators to cause us to damage ourselves by pitting us against one another.\n\nSocial sciences have studied human social behavior (including anti-social behavior), and we understand how some of this works. Still, like nearly everything else about messaging to the masses, we need reminders about what psychological forces are at work, so we can guard against the malign use of our more primitive reactions.\n\nGNRs help to remind us about our strengths AND weaknesses. That helps arm us. And since these reactions are usually unconscious and involuntary, we must make conscious efforts to resist them. That takes constant reminders. As GNR writer chloris creator often says, “repetition is good”. I would add that repetition is essential for us to effectively fight this kind of psychological warfare.\n\nHere’s Goodie:\n\nSocial Psychologist Phil Zimbardo famously said, “All evil begins with 15 volts” in reference to the infamous Milgram electric shock experiments where he found that ordinary Americans would give life threatening electric shocks to a stranger if told to do so by an authority figure.\n\nBefore Milgram ran his original study, he asked experts, students, and ordinary citizens how they thought people would react. Would people give another participant a shock of 300 volts – a point at which the other participant had already been screaming in pain and begging to stop? of course not. Every single person who Milgram asked said that no one would go that far — certainly they would never do that! — and yet every single participant in Milgram’s original study did go to 300 volts. And 2/3 of Milgram’s participants went to 450 volts. (Many people learn about the 67% who went to 450. Fewer know about the 100% who went to 300. You can read about it on the Milgram study Wikipedia Page)\n\nWhy did they give that inhumane level of shock? Because the study began with 15 volts. The first shock was just 15 volts – a minor shock. And then each shock increased by only 15 more volts. Each shock was only a little worse, and so participants got used to the increase slowly – what was inhumane became normal. Only the most sadistic among us would start with 300 volts, but all of us have the ability to get used to evil; to get used to cruelty; to get used to inhumanity.\n\nAnd that is what is threatening to happen now. This onslaught of cruelty, inhumanity corruption, and indifference. Each of these is a tick of 15 volts. Dehumanizing trans children. Attacking immigrants. Killing people who depend on USAID. It is where we will end – what our 450 volts will be - that worries all of us.\n\nLuckily there is something that can fight that tick tick tick of volts: a dissenter.\n\nIn Milgram's studies (he followed up that famous original with many more), when participants saw others refuse to comply, they also refused. Milgram wrote \"given social support, most subjects refused to continue to administer shocks, suggesting that social solidarity serves as a kind of a defense against destructive obedience to authority.\"\n\nIn fact, other researchers have found that one lone dissenter can reduce the conformity of others by 80%.\n\nWhen everyone is staying quiet and moving on with their lives and getting used to the ticks of conformity and inhumanity, one dissenter, one lone person willing to speak up and say “No. Enough. Not on my watch” is enough to change behavior.\n\nAnd even more powerful — when multiple people refuse to give in. Multiple people can change the norms.\n\nWhen we are brave and stand up against evil up we can give other good people, with just a little less courage, the boost they need to add their voices.\n\nWe can bring that voltage down.\n\nThe more people who stand up and refuse to be moved — refuse to accept the terrible — the more courage all people will have. Being brave will make other people brave.\n\nRemember, being brave doesn’t mean that you are not afraid. It means acting despite the fear.\n\nAnd this is where I feel the most hope and the most upbeat than I have felt in eight years. Because something special and strong and loving and fierce is building. I feel it all around me in people who follow a lot of politics and people who normally don’t. Yes, people are distressed and worried and overwhelmed but they are also motivated. They are not giving up. They are fighting and they want others to fight with them.\n\nOur movement hasn’t found its final shape yet but it is strong and loud and determined and kind and angry — all at once. I haven’t seen anything like this in my life — including in the first Trump years.\n\nThere is no minimizing the terrible damage that trump and musk are doing to our country and the world. But there is also no minimizing us and our ability to protect as many people as we can — together.\n\nThe biggest enemies we have are not trump and musk (although they are awful). Our biggest enemies are defeatism and acceptance and cowardice. But we can defeat those.\n\nEach one of us, in our own little (and sometimes big) ways can maintain kindness and caring and fight like hell against evil.\n\nWe can do this. And we will.\n\nI always bet on us. And I never lose.\n\n- This is How We Beat Evil! ____________________ GNR February 15, 2025.\n\n4. GNRs are good for your mental health\n\nPerhaps the most important benefit of the GNRs is that they really do help improve your mental health. \n\nIn a world gone bananas, the captured news media only increases the madness. We need to limit our exposure just to be able to sleep at night (which hopefully you are able to do!). And yet, we need to know what is going on and most of us are desperate to hear news that shows we are not alone in this hellscape.\n\nGNRs provide that news and that evidence — constant, reliable evidence — that not only are we not alone in this hellscape, but there are millions of other people who share our values. We learn about what people are doing to put up road blocks in front of the fascists. We learn about ways that WE can join in the effort to save democracy. We discover that — far from being caught flat-footed and unprepared — Democratic institutions have been planning and preparing for this dreadful eventuality and are working to mitigate the harm and claw back power from the kleptocrats. \n\nWe learn that just because the worst people seem to be temporarily winning, it doesn’t mean that nobody is fighting back. Terrible battles of ideology, greed and malevolence are complex. It was a long time building and may take some time to defeat, but defeat these dark forces we will.\n\nFirst, GNRs help us cope with this hard reality by describing our experiences of reality in a way to which most of us can relate. We don’t mince words. It’s honest, raw and true.\n\nHere’s Goodie:\n\nI’m angry. A lot. More than I would like. Furious, really.\n\nMostly, I am angry at Trump and the people who surround him.\n\nAs much as I don’t like to let anger overtake me, it is really hard not to be angry. \n\nI find it impossible to know what they are doing and not feel furious.\n\nI try to remind myself that MLK felt anger. He was filled with rage. But what he did with that anger was what mattered. Rather than letting the anger turn to hatred, he reminded himself that he was angry because of his love for people. He reminded himself that his anger came from love. And he took his righteous anger and turned it into action. \n\nSo, that seems as good a reason as any to feel ok about this unavoidable anger.\n\nAt the same time, I am trying to keep the target of my anger where it belongs.\n\nI was speaking to a colleague who was furious at our institution for not doing more to protect students, staff, and faculty at this time. \n\nI’ve also seen people furious with Democratic leaders who aren’t doing enough.\n\nI’ve see fury with people who didn’t vote.\n\nI’ve seen fury with Biden for getting out of the race and/or not getting out quickly enough.\n\nand I, myself, have felt furious at people who didn’t do as much as I did to try to get Kamala elected. And, if I am being honest, that is an awful lot of people to be mad at. \n\nThis anger worries me, because it isn’t where our anger should be focused. I saw this quote by Peter Sagal and agree with it:\n\nxMay I suggest something radical? Have mercy on people. Even on here. What’s happening is unprecedented, so politicians, journalists, public servants etc are doing their best to adjust. Not doing exactly what you think they should doesn’t mean they’re giving up or giving in.— Peter Sagal (@petersagal.bsky.social) 2025-01-29T14:59:57.233Z\n\nHave mercy on people.\n\nRecognize that just because they aren’t doing what you think they should be doing, doesn’t mean that they aren’t fighting and on our side.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t push politicians to do what you want. It doesn’t mean blind acceptance.\n\nBut it does mean that we have to work together. And it does mean that we have to show one another grace.\n\nAnd, mostly, it means that we need to keep our eyes on the prize and remember who the real enemy is.\n\nBecause that is the only way that we win.\n\n- Be Angry. But Be Angry At The Right People: GNR February 1, 2025.\n\nMental Health (continued)\n\nSecond, GNRs offer us a guide for how to process these experiences. We need to be able to understand how the cycles of outrage and grief are an integral part of the psychological warfare and how to interrupt the cycle so that we can continue the necessary work to overcome fascism and restore democracy.\n\nHere’s Goodie again: \n\nThings are awful.\n\nThat is going to sound like a really weird way for me to start a Good News Roundup.\n\nFirst, because I usually spent the entire GNR trying to show you how things aren’t that bad.\n\nSecond, because I don’t actually think anyone has rose colored glasses on. I know you know this is bad.\n\nYou read the news. And you believe it — because you are rational and informed people. You read it and you are horrified — because you are rational and informed and kind people. You feel awful. You see how super bad this is.\n\nAnd then, hopefully, you find ways to distract yourself with your LIFE. Because our lives are a gift and letting go of all the joy and love and fun and wonder in life is not what ANY of us should be doing. So the moving away from the trump news and living our lives is GOOD. Bravo. Keep giving yourself time to just live.\n\nBUT then next time you read about something else that trump has done that is awful, it feels like a stomach punch. It hurts just as bad. You feel a return of the dread and worry and awfulness. You feel it all over again. You are newly bowled over with how awful this is and you are worried and maybe even on the verge of panic.\n\nAnd that is what I want to help you stop. And, oddly, I think that comes from really truly accepting that this is awful and terrible and scary and wrong. \n\nOnce you accept this as reality it no longer has the power to emotionally destroy you.\n\nIt doesn’t mean you bathe in it. It doesn’t mean you don’t take breaks about it.\n\nit definitely doesn’t mean not fighting against it — it actually means the opposite. When we fully accept how awful it is, we also accept that we have no choice BUT to fight.\n\nAnd accepting how bad this is does not mean ignoring all the good things that are happening every day. I have plenty of those below. There are lots. We are amazing. I’ll give you LOTS of reasons to be hopeful below.\n\nAccepting how bad this is does not mean letting go of hope. I both see how bad this is AND am full of hope that we can, eventually, reclaim our country.\n\nSo why come to terms with how bad this is?\n\nBecause when you truly come to terms with how awful this is then every reminder of it doesn’t injure you afresh. Because you already know. You know they are awful and do awful things. It isn’t a repeated gut punch every time because you know this is the reality and you are focused on fighting back.\n\nThis is essential because you need to protect yourself from repeated psychological injury. They want you overwhelmed. They want you constantly injured. Don’t give it to them.\n\nAccepting it is easier when you know you are not alone. When you know how strong we are. When you know that we can’t protect everything, but we can protect a lot. And we will. And we are.\n\nThey suck. Don’t let them destroy you every time the suck anew.\n\nAccepting it means you take that power from them.\n\nYou are not alone. You are braver than you know. We are in this together and we are amazing.\n\nThey are awful and they will do awful things and those awful things will have awful consequences.\n\nBut their cravenness is not a sign of strength — it is weakness.\n\nAnd they are underestimating us. They think that they can destroy us with their evil. That we will be so overwhelmed that we will quit.\n\nBut we won’t.\n\nWe know this is bad. We know they are hurting real people. We know things are less safe.\n\nAnd those facts make us more dedicated to winning. They make us angry and they kick up our empathy for those being hurt. They give us more fire.\n\nThey are underestimating us. And that is a big mistake.\n\n- I am FULL of HOPE and COURAGE. HERE IS WHY: GNR February 22, 2025.\n\n🙂😁 Oh, and last but never least — GNRs will make you smile and even laugh! 😊😃\n\n5. GNRs bring you hard news that is also good news, and the information you need to do something to save democracy.\n\nBest of all, in the tradition that Goodie started back in 2017, the GNRs bring you good, solid news stories that maybe you didn’t see in the 3-senstational-stories-cycle of MSM or the 1-big-outrage-story-of-the-day of many cable and alternative news sources.\n\nGNRs bring you news about what Democrats are doing to fight back against Republican assaults on our rights and freedoms. It isn’t true that Dems are “doing nothing”. What is true is that the usual news sources are not reporting it. It isn’t the message or the activity that is all wrong, it is the media messengers who are picking the wrong things to highlight.\n\nGNRs bring good news about climate action, social justice, legal action, politics, and human thriving.\n\nWe also bring you news from the schadenfreude files, because sometimes it just feels better to know that some of the worst people are getting their just desserts.\n\nSome of the writers bring jokes, humor, history, music, animal stories and much more just for fun!\n\nGNR writers search for the important news that’s flying under the radar. These stories are often reported in MSM and alternative news sites yet rarely get the play that more sensational stories receive. But they are consequential stories and are having just as much impact on reality, even if peoples’ perception of reality is being warped by bad media coverage.\n\nWe can help change that perception by helping to spread the news that needs to be seen and heard.\n\n6. Bonus Reason — the Comments!\n\nThe GNR commentariat is the best thing on the internet. You may think I am biased, but this is just a fact. 😊\n\nWIneRev (who is also a GNR writer one Wednesday every month!) gives us a history corner in the comments each day which is fun and enlightening. Progressive Muse keeps us posted on Postcards to Voters campaigns, T Maysle provides extra news bits that nearly always surprise… just to name a few faithful regulars. There’s a whole cast of commenters who make the GNR comments section the best comment section on the internet. \n\nFunny, smart, and often adding to our knowledge with news bits from around the country (and around the world), our commenters elevate GNRs to next level of community, which is also great for our mental health. It’s a joy to behold and well worth taking the extra time to read!\n\n⚡️ Lightning RoundUp ⚡️\n\n⚡️ Why We Lost and Why We Will Win: GNR, Goodie (GoodNewsRoundup), December 14, 2024.\n\n⚡️ How Do Dems Save the Country and Their Party?

Tester, who lost to former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy in that race, declared on HBO’s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" that the woke politics embraced by the top of the ticket are what crushed his performance in the state. \"And the top of the ticket did not perform because I don’t think the top of the ticket embraced the issues that Americans were talking about,\" he said. \"We got wrapped up in all the cancel culture crap.\" 13-YEAR-OLD CANCER SURVIVOR EARNS STANDING OVATION AS HE BECOMES SECRET SERVICE AGENT DURING TRUMP SPEECH Tester had served three terms as the Democratic U.S. Senator in Montana, which has consistently voted for the Republican presidential candidate for decades. The ex-senator has taken a more moderate stance on issues during his time in the Senate, openly breaking with the Biden-Harris administration on several issues throughout the years. The Democrat also withheld an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris after she became the party's nominee. Both Maher and Tester agreed on the need for the Democratic Party to abandon its far-left leanings and \"court the center\" as the best way to rebuild and present an alternative to the GOP under Trump. He said, \"Yeah, you go to the place where the people are, and that way those disenfranchised Republicans have a place to land because they don’t think the other party’s crazy.\" Tester added, \"And if they’re able to do that, and you do that by talking about common sense stuff that people deal with every day.\" PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONCLUDES REMARKS AFTER DECLARING 'AMERICA'S MOMENTUM IS BACK' Maher then asked Tester why a more moderate Democratic lawmaker like him couldn’t win his election.

And the truth is the top of the ticket has to at least be competitive if you’re gonna win in a red state or even a purple state.\" In 2024, Donald Trump won Montana by 20 points, 58 percent to 38 percent. Sheehy beat Tester by seven points, 52 percent to 45 percent.

Three-fourths of the state’s communities, comprising as much as 25% of the state’s population, aren’t even on the state’s road system. As such, it is expensive to stock its grocery shelves. Americans may complain about high grocery prices, but Alaskans, in particular, face even bigger bills.\n\n“As an example, [Mike Jones, an economics professor at the University of Alaska-Anchorage,] said a half gallon of milk that would cost about $2.80 in Anchorage or Fairbanks could cost about $6 in rural communities, particularly in the west and southwest,” according to The Shelby Report, which covers the supermarket industry. “Infant formula that would cost about $18 in Anchorage could cost up to $30 for the same size in the rural areas. A five-pound bag of rice, priced at $5 in Anchorage could cost closer to $15 in many rural communities.”\n\nAccording to the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the U.S. city average for a gallon of whole milk is around $4. Half gallons aren’t half the cost; the math isn’t that simple. But generally speaking, and especially once you get out of the bigger Alaskan cities, groceries are extremely expensive. \n\nIn 2024, 55% of Alaska’s voters backed Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who received 41%. \n\nIn 2025, Trump decided to pick a fight with Canada for no logical reason at all. And the thing is, no matter how insulting Trump and his minions are toward Canada, our friends to the north are not powerless to deliver serious retaliatory pain. \n\nTake British Columbia, the land gateway from the lower 48 states to Alaska, for example.\n\n“British Columbia is hitting back at economic threats from the United States by introducing tools to impose fees on U.S. truck traffic travelling through the province on the way to Alaska,” reported the Canadian Broadcast Company. “Premier David Eby said the tolls may not be used, but warned that Canada needs to have tools available to fight the threat of tariffs coming from President Donald Trump until he backs down from his plans altogether.”\n\nThis action would come on top of already enacted provisions like “removing alcohol from Republican-leaning states from B.C. Liquor Store shelves, de-prioritizing U.S. contractors on government contract bids, and fast-tracking the process through which energy and resource projects are vetted for approval in order to improve the province's self-reliance and trade relationships with other nations,” according to the CBC.\n\nIn response, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, victim-blamed Canada like an asshole.\n\n“My hope is that the federal governments between our two great countries work out solutions to the tariff issues, and provincial and state governments refrain from making unilateral decisions that may have negative consequences that negatively impact discussions at the federal level as they find solutions,” he told the Alaska Beacon. \n\nAnd a Republican Alaska lawmaker whose day job is trucking sounded the dire warning. “It’s going to be a big deal for two things,” he said to the Alaska Beacon. “Fresh produce—the vast majority of our fresh produce … for most of Alaska gets trucked up. The other major issue that I could see is with the oil industry. If you want to get something up here fast, you put it on a truck, not a barge.”\n\nThe executive director of the Alaska Trucking Association was equally alarmed, saying, “Such measures will significantly increase transportation costs, disrupt supply chains, and raise prices for essential goods that Alaskans rely on. … We strongly urge provincial policymakers to maintain the great relationships and commonalities they share with Alaska while our federal governments work towards solutions to avoid tariffs.”\n\nAlaska Republicans could show kinship with Canada by standing with their neighbor against Trump’s dangerous belligerence. They could blast Trump’s efforts and call out just how much it would hurt regular Alaskans. \n\nBut nah, better to chastise B.C.’s provincial government for standing up for their rights? \n\nOh well. Fuck around and find out, right?","summary":"Alaska is big and divorced from the contiguous 48 states.

Because publisher Bezos had the horrific idea to publish some conservative opinion on the Post Op-Ed pages. Leading to headlines like this one from the Times: \n\nBezos Orders Washington Post Opinion Section to Embrace ‘Personal Liberties and Free Markets’\n\nDavid Shipley, The Post’s opinion editor, is resigning after trying to persuade Jeff Bezos to reconsider the new direction. \n\nOne could go on and on with similar headlines. The central point is clear: The American Left despises free speech and wants to silence it, whether in the Washington Post or anywhere else where disagreement over an issue that is a favorite of the Left surfaces.\n\nWe'll have to see if the Bezos order is actually followed. Last year, the Post didn't formally endorse Kamala, but the editorial board kept slamming Trump as the worst possible choice, so there was no doubt where they stood. \n\nMove away from journalism in Washington and head north to New York City. There, on the leftist-filled campuses of Columbia and Barnard universities, one headline after another tells the tale of leftist pro-Palestinian students trying to shut down the free speech of pro-Israel students.

It could be leftists at prestigious American universities. Heaven knows the arena where this obsession with suppressing a dissenting (conservative?) point of view will surface.\n\nBut at this point, make no mistake. Surface it will. And the answer to this anti-free speech mania from the Left, whether inside a major American newspaper, an Ivy League university or anywhere else, is for believers in free speech to stand up and speak out.\n\nBeing quiet is not an option.","summary":"The New York Times can’t seem to make up its mind on the First Amendment.\n\nHere is the Times promoting censorious Andrew Marantz on the subject of free speech in 2019: \n\n\nFree Speech Is Killing Us\n\nNoxious language online is causing real-world violence.

Trump’s Seizing Their Reins.","text":"Amid all of Donald Trump’s power grabs over the past six weeks, one little-noticed executive order may in the long run have the largest impact on the viability of the country’s democratic system of governance.\n\nThe February 18 order, misleadingly titled, “Ensuring Accountability For All Agencies,” claims to prevent government agencies from going off on a tear creating policies that stand in conflict to the agenda of the country’s elected leadership. In reality, however, it represents a vast power grab by the executive branch of government, essentially giving the president and the Department of Justice exclusive power to decide whether regulations are in line with political priorities, and to impose draconian presidential controls over agencies that were set up by Congress to be independent.\n\nThe executive order’s text gives the game away:\n\nIt shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.\n\nIn other words, if Trump opposes a regulation, that regulation goes out the window.\n\nThe order states that, “The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies,” and goes on to say: “Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans … to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization.” In other words, independent agencies will no longer be independent but will instead be ruled over by political commissars, their every action now scrutinized to make sure they are ideologically sympatico to the aims of the MAGA movement.\n\nTwo of the agencies subject to this new system are the Federal Election Commission (FEC) — a historically bipartisan, six-member organization that helps to set ground rules for how elections are run and financed — and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which, among other things, controls access to the country’s airwaves.\n\nTrump has been angling for control of both of these agencies since the start of his administration. In late January, he attempted to fire Ellen Weintraub, the Democratic chair of the FEC. The firing would have broken a 3-3 GOP/Democratic tie on the commission, and it would also have marked the first time that a president had removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party and not nominated in their place a candidate selected by that party’s congressional leadership.\n\nWeintraub pushed back, arguing that the president had no legal authority to fire her and that she wasn’t going to leave her job. On X, the FEC chair posted a copy of the dismissal letter she had received from Trump and then wrote that she wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nAs of this writing, the FEC still lists Weintraub as chair. She has become one of the few high-profile Trump targets in government to successfully resist his effort to push them out of their jobs. Yet, with last month’s executive order, Trump has essentially done an end run around Weintraub, and, indeed, the whole concept of a bipartisan FEC. He has claimed the power to bend the FEC to his will and essentially awarded himself, the Office of Management and Budget and the attorney general interpretative powers over whether FEC actions can go forward or not.\n\nGiven Trump’s history of rejecting election results that didn’t come out in his favor, pressuring elections officials to change vote tallies, urging noncertification of votes and currying foreign favor in his election campaigns, it’s hardly a stretch to imagine that he, or his acolytes, could put his new powers over the FEC to nefarious use in the coming election cycles.\n\nA similar sword now hangs over the Federal Communications Commission, led by MAGA follower Brendan Carr, who was coauthor of the Project 2025 report.\n\nCarr has used his time in office to threaten the broadcasting licenses of major networks, including going after CBS for its interview with Kamala Harris during the election campaign; to launch investigations into NPR and PBS, alleging that in mentioning on air who their sponsors are, they are essentially running advertisements in violation of their public mission; and to go after media companies they deem to have promoted “diversity” — despite this being a core part of the FCC mission, as detailed in the Communications Act.\n\nIn his chapter of Project 2025, Carr also stressed that there was no legal requirement — only convention — that the president defer to the minority party’s Senate leadership when selecting an FCC commissioner from the minority party. The implication was that a president could theoretically stack the commission entirely with those in favor of the president’s agenda.\n\nEven though the FCC is now headed up by MAGA loyalist Carr, that apparently is still not enough for Trump. In his impatience to acquire absolute control over a commission that has vast powers to shape the country’s broadcast and social media landscape — and, by extension, public opinion — Trump has moved to consolidate presidential power over any and every decision emanating from the FCC.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Trump explicitly threatened to yank the broadcasting licenses of the major television networks. Moreover, he has launched numerous lawsuits against major media companies and has repeatedly sought to defund public broadcasting. This environment signals clear danger of an autocratic assault on the freedom of the press.\n\nAdd into the mix the exiling of the Associated Press from White House events because of its refusal to stop calling the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of Mexico, and add in too the extraordinary move to have the White House decide which press organizations to admit into the White House press pool, and the warning signs start flashing red regarding this administration’s intentions toward media outlets that it views as not being subservient enough.\n\nThere has been, since January 20, such a flurry of executive orders that it’s easy for some to slip under the radar. The Ensuring Accountability For All Agencies order, however, is too important to get lost in all the white noise. With almost no pushback, a single executive order has concentrated a huge amount of power over critical regulatory agencies in Trump’s hands. There’s great risk that he will now misuse this power spectacularly as he seeks to consolidate his grip over the country.","summary":"A little-noticed executive order may in the long run have the largest impact on US democracy.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/independent-agencies-oversee-elections-and-media-trumps-seizing-their-reins/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2203213989-1536x1024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 15:49:23","author":"Sasha Abramsky","authors":["Sasha Abramsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":298155818,"title":"‘This Is War’: Bob Mould on Aging Indie, His Music’s Legacy, and Where the U.S. Goes From Here","text":"y his own admission, Bob Mould is not a Zoom kind of guy, at least not in terms of the video aspect. During the early months of the Covid lockdown, he passed on doing any of those briefly in-vogue virtual concerts. “People were saying, ‘Oh, come on, you could do Zoom concerts,’” he says. “And I’m like, ‘No, you don’t understand. That’s not what performing music is. Performing music is when people get together in a room and create a community.’ The idea of doing Zoom from my work room was frightening. No interest whatsoever.”\n\n And last week, when he called into Rolling Stone, Mould still wasn’t much of a Zoom guy. After expecting to have an audio exchange, he good-naturedly agrees to flip on his camera. “No worries,” he says. “You’re more modern than I am.”\n\n The Mould who pops up on screen is bespectacled and white-bearded, which befits his role as one of the elder statespeople of indie rock. Forty-six years after the launch of Hüsker Dü, the Minneapolis hardcore trio that would venture far beyond that subgenre, Mould has, as he says, “been through a lot.” Over the course of those decades, he’s dealt with the rise and flame-out of that band and saw indie became big-time alternative rock in the Nineties. Along the way, Mould stopped his own hardcore drinking, came out as a gay man, announced a farewell-to-rock tour that didn’t last, immersed himself in electronic music and DJing, wrote scripts for World Championship Wrestling, penned a memoir, and lived everywhere from New York City to Berlin.\n\n Mould has also been one of indie’s most productive music makers. His just-released Here We Go Crazy is his 15th solo album, not counting his records with Hüsker Dü and his subsequent band Sugar. Working once more with bassist Jason Narducy and drummer Jon Wurster, his regular rhythm section since the early 2010s, Mould has blasted out another collection of alternatively tormented and guardedly optimistic rants and raves.\n\n Now based in San Francisco, with occasional retreats to the Southern California desert, Mould admits to feeling somewhat more settled these days. “I’m pretty content with life,” says Mould, who married his partner, Don Fisher, in 2023. But he’s also had to cope with the recent deaths of colleagues like producer Steve Albini, the Replacements’ Slim Dunlap, and especially his Hüsker Dü bandmate Grant Hart, who died of liver cancer in 2017. Last year, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz confirmed his Hüsker Dü fandom, a brief see-a-little-light moment before Kamala Harris and Walz’s loss. And Mould is now dealing with a rattling post-election world that could easily target same-sex marriages like his.\n\n “It’s been sort of crazy lately,” he says. “But, you know, just trying to stay busy.” As always. \n\n When we spoke a few months ago, you were thrust somewhat into the national conversation when Beto O’Rourke tweed that he and the Democrats’ VP candidate, Tim Walz, bonded over Hüsker Dü. Tim Walz, yeah. [Sighs] What a wild day that was, to hear about the Beto O’Rourke tweet and the ensuing madness. Tim Walz seems like a super-decent guy. Minnesota has been such a leader in progressive ideas. Seemed like a good fit. Too bad things didn’t go better in the election for all of us. \n\n Did you get any MAGA blowback?No, I think I’m off their radar. Their radar seems to be malfunctioning at the moment anyway, so let’s just hope we can keep the airplanes in the sky, right?\n\n What are your feelings right now about the state of the country?It’s the end of an era, this great experiment we put together. I don’t know how we get out of this. I’m 64. I’ve seen a lot. Nothing like this. I don’t even know where to start. Every single person, whether you stand up against the MAGA movement or whether you’re part of it, you’re going to feel it, unless you’re in the very tippity, tippity top of the one percent or maybe the top two percent of income earners in America. Somebody’s going to lose their job. Somebody’s going to lose their house. People are going to lose their lives. Some people are going to lose their rights. I don’t see anybody gaining anything except the very tippity top of this scheme.\n\n I don’t want to hear about buyer’s remorse. I don’t want to hear, “Oh, you’re just exaggerating.” I don’t want to hear any of that anymore. This is beyond a five-alarm fire.\n\n As a gay man, how are you feeling, especially when same-sex marriages may be targeted as well?We knew this was coming. I’m very grateful that I live in California, where the elected leaders protect all citizens of our great state. I’m going to be probably okay to really bummed out; that’s sort of my range. A fair amount of my annual income goes to the best possible healthcare I can buy.\n\n I don’t think my life is in danger, but I feel like my rights are. My husband and I sit at the dining room table with all of the paraphernalia that ends up in our mailbox in San Francisco, talking about “yes” on this proposition, “no” on that proposition. We sit there with this 150-page book [each election], and we read through all of it, and that’s how we vote, because that’s our civic duty. For people who only get interested in politics every four years, we’ll see what you get.\n\n It’s all about whether people have the resources to fight an improper IRS audit, once all that data gets amalgamated. I feel for the people who don’t have the means to defend themselves, because when they lose the legal system, or they lose justice as recourse, a lot of people in America are going to be defenseless. \n\n Gender certainly played a role in the election.I feel most terrible for trans youth in areas outside of California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts, places where people are progressive and thoughtful and compassionate. It really hit me last September and October, when I did a solo electric tour. I played Orlando on a Saturday, then had a 650-mile drive to North Carolina. In the rental car, I had TuneIn. They can geo-locate my movements, so the ads were targeted for my location. I’m going through South Carolina, and all of a sudden I get my first exposure to the Trump trans ad campaign, which basically said, “Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you or us.” When I heard that, my heart sank, because at that moment, I feared it was going to work.\n\n What was the rest of that tour like given the election was coming up?I first played the Northeast and Midwest, so, friendly territory. I started building a monologue I would use in the middle of the show to explain my political stance, telling my story growing up in a small town in the Adirondacks, knowing I was a homosexual and that I had to move to a big city to feel safe, and then a decade of closeted life, especially in the Eighties. I would get up and tell people these things, and I would talk about getting married and how important all of that is to who I am and what I do. I just laid out my case in five to seven minutes. And each night I would end my monologue with, “And this one’s for all of you who say, ‘Shut up and play.’” And then I would play “Too Far Down” from Candy Apple Grey. I hope that monologue and that song and the contents of it would hopefully make a difference to people if there was a question about sexuality or any of that stuff.\n\n So September leads to October, and I go into the deep South: Baton Rouge, home of the Federalists, and Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis. I’m going into places that are less than friendly. I don’t have to, but I choose to include this monologue in these shows. In Atlanta, people were hooting and hollering, like “Fuck, yeah! Fuck them!” Jackson and Baton Rouge, not so much. [Laughs] I’m not knocking anybody or knocking a town, but that’s just the observation from the stage as I’m watching my congregation. It ranges from confusion to “do we really have to do this during a rock show?” to “fuck those guys.” In a couple places, it tipped more to the conservative side. And I’m a guest, right? I don’t want to start haranguing people. But I needed to show them who I am and what I do and why we’re here. Hopefully, a few people got it. \n\n How does art and music respond in a time like this?I preemptively protested with the Blue Hearts album back in September of 2020. That record was very political. It’s funny, because it sort of picked up where I left politics in the fall of 1983 [laughs], three years into the first Reagan term. Right before Zen Arcade, Hüsker Dü collectively made a decision to step away from punk politics and get more punk personal. So Blue Hearts, three years into Trump, was me revisiting that idea. So that was protest. The inner sleeve was my homage to Phil Ochs with the gun.\n\n But what is the purpose of art? I can only speak for myself. I’m getting old, but I walked seven and a half miles yesterday. So if there’s a protest, I should be able to make it. [Laughs] \n\n Hüsker Dü hit its stride during the Reagan presidency. People were using words like “fascist” then, but does that era compare to the current one?As a young kid, it was pretty shocking to me, going to a super-liberal private arts college, Macalester College, and being astonished at the sight of all these kids with suits and briefcases talking about Ronald Reagan. It was horrifying then. So it’s not without precedent. When Reagan was governor of California, right before he became president, the Moral Majority, the Anita Bryants, the Pat Robertsons and all those people, were already currying favor with the Republican Party. And Reagan made room for them at the table. And that is not unlike what’s happening now.\n\n The biggest difference, two generations later is, is communication. In the Eighties, communication was one way. You wrote an article and it was broadcast and people read it. Radio was for the most part one-way. In the early Nineties, the advent of the internet and digital compression evolved into AOL blogs and message boards and then social media, to where we are now — the algorithm as propaganda. Black-box weaponry. That’s the biggest reason we don’t recognize the world even compared to the Reagan years. They got us. We all clicked the EULA box, and they took it all, and they have it all. And now there’s a dude trying to merge what he’s got with what the other guy that’s in the UFC has got with what the IRS has got. Things that have been intentionally kept separate for centuries in our system are all now being hoarded and amalgamated by people who weren’t elected.\n\n Which part of this are people not understanding? It takes no time to destroy everything. It takes forever to build what we have, and we’re watching a handful of dudes destroy it for no good reason. \n\n Now you have an album called Here We Go Crazy. It isn’t as overly political as Blue Hearts, but did the consciousness of that record spill over into these songs? After Blue Hearts, I said my piece, and I still stand by those words; they’re appropriate today. For Here We Go Crazy, I was just trying to stay alive, trying to get back to work, spending time with my now husband. “Here We Go Crazy” was the song that brought everything together. What I’m trying to in that song is paint a picture of my new part-time life in the desert, surrounded by the mountains. It’s a very LGBTQ-friendly environment. It feels safe for now. There’s a good community there. I have a lot of quiet so I can do my work. In that song, I’m trying to convey the vastness of it, the sparseness of it. And not unlike Workbook [recorded on a farm in Minnesota], if it gets really quiet, I get a little crazy in the head. \n\n As you sing in “Sharp Little Pieces,” “The misery makes me feel alive.”Yeah, of course. [Laughs] Fortunately, I have a husband who understands this. He’s a doctor — well, a retired dentist — who’s smart enough say, “You’re just in there doing your work, aren’t you?”\n\n What fueled “Neanderthal”?With that drum intro, I just started thinking, “This is so dumb. This is so primal.” I use “Neanderthal” as shorthand for knucklehead. The knucklehead is me as a kid, not being particularly sensitive and being, “Fight, fight, fight.” Growing up in a violent house, I was always sort of ready for something, ready for violence, ready for everything I knew to get turned upside down in an instant. The second part of the song is me making fun of myself, like, “Yeah, I’m wild, crazy rocker. Oops. I’m in my 60s!” [Laughs] I’m just poking fun at my early self and my current self.\n\n I thought it might have been a shot at Trumpers.If the fascist tattoo fits, wear it, right?… The first four or five songs, there’s a lot of uncertainty. Then the sixth, seventh, and eighth songs, we’re going dark, like “How did I end up in this situation?” The top of side two is “Lost or Stolen,” a really dark song. That’s in that [sequencing] spot — look at my blueprint, like “Thumbtack” [at the start of the second half of 1996’s Bob Mould]. “Lost or Stolen” is heavy, a lot of old-school addiction, a lot of modern addiction.\n\n Addiction is weird these days. When I was growing up, my father was an alcoholic. I was an alcoholic. I am an alcoholic. I’ve come close to addiction with drugs, but have managed to stay back from it, knowing that I’m an alcoholic. I started drinking every day when I was 13. I stopped that when I was 25, but that was a quite spectacular run of about 5,000 straight days of being drunk. [Laughs] \n\n But in the new world, you and I could be sitting having a conversation at a coffee shop, and I could be getting ready to end my life because I just lost everything on a gaming site, and you wouldn’t even know. Whereas if you were sitting across from me and I had a dope problem or a drinking problem, you’d see it. The black piece of glass [holds up his cell phone] is the worst addiction. It’s a dopamine machine for all of us.\n\n Thinking of an album like an LP, with sides one and two, is very old school. You still conceive album sequences that way?Absolutely. To me, the construction of a record is when the tent pole appears. I have to make a tent and have these four corners, the beginning of side one and beginning of side two. And then you sort of secure everything, and then you put all the other pieces inside of it, and then you end up with 30-odd minutes. It’s a blueprint. I didn’t invent it. But I still use it. I’m a creature of the way I’ve always done it.\n\n On your past albums, you’ve mixed it up, venturing into electronic music or more expansive arrangements on Workbook, but you always return to the guitar-bass-drums trio format. Do you ever think, “I’m going to make a country album this time?”I have those thoughts of going in different directions. That’s what I’m supposed to be doing in my 60s, reinventing and coming up with some huge operatic concept piece or something. But this record is sort of give the people what they want. [Laughs] After everything we’ve been through recently, it’s like, “Here’s a nice, warm blanket. You know these songs already.”\n\n Hüsker Dü was the beginning of me playing in three pieces, then with Tony Maimone and Anton Fier, then Sugar, now me, Jon and Jason. From my perspective as a player, the less people involved, the easier it becomes to improvise. And when I say improvise, I don’t mean free jazz. When you’re onstage and we’re supposed to turn left slowly together on something, it’s easier to feel that turn and be able to turn with it. Or if we want to change a set list on the fly. We have these little baseball signs, like pitch or catch, that we do when we have to make a change. So there’s a functional purpose to three-piece as well. And it’s also about playing lead and rhythm together, that Townshend kind of playing. That’s my thing, and it just feels right for me.\n\n At this point in your life, what does it take to physically rev up to that intensity?Okay, so the dirty little secret in the business is: If you love a band and the singer or the drummer are over 60, take a look at their tour itinerary and see how many back to backs [shows] they’re doing. That tells you. I know I’m not as spry as I was in my 20s, and I know that I don’t have the raw power I did in my 30s, but I can still summon that every night, the closest I can get to it. I do not sit onstage. I run around and I am soaking wet after 10 minutes.\n\n The hard part is the recovery. The voice is the hardest thing. It’s a lot of water, a lot of sleep, trying not to scream bloody murder every single night. Just little shortcuts. When I’m on tour, I do not talk. I go to soundcheck, and I do a half a song, and I shut up, and I do 90 minutes, and then I shut up. I might say “Starbucks” or “bathroom.” At the after-show, I’m not going to talk to everybody for an hour and a half. If I do that, the tour is over. I’m going to get a lanyard that says, “Can’t talk.”\n\n Are there certain songs you don’t do anymore as a result?“JC Auto” off Beaster? [Laughs] I don’t know if I have to do the blood-curdling scream from the last chorus of “Poison Years” every night. If I do that, I’m fucked for the rest of the tour. I hope people understand I’m trying. I’m doing the best I can with it. This is war. I’ve got to be ready. I don’t eat any rich food ever on tour. Because you get older, you get reflux. It’s really a full-time job to try to stay in shape for work. \n\n This may sound like a crazy notion, but the way you and some of your peers still adhere to the sound of Eighties or Nineties indie feels like the way old blues men would stick with their basics.That’s spot on. I never thought of it that way. Old habits are tough to shake. And a three-piece felt natural: that kind of aggression and melody, and hopefully having a simple but smart approach to the words. You can’t go wrong with that, especially in pop music. I never thought of it in terms of the blues guys, but they had this primitive guitar, unconventional tunings and techniques you would not learn from a guitar teacher. They invented this language. And they keep it and are keeping that language alive as long as possible.\n\n Your genre’s collective language was different from blues-based classic rock, for sure.Yeah, it was. It was against all of that. It was against the excess, against the exclusivity, against private jets and cocaine and groupies. All of those things seemed unattainable. But when I heard the first Ramones album, it’s like, “I think I can do that.” And so many of us found our way in through that. \n\n You’re part of a generation that invented indie rock in the Eighties, but at this point, it sometimes feels like you’re one of the few people left standing from that genre, along with some of the former members of Sonic Youth. Kim Gordon just got a Grammy nomination.There’s a fair amount of people left. The hardest working of all of us is Mike Watt. His sheer passion for communicating on a daily basis with music in a new city is mind-blowing. [Henry] Rollins, in a different format, still has a lot to say and a lot to share. Jello Biafra is still out DJing and guest performing. He still puts out Guantanamo School of Medicine records. He’s got Alternative Tentacles the label. And Thurston [Moore] and Kim, and Steve Shelley’s new band, Winged Wheel. There’s still a lot of folks doing it. \n\n We lost Steve Albini last year.Yeah. The last time I saw him was during basic tracking at Electrical Audio in January 2024. We’d been working on and off at Steve’s place for a decade at least. My last hang with Steve was just getting caught up on how he was doing, whether Big Black was going over to Spain. The next day, he brought me a bag of empanadas from his favorite new restaurant down the street from the studio. Big, big, big, big loss. Steve not only built this incredible cathedral for us to work in, but he also had all the expertise he shared with thousands of bands, his outspokenness and his ability to show new musicians how to stay true to your work. I knew no one like him before I met him. We disagreed on a lot of stuff too, which always made it fun. \n\n Looking back, what is the legacy of that original indie scene?We built an entirely separate world, a world that that did not exist before we all showed up. Nobody had a plan. Not to drag it back to politics, but I know anarchy, right? I know what it is to burn everything down, go all scorched earth, and then whatever grows is what it is. I get it. In the Eighties, we saw no way into pop music. It seemed like there were barriers to entry to AOR radio. So bands started learning how to put on their own shows at VFW halls and about the power of independent press through fanzines, and how to broadcast a message at college radio. All these things began to coalesce through the mid Eighties, and it created a world that was separate from everything that came before it, and it was all built on community and change and generosity. How many bands slept in the basement of whatever apartment I might have had a room in when they came through Minneapolis? In return for sheltering and feeding a band when you got to their town, they usually would reciprocate. \n\n And that’s before the internet, before cell phones, before GPS, before any of that. You roll into a town and, “Oh, I see a skater kid. Let’s follow the skater. Oh, there’s the skate shop. It’s next to the vegan restaurant. Oh, and there’s the indie record store! Now we can maybe put 20 singles on consignment and get gas money to get to the next town.” That literally was the way we did this thing. And none of it existed before we showed up, and none of us knew we were building it. But then one day it was sort of built, and we’re like, “Oh, right, so we’re paving the roads. Now we’re making the roads really smooth.” And then you get to, like, August of 1991 and “Teen Spirit.” We won. [Laughs] For a while. \n\n You all did, but some of us also thought your band and your peers would also be the next generation of classic rock, so to speak, and it didn’t quite turn out that way.I don’t know. I don’t know if we were meant to be the next generation of a previous generation. I think we’re okay to be our generation for as long as we’re here. I didn’t expect to inherit anything. It was just like, “I’m doing this thing, and we got to keep doing it, and we’re the best band in the world, and we have to prove it.” That’s what Hüsker Dü was about to me. It wasn’t about “we inherit Quadrophenia” or something. \n\n Did the industry expect that, though? You were all signed to major labels.The Eighties was a weird time. Hüsker Dü, we were fucking oblivious to it. You look at us anytime on MTV and think, “Who are those guys? They are so weird looking.” But R.E.M. especially elevated the whole idea of community, great songwriting, constant touring and doing the right thing as people. They really lifted the whole thing up, even higher than any of the punk bands did, as far as their impact on the society. They were an important band to all of us. We had R.E.M. so I never really found a reason to like the Smiths. I had a lot of respect for them, but I never was a Smiths person.\n\n About a decade ago, the Replacements returned, with Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson and two newer members, and they were incredibly well received.That was completely nuts. I mean, it was great. Me, Jon and Jason played the same Riot Fest that was also the first Replacements show.\n\n Grant Hart was, of course, still with us then. In light of the Replacements’ reception, did it cross any of your minds to reconvene Hüsker Dü and get some overdue props as well?No. The band blew apart, pretty seriously. When it exploded, it exploded. Grant and I stayed in touch over the years. We played a couple songs together, acoustic, at a show to help raise money for late Karl Mueller, from Soul Asylum. We talked about it the night before, and we didn’t tell anybody, and then we did it, and that was it. Neither of us ever talked about putting Hüsker Dü back together. I was content with my own work. Pretty sure Grant was content with his own work post-Hüsker. A friend of mine was asking about [a reunion], and I just said that sometimes things are meant for a time and a place.\n\n I got no problem with nostalgia or reunions or any of that. I think whatever anybody wants to do is awesome as long as they’re having a good time. But Hüsker Dü was then, and it meant so much to the three of us in the band that we meant so much to people. I didn’t want to take a chance on being less than what people remembered.\n\n We just published a piece about the new generation of hardcore bands like Turnstile. Do you keep up with those?Turnstile, Narrow Head, a lot of that, yeah. In the current moment, there’s this new heavy sound that feels like it was built on early-Nineties shoegaze, with fair amount of emo from the mid to late Nineties and a little bit of old-school punk rock in it. For me, the last five or ten years, my favorite band is a group from Detroit called the Armed. It’s an art-noise collective, multiple members, six, seven people. They do a lot of amazing videos and the sound is really over the top. They’ve started to go into almost an Eighties goth lane as well. They are putting out some of the best Western pop music.\n\n What about guilty music pleasures?I’m an unabashed pop fan, so Dua Lipa. I mean, everybody loves her work. I just love her voice. I love the retro house/disco vibe of Future Nostalgia, such a cool record. I’m trying to get into Chappell Roan. Her message is strong and great. Cher on SNL 50, I was like, “Good God, I love Cher so much.” I loved her as a child and watched the TV show. I had all the singles. So to see her still standing and killing it every time was just great. \n\n For a period starting in the late Nineties, you were immersed in the world of pro wrestling and were a consultant for WCW. That’s the world partly responsible for giving us Trump.[Sighs] I tried to warn people. I tried to explain to them: “Look, this guy is a friend of that guy [Vince McMahon] who popularized this entertainment form.” I had a couple dinners with big DNC people, and I would just say, “You know what this guy is doing, right?” They would say, “Oh, no, too low-brow.”\n\n This would have been 2018, when they were trying to figure out how to stop [Trump]. They would say, “We have to find somebody who can beat him.” And I just looked up and said, “How about Dwayne Johnson?” And they’re like, “Who?” I said, “The Rock, the pro wrestler who understands this kind of entertainment.” There was crickets. I said, “I’m just trying to tell you how this sausage is made, because I got to make it for a while.”\n\n What did you take from that whole experience in pro wrestling?Pro wrestling at that period was Stone Cold [Steve Austin] and the Rock and [Hulk] Hogan and all those guys. You learn that the more explosions you give people, the more excited they get. The more pyro, the more coarse language, the more T&A that you give people, the more you can engage that cherished demo of 18 to 35-year-old males. And that’s what these guys are doing now, with chainsaws, sexual abuse, fireworks. It’s the same blueprint. And now Linda McMahon is running the education department.","summary":"The former Hüsker Dü frontman reflects on the election and lessons he learned from indie rock and pro wrestling","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bob-mould-interview-husker-du-trump-wrestling-1235286509/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bob-mould-LEAD.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 15:00:00","author":"David Browne","authors":["David Browne"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.126},{"id":298080520,"title":"Fury as Dana White embraces Andrew Tate and his brother after Trump administration 'helped them flee Romania'","text":"Fury as Dana White embraces Andrew Tate and his brother after Trump administration 'helped them flee Romania'\n\nREAD MORE: Dave Portnoy demands Donald Trump answers key questions \n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 14:04 GMT, 8 March 2025 | Updated: 14:49 GMT, 8 March 2025\n\nSome of the biggest names in combat sports and MAGA politics crossed paths at a Power Slap event in Las Vegas, where UFC President Dana White finally met kickboxer and accused human trafficker Andrew Tate.\n\nAlong with his brother, Tristan, Andrew greeted the MMA promoter before the 12th instalment of White's fledgling slap-fighting circuit.\n\n'Pleasure to meet you,' Tristan can be heard saying to White in one of the videos that have since surfaced on social media.\n\nThe Tates recently fled Romania, where they face human trafficking, organized crime and money laundering charges, as well as a rape claim against the 38-year-old social media influencer, Andrew.

D. Vance Memes?","text":"J. D. Vance doesn’t look like himself. In recent days, memes have spread across social media in which the vice president’s face has been Photoshopped to give him cartoonishly chubby cheeks. He looks like a bearded baby or Humpty Dumpty. Sometimes, he is holding a lollipop and wearing a child’s baseball cap with a propeller affixed to the top. One meme takes his edited baby face and adds lusciously curly locks, while another changes his skin tone to a gentle purple hue, making him look like a Willy Wonka–inspired human blueberry. In every image, Vance has been reanimated as an utter doofus.\n\nThese memes first appeared in October, when a user on X posted an image of Vance captioned: “For every 100 likes I will turn JD Vance into a progressively apple cheeked baby.” But baby-faced Vance has gone fully viral since last week, when the vice president clashed with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the Oval Office. Many of the photos, the most popular of which have received tens of thousands of likes on platforms such as X and Instagram, include captions that imagine Vance talking like a small child who cannot yet properly pronounce his words: “You have to say pwease and tank you, Mistow Zensky.”\n\nOf course, people love making memes that portray their political adversaries as hapless and incompetent. That’s not exactly what’s happening with these images of Vance. The memes are going viral on the left-wing internet. But they are equally, if not more, popular on the right. Explicitly pro-Trump accounts on X that otherwise spend their time bashing liberals are posting embarrassing memes of their party’s second in command.\n\nNo, the right doesn’t appear to be posting unflattering memes of Vance because it has turned on him. As I wrote when Vance joined the Republican ticket, he uniquely appeals to various factions across the party. The online right, in particular, has long appreciated Vance’s recognition of it (he follows some of its most prominent accounts on X, such as Bronze Age Pervert).\n\nSo why is the right willing to make fun of one of its own with memes? One user on X who goes by the name Aelfred the Great and frequently shares right-wing memes has been posting and reposting the unflattering viral images of the vice president. “They’re just funny,” he told me when I asked him about them. For what it’s worth, Vance seems to agree, or at least says he does. On Thursday, he told a reporter for The Blaze that he thinks the memes are “funny.” Others on the right swear that by posting images of Vance as a man-baby, they’re actually helping him. “The right is having so much fun roasting Vance’s baby fat that it’s just completely neutered the left’s capacity to make fun of him,” one right-wing account, @martianwyrdlord, wrote in a post that garnered about 22,000 likes on X. “This feels like a precursor to Vance’s inevitable presidency,” Auron MacIntyre, a prominent MAGA influencer, posted. “He will have been so thoroughly memed that he becomes immune to the effect before ever entering office.”\n\nIt wouldn’t be the first time that politicos have tried something like this. The “Dark Brandon” memes of Joe Biden and the coconut-pilled memes of Kamala Harris initially started out as right-wing attempts to denigrate the Democrats. “Dark Brandon” caricatured Biden’s reputation on the right as a doddering old man by imagining that he harbored a secret personality as a cold-blooded killer. And “coconut-pilled” began when the right harped on a clip of Harris recounting how her mother had once said the phrase “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree.” Harris then awkwardly laughed.\n\nBoth the Biden and Harris memes eventually made their way to Democrats, who tried to lean in to the jokes. Biden supporters made memes that earnestly portrayed him as a savvy, Machiavellian political operator (with laser eyes, of course). Harris supporters started putting coconut and palm-tree emoji in their display names on social media, calling themselves “coconut-pilled.” This strategy seemed successful at the time. As my colleague Charlie Warzel noted when people first started coconut posting, the memes had an “authentic” and “maybe even fun” energy to them. In both instances, it felt like Democrats could take a joke and even spin it around to their favor. In the end, this tactic did not work out. Biden’s age caught up with him, and Harris’s folksy awkwardness didn’t seem to charm voters.\n\nThe Vance memes might work against the vice president even more. There is no silver lining to looking like a doofus. As trivial as they might seem, memes about politicians can be telling. “Dark Brandon” memes wouldn’t have been quite as funny if Biden was actually sharper and quicker than he seemed. “Coconut-pilled” memes wouldn’t have endured if Harris didn’t frequently say bizarre and confusing things. Whether or not they consciously realized it, by spreading such memes, liberals were copping to some uncomfortable truths about the politicians they supported. The Vance memes seem to contain an admission as well: that even some conservatives do not see him as essential to the current MAGA movement.\n\nConsider the fact that Democrats have long tried to embarrass Trump with memes and images of him as an infant, a Cheeto, and other forms. None of it has really stuck, even ironically, on the right. Trump’s own base just doesn’t see him that way, and they instead often make memes portraying him as heroic and muscular. But for a vice president who was picked with widespread support in his party, Vance, at times, has almost seemed like a fringe figure in Trump’s second term. He is, of course, overshadowed by the president himself—but also by Elon Musk, who is gutting the federal bureaucracy through his Department of Government Efficiency, and by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This time around I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics,” she stated in a 2022 social media post. \n\nEarlier this year, as her father transitioned back to the White House, the first daughter reiterated those feelings. \n\n“I love policy and impact. I hate politics and unfortunately, the two are not separable,” Ivanka told The Skinny Confidential Him & Her podcast in January. “There’s a darkness in that world that I don’t really want to welcome into mine.”\n\nFor someone who hates the “darkness in that world,” Ivanka sure has enjoyed the spotlight near her father and at his events in recent months. The Republican National Convention, Election Night and the recent Joint Address to Congress are three examples of her recent appearances near her father- despite her resentment of politics. \n\nThe most recent appearance was this week at her father’s joint congressional address alongside her husband, Jared Kushner. The 43-year-old sat in the president’s box to watch the address, alongside First Lady Melania Trump and her siblings Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump. \n\nOther guests in the box included Elon Musk, Second Lady Usha Vance and the family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter killed by would-be assassin Thomas Crooks at Trump’s July campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last year. \n\nNotably absent was Barron Trump, the president’s youngest son. The 18-year-old New York University skipped the address because he had classes scheduled this week, The Daily Mail reported. \n\nIvanka shared an Instagram post chronicling her attendance with the caption, “48 hours in DC!” Hours later, she shared another post highlighting the outfit she wore to the address designed by Oscar de la Renta.\n\n“Thank you, @oscardelarenta, for the exquisite navy blue tweed suit with orchid appliqués,” she wrote. “Hair, makeup + photos by my dear friend @alexarodulfo (apparently I’m an ambi-turner … Serving right angles only in full Zoolander style).”\n\nBut, her father’s Congressional address is not the only political event that Ivanka has been pictured at in recent months. After not being seen around her father for months, she attended the 2024 Republican National Convention, taking a picture with her father as he signed his official nomination paperwork. That was days after an assassin tried to take Donald’s life.\n\n“Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today’s senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania,” Ivanka wrote on social media shortly after the shooting. \n\n“I am grateful to the Secret Service and all the other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country,” she added. “I love you Dad, today and always.”\n\nDays later, Ivanka was on stage with her father in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.\n\nWhile not appearing on the campaign trail with her dad, Ivanka was around him on Election Day. She was spotted at Mar-a-Lago and attended the Election Night party. Later, she was on stage with her father and the rest of her family as the Republican nominee declared victory over then-vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nIvanka didn’t speak to the crowd or the press that night, but could be seen smiling as her father reveled about returning to the White House. \n\nIn January, Ivanka and Kushner also attended Donald’s inauguration and the subsequent celebration events in January. She wore a green dress and hat to see her father be sworn in again on Inauguration Day. Later, she and her husband were alongside her father, and new president, at the Liberty Inaugural Ball. \n\nA month later, Ivanka wasn’t with her dad in the nation’s capital. Instead, she was by his side as he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. She had a prime seat at her father’s right hand as the family watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs. \n\nWeeks after that, she was back in his obit. This time for the address to Congress.\n\nDespite Ivanka calling the presidency the “world’s loneliest position,” she has been spotted by his side at several points in the last few months. While first saying she plans to support her father through non-political activities, she has been at some high-profile political moments. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the Trump Organization for comment about her appearances. \n\nIn January – well before she was spotted in his orbit – Ivanka discussed the difference from her first term and her hopes for her role in the second - even if she seemingly is more around than planned. \n\n“We were like the Pioneers, nobody really knew what to do with him as a political figure,” Ivanka told the January podcast about her father’s first term. “Now there are so many people around. I think about in this moment how I can also support him because I know what the job is, like in a very personal way, having been by his side for four years.”\n\n“I think I’m most looking forward to just being able to show up for him as a daughter and be there for him to take his mind off things, to watch a movie with him, or watch a sports game,” she added. “To know that he can be with me, and be himself and just relax and for me to be able to provide that for him in a very loving way as his daughter.”","summary":"Ivanka has said she ‘hates’ politics and plans to stay away from the White House during her father’s second term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ivanka-trump-donald-politics-appearances-events-b2710498.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/13/05/Ivanka-Trump-at-differents-President-Donald-Trumps-events-in-2025.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TFmEThlG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-08 13:27:23","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.224},{"id":298063796,"title":"Democratic 'frontrunner' for 2028 goes after his own party for not clapping during Trump's speech","text":"Outspoken Senator John Fetterman slammed his own party's muted response to President Trump's address to Congress earlier this week. \n\nThe Pennsylvania lawmaker, seen by some as a potential unorthodox candidate for the 2028 presidential election, was asked by Fox News for his reaction to how Democrats behaved during Trump's speech. \n\nDemocrats faced backlash for several stunts and protests during the address, including refusing to stand and clap for a young cancer survivor who was honored by Trump, while one congressman was even booted from the chamber for his antics. \n\n'I don't think that was the best look for our party last night,' Fetterman said. \n\nFetterman also took to X to share a more hostile take on his party's performance, which be branded a 'sad cavalcade of self owns and unhinged petulance.' \n\n'It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained,' he said as he shared a Politico article that mocked Democrats who held up protest signs during the speech as 'giving bingo.' \n\n'We’re becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to — and it may not be the winning message,' Fetterman posted. \n\nThe senator's break from his party comes as he has been floated by some as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, with Bill Maher recently calling for him to run, saying 'Democrats need to find their Trump.' \n\nIn his surprising endorsement for Fetterman, Maher said Democrats were struggling to combat Trump's platform and the party needed someone 'Trump-like.' \n\nThe comedian clarified that when he says the liberal candidate needs to be like the 47th president, he doesn't mean to take on his 'authoritarian' characteristics, but that the politician needs to act like the Republican in the way that he 'bonds with everyday Americans because he talks like them.' \n\n'The good news for Democrats is they have that guy, and his name is John Fetterman,' Maher, 69, said.\n\nMaher spoke highly of Fetterman, 55, and mentioned how he chose to go to Mar-a-Lago after Trump won 'instead of curling up in a ball'.\n\nAfter their 'fascinating meeting,' Trump told The Washington Examiner's Salena Zito how 'impressed' he was of Fetterman.\n\n'He's a commonsense person. He's not liberal or conservative. He's just a commonsense person, which is beautiful,' Trump added. \n\nDespite suffering health issues during his run for the senate in 2022, including having a stroke that impaired his speech, Fetterman has emerged in recent months as a potential Democrat presidential candidate. \n\nHe has broken with his party's liberal wing several times, including maintaining his staunch support for Israel and supporting the Laken Riley Act focused on illegal immigrants. \n\nWhile Fetterman appeared comfortable to trash his own party following Trump's speech on Tuesday, a number of his Democrat colleagues balked when questioned by Fox News over their party's antics. \n\nProducer Johnny Belisario was seen asking a number of Democratic Senators, including several past and potential future presidential candidates, for their take. \n\nAsked why he didn't stand up at any moment during the speech, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker responded it was because 'the president got before the American people and didn’t talk about how he could drive down grocery prices.' \n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked why she didn't applaud certain aspects of the speech, including for the mother of murdered Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. \n\n'I did clap, when he said that the United States has supported Ukraine,' Warren responded. \n\nTexas Congressman Al Green was removed from the chamber following several outbursts during Trump's speech, and he was censured by the House soon after as 10 Democrats joined Republicans in voting to punish the member. \n\nWhen Belisario went to Green's office, he said he was 'shooed away' by his staff. \n\nAnd when the producer tracked down Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar for her take on the speech, she responded bluntly: 'You need to get away from me.' \n\nTalk of Fetterman running for president comes as Democrats are searching for a standard bearer to lead them into the 2028 election, following Kamala Harris' resounding defeat in November. \n\nFetterman was previously asked about his White House ambitions in December 2023, to which he told Politico that he was 'not thinking about 2028.' \n\nDespite losing in a landslide to Trump, Harris surprisingly topped a post-election poll among Democrats, where she led the field with 41 percent of the vote, according to a Puck News/Echelon Insights survey. \n\nThe rest of the pack combined - 13 Democratic politicians who all scored in the single digits - garnered 43 percent, with 16 percent of those surveyed saying they were 'unsure' to the question of who they would vote for if a party primary were held today.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom came in at second place with just eight percent.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro earned seven percent in the poll, a once-rumored vice presidential pick who was ultimately turned down by Harris as a running mate in favor of Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota who receives six percent in the poll. \n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also remains in the list of potential candidates as he sits at six percent.\n\nOther possible candidates include Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with four percent and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer with three percent.\n\nCandidates in the bottom tier include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\n\nDemocratic senators in the conversation include Fetterman, alongside New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock.","summary":"The top Democrat senator broke from his party as he slammed his colleagues' antics during Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday night, saying it was 'not the best look.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14476237/Fetterman-Democrats-Trump-speech-reaction.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/08/13/95979859-0-image-m-8_1741439944965.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/01/2552582482017404652/1024x576_MP4_2552582482017404652.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-08 13:24:45","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":298071982,"title":"New York Times guest essay suggests fashion industry has 'given up' on 'woke' values","text":"President Donald Trump declared that America will be \"woke no longer\" while trashing DEI in Tuesday night's address to Congress, and perhaps a recalibration in the fashion industry has signaled that cultural change as well. Once dominated by progressive and socially-conscious minimalism, some in the industry now appear to be leaning into its more extravagant side and turning away from \"woke\" ideals while embracing luxury and decadence, according to a New York Times opinion piece published Wednesday. Fashion journalist Amy Odell speculated that the industry may have \"given up\" on \"woke,\" and the shift reflects a broader cultural change that encompasses a broader spectrum of political views.

However sincere the motivation — many people, especially on the creative side of fashion, share progressive values — making the world a more diverse, equitable, inclusive and sustainable place didn’t always sit well with luxury, either practically or aesthetically. \"Now that all seems to be over, and maybe that's OK,\" the piece read in part. Conservative women, once sidelined by fashion, are now receiving recognition from some designers, Odell added. For example, LVMH, the parent company of designer brands Dior and Givenchy, created two couture looks for Ivanka Trump during her father's inauguration, signaling a willingness to work with figures outside the progressive realm. LA COUNTY CUT FIRE BUDGET WHILE SPENDING HEAVILY ON DEI, WOKE ITEMS: ‘MIDNIGHT STROLL TRANSGENDER CAFE' Odell also pointed out that Oscar de la Renta, which boasts a long history of dressing first ladies of both parties – Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton, among others – showcased its looks for Ivanka Trump and Second Lady Usha Vance on social media. It's a stark contrast to the \"litmus test\" for the fashion industry accepting conservatives, when multiple designer brands declined to dress first lady Melania Trump for the first Trump inauguration, she continued, adding, \"The designers who said in 2016 they would dress Mrs. Trump, including Dolce & Gabbana, Thom Browne and Carolina Herrera, don’t seem any worse off for it.\" JANE FONDA DEFENDS ‘WOKE’ AT SAG AWARDS, RALLIES HOLLYWOOD TO ‘RESIST’ TRUMP At the same time, Vogue's support for former Vice President Kamala Harris, including one issue which included interviews from some of her supporters and a cover that referred to her as the \"candidate for our times,\" is said to have fallen flat. \"It’s hard to argue that the endorsement of Kamala Harris by Vogue magazine and its editor Anna Wintour last year moved the needle for anyone.

In a forum sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee for the national chair race in January, nearly every candidate pledged to scrutinize the DNC's contracts with consultants, with the stated goal of pruning the organization of those who have for decades helped guide the party's leaders and candidates in an era marked by embarrassing defeats and narrow victories that fell short of expectations.\n\nThe winner of that race, Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin, said at the time that “D.C. consultants” will “be gone when I’m there.” The DNC's contracts typically expire after each two-year election cycle, but many of them are then renewed as a matter of course; some consultants have even been on the DNC payroll since former President Barack Obama's first term. Now that he's been elected chair, Martin gets to decide whether to follow or break with that precedent. According to a DNC spokesperson, he intends to stand by his pledge, pending a close review of who on the payroll is worthy of staying or being thrown out.\n\n“As DNC Chair, Ken Martin and his team will be going through every contract, line by line,\" Abhi Rahman, the DNC's national deputy communications director, told Salon. \"There’s one criteria — are they helping us win elections and rebuild our credibility with working families?\" \n\nJames Skoufis, a fierce critic of the Democratic Party's cozy relationship with those consultants, also ran for chair before dropping out and endorsing Martin. In an interview with Salon, he argued that Martin should be able to find plenty of waste and fraud, as winning elections and building credibility was not the criteria that has been used in the past.\n\n\"Many of these contracts, which can be seven or eight figures large, were not earned through honesty and value they bring to campaigns,\" Skoufis said. \"They were instead earned via relationships within the DNC, for knowing a friend of a friend of a congressman, or another consultant, or the right people within the organization.\"\n\nThe use of the \"D.C.\" label by Martin to characterize disfavored consultants evokes the image of a political swamp that can be found anywhere in the U.S., though its brackish waters are most thick where the federal government and swarms of lobbyists reside. Skoufis, who sometimes refers to those consultants as being part of the \"cocktail circuit,\" defined them more specifically as mercenaries who earn lucrative contracts by \"drifting from campaign to campaign, administration to administration, cable contract to cable contract, and advise the party’s political hub and candidates, and are often rewarded with more contracts and campaigns,\" even when the party loses.\n\nFor her 2024 campaign, former Vice President Kamala Harris spent hundreds of millions of dollars on consulting and media firms run by Democratic Party insiders, including those who worked for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign. It all amounts to a giant waste of money, Skoufis said, because their advice, encapsulated by the Biden administration trying to persuade Americans that their perception of a difficult economy was not rooted in reality, is \"totally removed from the desires, needs, and motivations of working class and middle-class voters.\" \n\nIn this criticism, Skoufis appears to share common ground with a number of consultants and staffers largely from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Those people, many of whom supported the insurgent campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and were once blacklisted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, are quick to distinguish themselves from the much-derided \"consultant class.\"\n\n\"They exist largely to protect their own power and keep making money,\" Usamah Andrabi, communications director for Justice Democrats, a group that supports progressive candidates, told Salon. \"The party needs to pivot away from consultants who have conflicts of interest, who go around the revolving door to also work with corporations like Uber or McDonald's or Exxon Mobil or Goldman Sachs and represent their interests in the political world.\"\n\nOne Democratic Party-aligned polling firm that has consistently appeared on the DNC payroll, Global Strategy Group, was paid by Amazon in 2022 to help the company suppress a union election at a Staten Island warehouse. Although the DNC publicly floated a proposal to ban party consultants from engaging in union-busting in response to backlash, they have not since clarified if it was actually put into effect. Such a proposal would have, in theory, barred the DNC from paying $1.2 million to GSG during the 2023-2024 election cycle even as the firm continued to represent union-hostile companies like Google, or paying nearly $12 million to Wilmer Cutter Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, a law firm that advertises \"union avoidance strategies,\" during the same period, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nIt's not just those firms' corporate ties that are raising eyebrows. SKDK, another popular Democratic Party firm and a co-creation of former Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn, recently registered as foreign agents for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, even as the party is already facing widespread censure over its support for a country that has been accused of committing genocide.\n\nThe dominance of those consultants has become even more pronounced after the Supreme Court allowed unlimited outside spending on federal elections, Gabe Tobias, a veteran campaign strategist who worked on Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign, told Salon.\n\n\"Political campaigns have become a really big industry, and like any other industry, you've got people and firms with a lot of power, and some who have less and want more. It doesn't look any different on the inside than working in the pharmaceutical industry or working in tech or something like that,\" Tobias said, adding that politicians \"only need these kinds of consultants because you can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on television ads, on mail or whatever other kinds of things that have only become a concept because we've allowed the unfettered influence of money in our political system.\"\n\nThe most recent failed presidential campaign provides an ideal case study for critics of business as usual. While Harris entered the campaign with some tentative appeals to economic populism and acknowledged that the cost of living was \"still too high,\" she and her surrogates increasingly relied on well-worn arguments about Trump's authoritarian tendencies and bumbled over how tightly to embrace the Biden-era economy in the face of widespread discontent. By the fall, earlier proposals or promises to crack down on price gouging, expand the child tax credit and impose more taxes on the wealthy had been watered down, while rhetoric against moneyed elites gave way to more neutral appeals like \"job creation\" and \"opportunities for the middle class\" — much of this, apparently, at the direction of Harris advisers with corporate ties, according to reporting by the New York Times. \n\nOne of those advisers, Karen Dunn, was serving as lead trial counsel for Google in a Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit at the same time she helped Harris prep for her debate against Trump; two others, Obama campaign alum David Plouffe and Harris' brother-in-law, Tony West, have seats on Uber's senior management team. West reportedly played a key role in convincing Harris to tailor her economic message to be more business-friendly and campaign more with surrogates who could ostensibly provide cross-party appeal, like billionaire Mark Cuban and former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney.\n\nIn the end, Harris continued the Democratic Party's trend of leaking low-income voters and failed to convert meaningful numbers of registered Republicans, earning less than 6% of the latter. \n\n\"People in the Harris campaign decided that maybe we're going to hit some people that we don't want to hit right now, we don't want to look so anti-corporate. That was clearly a dumb decision,\" Tobias said. \"David Plouffe, Tony West, Jen O'Malley Dillon and the rest have been on podcasts giving 1,000 data points about why the decisions they made with the right ones, so you can't prove that they're secretly trying to help themselves get rich off other corporate clients. But they do have those clients too, right? It really belabors trust with voters who already don't trust Washington in general when these people are the ones with the most influence over the party.\"\n\nMike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Harris senior adviser, pushed back on the notion that Harris didn't focus enough on economic issues, citing her proposals to expand Medicare and housing. But, in an interview with Salon, he also acknowledged that Democrats in general struggled with \"talking like regular people\" and moving beyond an excessively curated, focus group-verified approach to politics in large part because of a lack of class and geographical diversity among consultants. \n\n\"We have a ton of people who are highly educated in the Democratic Party that talk and think a particular way, and then we build campaigns that are over-reliant on that group,\" he said. \"We won highly-educated people in this country and people who make over $100,000, but we're getting killed with working class people. And I don't think we're elevating enough working class people in the party, people who didn't go to college, people who have a different way of thinking about the world because they have a different lived experience.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party should be a big tent organization, Nellis said, and include both labor and corporate voices because \"there aren't enough votes\" if one goes too far in either direction. While that might represent a shift in the direction progressives want to see, many of them argue that it's not enough, since moneyed interests are in their essence opposed to any expansion of labor or consumer rights that might threaten their profits. The party's preference for consultants from well-heeled firms over union organizers or community activists, they say, is a symptom of a Democratic Party unwilling to break ties with the corporate world or eschew fundraising with billionaires, and the symptom will not go away until they cure the deeper sickness. \n\nIf the party rebuilt itself around \"a mass base, labor and/or civil rights,\" as Tobias put it, there would be a stronger push within the DNC and other campaign committees to become something more than a \"giant fundraising machine.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nWhile commentators argue over how easily Democrats in general could have performed better with a different strategy and set of policies, Senate and House candidates across the country slightly outran the presidential ticket. Julie Merz, the DCCC's executive director, credited House Democrats' almost-enough performance with their expanded request-for-proposal process designed to \"hire the best talent available\" and bring \"diverse voices to the decision-making table\" who better understand or live in culturally diverse districts, where Democrats were stung in the last few election cycles by a shift in the Latino and Asian vote towards the GOP.\n\n\"The result was effective and authentic paid communication with voters, which will continue to be a key part of our strategy to win back the House in 2026,\" she told Salon.\n\nMany Democrats viewed as establishment-friendly have insisted that individual candidates, their advisers and the party as a whole should not be blamed for the 2024 election results, pointing to governments around the world struggling to maintain their popularity in the post-COVID economy. While Germany's center-left coalition lost power this week, Canada's Liberals appeared to be on course for an electoral drubbing before recovering in the polls amid their response to U.S. tariffs. Other incumbent parties like Mexico's left-wing National Regeneration Movement didn't require an assist from Trump to successfully defy political headwinds.\n\nDespite the success of progressive ballot measures in states that voted for Trump, some Democrats interpreted the 2024 election in the U.S. primarily as a call to move rightward on certain human rights issues or risk being tarred as \"woke\" by the right. That approach, Andrabi argues, is a grave mistake and yet another example of out-of-touch consultants either dramatically missing the point or doing anything to avoid offending their corporate connections.\n\n\"In election after election where Democrats lose, the establishment's first instinct is to punch down on not only just marginalized groups, but marginalized groups that it counts as its own base, or did at one point, and then wonder why those people don't want to vote for Democrats anymore,\" he said. \"Throwing immigrants and trans kids under the bus and turning into a diet Republican Party is not the solution. You'll always be out-righted by them.\"\n\nAndrabi, noting polls that showed a shift towards Trump over the economy rather than on identity and human rights, said that the objective for the Democratic Party should be to \"unite these marginalized communities, be it immigrants, be it trans people and their families, be it working class people of all races, against the same handful of billionaires and corporations that are picking all of their pockets.\"\n\nMartin, the newly-elected DNC chair, has signaled, if unevenly at times, that he too recognizes the need for a Democratic Party less beholden to its wealthiest donors and the consultants close to them. Even if Martin attempts to follow through, he does not control other key party committees like the DCCC and DSCC, which manage House and Senate races respectively, nor does he have direct say over what consultants individual candidates put on their payroll.\n\nBut his promise to review consultant contracts that have been normally regarded as a fait accompli is a good start, some observers say.\n\n\"The DNC is going to get the most attention even if it doesn't solve the problem on its own,\" Nellis said. \"For better or for worse, Ken is the face of the Democratic Party, and I'm glad that he's stepping up for it. But it needs to happen at every level. It needs to happen at every party committee. It needs to happen on every campaign. We can't be playing running the same damn playbook that we've been running for the last 20 years at least.\"","summary":"Newly elected DNC Chair Ken Martin has promised to review the party's existing contracts with consulting firms","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/03/08/can-democrats-finally-quit-the-consultant-class/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/03/ken_martin_2194261618.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 10:45:03","author":"Nicholas Liu","authors":["Nicholas Liu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":298005088,"title":"Europe’s Trump whisperers: Starmer, Macron and Meloni seem like an odd grouping","text":"The impetus for the rapport between Keir Starmer and Donald Trump arrived in the wake of an assassin’s bullet.\n\nGunman Thomas Matthew Crooks fired at Trump, then running as a candidate to be US president, at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania just after 11pm British/Irish time (6pm in the eastern US) last July 13th. A quarter of an inch from changing history, Crooks grazed his target’s ear and killed a man in the crowd.

England would go on to lose 2-1 to Spain, but Starmer would win Trump’s attention and respect.\n\nThat afternoon as he travelled to the match, he stopped for a 10-minute phone call with the US politician that had been personally arranged by Pierce. It was the first time the two men had ever spoken. Even Nigel Farage, who portrays himself as Trump’s “best friend” in Britain, had only texted him since the shooting.\n\nTrump was struck by Starmer’s kindness towards him, setting the tone for a political relationship that has stayed warm since, even as glacial winds have buffeted the traditional US-Europe transatlantic alliance. Their rapport was crucial this week as Starmer shuttled between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, trying to patch things up between them following their public falling out in the Oval Office over the war with Russia. British media have dubbed their prime minister Europe’s “Trump whisperer”.\n\nWriter and former Labour adviser Tom Baldwin, with whom Starmer co-operated last year on a revealing biography, told The Irish Times this week that he has since spoken to the prime minister about that crucial first phone call last July. What was it about that conversation that so endeared the UK prime minister to Trump, the most unpredictable and disruptive US president in history?\n\n“Starmer felt he made a personal connection with him when he spoke about how difficult it must have been for Trump’s family to watch him almost get killed on television,” said Baldwin. “They spoke about each other’s families. That was the moment he felt a different mood down the line, that this wasn’t just two men in politics talking business to each other.”\n\nThey met for the first time two months later at the height of the US election campaign. Starmer and his foreign secretary, David Lammy, held a two-hour dinner with the US politician in September at his gilded Trump Tower in New York, when they were in town for a United Nations meeting. Lammy said the dinner went so well, Trump gave them a second helping of chicken.\n\nLammy had invested separately, and heavily, in courting Trump’s vice-president (then running mate) JD Vance. Starmer, meanwhile, made no effort to also meet Harris during that US trip last September. He was all-in on Trump, who thinks he is a “really nice guy”. Now they speak often on the phone.\n\nLast week they met for only the second time – the first with both in office – in Washington. Amid an air of real bonhomie, Starmer produced a letter from his pocket from King Charles inviting Trump to Britain for an unprecedented second full state visit. The US president almost levitated with glee.\n\nAnand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College in London, was unalloyed this week in his admiration for what he sees as Starmer’s stellar job of liaising with Trump.\n\n“Oh God yeah,” he says, when asked if the UK prime minister has been deft in his diplomacy. “But there are still risks for him. If Trump keeps going like this [for example, by displaying unpredictable behaviour over Ukraine] an element of anti-Americanism might creep in on the Continent – ‘you’re either with us or against us.’” Starmer soon may have to manage that dynamic as well as his relationship with Trump, says Menon.\n\nFor Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni, meanwhile, her close personal connection with Trump was born in December, weeks after he beat Harris in the race for the White House. They were already politically compatible as fellow radical right-wingers. But Meloni, a cautious operator, had previously maintained an air of neutrality during the campaign – she wanted to also keep a good relationship with outgoing US president Joe Biden, and also with Harris in case she won.\n\nBut by December, Trump was the president-elect and Meloni knew who she needed to court. They met for the first time at the ceremony in Paris for the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral, which was destroyed by fire during Trump’s first term. Meloni tweeted a picture of the pair laughing in a semi-embrace, thumbs up at the camera. Trump said she was a “real live wire” and they hit it off. Meloni is also close to the billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s closest political ally.\n\nWeeks later, Meloni made a surprise trip to see Trump during the first week of January at his Mar-a Lago resort in Florida. As well as Ukraine, over five hours they also discussed the case of Cecilia Sala, an Italian journalist arrested in Iran after Italian authorities had arrested an Iranian engineer at the request of the US. The Iranians released Sala three days after Meloni met Trump.\n\nLater that month, Meloni was the only European national leader to be invited to attend Trump’s second inauguration in Washington. In February, she was also invited to remotely address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, a right-wing jamboree where Trump was feted as a hero.\n\n“She spoke out against wokeness and in favour of the family – things like that,” said Daniele Abertazzi, professor of politics at the University of Surrey and co-author of a forthcoming new book on the radical right in Europe, Populist Radical Right Parties in Action.\n\n“There is no political cost in saying such things at CPAC. Meloni knew how to push the right buttons. But she also stood there and told the conference that Ukraine was a victim of Russian aggression.”\n\nMeloni, along with Starmer, has pushed for Europe to maintain close ties with Trump’s White House, even as the US president roils the continent with his unpredictable behaviour such as cutting aid to Ukraine and his growing closeness to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, seen as a threat to Europe’s security.\n\nThe Italian prime minister helped her UK counterpart to convene the summit last week of European and certain Nato members held in London on Sunday to discuss Ukraine and Europe’s future security. That morning in advance of the summit, she also met Starmer at Downing Street for a one-to-one, the only European leader to do so. They compared notes on their relationships with Trump.\n\nThe night before, both leaders spoke to Trump over the phone, a day after the US president’s disastrous White House meeting with Zelenskiy on the Friday, which ended in a shouting match. Speaking afterwards, Meloni said it was “very important to avoid the risk of the West splitting”.\n\nMeloni has proposed a wide-ranging US-Europe security summit, with Starmer’s full support. She has said their nations must work to “build bridges” to Trump’s Washington.\n\n“Being seen to be this bridge to Trump is very important for Meloni,” said Abertazzi. “A bridge is between two points. But sometimes it seems like now we have two different planets. How do you bridge that? It seems to me like it might be too far.”\n\nCharles Grant, a security policy expert and director of the Centre for European Reform, is one of the best-connected British analysts in Brussels, while he also has strong links to Paris. He says he “isn’t a fan” of the bridge-building [or in this case, Trump whispering] approach to international affairs.\n\n“It can seem vainglorious. It can also be a mistake. Starmer has done reasonably well at it, but not if it ends up lapsing into something where Britain pretends to have this unique relationship with the Americans, because it thinks Europeans are too stupid to understand them properly.”\n\n[ Fintan O'Toole: European leaders seem astounded by Trump’s bullying and blatant aggressionOpens in new window ]\n\nEuropean unity is more important than bridge-building to Washington, according to Grant. “And Meloni, to her credit, is not undermining European unity in any way.”\n\nWhile he doesn’t care too much for bridges, Grant says he is a fan, however, of the third European leader who has also tried to be a sort of Trump whisperer, France’s president Emmanuel Macron. He was the first European leader to meet Trump after his inauguration – the two shared a mercurial, but occasionally close, relationship during Trump’s first term from January 2017 to 2021.\n\nMacron visited Trump in the White House two days before Starmer, and the France and US presidents engaged in touchy-feely diplomacy and a textbook display of their famous power handshakes. Macron, however, also corrected Trump when he downplayed the importance of European financial support for Ukraine. Starmer has done similar, but more gently. Both leaders have balanced out their Trump-wooing by also being openly enthusiastic in their backing for Zelenskiy.\n\n“Macron is a supremely self-confident political leader. I am impressed by this aspect of him,” said Grant. “He uses a lot of savoir faire in his relations with Trump. Starmer is perhaps more polite to Trump, maybe even more obsequious. He is much more careful not to say anything that could be construed as criticism. But both have done fairly well at it.”\n\nGrant says it is “up to them [Macron and Starmer]” to lead Europe in its relations with Trump, because Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appears to be adopting a different tone. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also can’t lead Europe’s relations with Trump, because the US president dislikes European Union institutions, says Grant. This post-Brexit reality is an aspect of Starmer’s dynamic with Trump that his Number 10 team play up in private.\n\n“Meloni can also play a useful role. I think it’s right to highlight that Italy has a huge trade surplus with the US, which might become an issue some day in the relationship. But the link between her and Musk is also important. They like each other, or at least Musk certainly likes Meloni,” says Grant.\n\n[ Patrick Smyth: Giorgia Meloni masquerades as the ‘acceptable’ face of the far right, but nobody should be fooledOpens in new window ]\n\nThe trio of European leaders vying, and frequently co-operating, to be Trump whisperers seem an odd grouping when set side by side.\n\nThere is Starmer, a stodgy, emotionally constipated social democrat falling down with political problems at home, but who appears to have found his calling as a transatlantic statesman in recent weeks. Baldwin says that despite Starmer’s reputation for eschewing the personal side of politics, his methodical cultivation of a close connection with Trump is fully in line with what he knows of him.\n\nMeloni, meanwhile, is an adherent of the sort of radical nationalism that ought to make her an ideological bedfellow of the EU-sceptic Trump. Yet somehow, she has emerged as a defender of European unity while at the same time remaining close to the US president.\n\n“I feel the moment will eventually come when she must choose between them,” says Abertazzi. “She will go for Europe because Italy must. But she’ll still massage Trump’s ego.”\n\nAs for Macron, the effervescent centrist whose domestic political career has floundered, he can still make a valedictory contribution by helping to shape the future security of the European continent. He has even floated the idea of using France’s nuclear weapons as a shield for Europe.\n\n[ Micheál Martin should follow Macron’s playbook for handling TrumpOpens in new window ]\n\nWhile admiring Macron’s diplomatic skills, Grant spies the potential for tension between him and some of the other Trump whisperers. For example there is a clear gap, he says, between Macron’s evangelism for complete European strategic autonomy on security and Starmer’s insistence that a US security guarantee in Ukraine is the only way forward.\n\nThere may also disagreements on how European money is spent on buttressing defence, with Macron wanting it to all to be spent through EU entities. “There is potential for disruption there. But overall, I think Starmer and Macron are still appreciative of each other’s virtues,” says Grant.\n\nA France-UK plan to convince the US to sign up to a Ukraine peace plan that deters Russia remained at the whim this weekend of the disrupter president, Trump.\n\nBut whatever noise Trump makes in Washington, whatever he does next, there will still be a trio of patient European leaders lobbying him gently by whispering quietly in his ear.","summary":"Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni and Emmanuel Macron are trying to keep the mercurial US president onside over Europe’s security","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/03/08/europes-trump-whisperers-starmer-macron-and-meloni/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/KEIZI7FTOBD7LNMHAXMHZGSWCU.jpg?auth=44a7b10cfa2088e174c90f9ecec72c9c8dbe30c99454fd89a751a3460dd0ea3c&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 09:00:00","author":"Mark Paul","authors":["Mark Paul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.039},{"id":298005712,"title":"Will Kamala Harris Run For California Governor?

The proposals were such a detour from the GOP's usual Second Amendment fealty that the Democrats subsequently introduced a near-identical package of bills, prompting GOP gripes earlier this month that the majority party hijacked their bills.\n\nAssemblywomen Michele Matsikoudis, R-Union, who sponsored the GOP bills with district partner and fellow Republican Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz, said she doesn't see the measures as a departure from party priorities. Rather, she said, the restrictions she and Munoz proposed align with Republican calls to crack down on crime and protect public safety. Many of the bills target illegally manufactured firearms like 3-D printed guns and gun-involved crimes.\n\n\"Illegal gun crime is one of the biggest threats to lawful gun owners and law-abiding citizens,\" Matsikoudis said. \"So everyone that wants to protect Second Amendment rights will naturally be behind this, because what it's doing really is separating lawful, law-abiding gun owners from the bad actors and people that are looking to do harm with this new technology that's untraceable.\"\n\nTheir push for the gun restriction measures comes as both women seek reelection in a legislative district that is under GOP control but voted in November for then-Vice President Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by 12 points.\n\nBoth Democrats, who trumpeted their version of the bills in a news conference earlier this month, and Matsikoudis said the legislation was inspired by recommendations the State Commission of Investigation issued last spring to foil repeat gun offenders and stem a rising tide of \"ghost guns.\"\n\nMatsikoudis said she has asked to co-sponsor the Democratic bills, which an Assembly panel recently advanced along party lines.\n\n\"Anytime that I can reach across the aisle to come up with good, common-sense legislation, I will do that every day of the week,\" Matsikoudis said. \"Safety affects everybody.\"\n\nAt least one of her party peers has no plans to join her.\n\nAssemblyman Bob Auth, R-Bergen, said most of the Democratic bills were unconstitutional or redundant, because they seek to outlaw things that are already illegal, like ghost guns and machine gun conversion devices. Auth, along with Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn, R-Monmouth, voted against most of the Democrats' gun bills when they were heard by the Assembly's judiciary committee last month.\n\n\"We have some of the most restrictive gun laws in this nation. We have a cornucopia of different gun laws. I think they've accomplished the goals that they've set out to do, but they just keep piling more on,\" Auth told the New Jersey Monitor.\n\nMatsikoudis and Auth dismissed any idea that their differences on the bills signaled any deeper party division on the issue.\n\n\"Fifty percent of the people that get married in this country get divorced. I would say that the Republican caucus is doing far better than just the average person who's trying to survive a marriage,\" Auth said. \"I think that we agree on more things than we disagree on.

The billionaire didn't even bother to negotiate over the $250 million price tag and promised to be a \"hands-off\" owner. For years he honoured that pledge, but shortly before the last presidential election, he badly \"tarnished\" the paper's reputation by spiking a Washington Post editorial endorsing Kamala Harris – a move that led to some 250,000 cancelled subscriptions. And last week Bezos went further.\n\nIn a memo to Post staff, he explained that the paper's opinion pages would henceforth consistently champion \"personal liberties and free markets\". \"We'll cover other topics too of course,\" he wrote, \"but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\" The Post's opinion editor, David Shipley, promptly resigned over the edict.\n\nHonestly, the fuss people have made of this, said Rich Lowry in the New York Post. There's nothing new about owners determining the editorial line of newspapers. The Washington Post has been \"synonymous with crusading liberalism\" since it exposed the Watergate scandal, but its politics were different in the 1930s, when it was owned by the Republican banker Eugene Meyer. Besides, what's so bad about emphasising liberty and free markets? They're hardly \"the hallmarks of authoritarian rule\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

It could be a smart commercial move, too, given the uncertain future of the Murdoch media empire. If the more liberal family members get their way and push the politics of papers such as The Wall Street Journal to the left, it could present an opening for the Post.\n\nIt's a \"rotten business decision\", said Michael Schaffer on Politico. The Post has always sought to reflect a wide range of views on its op-ed pages, to grow its readership. If Bezos seems to be controlling the paper to \"curry favour with his new pal Donald Trump\", then readers won't trust it. Bezos says papers don't need to cover all views because \"the internet does that job\"; he just cares about freedom. Does that \"include, say, the freedom to start a union at an Amazon warehouse? Or run a business without worrying that some monopolistic e-commerce behemoth is going to drive you under?\" These sound like good subjects for debate \"on a pluralistic op-ed page somewhere\".\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWashington Post\nFrom the magazine\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nGene Hackman: the death of a Hollywood legend\n\nThe French Connection actor had an extraordinary gift for making characters believable\n\nBy The Week UK\n\nPublished 8 March 25\n\n5 confrontational cartoons about Zelenskyy at the White House\n\nArtists take on diplomatic fashion, card games, and more\n\nBy The Week US\n\nPublished 8 March 25\n\nSudoku medium: March 8, 2025\n\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\n\nBy The Week Staff\n\nPublished 8 March 25\n\nYou might also like\n\nElon Musk and Wikipedia are feuding\n\nThe Explainer\nThe online encyclopedia stands accused of being far-left propaganda\n\nBy Devika Rao, The Week US\n\nPublished 13 February 25\n\nPhone hacking: victory for Prince Harry?\n\nTalking Point\nEven those who do not share the royal's views about the press should 'commend' his dedication to pursuing wrongdoing\n\nBy The Week UK\n\nPublished 1 February 25\n\nCan The Washington Post save itself?\n\nToday's Big Question\nStaffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus\n\nBy Joel Mathis, The Week US\n\nPublished 20 January 25\n\nThe ultimate podcast list of 2024\n\nThe Week Recommends\nSome of the best podcast series released in the past year or so\n\nBy The Week UK\n\nPublished 26 December 24\n\nRupert Murdoch's succession problem\n\nTalking Point\nA court ruling has thrown the future leadership of News Corp and Fox wide open.

An ardent leaver in his teens, who backed Boris Johnson in 2019, he now belongs to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.\n\nWe meet in the packed bar of the Athena theatre in Leicester, alongside about 900 people who have paid £15 and dodged a noisy counterprotest to see their hero in the flesh at Reform’s East Midlands rally. Their reward is nearly three hours of speakers attacking small boat crossings, “woke” ideology and grooming gangs raping and trafficking young girls.\n\n“If you don’t want to respect our history, our heritage, our way of life, our laws, then clear off,” barks Reform MP Lee Anderson, as burly men ferry pints from the bar. Andrea Jenkyns, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Reform, says her seven-year-old wants to join, and implores parents to sign their adult children up. Throughout the night, someone keeps heckling “Listen to Tommy Robinson!” (the jailed far-right thug Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, whom Farage has consistently frozen out).\n\nSpeeches are high on energy and emotion, switching in tone from end-of-the-pier-show jokes to rabble-rousing: by the time Farage himself begins glad-handing his way through the crowd, the adrenaline is pumping. Pyrotechnics explode at his feet and the bass is turned up chest-poundingly high. Like Donald Trump, he’s learned to dish up politics as entertainment.\n\nWhat attracted Josh, he explains, is that Reform have never been in power, so they haven’t been tried and seen to fail. But he also thinks they’re “the only party standing up for British values”, criticising what he sees as mainstream parties’ attitude to British history and tradition. He didn’t go to university, but seems suspicious of what might have happened there: “There need to be more safeguards to stop lecturers from putting their own worldview on to students.”\n\nJosh is articulate, polite and unusually formally dressed for his age, in suit and tie: he’s interested in becoming an MP. But he’s perhaps less confident than he sounds. “I’m quite an introverted person,” he concedes. When I ask what his friends think about Reform, Josh says he’s “hovered around a few friendship circles” lately. Most of his mates are either leftwing or not interested, but he’s found a new community on TikTok. Josh flips open his iPad to show me the account he runs for his local Reform branch, with 125,000 followers – more than the Conservative party’s official national account, though less than the 1.2 million following Nigel Farage’s chirpy, laddish feed. “The Conservatives or Labour feel like they’re reading from a script. They feel like AI almost,” he explains. “Nigel Farage feels like a normal person. He feels real.”\n\nJosh’s peers are still significantly more likely to vote Labour, Green or Liberal Democrat than Reform (only the Tories did worse among this age group at the last general election). In Leicester, there were more young people outside waving pro-refugee placards at the protest than inside listening to Farage denounce immigration numbers. But the erstwhile party of grumpy old men is seemingly catching gen Z’s imagination. Young men were twice as likely as young women to vote Reform at the general election, according to the pollsters YouGov (young women were more likely to go Green). Though this is a fickle and wildly volatile demographic, and so small it’s hard for pollsters to capture its views accurately, Reform’s vote share among under-24s of both sexes swung from 9% last summer to 19% at its peak in January, mirroring a global swing to the populist right.\n\nIn last summer’s European elections, almost a third of French voters under 34 backed the far-right National Rally, whose 29-year-old president, Jordan Bardella, looks like a boyband member and is big on TikTok. Germany’s recent election saw young voters continuing to move to the political fringes: in the 18-24 bracket, the far-right AfD came out second with 21%, after Die Linke with 26%. Most striking of all, last November over half of American men under 29 chose Donald Trump over Kamala Harris. The hard right seems to be profiting not just from frustration with economic stagnation but from a male backlash against the socially conscious, overtly feminist culture in which gen Z grew up.\n\n“There’s an awakening in a younger generation who have had enough of being dictated to,” Farage declared last year. Society was stopping young men being young men, he said, and “if no other politician is willing to reach out to this group of people, then I will.” But is that really what young men want?\n\nMike Nicholson has learned to expect sullen faces and folded arms when he enters a classroom. “They’re like, well, this is all going to be woke rubbish,” he says, ruefully. A former English teacher, Nicholson now runs Progressive Masculinity, which organises workshops for teenage boys in British secondary schools exploring positive ways to be a man. Teenagers so rarely hear the word “masculinity” without “toxic” attached, he explains, that they’re expecting a lecture. Once they realise they can talk freely, they barely stop.\n\n“Every week we hear boys saying they’re unseen, not heard, frustrated. One really articulate 13-year-old, a white working-class boy, said to me that almost every social group has a movement, like Black Lives Matter or #MeToo or LGBTQ+. And he said it was good they had it, but that ‘we don’t see anything like that for us’.”\n\nThe boys he meets often seem immature for their age, he says, possibly reflecting the impact of lockdown on their social skills; they’re also increasingly conscious that they can’t afford the expensive trainers and other status markers modelled by their favourite YouTubers. Nicholson says most havemoved on from Andrew Tate, the misogynistic influencer facing charges of rape and trafficking in Romania. (Farage once called Tate “a very important voice” for men, while conceding some of his content was over the top.) But Tate has spawned endless imitators online, preaching the “manosphere” gospel that being a real man means getting rich, pumping iron, parking your Bugatti outside your penthouse and treating women like property. It’s a far cry from what awaits boys in real life, where youth unemployment is rising, over a quarter of 24- to 29-year-olds still live with their parents, and girls have minds of their own.\n\nBoys often complain, Nicholson says, about getting suspended from school for saying “what you really think”. But in the workshops they’re encouraged to voice their worst thoughts, which facilitators can then unpick.\n\nThough Nicholson notes “a shift towards rightwing views”, mostly he finds boys switching off from politics completely. When they’re asked to rank a selection of men by perceived status, Rishi Sunak (when prime minister) and now Keir Starmer get shoved to the bottom. “We’ll say, ‘If masculinity is defined by power, he’s the most powerful man in the country!’ But they’re really disillusioned with the political process.” It’s a reminder that far more young men don’t vote at all than vote Reform.\n\nGeoff Norcott, the right-leaning comedian and host of the political podcast What Most People Think, argues that turning to Farage, Tate or Trump is a symptom of deeper problems in boys’ lives. He’s frustrated that it’s taken a populist backlash for issues such as male suicide rates or boys’ educational underachievement to get attention: “It seems so nakedly transactional – ‘I give a shit because you might vote for this thing I don’t like.’”\n\nYoung men, he thinks, are struggling to find their feet in a world in which the girls who have long outstripped them in exam results are now in some cases out-earning them. (Among under-30s, the pay gap is only 2.25%, though it rises in age groups associated with having children.) Boys fear being unable to acquire the trappings they think will make them attractive and some are, he thinks, channelling that anxiety into unhealthy body images, bulking and shredding to fit some punishing social media-inspired aesthetic. “I know a lot of mates with teenage sons and the amount of time they spend on their physiques is a concern.”\n\nBut talking about male vulnerability, he argues, too often invites counterarguments about how tough girls still have it, as if both things couldn’t simultaneously be true. “There’s a feeling that if women have problems, it’s because of something society does to them, but if boys have problems, it’s something they do to themselves.”\n\nAs a middle-aged man who grew up in an era of more entrenched chauvinism, the idea of male privilege makes some sense to Norcott. “I can look at moments in my life and see it has existed,” he says. “But young males haven’t grown up with this stuff, so it doesn’t make sense to them.”\n\nOn the face of it, Reform simply offers angry young men someone to blame. Can’t afford to move out of home? Blame competition from immigrants, supposedly pushing up rents. Can’t get into a good university, or graduate job? Blame competition from foreign students. Can’t get a girlfriend? Blame feminism. But the young men I meet in Leicester seem less angry than nostalgic for a past they’re too young to remember. Above all, they’re desperate for something to feel good about.\n\nEighteen-year-old Ryan came to the rally because he thinks Reform are “for the younger generation, like me”. His parents were Labour voters but are leaning to Reform and so, he says, are lots of his friends. “Reform is the only party that’s bold enough to make the changes, to turn the country around.” What changes? “It’s a plethora of things but I think the main thing is having a national identity, a real sense of being British – I feel like we’re slowly losing that, with time. At school I especially notice that there’s kind of a bitter taste in the air, in the way the teachers talk.”\n\nOn the other side of the auditorium I meet Ethan (not his real name), earnest in his blazer and spectacles, who is hoping Reform can reverse what he sees as national decline. “I’m a great history lover. I can look back over the past – the great voices in the second world war – and see a Great Britain. Today when I look around, I don’t.” What distinguishes this from any other conversation with a middle-aged Farage fan is that he’s only 16, and worried he’ll never be able to buy a house.\n\nIf it seems counterintuitive to hear young people talking like this, then that’s because the “woke youth” stereotype was never accurate, says Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at the University of Bristol who has tracked the rise of rightwing populism among the young. “People find it surprising because they think all young people are on the liberal left, but that’s never been true,” she says, pointing out that in every generation some instinctively lean right. “In 2024, if you were a person on the right, you had the Conservatives, who were desperately unpopular, or you had Reform – I don’t think we should be surprised that these young voters who were on the right were more likely to go to Reform.” If anything, Surridge is amazed more didn’t, given young voters’ evident hunger for something more radical than the two big parties – one reason the Greens did even better among this demographic.\n\nLike every political scientist I speak to for this piece, Surridge warns that the data we have on young male Reformers is still sketchy and prone to error: these are people who are often reluctant to engage in surveys. But it’s not inevitable, she warns, that each new generation of young people will be more progressive than the last. “We have tended to see that, as education levels have risen,” she says, noting that going to university is associated with more liberal views and that student numbers have shot up in the past 40 years. “But the expansion in higher education is largely settled now, so we can’t necessarily expect that change to continue.” And while, for now, young women remain noticeably more liberal, that may not be guaranteed.\n\nAva is 23, unemployed and exercised about immigration and trans women entering women-only spaces. She spent a lot of last year online, mostly on YouTube, Facebook, Trump’s Truth Social platform and in private groups for far-right women on the messaging app Telegram. In her chosen bubble, Ava was bombarded with news stories about ethnic minority men raping and grooming girls, seemingly designed to trigger her emotions – if she’d had any, for Ava isn’t real. She is an online persona constructed to see “where the algorithm would take” a right-leaning young woman, by 29-year-old British writer Lois Shearing, whose new book, Pink-Pilled, examines women’s involvement in the “alt-right” movement. The results convinced Shearing – who in real life uses they/them pronouns and doesn’t share Ava’s imaginary politics – that Reform could get a hearing from young women, too.\n\n“I wouldn’t be shocked to see an increase in young women voting for parties like that. I’ve seen even this year a change in how women are talking and communicating online, and I think it’s accelerating,” Shearing says. “This shift we’ve seen where women are getting more liberal is not necessarily going to stick around.” In Europe, Surridge points out, female far-right leaders are actively wooing female voters.\n\nSo far, however, Reform remains uncompromisingly laddish in tone. “Lovely melons,” Farage smirks to camera as he approaches a fruit stall, in one of his most-viewed pre-election TikToks. It was his 2023 stint on the reality show I’m A Celebrity … that first introduced Farage to a young audience. (He was a surprisingly early adopter of social media, having learned years ago as an MEP that the quickest route to press coverage was saying something calculated to go viral on YouTube.) His team seem to have quickly realised that posts about football, drinking challenges or lip-syncing to Eminem did far better on TikTok than ones attacking the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nBut mostly teenagers just seemed fascinated by the incongruity of a 60-year-old politician appearing in their world, like a pensioner bursting into a nightclub. When they realised he did Cameos – video messages recorded by celebrities for money, from a script dictated by customers – a craze developed for getting Farage to deliver birthday greetings peppered with teenage slang, just to watch him say “big chungus”. (If you have to ask, you’re not the target audience.) Before long, Reform was winning school mock elections, while schoolgirls complained about boys cheering and saluting when Farage was mentioned in politics A-level classes.\n\nFor some of his new fans, the ideological implications of all this were clearly hazy at best. (After one video Farage posted of himself bantering with members of a teenage guitar band led to the boys being abused online, they wrote plaintively on Instagram that “we’re 15, we don’t know anything about politics”.) Even now, his appeal remains hard to separate from teenagers’ love of anything edgy, or of winding teachers up.\n\n“I think there’s that sense of it being a bit of a laugh, not taking it too seriously – certainly not thinking about it in ideological terms,” says Surridge, who has two teenage sons herself and compares it to previous generations shocking their parents by embracing punk. “For that age group, my experience is everything has to be a joke at some level.”\n\nBut the one consistent message Farage sends boys is that he’s on their side. When Sunak threatened to bring back national service – which many teens interpreted as being sent to die in some looming world war with Russia – or stop teenagers ever smoking, Farage took the opposite approach. “My advice is completely ignore what you’re being told: have a drink, have fun, have a sense of humour – obviously within reason,” he posted after football fans were warned against getting too boisterous at the Euros. “We’re only here once.” He offers young men a permission to be themselves that is eerily familiar to Trump-watchers.\n\nRichard Reeves is a British-born former aide to the then British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, and now runs the Washington-based American Institute for Boys and Men. Three years ago, he was still struggling to find a publisher for his book Of Boys and Men, which warned that young men’s struggles risked being exploited for political gain by the far right. (Though Reeves is a card-carrying liberal feminist, whose book stresses that women still face numerous hurdles in life, he thinks editors were nervous of a book about male disadvantage sparking a backlash.) Then came a string of election results worldwide that made his thesis look uncomfortably prescient, and lately his phone is ringing off the hook.\n\n“It’s often said elections come down to who would you like to go for a beer with. Well, I think this one was more like who would like to go for a beer with you,” he says of Trump’s victory. While leading Democrats lectured young men on the need to “step up” by electing a female president, Trump’s campaign signalled that men were fine as they were. He surrounded himself with wrestlers and martial arts stars, Twitch streamers and podcasters popular with young men – some reportedly picked by the president’s 18-year-old son Barron. (Farage has similarly popped up on the entrepreneur-friendly Strike It Big podcast, and on the Disruptors with Rob Moore, an eclectic mix of get-rich-quick tips and fringe politics with past guests including Andrew Tate and the conspiracy theorist David Icke.)\n\nBut the clincher, Reeves says, was Trump’s unfiltered manner. “I think a lot of young men responded to a kind of freedom about it. In the UK you’ve got that great word blokeish; we don’t really have that here in the US.” It’s the same quality Josh described in Farage’s social media post, and it appeals, Reeves thinks, to young men who envy Trump’s willingness to take risks. “A lot of young men are reacting against the idea that they’ve been having to tread on eggshells, they can’t joke, that all this stuff has gone too far. Of course we can have a long argument about whether that’s true … but a lot of them have felt quite tightly wound and fearful.”\n\nWhen I ask whether he thinks Farage could pull off a Trump-style uprising among British young men in 2029, Reeves says the British left has avoided leaving him an open goal, citing as an example “the fact that [health secretary] Wes Streeting has done a men’s health strategy”. Still, he rattles off a list of what any party keen to attract young men could do: more high-quality apprenticeships because “mainstream education doesn’t seem to work for everybody”, more male teachers to provide good role models and better-paid paternity leave to show fatherhood is valued.\n\nBut how politicians pitch it matters, he argues. Reeves suspects Trump’s campaign particularly resonated with under-25s raised on lectures about toxic masculinity. “They’re not against gender equality – but they’re over it. They’re over being seen not as having problems, but as being the problem.” Like Norcott, he thinks men’s struggles are too often framed as things that need tackling in order to protect society from them, not for men’s own benefit. “If the best we can offer young men is a way for them not to be poisonous, we shouldn’t be surprised if that’s not a very inspiring message.” And that’s the vacuum into which both Trump and Farage have moved.\n\nOn stage in Leicester, Farage announces that it’s time to stop talking to the young about four-day weeks, and start talking about getting rich. “We’ve got to encourage young people to work hard – no one succeeds in life without working hard. We’ve got to tell young people we want them to go and make money, to succeed.”\n\nIt’s a Thatcherite message recast for a modern era of hustle and grind, pitched at young men whose social media feeds are full of crypto bros bragging about making a killing from digital currency and get-rich-quick influencers posting #5amclub selfies from pre-dawn workouts. It’s what the National Rally’s Bardella, who grew up in a tough Parisian suburb, means when he says his life story shows “if you work hard, if you believe in your dreams” they can come true, and what Trump tapped into by launching his own crypto memecoin. It’s selling a fairytale about how to succeed, to a generation that can’t even remember what an economic boom felt like.\n\nJoseph Boam tells me he is a property developer, who runs two other businesses on the side. He is also only 22, very nervous, and accompanied by his mum, proudly clutching a copy of his speech. Boam only joined Reform last summer, and when he chaired his first branch meeting in December, it was the first time he’d spoken publicly in front of 20 people. Now he’s on stage addressing a packed Leicester auditorium, and will stand as a local election candidate this spring. As a startup party attempting to scale fast from nowhere, Reform offers the ambitious a dizzying rise.\n\nOn stage Boam is businesslike, praising Reform’s “practical solutions to the issues that matter most” and “values that resonate with the challenges young people face today”. He used to be a Tory, he tells me, but that didn’t work out: “I got treated as if I was just someone to throw away. With Reform, I feel more of an equal.” In the Conservative party, he explains, it could have been years before they let him do much. But “with Reform, they want the youth”.\n\nHis story fits a clear pattern. Nicholas Lissack is one of the more vocal young Reformers on X, his feed a mix of demands to deport illegal immigrants, pub selfies with his mates and claims to be living through “one of those rare, seismic moments in history where a once-woke generation is finally waking up”. He has said he posted his first pro-Farage video last June, aged 22, and a week later was meeting the leader backstage at a rally.\n\nThis open-door policy has helped Reform grow a small but noisy online army of influencers tweeting, vlogging, pontificating on GB News and generally ensuring that young right-leaning men (whose political identities are increasingly formed online, not via family and friends) see Reform’s brand first, embodied by someone who looks and sounds like them. (Although maybe not quite like them: for all his talk about backing the “salt of the earth” party, Lissack’s LinkedIn account suggests he attended a fee-paying sixth form college overseas followed by a degree at Durham, a master’s at St Andrews and working as a researcher for journalist Isabel Oakeshott, partner of Reform MP Richard Tice.)\n\nYet there are risks for Reform in taking punts on young men in a hurry, including that of attracting some for whom they don’t go nearly far-right enough. By last autumn, the first glimmerings of intergenerational tensions were emerging. After October’s big Reform party conference in Birmingham, a young hard-right activist called Connor Tomlinson posted on X that it had “felt like someone trying to start a Trump rally during bingo night at Butlin’s”, complaining that the audience was “boomercore”. Tomlinson, who claims to have been suspended from the Conservative party, posted a video of himself apparently on a fringe meeting panel, demanding “mass deportations” – something Farage had ruled out – to loud applause.\n\nIs this very volatile, very online demographic – who are used to seeing trends come and go very fast – interested in Reform for the long haul, or, as with Tate, are they already moving on? Even if they have, perhaps their energy and ability to generate attention have already served Reform’s purpose.\n\nBy the beginning of February, Josh’s branch TikTok account is on a roll, gaining another 12,000 followers. Joseph Boam has made his television debut, on the BBC regional news. Nigel Farage is back to posting on TikTok mostly about immigration, not his Adidas trainers, and views have fallen accordingly. And, after weeks of wildly yo-yoing polling, Reform was averaging around 12% with under-24s, according to YouGov, broadly neck and neck with the Tories again. None of which had stopped the Reform party itself – whose real powerbase (as Surridge keeps reminding me) remains among the middle-aged, not the young – from moving inexorably on up regardless.","summary":"Once, anti-establishment youth disillusioned with mainstream politics headed left.

Both posts hinted that she and her 12-year-old daughter, Dakota, might not currently be in the United States.\n\nIn one of the posts, O’Donnell, 62, shared a selfie taken from behind the wheel of a car, with a caption noting that she was driving on the opposite side of the road compared to the U.S., suggesting they could be in the U.K. or Ireland.\n\n“Bought a little used car to tool around the countryside on the wrong side of the road,” the former “View” co-host wrote. “Hit the curb three times – thought I hit a cat !!! #newadventures ❤️.”\n\nIn another post, O’Donnell showed a snap of her daughter in the backseat of the car with a backpack next to her and a tablet in hand. The “League of Their Own Star” wrote in that caption that she was taking Dakota to school, adding that she “can’t wait to walk to school” with her.\n\nO’Donnell has also shared photos on her TikTok which suggest she is in Ireland. \n\nOne pic showed her, her daughter and their black Labrador service dog outside a church next to a street sign with a road name written in Irish — “Bóthar Naomh Mhuire” — above the name in English — and “St. Mary’s Road.”\n\nAnother TikTok post shared Friday included free-form musings that hinted she may be in or have recently visited Ireland.\n\nAmong her notes, she wrote, “now – here my grannys [sic] homeland […] a sense of belonging is what i have found here.”\n\nThe former daytime host has Irish lineage on both her mother’s and her father’s sides.\n\nThe Post reached out to O’Donnell’s rep but did not immediately hear back.\n\nIn 2023, O’Donnell shut down rumors that she said she would move to Canada if Trump won the 2016 election.

Some conservative commentators thought it was a bad idea that would cost the president precious political capital. Others believed Trump should do it despite the guaranteed outrage it would incite on the left. \n\nFor black conservatism to survive, it must aspire to more than just policing the excesses of the progressive left or the fringe right.\n\nThe response from Xaviaer DuRousseau, in particular, caught my attention because the popular influencer and commentator jokingly raised an issue that a particular subset of conservatives rarely expresses openly. \n\nBeing a black conservative and maintaining your cookout credentials is getting soooo hard.\n\nHe ended his post with four crying emojis that made his point crystal clear: Issues that are racially coded and politically charged are hard for black conservatives to navigate. \n\nA unique challenge\n\nMany black conservatives experience this identity crisis — one characterized far more by the “tragic mulatto” trope from 19th- and 20th-century literature than the “Uncle Tom” epithet that is synonymous with racial self-hatred. The tragic mulatto stereotype arose in a culture governed by racial hierarchy. It was associated with mixed-race people who struggled with feelings of alienation in a world that did not accept them as either wholly black or white. \n\nBlack liberals are quick to label their conservative brethren “sellouts” for rejecting progressive politics. White liberals, likewise, have no problem questioning the racial bona fides of blacks who don’t vote for Democrats. A growing chorus of white conservatives also blame Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement for diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as Black Lives Matter, critical race theory, and LGBT radicalism. \n\nBlack conservatism, in many ways, faces a unique challenge. It exists as a racial subgenre within a broader political movement that has traditionally emphasized color blindness and minimized the impact of racism on the current outcomes of black Americans. The only notable exceptions occur when accusations of bias and discrimination are directed at white liberals or at failed progressive policies.\n\nAnyone paying attention to conservative public discourse in the age of social media, however, can see that the right’s approach to race is rapidly evolving. Conservative commentators are increasingly vocal about what they view as anti-white bias in criminal prosecutions, professional sports, media representation, and the job market. This emerging race consciousness is evident in heated online debates about American identity and culture. It also serves as an underlying theme in policy fights over immigration.\n\nA new generation of ‘reconstructionists’\n\nRace is the most visible source of the black conservative identity crisis, but the movement’s mission is equally important to its long-term survival. Today, the most visible black conservatives in America seem focused on increasing Republican representation in politics and growing their brands as right-wing commentators. \n\nThe conservative ecosystem certainly makes room for political operatives and culture warriors. But when black conservatism focuses primarily on boosting voter turnout and participation in elections, it fails to fulfill its core mission.\n\nDonald Trump maintained roughly the same support from black voters as in 2020 — about 13% overall and 20% of men. In fact, he lost black conservatives to Kamala Harris by an 11-point margin. Investing financial, political, and social capital to attract black voters has yielded poor returns. But this does not spell the death of black conservatism.\n\nThe movement needs a new generation of “reconstructionists” focused on strengthening local institutions and individuals rather than politicos and media personalities fixated on national elections. The most crucial task ahead is restoring the traditional family structure that prevailed from the end of the Civil War through the Civil Rights movement.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1950, black men and women were more likely than their white counterparts to be married by age 35. In the 1930s, 65% of black women were married before having their first child. The 1960 Census showed that two-thirds of black children lived in two-parent households. Today, only 33% of black adults are married, 70% of black children are born to unmarried parents, and 45% live with a single mother. These outcomes are worse for blacks than for any other group.\n\nThe most valuable contribution\n\nAlthough the family is the most important institution, it is not the only one. The poor educational outcomes in many urban districts should motivate a new generation of black conservative scholars, educators, and activists to take action.\n\nMany have already risen to the occasion.\n\nIan Rowe, an educator who has spent his career teaching children in the Bronx, opened Vertex Partnership Academies in 2022. This high school’s mission is guided by the four cardinal virtues: courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom. Denisha Allen founded Black Minds Matter, an organization that promotes school choice and empowers black educators working to improve outcomes in their communities.\n\nThese leaders demonstrate that black conservatives need not feel conflicted between their ethnic identity and political ideology, especially when both are grounded in a Christian worldview of human dignity.\n\nFor black conservatism to survive, it must aspire to more than just policing the excesses of the progressive left or the fringe right.\n\nThe movement should also avoid the trap of believing that electoral politics alone can drive social progress. The most valuable contribution black conservatives can make today is to leverage their cultural competency, experience, relationships, and expertise to build institutions that can radically improve social and economic outcomes in the cities and communities they care about most.","summary":"Ben Shapiro’s recent video arguing President Trump should pardon Derek Chauvin elicited passionate responses on social media.

Now, after she was abruptly fired from her civil service job, her days of supporting the president are over. Piggott is among more than 125 people dismissed in February from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service in Parkersburg, West Virginia, unsettling a community that voted overwhelmingly for Republican President Donald Trump. Nobody that I've talked to understood the devastation that having this administration in office would do to our lives, Piggott, 47, told Reuters in an interview, saying she would not have supported Trump if she knew then what she knows now. As much as I think that President Trump is doing wonderful things for the country in some regards, I don't understand this at all, she said. Piggott worked at BFS for five years and had recently been promoted. That promotion made her a target as the Trump administration began firing thousands of probationary federal workers - a group that includes new hires but also existing workers moving from one internal position to another. The renunciation of allegiance to Trump by Piggott, a church-going conservative and three-time Trump voter, comes as political analysts are parsing early signs of a possible backlash in Republican strongholds where the government-slashing efforts of the president and his cost-cutting czar Elon Musk are beginning to be felt. A White House spokesman told Reuters that Trump had been given a popular mandate to overhaul the federal government to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. Trump edged out his opponent, Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris, by 1.5 percentage points in the November contest. The personal financial situation of every American is top of mind for the president, which is why he's working to cut regulations, reshore jobs, lower taxes, and make government more efficient, Harrison Fields added. The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Riley Moore, who represents Parkersburg in the House of Representatives, and Senator Jim Justice did not respond to requests for comment. Senator Shelley Moore Capito told Reuters that while she understands the concerns some have about the DOGE cuts, she supports the Trump administration's efforts to right-size government. Trump spoke at length about eliminating unnecessary programs during his address to Congress on Tuesday but made no mention of the mass government firings that have roiled the country. So far 100,000 workers have been fired or taken a buyout. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Americans' attitudes toward Trump are so far essentially unchanged since he began firing federal workers in February. As of March 4, his approval rating was holding steady at 44%. West Virginia is also strong Trump country. He won the state in November with 70% of the vote, among his biggest victories. Still, the economic impact of the mass dismissals across America may not be felt immediately. A handful of Republican voters who lost their federal jobs joined Democrats for a rally of more than 100 people protesting the cuts near the two BFS office buildings in Parkersburg last week, cheering on a local union leader as he criticized Trump and Musk while standing next to a large Fat Cat balloon. Support for Trump's shrinking of government can, however, be heard in places around Parkersburg - a middle-aged couple singing DOGE's praises over breakfast at a local diner; a hotel patron saying remote workers deserved to be fired; a young bartender lamenting federal workers' relatively high pay. In interviews with three dozen workers, business owners and politicians in Parkersburg, which sits at the convergence of two rivers including the mighty Ohio, nearly all said Trump's focus on cutting government spending was a worthy goal. But most said they knew BFS employees to be hard-working and didn't see them as the right target if the aim was to eliminate waste. Scot Heckert, a Republican who represents parts of Parkersburg in the West Virginia state legislature, said he was worried that layoffs at BFS, which employs about 2,200 workers in Parkersburg, would devastate the local economy because the workers earned higher-than-average salaries, and because of the looming prospect of another round of cuts. He said his daughter-in-law was among those fired and that he was seeking more information on why so many jobs were eliminated in a seemingly indiscriminate manner before he would commit to backing Trump in the future. People voted for Donald Trump to make a change, he added. It's an unfortunate thing in our community that is plagued with many things as it is. BUSINESS IMPACT To the residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia's fourth-largest city with 29,000 people and the seat of Wood County, the cuts driven by Musk's DOGE feel like the latest in a series of economic blows. Parkersburg has lost a third of its population over the past five decades, mirroring a hollowing out of manufacturing across the state. The glass producer Corning sold its Parkersburg factory in the 1990s, and in 2005 a major shovel plant buffeted by Chinese competition closed. BFS, which manages the federal government's accounting and payment systems, is a provider of stable, solid-paying jobs in Wood County, where the median household income is two-thirds the national average and 14% of the population lives below the poverty line. The community is now bracing for another round of layoffs, with all government agencies ordered to make plans to cut career staff by March 13. That could mean hundreds more cut at BFS. Business owners in Parkersburg said they were worried that more job losses would ripple through the economy in the form of depressed spending on everything from clothing to rent. The owners of the Blennerhassett Hotel, a fixture of downtown Parkersburg for more than 130 years with its turreted brick facade, have already told staff that seasonal hiring will be kept to a minimum for the usually busy summer months. It's a major economic disaster for our community, said co-owner Wayne Waldeck, likening the potential scale of the expected job cuts to another factory leaving town. Parkersburg Brewing, a local bar and eatery, is also worried about a hit to demand. Roughly one-sixth of the brewery's 65 members, who pay an annual fee for a larger pour and other perks, work at BFS, manager Samantha Gibbs said. They have the extra money to come spend at places like this and give back to the community, and now a percentage of that is lost, she said. That's going to affect us tremendously. West Virginia ranks third among the contiguous 48 states in the percentage of its total workforce - 3.7% - in federal jobs, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. That's about double the national average. Only Virginia and Maryland, the two states closest to Washington, are higher at 4.6% and 5.9%. John Deskins, an economics professor at West Virginia University, said he is worried about potential job losses at other large federal facilities in the state. We stand to suffer a disproportionate share when those jobs disappear, when that income disappears, he added. VETERANS CAUGHT IN LAYOFFS Roger Conley is a Trump supporter who left the Republican Party last year because he thought it was too liberal. In a Facebook post before BFS workers were cut, Conley said DOGE was acting like any successful business in boosting efficiency and wondered why anyone would question its moves to lower costs. Then his son lost his job at BFS, according to union members. In a February 20 Facebook post, Conley said while he still backed Trump, he questioned the need to fire so many people so quickly and whether Musk was the right person to lead the effort. When reached by phone, Conley declined to comment. His son did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story. Meanwhile Piggott, who like other fired probationary employees received no severance, faces an uncertain future. She said she and her husband, a disabled military veteran, have been discussing ways to make ends meet including selling their home. She teared up when talking about how many veterans, who make up about 30% of the federal workforce, had lost their jobs at BFS and other agencies. One veteran caught up in the BFS layoffs was Chauncy James, who was promoted twice during his 18 months at BFS, the second time to building maintenance. James, 42, said he too worries about making his mortgage payment and feeding his five children. At last week's rally he marched with a sign criticizing Musk and said he regretted voting for Trump. They are pretty much just coming here, chopping heads off, without really doing their homework, James said. He got elected president and he's doing a lot of things that people never even imagined that he was going to do to us.","summary":"Jennifer Piggott, a former Trump supporter, regrets her choice after being fired from her job at the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Fiscal Service.

But I consoled myself with thoughts of how terrible the alternative – the vacuous Kamala Harris – would have been.\n\nI reminded myself that on a number of issues – securing the southern border with Mexico to stop illegal mass migration, ending the billions being spent on net-zero nonsense, cutting taxes and stifling regulations, a war on wasteful federal spending, an all-out attack on urban crime, stopping transgender operations on the young, banning men from competing in women's sports – he was more right than wrong.\n\nPerhaps second time round Trump would be a bit more mature, a little less unpredictable, somewhat more aware of the dignity the presidency should embody, more focused on his legacy than the next day's headlines.\n\nYes, he would deploy unorthodox means and there would be much too much exhausting sound and fury. It would clearly not be a time for those of a gentle or nervous disposition. But if it got results, so be it. And didn't complacent, corrupt Washington need some stirring up anyway?\n\nThe last seven days have confirmed what those of us prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt have, in our heart of hearts, always feared: that he is an unprincipled, narcissistic charlatan\n\nWell, how wrong can you be? The last seven days have confirmed what those of us prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt have, in our heart of hearts, always feared: that he is an unprincipled, narcissistic charlatan.\n\nFor him, freedom and democracy – the core values of the country he leads and of the Atlantic Alliance which has united America and Europe for almost 80 years – mean nothing. Because the interests of Donald J Trump are everything.\n\nIn Trump World dictators are feted and revered, democratic allies dumped and disparaged.\n\nMight is right, the spoils go to the strong, the weak deserve only opprobrium. Dependency is weakness. So if you depend on America, for markets or defence, then you can be certain Trump will mistreat you.\n\nIndeed, being an ally serves little purpose: Trump will still slap tariffs on your exports (Mexico, Canada) and threaten to seize your territory (Canada, Greenland, Panama).\n\nThe brutal reality of all this unfolded last week, the grimmest seven days for Western democracy in modern times.\n\nThis week it became clear that, under President Trump, we can no longer count on America as the keystone of the Atlantic Alliance – that when it comes to Europe's future security it will increasingly be on its own.\n\nThis is no longer just a matter of Europe picking up more of the Nato defence burden, which is long overdue and happening at last. It is the prospect of Nato without America at all.\n\n'I want to believe the US will stay by our side,' President Macron said in a prime-time broadcast last night 'but we have to be ready if they don't'. He's right.\n\nThe end of a US-led Nato alliance is bad enough. But it's even worse than that.\n\nTrump's America is not just an unreliable ally – it now behaves as if it's batting for the other side. Faced with a choice between Europe and Russia, Trump gives every impression that he'd choose Russia.\n\nThis week a French senator said 'we are fighting a dictator [Putin] supported by a traitor [Trump]'.\n\nThose of us who wished for better should have known better. It was on January 6, 2021, that the real Trump was in view for all to see. Pictured, the Capitol riots in Washington DC\n\nOver the top? Perhaps. But consider what's happened in just the past couple of days. The man who promised to stop the Ukraine-Russian war on day one of taking power decided instead on day 42 to stop all further US military aid to Ukraine – while looking at ending economic sanctions that hurt the Kremlin.\n\nNot content with one bodyblow to Ukraine, he followed up with a second – freezing Kyiv's access to vital intelligence data – which immediately undermined its ability to deal with Russian attacks.\n\nWithin 24 hours Russia mounted one of its biggest ever bombardments on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, unleashing more than 250 missiles and drones on power and gas facilities in one night.\n\nTrump aides like to stress the weapons and intelligence bans are only temporary. But no matter how much grovelling President Zelensky does since he dared to stand up to the US President last Friday in the Oval Office (and he's done a lot), Trump just turns the screw.\n\nIt's becoming clear that Trump wants to see the back of Zelensky and have him replaced with someone more pliable.\n\nSenior Trump aides have even held secret talks with Zelensky's political opponents and, from Trump down, the US administration has taken to parroting Kremlin talking points about the need for a general election in Ukraine (not easy when your country has been invaded and is part-occupied by the invader).\n\nThus is the White House now aligned with the Kremlin, which has long wanted rid of Zelensky.\n\nPerhaps that explains why Trump, as he humiliates the Ukrainian leader, puts no pressure on Putin whatsoever.\n\nHe claims there are 'strong signals that they [Russia] are ready for peace', without a scintilla of evidence. He's already assured Putin there's no question of Ukraine being allowed to join Nato.\n\nThe Kremlin's less-than-friendly response was to say that any deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine would be regarded as a declaration of war on Russia by Nato, which pretty much scuppers Sir Keir Starmer's hopes of deploying a Franco-British peacekeeping force (for which much thanks – it was always going to be fraught with difficulty).\n\nThe brewing Musk-Trump war that could ruin MAGA, revealed to ANDREW NEIL by GOP whistleblower\n\nThere will be peace talks in Saudi Arabia next week and Zelensky is expected to attend. Trump, probably realising he's overdone the love-in with the Kremlin, yesterday threatened more sanctions if Russia continued its aerial attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure.\n\nAmid the confusion it is important, in these testing times, to stay clear-headed. As Trump tries to discombobulate us with all manner of bluster, it's worth holding on to some self-evident, fundamental truths.\n\nThere is an invader (Russia) and a victim (Ukraine). There is a democracy (Ukraine) and a dictatorship (Russia). There is a country which wants to be a democratic European market economy (Ukraine) and another that hates democracy, freedom, markets and everything else the West stands for (Russia).\n\nThat we have a US president who sides with the invader and penalises the victim is proof our world has turned upside down. Europe, with Britain playing a pivotal role, must do all it can to fill the gaps, as it's already starting to do.\n\nWhatever happens, Europe – even if Trump comes to his senses – must prepare for a future without America. It was already starting to realise as much before Trump pulled the rug from under Ukraine. It can now be in no doubt – and must rearm accordingly.\n\nOf course peace must still be given its chance. But not a loser's peace, which is what Trump looks like forcing on Ukraine. Whatever the parameters of any peace deal, it cannot leave Ukraine too weak to fend off Russia when Putin feels it's time to finish the job.\n\nThere is a difference between peace and capitulation. When it comes to Ukraine, it is not clear Trump knows the difference. What can he care of democracy in Ukraine when he encouraged the mob to overthrow the result of a democratic election in America?\n\nThose of us who wished for better should have known better. It was on January 6, 2021, that the real Trump was in view for all to see. He did not even try to hide from us what he was.\n\nWhat fools we were not to take him at his own estimation but to think he could amount to something better. We have no right to be surprised that the man who tried to overturn democracy in his own country doesn't give a damn if it's now snuffed out in Ukraine.\n\nUkraineRussiaNATODonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump is an unprincipled, narcissistic charlatan who doesn't give a damn about democracy: ANDREW NEIL\n\nAdd comment","summary":"For Trump, freedom and democracy - the core values of the country he leads and the Atlantic Alliance which has united the US and Europe for 80 years - mean nothing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14474223/Donald-Trump-unprincipled-narcissistic-charlatan-democracy-ANDREW-NEIL.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/07/17/95959585-0-image-m-13_1741369330325.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 01:40:00","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":297921074,"title":"Charles Barkley calls Canadians 'fools' for breaking Wayne Gretzky's heart over Trump friendship","text":"Former NBA MVP Charles Barkley took aim at Canadians who have been critical of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky in recent weeks.

In fact, they live in terror of physical threats from the unhinged MAGA cult, and they’re already getting attacked by Democrats for voting to gut Medicaid. So what do they have to lose in the end? \n\nWell, reelection, for one.\n\nA new poll from KFF Health News confirms just how idiotic and politically dangerous the GOP’s Medicaid cuts are. \n\nJust 5% of Democrats and 14% of independents want Medicaid funding decreased. And among Republicans, just 33% want Medicaid decreased, 24% want it to be increased, and 43% are happy with the way it is now. \n\nBut here’s the kicker: Among rural voters, just 23% want Medicaid funding decreased, and among rural Republicans, that number is just 35%. And it’s no surprise, since Medicaid is disproportionately a rural program. \n\nAmong rural voters, 75% say Medicaid is “very important” to their communities, and 23% say it’s “somewhat important.” And among rural Republicans, 95% say Medicaid is either “very” or “somewhat important.” Holy moly! \n\nNone of this should be particularly surprising, given how beneficial to Republicans Medicaid has proven to be.\n\nIn 2023, a Georgetown University report found that six states—New Mexico, Louisiana, Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, and Arkansas—had at least half of children living in rural areas and small towns covered by Medicaid. Five of these are red states—four solid red. \n\nAnd the 10 states with the most children on Medicaid in small towns and rural areas were all deep red: Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Ohio, Arkansas, and Indiana.\n\n“Non-elderly adults and children in small towns and rural areas are more likely than those living in metro areas to rely on Medicaid/CHIP for their health insurance. As a consequence, reductions in federal Medicaid funding being contemplated in Congress are more likely to cause greater harm to rural areas and small towns than metro areas,” the report said. \n\nAnd it is within that context that Republicans voted to gut the program. \n\nAs I noted earlier this week, there was a historical reversal in voting habits in the 2024 election. Trump won voters making less than $50,000, while Kamala Harris won those making over $50,000, signaling that Democrats have become the party of the educated while Republicans are the party of the poor. \n\nBut as effective as their culture war has been in moving low-income demographics in their direction, GOP policies aren’t following suit. \n\nTrump is fixated on inflation-fueling trade wars and mass deportations, crypto bros, vulgar Gaza fantasies, gutting the federal workforce and programs that directly help people, and—of course—tax cuts for billionaires. \n\nRepublicans realigned the working class and made them theirs, but now they’re giving them nothing in return.\n\nDemocrats’ future electoral prospects depend on keeping their current coalition while clawing back some of the working class. Yes, most are deep in the cult and aren’t going anywhere. But remember, flip just 10% of Trump voters—or activate 10% of non-voters—and it’s a completely different election. \n\nThat’s the challenge. Now we need to make it happen.","summary":"House Republicans shot themselves in the foot by voting for a “budget blueprint” that will cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years, paving the way for yet another tax cut for Elon Musk and his billionaire pals. \n\n\n\nIt was a vote so transparently toxic that “moderate” Republicans justified their vote by claiming it’s just a “starting point,” not an actual budget cut.

Smith If They Ran Against Each Other For President","text":"We're just a few months removed from an intense presidential election, but this is America, dammit, so we're already looking ahead to the 2028 election. And considering how badly the Democrat Party is down right now after Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump, its disgusting display this week during the President's speech to a joint session of Congress and a pair of cringe-inducing videos — one of which featured a purple-haired congresswoman who kind of looks like Witchiepoo from HR Pufnstuf dropping some Gen Z lingo, fam — the party is looking for a 2028 candidate from outside the traditional rank and file. Enter: Stephen A. Smith, he of ESPN and a brand new $100 million contract. Smith's name has been tossed out as a potential candidate in 2028. As of late, Smith himself has seemingly become disillusioned by the Democrat Party so maybe he'd want to go about changing the face of it. But, if that happens, don't be shocked if OutKick founder Clay Travis gets in on the fun and runs for the Oval Office against Smith, because he says it'd be a landslide victory in his favor. Clay was a guest on Fox News Channel on Friday alongside 32 Advisors founder and CEO Robert Wolf, who talked about the lack of a clear leader for the party and floated Smith's name. \"Look, if Stephen A. Smith wants to run for president as a Democrat, I will run for president as a Republican and I will beat and I will beat him in 40 states,\" Clay said. I'd actually feel bad for him. I'd wipe the floor with him.: Clay then said he'd wipe the floor with Smith worse than the Lakers wiped the floor with the Mavericks in the Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade and that he was the reigning Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles while Smith was the perpetually-rebuilding Chicago Bears. The Quick Math Is In Clay's Favor Now, I think I speak for all of America when I say we need to see this. The debates alone would be electrifying. You'd get a pair of sharp dudes sparing over ideas instead of some folks trading talking points or an old guy getting wheeled out Weekend At Bernie's-style so that the party had an excuse to take him behind the shed and end his reelection hopes Ol' Yeller-style. And if we got an election, I don't think Clay's 40 state prediction is that far off. Sure, I play for the same team, but let's do a little thought exercise. I think we can give Stephen A. New York, California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, and Vermont. Now, I think we can all agree that Clay would probably win every state with an SEC school and every state with a Big 10 team I didn't already give to Smith — and that includes Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Also, Big 12 states? That's Clay Country. So according to my cocktail napkin election map, might be well on his way to 40 states. Now, who knows what will happen between now and November 2028, but I think it will certainly be interesting.","summary":"OutKick founder Clay Travis called his shot saying he&apos;d beat Stephen A Smith in 40 States if they ran for president against each other.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/clay-travis-says-hed-wipe-floor-stephen-a-smith-ran-against-each-other-president","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/03/clay-stephen-a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 23:57:38","author":"Matt Reigle","authors":["Matt Reigle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":297893546,"title":"In Reversal of Renaming, Base Is Again Fort Bragg","text":"FORT BRAGG, N.C. -- The sprawling Army base in North Carolina had long been named for Braxton Bragg, an incompetent Confederate general who owned enslaved people.\n\nThen in 2020, Congress moved to strip the base of its name, mandating a new one. The base was renamed Fort Liberty as part of the U.S. military's examination of its history with race. But Donald Trump and other conservatives raged against the changes, arguing that \"wokeness\" was softening the military and wiping away important elements of American tradition and heritage.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to restore the old name, and his pledge was brought to fruition Friday, but with a twist that seemed both a rewriting of history and an internet troll: Fort Liberty again became Fort Bragg, not in honor of the Confederate general but in memory of Pvt. Roland L. Bragg, a previously obscure infantryman who had served at Fort Bragg and fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.\n\nThe official ceremony at the military base Friday cemented a political victory for Trump, who suffered a legislative defeat in 2020 when Congress pushed past his veto of a bill with a provision to rename nine Army bases that had honored treasonous Confederate generals who fought against the United States to preserve slavery and white supremacy.\n\nThose bases were renamed for candidates that \"embody the best of the United States Army,\" according to the naming commission that recommended the initial changes. They included decorated officers, enlisted troops who survived harrowing trials in battle, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and one civilian: Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, a Civil War surgeon and the only woman ever awarded a Medal of Honor.\n\nVeterans, politicians, Roland Bragg's relatives and current service members attended the renaming event, which featured a ceremonial unfurling of the new Fort Bragg colors.\n\nThe reversion of Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg is part of a larger effort by Trump -- through Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth -- to purge the military of top officers, diversity initiatives, transgender service members and other policies and personnel that he said had made the armed forces \"woke.\"\n\nArmy officials stressed during the official ceremony that their intention was to honor Roland Bragg, not the Confederate general. They hosted members of Bragg's extended family at the event, and spoke of his valor and courage while fighting the Nazis in Europe. They described one episode in which the soldier escaped capture and regrouped with his comrades by knocking out an enemy soldier and driving a German ambulance through enemy lines.\n\n\"Fort Bragg is named after Roland L. Bragg,\" Lt. Gen. Gregory Anderson, the mission commander at Fort Bragg, replied when asked about the base name's ties to the Confederacy.\n\n\"He's one of us,\" he added of Bragg. \"He's cut from the same, you know, cloth we are. That's what I think about.\"\n\nDiane Watts, Bragg's daughter, said she was unaware of Hegseth's order to change the name of the base to honor her father until a local reporter in Maine called her to ask about it. She had assumed it was a prank call.\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether she thought her father's name might be being used for political purposes, Watts replied: \"I don't think that's the case. I really don't. I think that they looked for a man of good character, and they found my dad.\"\n\nDaniel Driscoll, the Army secretary, attended the renaming ceremony but declined to answer questions.\n\nThe cost of renaming the Army bases named for Confederates was estimated at about $39 million, covering expenses like replacing the signage and removing old references to the bases' outdated names.\n\nCol. K. Mixon, the garrison commander for Fort Bragg, estimated that the costs to reverse the changes there would be less than $1 million. Businesses and street signs near Fort Bragg in nearby Fayetteville, North Carolina, still referred to Fort Liberty on Friday. The nearby Army Airborne & Special Operations Museum on Friday featured merchandise with the name of Fort Liberty as well as shirts with the words \"Bragg is back!\"\n\nThe original naming of the nine Army bases was part of a movement to glorify the Confederacy and advance the Lost Cause myth that the Civil War was fought over \"states' rights\" and not slavery.\n\nThese Confederate generals were at first pariahs after the Civil War. But by the height of the Jim Crow era, they were idolized by many Americans, especially in the South.\n\nIn 2020, amid racial justice protests in many American cities after the murder of George Floyd, an overwhelming majority of Congress pushed past Trump's veto of a military policy bill to strip the names of Army bases named for Confederates, starting the process to give the installations new names.\n\nIn 2023, Fort Bragg was officially renamed, along with eight other Army bases originally named for Confederates.\n\nBut Trump, who has repeatedly defended monuments honoring Confederates, had vowed during the 2024 campaign to revert the name of Fort Bragg to honor Braxton Bragg, the Confederate general, who was widely considered by his fellow Confederates and many historians to have been a poor commander.\n\nVice President JD Vance had also falsely claimed while campaigning near the base last year that Vice President Kamala Harris had directed the changing of the name of the base during the Biden administration, rather than a bipartisan, veto-proof majority of Congress in the final days of Trump's first term.\n\n\"It's Fort Bragg, and we're proud,\" Vance said in Raeford, North Carolina, in October.\n\nOn Monday, Hegseth said that Fort Moore -- renamed in 2023 for Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore and his wife, Julia -- would again be called Fort Benning. The base was originally named for Henry L. Benning, a Confederate and white supremacist. Hegseth again selected an honoree who had the same name, saying that the base was being renamed to honor Cpl. Fred G. Benning, who served during World War I.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"FORT BRAGG, N.C. -- The sprawling Army base in North Carolina had long been named for Braxton Bragg, an incompetent Confederate general who owned enslaved people.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/in-reversal-of-renaming-base-is-again-fort-bragg/article_f2dd43b4-60e2-5c1c-ba67-60d2df4876b5.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 23:04:53","author":"Chris Cameron,North Adams Pride","authors":["Chris Cameron","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.113},{"id":297892484,"title":"Trump pledges to make America the ‘Bitcoin superpower’ at first crypto summit","text":"“Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and crypto capital of the planet, and taking historic action to deliver on that promise,” Trump said.\n\nTRUMP THREATENS NEW SANCTIONS AND TARIFFS ON RUSSIA TO FORCE PEACE TALKS \n\nSeveral industry leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, attended the summit, which was led by White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks.\n\nThe crypto industry enthusiastically embraced Trump’s 2024 campaign as Trump vowed to turn the United States into the crypto capital. Trump sought to appeal to young male voters through his embrace of crypto in his battle against former Vice President Kamala Harris, who failed to propel enough women voters to back her campaign.\n\nIn January, after male and young voters propelled him to victory, Trump launched a cryptocurrency meme coin known as $TRUMP, and first lady Melania Trump launched her own coin, $MELANIA.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 Americans somehow own crypto, according to the report “Global State of Crypto 2024.” The report said the U.S. had the biggest gender gap among the nations surveyed with only 28% of female cryptocurrency holders compared to 72% of male holders.\n\nAn October 2024 Pew Research Survey revealed that 42% of men ages 18 to 29 said they had invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency, compared to 17% of women in the same age range. Among men ages 30 to 49, 36% of men had invested, traded, or used crypto, compared to 15% of women in this age group.\n\nDuring Friday’s gathering, Trump didn’t shy from politics. \n\nTrump attacked former President Joe Biden’s administration for selling off bitcoin and for its alleged “war on crypto.”\n\n“Unfortunately, in recent years, the U.S. government has foolishly sold tens of thousands of additional Bitcoin that were worth billions and billions of dollars had they not sold them,” Trump said. \n\n“They strong-armed banks into closing the accounts of crypto businesses and entrepreneurs, effectively blocking some money transfers to and from exchanges, and they weaponized government against the entire industry,” Trump said. “But I know that feeling also maybe better than you do. All of that will soon be over and we are ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”\n\nIn a light-hearted moment, Trump appeared to quell some fears the American public may have about crypto.\n\n“From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoin knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin. That’s a little phrase that they have,” Trump said. “I don’t know if that’s right or not. Who the hell knows?”\n\n“I also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar-backed stablecoins and the digital assets market,” he said. “I hope lawmakers will send that legislation to my desk before August recess if they can.”\n\nThe president elaborated that the Treasury and Commerce departments would explore new pathways to accumulate additional bitcoin holdings for the reserve, with the caveat that taxpayers would not foot the bill.\n\nSacks, the crypto czar, was among a handful of administration leaders at the summit, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Small Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler, one of the only women at the event among a sea of men.\n\n“We’re going to position the United States as a leader among nations in the digital asset strategy. It’s important for the United States to recognize this fact and get ahead of the other nations in the digital age,” said Bessent. \n\n“This is truly a historic day. And as a crypto founder, I couldn’t be more proud to be part of your administration,” Loeffler added. “And under your administration, we are truly going to enter into the golden age. And I’ll just say, as the administrator of the SBA, small business is a tremendous network that crypto can be deployed against, and so the SBA is open to crypto.”\n\nBefore the summit, Sacks told reporters, “The objective of the summit today is taking feedback and advice from the industry. We promised to do that during the campaign.”","summary":"At the first-ever White House crypto summit, President Donald Trump reassured cryptocurrency industry leaders that his administration would work to help legitimize the burgeoning financial system after reluctance under the previous administration.

I wish you would speak out, because your voice would be so meaningful to your fans who love you, to your community members who need you, to folks who can use just a little solidarity right now.’\n\n‘No one’s asking you to solve the conflict of the Middle East. Just say that you stand with your Jewish friends, colleagues, and neighbors against hatred and what’s happening on our college campuses and in our schools and to Jewish-owned businesses is totally unacceptable.’\n\nGal Gadot also took to the stage to receive the Anti-Defamation League’s International Leadership Award.\n\nGadot, 39, repeatedly declared her pride being an eighth-generation Jewish Israeli during her 12-minute acceptance speech where she called for the release of the dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.\n\n‘With every hostage release we hear new testimonies of the horrors they’ve been through. Every minute for them is hell. Their lives are in danger and we need them home,’ Gal said to uproarious applause.\n\n‘None of us can ignore the explosion of Jew hatred around the world anymore. We have had enough of Jew hatred we will confront anti-Semitism. We will call it out, but but we will never let it, not only, defeat us but define us because our love is stronger than their hate.’\n\nHours later, Gadot wrote that this moment is about everyone ‘refusing to be silent in the face of anti-Semitism.’\n\n‘October 7 was a wake-up call, but it also reminded us of our resilience and unbreakable bond,’ the Israel Defense Forces veteran – who boasts 133.6M social media followers – wrote on Instagram.\n\n‘We must continue to educate, share our stories, and stand up against hate — because love will always be stronger.’\n\nOn Monday, Gadot shut down outrageous claims from a viral post alleging she pulled out of presenting the best documentary Oscar, which went to Palestinian director Yuval Abraham’s film No Other Land.\n\nThe Wonder Woman alum’s representative told DailyMail.com that the rumors were completely untrue as she was always supposed to present the Oscar for best visual effects on Sunday alongside her Snow White co-star Rachel Zegler.\n\nGal portrays the Evil Queen in Disney’s Snow White, which hits US/UK theaters March 21.\n\nLast month Schwimmer – who has been among the most outspoken Jewish celebrities \n\n took to social media to urge the Tesla CEO to ‘stop giving West a megaphone’ on the platform. \n\nThe actor – whose account on X is currently suspended – uploaded screenshots of the rapper’s recent unhinged rants on what is formerly known as Twitter. \n\n‘This is so 2022,’ he began in the caption. ‘We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk.’\n\n‘Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence.’\n\nSchwimmer continued, ‘His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews.’ \n\n‘I don’t know what’s worse, the fact that he identifies as a Nazi (which implies he wants to exterminate ALL marginalized communities including his own).’ \n\n‘Or the fact that there is not sufficient OUTRAGE to remove and ban him from all social media at this point. Silence is complicity,’ David concluded in his message to Elon. \n\nA day later West’s account was deactivated following his vile tirade – however it has since been reinstated.\n\nMusk began his acquisition of Twitter back in April 2022, which was then concluded that same year in October. \n\nThe SpaceX founder has been vocal about censorship and an advocate for free speech. \n\nSchwimmer’s account on X is currently ‘suspended’ although it is not exactly known when that took place. \n\nLast month West – also known as Ye – took to X where he labeled himself as a Nazi and also asked President Donald Trump to free Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs. \n\nThe music artist further sparked outrage when he mocked Cassie’s assault by Diddy – who is currently in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. \n\nKanye has also since taken to the social media platform to say he has ‘dominion’ over his wife Bianca Censori and branded her controversial naked Grammys dress the ‘best look of all time.’ \n\nWest was first accused of anti-Semitism in 2022 after making a series of racist remarks. However, he later apologized, insisting it was not his ‘intention to hurt or demean’ the Jewish community.\n\nYet in a rambling U-turn, Kanye penned a series of tweets on X on Thursday, claiming that he will never ‘trust or work with Jewish people’ again and insisting he ‘will not apologize’ for his views. \n\nAmong his most shocking tweets in the hours-long tirade, Kanye proudly declared: ‘I AM A NAZI’, later adding: ‘I LOVE HITLER NOW WHAT B*****S.’ \n\nThe troubled rapper also addressed concerns that his wife Bianca Censori is a victim of coercive control after her naked outing at the Grammys, claiming he has ‘dominion’ over her.\n\nKanye, who took aim at several minority groups in his foul-mouthed tirade, went on to state that ‘IF I LOST EVERYTHING ‘AGAIN TONIGHT WAS WORTH IT I CAN DIE AFTER THIS’, while also insisting he was ‘sober’ while tweeting.\n\nHaving voiced his support for incarcerated rapper Diddy, Kanye doubled down by saying he would ‘never speak again’ to anyone who disagreed with him, while also using homophobic slurs to lash out at those who supported Kamala Harris.\n\nKanye also went on to lash out at the ‘woke’ decision to use female plus-size models in fashion shows. \n\nHe then unleashed a vile anti-Semitic diatribe after claiming hours earlier that the Jewish community control the narrative.\n\nRetracting his 2023 apology, he tweeted: ‘IM NEVER APOLOGIZING FOR MY JEWISH COMMENTS I CAN SAY WHATEVER THE F**K I WANNA SAY FOREVER WHERES MY F***ING APOLOGY FOR FREEZING MY ACCOUNTS SUCK MY D**K HOWS THAT FOR AN APOLOGY.’\n\nHe went to make unfounded claims that the Jewish community are responsible for aborting black children. \n\n‘BE CLEAR YOU JEWISH N****S DONT RUN ME NO MORE THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND THIS IS MY FREE OPINION YOU ABORT BLACK CHILDREN FOR STEM CELLS ABORTION IS MURDER AND ITS PUSHED ONTO THE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES.’\n\nCalling on anyone who works for him but disagrees with his views to ‘quit’, he went on to claim he wouldn’t work with any Jewish people again.\n\nInsisting he was sober while making these remarks, he tweeted: ‘AINT NOBODY RAMPED UP EITHER IM CALM AS ICE THIS HOW I REALLY FEEL HOW I REALLY FELT AND HOW I WILL ALWAYS FEEL F**K ALL OF YOUR F**K A** UNFAIR BUSINESS DEALS.’\n\n‘AMY JEWISH PERSON THAT DOES BUSINESS WITH ME NEEDS TO KNOW I DONT LIKE OR TRUST ANY JEWISH PERSON AMD THIS IS COMPLETELY SOBER WITH NO HENNESY [sic].’\n\nHours earlier, he began his rant by addressing incarcerated rapper Diddy who has been locked up at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center since he was arrested last year on sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution charges.\n\nDiddy has vehemently denied all of the allegations and charges against him. He has been denied bail multiple times.\n\nAnd in a seemingly unrelated tweet, he repeated the shocking claims he made in 2018, writing: ‘SLAVERY IS A CHOICE.’\n\nAppearing to go back to defending Diddy, he went on: ‘THEY TRYNA PROVE A POINT AND YALL KNOW THAT YALL F***ING KNOW THAT AND SITTING LAUGHING AT THE F***ING INTERNET ON INSTAGRAM THIS MAN GAVE HIS LIFE TO US THIS MY IDOL THIS MY HERO.’ \n\nThis week, West further sparked fury when he appeared to mock Cassie’s assault by disgraced rapper Diddy in a series of posts on X. \n\nAlongside a screenshot of security footage of Combs assaulting Cassie in a hotel, West wrote, ‘When I [sic] man truly loves a woman he may express it in rage I empathize with both sides.’\n\nUnderneath the same screenshot, he also typed, ‘You have to truly be in love to get to the point of risking everything.’ \n\nHe then added, ‘Hey question if someone were to beat up their girlfriend in public, would that be considered domestic violence, or is that outdoor violence, or is it just public indecency? ….Im just asking for a friend.’ \n\nIn one of his last nonsensical posts, Kanye claimed he had banned from Instagram again – at the time of posting his Instagram account was still active.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFriends icon David Schwimmer has slammed Hollywood stars refusing to speak out&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: David Schwimmer Criticizes Hollywood Friends for Remaining Silent on Important Issues first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/david-schwimmer-criticizes-hollywood-friends-for-remaining-silent-on-important-issues/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Friends-legend-David-Schwimmer-turns-on-two.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 23:00:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.219},{"id":297970362,"title":"NewsBusters Podcast: The Leftist Media Enforcers of Ideological Purity","text":"Reporters like Oliver Darcy and David Folkenflik serve as sounding boards for the radical-left staffers inside liberal media outlets who are furious whenever owners or executives threaten to move any outlet toward the center, or make any move that seems to please President Trump.

The activist, who played a massive role in flipping Pennsylvania for President Donald Trump in 2024, plans on going to the Badger State for two weeks “working to win the Supreme Court election.” \n\n“I just wanted to use my platform to bring attention,” he said. \n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court election is between former conservative Wisconsin Attorney General and Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel and Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who previously represented left-wing groups like Planned Parenthood as an attorney. \n\nThe 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race is expected to be even more expensive than the 2023 election, which shattered national spending records for a judicial contest at $56 million and brought in massive out-of-state spending. In Wisconsin, state Supreme Court justices serve ten-year terms. While the judicial race is nonpartisan, both sides of the political aisle are heavily invested in the results of the election. \n\n“There is no party affiliation on the court, but we all can read in between the lines,” Presler said, calling Crawford a “radical, rabid leftist.”\n\nPresler said one of the largest ramifications of the race is if Crawford wins and Democrats are able to gerrymander the legislative districts to snag two U.S. House seats from Republicans. The seats in their crosshairs are currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin and Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) in the 3rd Congressional District in the western part of the battleground state. \n\nDemocrats’ view of the race as a pathway to power in D.C. is not mere speculation and has been touted openly. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan.13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler has a subject line that reads: “Chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.” Aides of Reid Hoffman notably helped to organize the event, the New York Times reported. Hoffman, reportedly a past visitor to Epstein Island, later contributed to the race along with other left-wing billionaires.\n\n“But winning this race could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026,” the email reads. \n\nA complaint has since been filed against Crawford over the event email, which was sent by a nonprofit that works to boost voter turnout called Focus for Democracy. Crawford and her campaign have denied any wrongdoing, while Republicans view the incident as evidence that she has made a “campaign promise to sell Van Orden and Steil congressional seats.” Crawford’s campaign has not returned Breitbart News’ previous requests for comment.\n\n“It’s not just the Wisconsin Supreme Court,’ Presler said. “It’s potentially taking the House majority away from Republicans, therefore stalling President Trump and taking away his ability to govern and legislate.”\n\nPresler, who is already planning for the next presidential election, said the results of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race could even have “2028 ramifications.”\n\n“I’m already in the mode of working towards presumptive nominee presidential candidate JD Vance in 2028,” he said. “There is no stop to the work that we do, and so I am cognizant that these Supreme Court races are going to impact even the next presidential election.”\n\n“[Gov. Tony] Evers (D) is up in 2026, so, hello, you have a Wisconsin governor’s race as well in just two years,” he added.\n\nAs far as Republican voter morale following Trump’s 312-electoral vote victory in November of 2024, Presler said he still sees a lot of enthusiasm and more excitement than before the state’s 2023 Supreme Court election.\n\n“I always believe that victory begets victory. I think we have a much more likelihood of winning these off-year Supreme Court elections, in part, because of our victory in 2024,” he said.\n\n“And the reason why I say that is if you look at 2023, what did people really have to be excited about? 2022 was an awful year. Kari Lake lost, we lost the governorship in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — and Governor Evers was reelected. Morale was really low,” he said.\n\nTrump’s 2024 victory was, notably, only the second time a Republican presidential candidate has won the state in nearly 40 years — with Trump securing the first win during his 2016 run. Both times, Trump saw a narrow margin of victory, although he has received increasingly more votes during all three of his presidential runs in the swing state. In 2016, Trump beat out Hillary Clinton 47.8 percent to 47 percent, 1,405,284 votes to 1,382,536. In 2020, Biden won the state by a slim margin, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent, but Trump pulled in more votes for himself than in 2016 at 1,610,184. In 2024, Trump won Wisconsin over Kamala Harris, 49.6 percent to 48.7 percent, and secured more votes than in 2020 at 1,697,626.\n\nVideo Source: Matt Perdie / Breitbart News\n\n“I would argue, going into the spring election and, just with what Donald Trump has achieved in three weeks in office, morale is high. And so therefore, this is a base-turnout election,” he said. “If we get Trump voters out, then Brad Schimel will be our next Supreme Court justice.”\n\nOn the state level, the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to hear several high-profile cases, including a challenge to an 1849 abortion restriction (which is currently on hold by the courts), and a lawsuit against Wisconsin Act 10, a law limiting collective bargaining for public sector employees passed in 2011 by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. \n\nElection integrity is also of concern among conservatives like Presler. Soon after the election of Protasiewicz in 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court liberal majority notably undid a prohibition on ballot drop boxes in the state and prompted the Republican-controlled state legislature to redraw State Assembly and State Senate maps. The April ballot also includes a proposed amendment seeking to enshrine voter ID requirements into the state constitution.\n\nIn February, the liberal-leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that a Republican Party official lacked standing to bring a lawsuit challenging the use of a mobile voting van in Racine in 2022 and dismissed the case. Republicans had argued that the van, which was purchased using grant money from a nonprofit backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, was used to boost turnout in a heavily Democratic area in violation state law, and that future use could lead to voter fraud.\n\nThe court did not rule on the merits of the case, meaning voting vans could be used again — and some city officials said they plan to use the van in April in light of the state Supreme Court’s decision. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Democrats and their media allies came out of the gate framing the Wisconsin Supreme Court election as a referendum on abortion, much like every election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. When Roe v. Wade was struck down, Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion restriction went into effect, but was put on hold in December 2023 and is expected to come before the state’s high court later this year.\n\nCrawford has declined to say how she would rule on the law, but she did say in an interview that the government should not regulate abortions, according to a New York Times article with the headline “One of 2025’s Biggest Battles Over Abortion Rights Has Already Begun.”\n\n“I believe as a woman that I should be the one to make decisions about my own body and my health care, together with my doctors,” she said. “I trust other women to make those same decisions.”\n\nPresler contended that Democrats’ approach is not in line with what the majority of Americans are actually concerned about and lauded Schimel’s emphasis on public safety and restoring impartiality to the state’s high court.\n\n“I just think that in this age of information — thanks to people like Elon Musk who has really opened up a platform for free speech — people are understanding … our government with USAID is a really big issue. The border is a big issue. Inflation is a big issue. Having peace, not war, is a big issue. Deporting criminal illegal aliens who are in states like Wisconsin is a big issue,” Presler said. “And so therefore, I would argue that [with] abortion, the Democrats are going to try to make it their top number one priority like they did with Kamala, [but] ultimately, voters are sensing and feeling struggles that are much bigger and have a larger priority in their lives than abortion.”\n\nPresler pointed to the election of gun control activist David Hogg as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as proof Democrats are doubling down on their election strategies despite the results of 2024.\n\n“David Hogg, who is a rabid anti-Second Amendment, and therefore anti-constitution individual — he is quoted as saying there is no right to own a gun. I mean, there is nothing that you could say that is more anti-constitutional when it’s our Second Amendment enshrined into the Constitution,” he said. “The Democrats elected him — they chose him, they voted for him, and they are doubling down. They are tripling down. It seems to me that they have learned nothing from losing the popular vote in 2024.”\n\n“And actually, I celebrate this. I hope they continue to double down on their terrible policies and ideologies that allowed Donald Trump to win the popular vote in 2024,” he continued.\n\n“When your enemy is making a mistake, let them,” he concluded.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.
