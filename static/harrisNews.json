The company recently settled a lawsuit filed last year by Donald Trump (before he was elected to a second term as presidenct) over a 60 Minutes interview with Trump’s election opponent, Kamala Harris. The settlement is widely seen as helping the merger’s chances for approval by the FCC under the Trump administration — and which Colbert criticized upon his return from a hiatus earlier this week.

Whether Collins can retain support among independents and moderate Democrats will have key implications for whether she will be reelected next year.What To KnowMorning Consult released its quarterly poll of senators' approval ratings this week and found that Collins is among four with negative scores.Only 38 percent of Mainers approve of her job performance, according to the pollster, which noted it is a \"record low\" for Collins. Meanwhile, 54 percent disapprove of her performance—a high point in the survey's history, spanning to 2017.That marks a notable decline from the fourth quarter of 2024, when 47 percent of Mainers approved of Collins and 44 percent disapproved, according to Morning Consult. In the third quarter of 2024, 50 percent of Mainers approved, and 42 percent disapproved of Collins.Morning Consult polls are based on a \"three-month roll-up\" of responses from daily tracking surveys among registered voters.Collins last won reelection in 2020 against Democrat Sara Gideon. At the time, most polls suggested Gideon had a lead, but Collins ultimately ended up winning with just over 50 percent of the vote.The only other senators with negative approval ratings in the poll were GOP Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Despite hopes of a blue wave, Democrats are facing a tough Senate map, making Collins' seat a must-win as they aim to regain control of Congress' upper chamber. In addition to Maine—which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 percentage points—North Carolina, which Trump carried by about 3 percentage points, is viewed as Democrats' other top flip opportunity.Who Could Susan Collins Face in 2026 Midterms?On the Democratic side, two candidates have declared their intent to run. David Costello, who ran in 2024 and held several different positions in Maryland, including acting secretary of the state's Department of the Environment, is running again. Jordan Wood, who served as chief of staff to former Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat, is also running.Governor Janet Mills has also not ruled out running. Some Democrats view her as their best chance of winning, as she has also won statewide by comfortable margins.Morning Consult's latest gubernatorial approval ratings, however, also delivered troubling news to Mills, though she was still narrowly above water with Mainers, scoring a +2 approval rating.\"Janet Mills of Maine is term-limited as governor and viewed as one of the Democratic Party's best options to challenge moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins in next year's midterm elections. But she's also the most unpopular Democratic governor in the country, and one of the only to lose popularity since the last quarter of 2024,\" the report reads.Collins has distanced herself from Trump, voting against his signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" over Medicaid cuts. She has long cast herself as the most moderate Republican in the Senate, which has helped her win elections.A Pan Atlantic Research Poll, which surveyed 840 likely Maine voters from May 12 to May 26, had better news for Collins. In that survey, 49 percent of respondents viewed her favorably, while only 45 percent viewed her unfavorably.A Collins spokesperson pointed to that poll when reached by Newsweek.Conversely, a University of New Hampshire poll released last month found that only 14 percent of Mainers view Collins favorably, while 57 percent view her unfavorably. An additional 26 percent were neutral. That poll surveyed 846 Maine residents from June 19 to June 23, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.What People Are SayingNick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, previously told Newsweek: \"No one fights harder for Maine than Susan Collins, and she continues delivering big wins like protecting Social Security for over 25,000 Mainers and millions of Americans.\"Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of Cook Political Report, wrote on X: \"For all the talk of Dem SEN opportunities in NC, TX and even IA, the red lights are really blaring in MAINE, where Morning Consult polling shows Trump underwater by 17 pts. SEN. Collins at -16. And yet NO serious Dem is taking the plunge to challenge her.\"What Happens NextCollins had not made a formal announcement about her reelection bid, but told CNN in May it is her \"inclination to run\" and that she is \"preparing to do so.\"The Cook Political Report classifies the race as \"Lean Republican,\" meaning it is \"considered competitive,\" but that Collins \"has an advantage.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball also classifies the race as leaning toward Republicans.","summary":"A new Morning Consult poll found Collins' approval at a \"record low.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/susan-collins-dealt-new-polling-blow-ahead-2026-midterms-2100479","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2685438/senator-susan-collins-polling.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b986b1eb146df365b8b7e4389630d193","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 22:44:24","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":342696546,"title":"Syria’s Ethnic Clashes Test Trump’s Support for Jihadi President","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters Signup \n\n BREITBART\n\nBiden Autopen Scandal\n\nEpstein Memo\nTexas Flood\nSocialist Zohran\nTariff Talks\nIsrael vs Hamas\n\nSyria’s Ethnic Clashes Test Trump’s Support for Jihadi President\n\n Rami Alsayed/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nJohn Hayward17 Jul 2025 \n\nIsrael / Middle East\nNational Security\nAhmed al-Sharaa\n\nDonald Trump\n\nIslamic State\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nterrorism \n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nExclusive — Sen.

Robert Garcia in a letter Thursday accusing their network of “deceptively” editing a 2024 interview with President Donald Trump to distance the president from disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s “horrific crimes.”\n\nGarcia, who was recently voted the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, asked whether Fox News’ editing of the Trump interview “misled the American people.” He also asked whether Trump or any members of his campaign team “may have interfered” with the channel’s editing process.\n\nFox News, in a statement to TheWrap, said there was “no selective or deceptive editing whatsoever.” \n\nDuring a televised interview on “Fox & Friends Weekend” in June 2024, Trump was asked by Rachel Campos-Duffy if he would “declassify the Epstein files” once elected president.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I would,” Trump said in that airing. \n\nIn a longer answer that aired the next day on “Fox & Friends” and other platforms, the president’s full response was given: “Yeah, yeah, I would. I guess I would. I think that less so because, you don’t know, you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would, or at least—”\n\nAt that point, Campos-Duffy jumped in an asked “Do you think that would restore trust? Help restore trust?”\n\nTrump continued: “I don’t know about Epstein, so much as I do the others. Certainly, about the way he died. It’d be interesting to find out what happened there, because that was a weird situation, and the cameras didn’t happen to be working, etc., etc. But yeah, I’d go a long way toward that one.”\n\nGarcia, in his letter obtained by TheWrap, said the president’s “well documented past social ties” with Epstein and Fox News’ “selective omission raises serious concerns that the network may have deliberately sough to shield then-candidate Trump from any further association with Epstein or the horrific crimes he perpetrated.”\n\nHe added: “It is legitimate to ask whether President Trump himself or those close to him may have actively encouraged this withholding of information from the American people.” \n\nA spokesperson for Fox News reiterated to TheWrap that “there was no selective or deceptive editing whatsoever. Portions of the initial interview that aired on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ with then-candidate Trump on June 2, 2024 had standard editorial cuts for time and the full answer to the Epstein question aired on the following day’s show.”\n\nThe rep continued: “The entire unedited interview was also run on multiple Fox News Media platforms with full transparency on June 3, 2024, including audio, digital and streaming, while the entire transcript was posted on foxnews.com.”\n\nThe full interview is available here; Trump’s answer comes around the 35:30 mark. \n\nGarcia’s letter to Murdoch and Scott came after Paramount recently paid Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit claiming “60 Minutes” had “deceptively edited” an interview with Kamala Harris leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker from Los Angeles added his questioning of Murdoch and Scott is especially important, considering “President Trump’s efforts to punish Paramount.” \n\nCNN was the first outlet to report the letter on Thursday.","summary":"Rep.

The former MSNBC host then claimed, without evidence, that it is Morgan’s “schtick” to make conversations about race.\n\n“First of all, I love the fact that your ‘play the race card’ is your version of the race card. You literally are so fixated on trying to racialize conversations with me, Piers, and I actually find it quite charming,” Reid said in response to Morgan.\n\n“You’ve racialized more conversations in your tenure at MSNBC than any host in history. Come on!” Morgan fired back. (RELATED: Joy Reid Breaks Down In Tears Over Being Canceled By MSNBC)\n\nEarlier in the interview, Morgan asked Reid why she is willing to label President Donald Trump as a “fascist” over his mass deportations, but has no criticism of former President Barack Obama, who earned the nickname “Deporter-in-Chief” during his presidency over his own deportation policies. Reid, who has a long history of obsessing over race, ranted that Morgan’s so-called “schtick” as a “white European” is to “fixate” on race.\n\n“I understand that this is your schtick, Piers. I get that this is your schtick … And it’s so interesting to me that you, yourself, as a white European, find when people of color talk about race, that you believe is racializing conversations. But when people like you fixate on ‘well Barack Obama was a black president, why don’t you object to that?’ That is racializing a conversation about the former president of the United States.”\n\n“I find it hilarious because you’re the one who said Donald Trump is a white fascist, and yet when Obama did the same thing, I’m not allowed to mention his skin color,” Morgan said.\n\nMorgan called Reid a “hypocrite” for attacking Trump, but not Obama, over mass deportations. Reid discredited Trump’s success in securing the U.S.-Mexico border, and accused the administration of conducting “literal terrorism against brown migrants.”\n\nAfter the showdown, Reid accused Morgan of having a “weird [and] negative obsession with black people,” particularly Meghan Markle and other black women.\n\n“Piers definitely seems like a Brit from the old 18th and 19th century school. [He is] thoroughly obsessed with black women in the creepiest possible way. He never misses an opportunity to play gotcha with black guests on his podcast, whom he, like other right-wing podcasters, use as fodder to keep their very white audiences angry, paranoid and clicking,” Reid said.\n\nReid made several racial remarks about white people during her time on MSNBC. She lashed out at white women on Nov. 5 for largely backing President Donald Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris. She further referred to Democrat Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly as “super white” and compared him to a “mayonnaise sandwich on Wonder bread white” in August while discussing Harris’ running mate.\n\nIn April 2022, the former MSNBC host also accused Elon Musk of wanting a return to apartheid because he supported free speech on Twitter. In reality, Musk attended anti-apartheid protests and concerts as a child growing up in South Africa in the 1980s, according to an excerpt from Walter Isaacson’s book, “Elon Musk.”\n\n“There was a time when people had the double hashtags around their names because they were Jewish and right-wingers were saying ‘get in the oven’ anytime you made any benign comment on Twitter. They attacked women, the misogyny was crazy on Twitter for a while. Elon Musk, I guess he misses the old South Africa in the ’80s, he wants that back,” Reid said.\n\nReid further accused Republicans in March 2021 of being willing to trade in tax cuts to “openly say the n-word.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rye said on “The Breakfast Club” that she just has a feeling the election was rigged, floating conspiracy theories to back her sentiment.

And I feel like if something about my Spidey senses are tingling — and they have been since the day after the election when we were all together — I don’t know, something is not right,” Rye said. “There’s the Elections Truth Alliance. I believe — ETA has a whole report on some of the inconsistencies in election results. There is another entity that I can’t think of right now that also has a report on this. Clark County had some irregularities in Nevada.”\n\n“So, I mean, I have questions.

So yeah, I’m not sure, but I definitely don’t feel good about it. It would make me feel better knowing that he stole it rather than this many people would vote for this man.”\n\nLeft-wing media pundits are also already suggesting that the 2026 midterm elections will be rigged in favor of the Republican Party, citing Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” as at least part of the basis for their claims.\n\nFormer MSNBC host Joy Reid said on “The Left Hook with Wajahat Ali” July 3 that she felt it was “insane, honestly, to just assume we’re going to have normal elections next year,” citing Republicans voting in favor of the bill after opposing it.\n\n“[Republicans are] not actually worried about getting reelected,” Reid said. “If they feared being reelected, they would not vote for this bill — because they know it’s going to devastate their states.”\n\nTrump signed the sweeping legislation into law on July 4. It includes a permanent extension of his 2017 tax cuts and delivers on his campaign promises to remove taxes on tips and overtime pay, and permanently raise the child tax credit to $2,200.\n\nDemocrats have been hysterical about the bill becoming law, warning Americans would die due to changes to Medicaid benefits.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The 62-year-old comedian said he is not worried about it.\n\n“You know, unfortunately, we haven’t heard anything from [Paramount or Skydance].

Elizabeth Warren targets price gouging in new bill as tariff costs, inflation increase","text":"With expectations that prices will rise throughout the economy over the summer as more tariffs stack up, a group of legislators on Capitol Hill, highlighted by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), introduced a bill to target price gouging by the market's biggest companies.\n\nThe Price Gouging Bill of 2025 — introduced on Thursday by Warren along with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois), and Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.) — would make price gouging illegal and give the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the power to litigate alleged abuses of market power.\n\nThe proposed legislation comes just days after the June consumer price index showed a resurgence of inflation and as the tariffs toll continues to grow.\n\nWarren says that in the past, big corporations have taken advantage of market shocks, hiding behind factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions to raise prices excessively, but this time the culprit is President Trump's global trade war.\n\n\"Donald Trump's reckless tariff policies are giving companies cover to squeeze families and raise prices more than necessary. My bill is an opportunity for Congress to stand up for families by cracking down on price gouging and fighting back against corporate abuse,\" Warren said in a statement.\n\nThe text of the bill, as seen by CNBC, lists \"abrupt trade policies\" and \"exceptional market shock\" as factors to be considered in analysis of price increases.\n\nA version of the bill introduced last year, The Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2024, did not specify trade policies. That legislation, sponsored by Warren along with former Senator Bob Casey (D-Pa.) was introduced in February 2024, but failed to pass. Casey lost his Senate seat in the 2024 election to Republican David McCormick.\n\nThe price gouging bill would require companies with over $100 million in revenue to publicly report in Securities and Exchange Commission filings on any changes in pricing that exceed the average price in the past 120 days before the reporting period, and provide details on product costs and margins. Businesses with less than $100 million in revenue would be protected from price gouging litigation if they show legitimate cost increases.\n\nThe bill would allocate an additional $1 billion in funding to the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the price gouging law.\n\n\"The biggest corporations in our country jack up the cost of everyday household items, take in record profits, and give their executives huge bonuses – all on the backs of hard-working Wisconsin families,\" said Senator Baldwin in a statement. \"Donald Trump claimed he would lower prices – so far, he has done just the opposite and is even opening the door to more price gouging. ... Our bill will finally crack down on corporate greed and help stop those big companies at the top of the food chain from sticking families with exorbitant costs,\" she stated.\n\nIn second-quarter earnings calls, companies from Costco to Best Buy and Newell Brands cited tariffs as a reason for price increases.\n\nDeluzio said price increases are a result of \"out-of-control\" corporate power. \"Prices are still too high, and inflation is still pounding folks,\" Deluzio said in a statement. \"Especially now, we need to rein in monopolists and other huge corporations with the power to price-gouge the American people,\" he added.\n\nThe AFL-CIO and United Steelworkers both voiced support for the bill and told CNBC that the bill is long overdue.\n\nPrice gouging policy has been criticized on both the right and left in recent history. During Kamala Harris's run for the presidency, Obama economic advisor Jason Furman told the New York Times that a plan to ban grocery store \"price gouging\" was not sound economics. \"This is not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality,\" he told the Times. \"There's no upside here, and there is some downside.\"\n\nDuring a heated CNBC interview in August 2024 about the same Harris plan, Warren said three dozen states, including Florida and Texas, already have price gouging laws and have used them effectively. These state laws are often focused on natural disaster scenarios and acute shortages of goods and services. \n\n\"Pricing gouging laws are not price controls. Price gouging laws are there to say that sometimes markets go off the rails and when they do we need some ways to get them back on the rails. We need some curbs on that behavior,\" Warren said during the August 2024 \"Squawk Box\" interview.","summary":"Elizabeth Warren introduces a price gouging bill to target big companies that use market shocks including a trade war to push through excessive price increases.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/elizabeth-warren-targets-price-gouging-with-tariff-costs-inflation-up.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108133439-1744904050281-gettyimages-2210736895-anotherday18620813_9mp5f6ro.jpeg?v=1752766124","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M07D17/7000382658/1752757254-40761807821-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-17 16:43:16","author":"Lori Ann Larocco","authors":["Lori Ann Larocco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":342582838,"title":"SEN TOMMY TUBERVILLE: The Fed Has Gone Rogue — Fire Jerome Powell","text":"President Donald J. Trump and his America First policies are back, and the American people can feel the momentum. After four years of disastrous open-border policies, skyrocketing inflation, and woke bureaucrats running wild, the tide is finally turning. Thanks to the President’s tariffs and tax cuts, the Trump economic engine is revving back up. Prices are low. The stock market is up. Employment numbers are on the rise. America is returning to energy dominance. Families are finally starting to feel like they’re keeping more of their paycheck. But there’s still one major obstacle standing in the way of unleashing America’s full economic potential — and that’s Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nLet’s cut the bull, Jerome Powell has gone rogue. He’s acting like a coach whose team is down by 2 at the end of the 4th quarter – but instead of kicking a field goal to win the game, they punt the ball. Inflation is at the lowest point in four years under President Trump – but Jerome Powell is still using the old Biden Democrat Socialist playbook. As a result, interest rates are through the roof, borrowing costs are squeezing families, and small businesses are getting crushed. Americans are ready to build, buy, hire, and grow — but the Fed is playing games instead of cutting rates and letting the economy breathe. That’s not just bad policy. That’s sabotage.\n\nThis isn’t his first offense either. Powell’s track record is a mess. Back in 2021, as Biden and the Radical Left were pumping the economy with trillions of dollars in reckless spending, Powell stood in front of the American people and told them inflation was “transitory.” He basically told American consumers to not believe their own lying eyes. But the American people aren’t stupid. They saw prices rising at the pump, at the grocery store, and on every utility bill. What Powell called “transitory” turned out to be full-blown, historic inflation that was here to stay as long as Biden and Powell were the ones calling the shots. (RELATED: Art Laffer Lists Good Reasons To Label Jerome Powell ‘A Political Hack Trying To Get Trump In Any Way He Can’)\n\nAnd when reality finally caught up to him? He panicked. Powell overcorrected, hiking interest rates at a pace this country hasn’t seen in decades. Those rate hikes didn’t just “cool” inflation. They froze out middle-class families trying to buy a home, start a business, or expand their operations. They strangled growth just when Americans needed it most.\n\nBut his head-scratching decisions didn’t end there. Powell flipped the script again and started cutting rates just in time for the 2024 election. Funny timing, isn’t it? After three years of punishing American families with high rates, he suddenly finds religion the minute it looks like Kamala Harris and the radical Democrats are about to get steamrolled by President Trump.\n\nFor those of you keeping score at home – first Powell said inflation was “transitory” and nothing to worry about, then he suddenly cared about inflation and hiked interest rates, then he cut them in a blatant attempt to influence the 2024 election.\n\nLet’s not pretend this wasn’t political. Powell has aligned himself with the D.C. Swamp, the same corrupt system that’s tried everything to stop Donald Trump from putting America First. The Fed is supposed to be independent, but under Powell, it’s acting like the economic arm of the Democrat Socialist Communist Party. Powell isn’t just a bad economist. He’s a symbol of the woke elites that look down on farmers, truckers, teachers, and welders — the backbone of this nation — and thinks they should just sit down and be quiet while the “experts” in D.C. run things.\n\nIn the United States of America, we believe in freedom, faith, hard work, and putting the American taxpayer first. We don’t take orders from the World Economic Forum. We don’t answer to Davos. And we sure don’t let Ivy League elites in glass towers decide whether families in Alabama can afford to buy a house or start a business.\n\nIf your quarterback is fumbling the ball, missing reads, and throwing picks, you bench him. You don’t give him another season; you send him packing. President Trump knows how to win. We need a Federal Reserve that supports that mission, not one that tries to undermine it. This isn’t just about monetary policy, it’s about our future.\n\nIt’s time to fire Jerome Powell and bring in a Fed Chair who understands the America First vision — someone who will fight inflation by empowering American workers, not punishing them. Someone who understands that prosperity starts with cutting taxes, slashing regulation, and letting a free people create, build, and thrive. Jerome Powell had his shot. He blew it. It’s time for a new leader at the Fed.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Building on the excitement and media attention surrounding women’s basketball, the pair are “creating that experience that people can tap into,” Rapinoe says. “We definitely want to continue widening our footprints at these events, to create cool spaces that, frankly, we never had before.”\nThe former athletes, who have been engaged since 2020, have recently become business partners in their burgeoning sports media empire, focusing on live events and experiences for a female sports-fan community that the couple argues has previously been overlooked. “There’s a variety of things that finally ripped the blinders off people to women’s sports, and now they’re seeing all of it when it was already there,” Bird says.\nDuring the COVID pandemic, Bird and Rapinoe turned to social media for community, hosting Instagram Lives for followers. Then they hit pause and finished their professional playing careers—Bird in basketball and Rapinoe in soccer. Post-retirement, the pair launched the live series and a podcast with the help of Vox Media. Since then, they have become fixtures on the media circuit at events like Cannes Lions, SXSW, and WNBA All-Star weekend, interviewing a wide range of guests including JuJu Watkins, Paige Bueckers, Aubrey Plaza, Gabby Thomas, and, most recently, Tara Davis-Woodhall and Hunter Woodhall. Rapinoe and Bird even hosted former second gentleman Doug Emhoff on the podcast while Kamala Harris campaigned for president.\nI attended a live taping of their podcast in May, just hours after the New York Liberty were presented with their 2024 championship rings and won their home opener against the Las Vegas Aces. The fans coming decked in Liberty gear left the game and filtered into Shell’s Loft, a sun-soaked event space in Brooklyn.\nAs fans sipped on the signature cocktail a Home Opener Spritz, sports journalist Pablo Torre was checking out the scene, and in the back of the room, Jason Sudeikis was perched at a high top, in a Liberty sweatshirt and hat. Breanna Stewart, the guest for the episode, barely had a moment to get ready, rushing over immediately after playing for 27 minutes in the game, where she’d put up 25 points and eight rebounds.\nThe expansion of their podcast and live-events business also happens to coincide with a recent surge of interest in the female sports space. By the time Caitlin Clark broke through in the media, Bird and Rapinoe already had an infrastructure in place to feed the desire for regular content and analysis. The pair, who are both Olympic gold medalists and female sports legends in their own right, argue that the fandom and community surrounding women’s sports has always been active, but was deeply suppressed in the media over misogynistic biases. Since the start of their professional careers, “the mechanism for information delivery changed dramatically,” Rapinoe says, with social media allowing for far more access than a news cycle dictated by a daily ESPN highlight reel.\nRapinoe and Bird feel a responsibility to bring expertise and nuance to the female sports media ecosystem, which at the moment feels a bit “land grabby,” Bird says, as new media entrants and investors catch up to a market opportunity that was one vastly overlooked.\n“Over my dead body am I going to be one of the chorus of us who’ve been here a long time, who have helped build this, who is going to not own what is happening in the future,” Rapinoe tells VF.\nVF: When did you both start thinking seriously about the media space after your playing careers?\nMegan Rapinoe: Everybody has a podcast these days, but you don't want to just get on there, talk about yourself, and not really contribute. So I think we were like, being in sports so long, what's missing for women's sports, and where do we see an opportunity. Ultimately, we're building a foundation for women's sports, both for fans who have been here and need a place to go to listen to sports and to be plugged in, and for brands who are looking for places to invest their money in what is a billion dollar exploding business. Almost being like the port of entry for other cultural figures who love sports but maybe haven't been in women's sports.\nSue Bird: I have always been interested in talking about women's sports, even when I was playing. Gosh, rewind, probably 20 years ago, I first tried broadcasting and I realized it wasn't necessarily the perfect fit. I enjoyed it. But I was like, I wish I could do it in a different way. So I always kind of had that swirling in my head. Then the way things played out, the way the landscape of women's sports changed, the way that podcasts became what they are now, which is not just audio, there's video aspects to it. People are watching podcasts on TV. They're coming to the live shows. For me personally, I knew I wanted to continue to talk about sports and now I found the way that fits me most.\nThere's this huge ecosystem that women's sports is entering but you need the voices of the people that really know it to balance the hot takes, to balance people who are maybe just covering it for the first time. I'm not saying no hot takes. You actually need those too, but then you need, like I said, the balance to those, the voices of the people that understand the nuance.\nRapinoe: I love a hot take. I’m the hot take and then Sue’s like, that’s not actually what’s happening.\nYou’ve gone from Instagram Lives to multiple podcasts, to these live events and connecting with your listenership in person. Can you speak to the community that you’ve built?\nBird: Instagram Live was something that we were doing for fun in the pandemic, not just found enjoyment in, but found connection and found community. It did get put on the shelf a little bit as we were finishing our careers. So you fast forward to the actual podcast, and what I'm learning in the building of businesses is you start with something. So we knew we had something in our Instagram Live we're like, let's see how this goes with a live show. We did a trial run at the Sloan conference in March 2024. And we were like, Oh this works. This hits. And so we started our journey from there. What I'm learning is you have an idea, you have like a North Star, and then you have to let it unfold naturally. You have to let it take on its own form organically.\nRapinoe: The community has actually been there the whole time. Sue played in the Final Four three decades ago and it was sold out. The 99’ World Cup was sold out. I look at part of the business of our podcast, and the sort of house that we're building, as servicing what's already there. They just don't have anything to buy, listen to, tap into, subscribe to. There's just so little inventory out there for them. You loved us as players. We have that community, we have that relationship, we have that trust. They're trusting us to give them something, and we're trusting them to show up and to support that. There's just so little out there, but the community already exists. You're seeing it. Every dollar invested in women's sports, like the return is just tenfold, because people want the jersey, they want to go to the game, they want more from the players. They want content.\nMuch has been made about the increasing media attention that women’s sports is getting right now. In the place that the two of you sit, being former athletes, prior to this surge, what has it been like to witness that shift from the other side?\nRapinoe: Gosh.\nBird: D, all of the above. Whatever you’re thinking, all of it.\nWhere I always land is just an incredible sense of pride that women’s sports has taken off in this way. It’s really exciting to watch. We're proper fans, we go to the games, we pay attention, we're tuned in. We're part of the blueprint that got it here. So to actually see it come to fruition is amazing. It could have easily not happened in our lifetime. At the same time, there's been some frustrations around the coverage of the sport and just some of the narratives that have formed that are just false or just a little off or a little wrong. As I'm saying, all of the above, I think, more than anything, it's really just exciting.\nRapinoe: It is so exciting. I think the jealousy I feel is like, I would have loved to play in this era. I'm just imagining myself in this era, like, oh my gosh, I probably would have been a menace, but it would have been so much fun. The players benefit the most, and they are the stars and all that. But it's providing so much more opportunity for people like us, for other women that have podcasts.\nIf you zoom out, this is everything that we've been asking for decades. The Billie Jean Kings and the Williams sisters of the world. This is everything that we've been asking for so long, and it's finally happening. Women's sports are seizing the moment. We’ve never dropped one ball when the moment has come. We've always seized the moment. We've always outperformed. And now, the real money is coming in, the real investment, and it's like being on a rocket ship.\nYou mentioned some unfavorable narratives that have taken hold during this time. How are you looking at the media coverage and whether it’s being doled out equally among players? Do you see your platform as a way to amplify a range of stories?\nRapinoe: I think the mainstream media is uneducated in the deep nuance of women's sports. I don't mean that as a dig but they just have a lack of education because they haven't been following it to the degree necessary to then have an opinion, or a really nuanced take. So I think it's taking some time to catch up. The obvious one is the physicality of the WNBA. The WNBA is physical, if we want to call it differently, okay, but these are the rules. This is the way that the refs are being asked to call the game. So yes, it's going to be physical. The whole league is physical. But in order to have that conversation, you have to have a long history and understanding of the game and the way it's called. It's taking some time to catch up.\nThere's a lot of players and a lot of people who have been in and around women's sports for a really long time, who now have the opportunity for it to be financially viable for them to make their living talking about sports. Not just overlapping with male commentators, frankly, who spend 90% of their time talking about men's sports, who are now just being like, I'll just talk about these sports too. But they're two vastly different ecosystems.\nThe WNBA All-Star game is coming up. I’m curious to hear what your plans are for A Touch More, specifically live events. What could that weekend mean in terms of spotlighting women led media platforms and athletes?\nRapinoe: We’ll be very busy.\nBird: We’ll be there.\nRapinoe: She’ll be very busy. She has another podcast, obviously Bird’s Eye View. You’re doing a live for that. We’re doing a live A Touch More. We’re hosting a little after party. Creating that experience that people can tap into. We definitely want to continue widening our footprints at these events, to create just cool spaces that frankly, we never had before. We’ll be taking over Indy, basically.\nI was at your event in Brooklyn and Jason Sudeikis was there. I’ve seen his support as a particular boon for the league and everyone was taking pictures with him. How has the support from male celebrities looked for you internally?\nBird: If I'm being honest, that is not new. First of all, let me give credit, Jason is a very passionate New York Liberty fan. He goes to the games when he's in LA as well, because he's kind of bicoastal. Jason is definitely ride or die. But honestly, for me personally, men have been a fan of women's basketball, have been a fan of myself for forever. Who stops me on the street more than anybody else?\nRapinoe: It's the wildest, in the wild thing, I’ve ever seen. It's like crossing the street or walking in any city in the whole country. Hi Sue. Adorable.\nBird: So it's really not that surprising. I think that's what's so interesting about this time. There are certainly some things about what's happening in the world of women's sports that are new, don't get me wrong. But then there's some things that are getting highlighted and it's like, you just weren't looking at it before.\nI guess the question then becomes, why did it take so long to have these conversations?\nBird: How much time do you have?\nRapinoe: Um…I think it’s sexism. Broadly.\nBird: It’s the isms. The ways in which it's just been held back. It has always been this way. I was in college, it was my junior year, I hit a game winning shot. The year is 2000 and there's no social media. You're only going to see this so many ways, but it was on the ESPN top 10. Immediately the next day, and then following week, I was getting all kinds of calls from celebrities to the basketball office. I wouldn’t drop names, I don't want to be that person, but it was like NBA players were calling to congratulate me, like, oh, let's exchange information. Actors were calling like, I'm a big fan.\nIt's always been there. That's how suppressed and held back this sport and women's sports in general, has been. The same goes for soccer. Tons of people have been going to your games for years and years and years. There's a variety of things that finally ripped the blinders off people to women's sports, and now they're seeing all of it when it was already there.\nRapinoe: I also think the mechanism for information delivery changed dramatically. So prior, if you weren't watching ESPN and it didn't make the top 10, or the producer didn't choose to talk about women's sports, women's sports weren't talked about. Your Final Fours were sold out, the community's been there. But from a broad cultural perspective, it wasn't spoken about. It was suppressed, it was held back. Women's sports social media just really blew the top off who was getting access to what was actually happening. And then the second that happened, before, Caitlin Clark, before, some of these bigger things, that was already 2000, those moments were already happening.\nBird: If you want a little more of the paper trail, some of the moments are their fight for equal pay, Sedona Prince’s TikTok showing the discrepancies during the bubble NCAA Tournament season, our WNBA bubble season, Kobe Bryant wearing a WNBA hoodie. There’s a whole paper trail of all these moments that eventually got to a tipping point. And yes, Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Paige Beckers, this new generation for basketball plays a huge role.\nDo you feel a sense of responsibility to shape this wave of attention so that it leads to long term change?\nBird: I think we do. We can do it our way. On the podcast, circling back to everything we've already said, speaking on it in a nuanced way. Bringing in history, bringing in expertise.\nWe've gotten past the phase, which is great, of, is this real? Does this have staying power? We've actually gotten past that, it's pretty real, we're legit now. It's here to stay. But now there's this land grabby feel to it. I really encourage people not to do that and to actually be strategic with whatever decision you're making around women's sports. Wherever you want to put your money, whatever player, team, league, whatever it is that you want to be connected to, be strategic with. Don't just throw money at it because you're trying to get in. I think that's going to play a huge role in taking it to the next level.\nRapinoe: Over my dead body am I going to be one of the chorus of us who've been here a long time, who have helped build this, who is going to not own what is happening in the future. We have this opportunity to be one of many crafting what is going to be an unbelievable time in American sports culture, just in general, but in women's sports culture specifically. I think women are going to own the next decades-long phase of American sports culture.","summary":"Ahead of the WNBA All-Star Game, VF caught up with the couple to discuss their A Touch More live podcast business and the mixed emotions of being former athletes during a surge in interest of women’s sports","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/sue-bird-and-megan-rapinoe-are-riding-the-rocket-ship-of-the-female-sports-media-ecosystem","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6877d2c7b768f824e54d462a/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Sue-Bird-and-Megan-Rapinoe-Sports-Media.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 15:14:23","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.236},{"id":342572546,"title":"Chuck Schumer, Ed Markey Urge FCC Chairman to ‘End Partisan Attacks’ on CBS","text":"Democrats Chuck Schumer and Ed Markey are calling on FCC chairman Brendan Carr to end the agency’s “partisan attacks” on CBS and to “cease interfering with the judgement of independent news organizations.”\n\nIn a new letter, the pair called out the agency for an “outrageous abuse” of its enforcement powers by making CBS turn over the transcript and camera footage of the “60 Minutes” Kamala Harris interview, which was subsequently opened up to a public comment period as part of an investigation into allegations of “news distortion.”\n\nAt the same time, the letter knocked the FCC’s “political double standard” by not acting on Fox News’ “selective editing” of a June 2024 interview with then-candidate Donald Trump , which they said “appeared to be far more misleading” when he was asked about the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n“The selective editing of the Trump interview led viewers to believe that Trump unqualifiedly supported the files’ release when in reality he equivocated,” Schumer and Markey wrote. “Yet, when CBS made editorial decisions around a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President candidate Kamala Harris in October 2024 that had no effect on its content, the Federal Communications Commission opened an inquiry.”\n\nDuring the interview, Trump replied, “Yeah, yeah I would,” when asked if he’d release the Epstein files. But in a portion of the interview that did not air on “Fox & Friends,” he said: “I guess I would. I think that less so because, you don’t know, you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.” \n\nAsked if it would restore trust, he added, “Yeah. I don’t know about Epstein so much as I do the others. Certainly about the way he died. It’d be interesting to find out what happened there, because that was a weird situation and the cameras didn’t happen to be working, etc., etc. But yeah, I’d go a long way toward that one.”\n\nWhile Fox’s cable network is not subject to FCC scrutiny, the lawmakers pointed out that the interview being re-aired over its owned and operated stations would put it under the agency’s jurisdiction. But they emphasized that an investigation into Fox News is “not the answer” and that neither network should be investigated or pressured. \n\n“Editorial discretion lies at the heart of press freedom and should not be subject to government interference,” the letter concluded. “Rather than opening an investigation into Fox, the FCC should close the docket in its investigation over the Harris interview on 60 Minutes and stop wielding its regulatory power as a weapon against the news media.”\n\nMore to come…","summary":"The lawmakers also asked Brendan Carr to \"cease interfering with the judgement of independent news organizations\"\n\n\nThe post Chuck Schumer, Ed Markey Urge FCC Chairman to &#8216;End Partisan Attacks&#8217; on CBS appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/chuck-schumer-ed-markey-brendan-carr-fcc-partisan-attacks-cbs-letter/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/chuck-schumer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 15:03:03","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.525},{"id":342658390,"title":"The Rolling Stone Interview","text":"Skip to main content\n\nThe rolling stone interview archive\n\nStephen A.

That review found that Epstein died by suicide.\n\nRight-wing conspiracy theorists – many of whom form part of Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base – say they believe Epstein was murdered because he had sensitive information about powerful figures, and that this was covered up.\n\nThey have criticised Bondi for failing to fully publish what are known as the “Epstein files”, including a list of clients they believe exists but which the government review found does not.\n\nSome, but not all, of the files compiled by US federal investigators on Epstein were unsealed in January last year, but many remain redacted. Of particular interest is a theoretical client list.\n\nIn recent weeks, the furore among MAGA members has been building, much to the fury of Trump.\n\nIn social media posts on Wednesday, Trump dismissed MAGA conspiracy theorists as “weaklings”, describing the controversy as a “hoax” fabricated by his political opponents.\n\nWhat are the Epstein conspiracy theories about?\n\nOn July 7, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Department of Justice concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell. On July 14, the same two organisations said there was no evidence Epstein had a specific “secret client list”.\n\nHowever, online amateur investigators have long posed conspiracy theories that the government covered up the truth behind Epstein’s life and death. The July memos breathed new life into the case.\n\nWhen the second memo was released, the Justice Department also released a video of Epstein’s jail cell on the night he died, showing no one entering or exiting. However, the time code jumps by one minute and two seconds just before midnight, further inflaming conspiracy theories that part of the video has been deleted.\n\nWhat do MAGA members have against Pam Bondi?\n\nPam Bondi has come under intense criticism from many in the MAGA movement since the government’s July 7 and 14 memos detailing its review of the Epstein files.\n\nIt claimed that no evidence had been found of an Epstein “client list” and that no more files from the investigation would be made public.\n\nBut Bondi has raised the hopes of conspiracy theorists in the past.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News in February, when host John Roberts asked the attorney general about government plans to release the list of Epstein’s clients, Bondi said, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump. I’m reviewing that.”\n\nAlso in February, Bondi presented a tranche of documents titled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” to conservative commentators at the White House. However, it did not contain any revelatory information about Epstein.\n\nAt the time, she said that she would deliver a “truckload” of evidence, reportedly thousands of pages, about the Epstein case to the FBI, but did not provide details, and none have been forthcoming.\n\nThe July 14 memo was the last straw for Bondi critics within the MAGA movement, as the “list” she had been promising to release seemingly never existed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bondi denied that, in her February interview, she had been talking about a “client list”. Instead, the “list” she was referring to was the Epstein case file. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said.\n\nThe same day, Bondi also said that the thousands of videos regarding the Epstein case, reviewed by US intelligence, could not be released as they contained child sex abuse images.\n\n“Never going to be released, never going to see the light of day,” she said.\n\nConspiracy theories suggesting a government cover-up of Jeffrey Epstein’s death have persisted in right-wing circles since his death six years ago.\n\nTrump ally Kash Patel, appointed FBI director during Trump’s second tenure, and former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, both previously questioned the official suicide ruling. By May this year, however, both said they accepted the government’s conclusion about Epstein’s death.\n\nWhich right-wing personalities are shouting the loudest about the Epstein files?\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk was once a Trump ally, and he spent almost $300m backing Trump’s presidential campaign alongside other Republicans last year.\n\nHowever, Musk and Trump had a falling out last month over Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill”. After that, Musk alleged that Trump himself was named in the Epstein files in a now-deleted post on his X platform. Later on, he expressed regret for the social media attack.\n\nHowever, following the July 7 memo, Musk has made more social media posts criticising the Trump administration’s conduct regarding the Epstein files.\n\nEarly on Thursday, Musk made added a series posts to X in which he sent the platform’s AI chatbot Grok prompts about Epstein such as, “Are there likely to be electronic records in any government or commercial computers recording who traveled on Epstein’s plane to the US Virgin Islands?” and “Please make a thorough list of all those who should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein. Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes.”\n\nOn July 8, Musk wrote on X, “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”\n\nMusk owns companies such as the carmaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth stood at $361bn as of Friday.\n\nLaura Loomer\n\nLoomer, 32, a Trump ally and far-right conspiracy theorist, wrote on X on July 8, “Pam Blondi [sic] is covering up child sex crimes that took place under HER WATCH when she was Attorney General of Florida,” adding that Bondi “needs to be fired”.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday with Politico, Loomer warned that Trump’s handling of the Epstein files threatens to “consume his presidency”.\n\n“The best thing that the president can do is appoint a special counsel to handle the Epstein files investigation,” she said.\n\nBut Loomer made it clear that she still supported Trump and was not splitting from the US president over the issue.\n\n“President Trump is doing a lot of great things and we don’t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” she wrote in an X post after her interview. “But we can’t just Truth Social the Epstein Files away. Two things can be true at the same time. I fully support President Trump.”\n\nLoomer has long been involved in US politics and backs Trump, but she has not officially worked for his campaign, both Trump and Loomer clarified last year.\n\nShe unsuccessfully ran for Congress twice in southern Florida as a Republican, in 2020 and 2022. She has a reputation for promoting anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric online.\n\nLoomer has clashed with other right-wing figures in the past.\n\nLast year, she wrote in an X post that if former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential election, “the White House will smell like curry” as a jab at Harris’s Indian and Jamaican heritage.\n\nShe was rebuked for this by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative from Georgia, who wrote in an X post, “This is appalling and extremely racist. It does not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA. This does not represent President Trump. This type of behavior should not be tolerated ever.”\n\nLoomer has been banned from several social media sites. In 2018, she was banned by X, then called Twitter, over her Islamophobic posts. In response, she handcuffed herself to the company’s headquarters in New York. After Musk acquired the social media site in 2022, Loomer’s account was reinstated.\n\nThe Hodge twins\n\nAn account called “Hodgetwins” posted on X on July 8, “Trump has to fire Pam Bondi. She went on camera and told the world she has the Epstein client list on her desk. Now they say there is no list??”\n\nThe duo comprises Keith and Kevin Hodge, 50-year-old twin brothers who post content online about fitness and politics.\n\nThe twins have a channel on YouTube with 3.4 million subscribers. The first published video on their channel is dated September 2010. The pair posted videos about fitness and bodybuilding until they pivoted to food content around 2016 and then to relationship advice in 2021. In recent years, they have posted about culture and politics.\n\nThe twins have a website through which they sell dietary supplements and merchandise, including T-shirts that say “America Only” and snapback caps that say “Gulf of America“. One shirt says “Alligator Alcatraz“, with an illustration of an alligator clad in a military green uniform with a cigar in its mouth. Alligator Alcatraz is the moniker assigned to a migrant detention facility in Florida.\n\nThey also have a podcast called TwinsPod, for which they started releasing episodes last year.\n\nOn July 11, they posted a podcast episode more than two hours long titled, Epstein List COVERUP?! This Is Getting Weird… The guest in this episode was Harrison Smith, a host at conspiracy theory website Infowars.\n\nOn July 8, conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder Alex Jones posted on X, “Next the DOJ will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed’,” calling the memo’s findings “over the top sickening”.\n\nJones, 51, has advocated multiple conspiracy theories over the years, including that the US government failed to prevent, or was involved in, the Oklahoma City bombing and the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Oklahoma bombing was a domestic terrorist attack which happened on April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma. A truck bomb exploded outside the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring more than 600 other people.\n\nJones spent the past three years in federal bankruptcy court after being ordered to pay $1.3bn to families of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting victims in defamation suits in Connecticut and Texas for falsely claiming the shooting was a hoax.\n\nHe grew up in Dallas and moved to Austin with his family as a teenager. In 1996, he began working for a radio station in Austin, but was fired three years later because his opinions made it difficult to get sponsors on the show, according to the local publication, the Austin Chronicle.\n\nAfter he was fired, Jones set up the Infowars website, buying the domain name for $9. He broadcast from his house.\n\nJack Posobiec\n\nFar-right influencer Jack Posobiec posted on X on July 7, “We were all told more was coming. That answers were out there and would be provided. Incredible how utterly mismanaged this Epstein mess has been. And it didn’t have to be.”\n\nPosobiec has been sharing conspiracy theories about the Epstein case for years.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to recover possible classified documents. Soon after, Posobiec claimed the judge who approved the raid was “Epstein’s lawyer”. This was misleading because while Judge Bruce Reinhart had represented Epstein’s employees in the past, he was simply the available magistrate at the time, according to local reports.\n\nPosobiec also has a reputation for posting anti-Semitic and white supremacist content online.\n\nIn February this year, The Washington Post reported that Posobiec had been invited on Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s first overseas trip to Europe.\n\nThe far-right figure is best known for promoting “Pizzagate“, a conspiracy theory alleging that Democratic politicians were involved in a pedophilia ring. The theory picked up during the 2016 presidential election when Pizzagate theorists alleged that then-presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a pizza place.\n\nWill Bondi be the fall guy for any fallout from this saga?\n\nExperts say that, while critics within MAGA may well be trying to make Bondi the scapegoat in this situation, she still has Trump’s backing.\n\n“Hardcore MAGA figures would undoubtedly like to make Pam Bondi into a scapegoat, but at the moment, she still seems to have Trump’s support. It’s more likely that Trump will push the blame elsewhere,” Peter Knight, a professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, told Al Jazeera.\n\nKnight added that Trump could instead blame groups, including “the Democrats, the Deep State, the Fake News media”.\n\nTrump has already blamed news outlets and Democrats for promoting the “Epstein hoax”.\n\nThe Deep State refers to the idea that there is a hidden group of powerful people, often in government, intelligence, or military agencies, who secretly control or influence government policy, no matter which leaders are publicly in charge.\n\n‘Weaklings’: What was Trump’s recent outburst over Epstein all about?\n\nDespite promising to release all the Epstein files during his presidential campaign last year, Trump is now showing anger towards his supporters over Epstein conspiracy theories.\n\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘b*******,’ hook, line, and sinker,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.\n\n“I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,” Trump wrote.\n\n“Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!” he continued.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said Bondi had handled the situation “very well”, adding, “whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.”\n\nOn July 12, Trump posted on Truth Social: “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’ They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening.”\n\nDuring a White House Cabinet meeting on July 8, a reporter asked Bondi about the missing minute on the Epstein prison video, which was circulated the day before.\n\nTrump, who also attended the meeting, jumped in, asking, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy’s been talked about for years”.\n\n“Are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable,” Trump added before asking Bondi if she wanted to “waste time” answering the question.\n\nWhen asked by a journalist if the attorney general had told Trump whether his name appeared in any of the records, he said, “No, no.”\n\nThe president also questioned the enduring fascination with the Epstein case, “only really bad people, including the fake news, want to keep something like this going.”\n\nCould this row hurt Trump’s popularity in the US?\n\n“In theory, this event could turn the MAGA faithful against Trump,” Knight said.\n\n“But it is very unlikely that the MAGA crowd will turn against Trump because of the Epstein files, even if they have good reason to feel betrayed. There is no one else that they could get behind in the same way as Trump. Instead, it’s much more likely that this episode will soon be drowned out by the next conspiracy theory media spectacle.”","summary":"Tesla, Pizzagate and diet supplements: welcome to the world of Epstein conspiracy theorists.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/who-are-the-maga-influencers-calling-for-pam-bondis-head-over-epstein?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getty_6878f0c781-1752756423_947d24-1752756573.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 14:56:17","author":"Alex Kozul-Wright,Apps Support,Sarah Shamim","authors":["Alex Kozul-Wright","Apps Support","Sarah Shamim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":342576768,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: California Governor Contender Says His Fellow Republicans ‘Too Stupid’ To Figure Out How To Win","text":"Riverside County Sheriff and California gubernatorial hopeful Chad Bianco warned Republican infighting could sabotage the party’s best shot in decades to retake the state, blasting GOP rivals as “too stupid” to see what’s at stake.\n\nCalifornia’s open “jungle primary” system — where candidates compete on the same ballot and only the top two advance — makes GOP unity even more critical. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans roughly two to one, a split conservative vote could easily shut Republicans out of the 2026 general election entirely, Bianco said in an interview with the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Six Months Later, California Democrats Have Done Basically Nothing To Rebuild From LA Fires)\n\n“To be quite honest with you, and blunt, Republicans are too stupid to figure it out, and we allow egos and we allow narcissism to influence our election process,” Bianco told the Caller. “And that we do everything we can in the Republican side to ensure that we lose in primary elections.”\n\nIn most states, party infighting fades by the primary, when voters or delegates settle on a standard-bearer to face the opposition in November. But California’s “jungle primary” flips that dynamic on its head.\n\nUnder the system, every candidate from every party appears on the same ballot, and only the top two vote-getters advance to the general election — regardless of party. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans about two to one, a crowded GOP field risks splitting the conservative vote so thinly that both finalists could be Democrats.\n\nThat threat looms even larger if former Vice President Kamala Harris jumps into the race, as some Democrats expect. Her presence could consolidate Democratic support early and leave the fractured Republican slate fighting over scraps.\n\nIt’s in this context, Bianco said, that his GOP rivals are “egotistically driven,” accusing them of running for “personal/political reasons, not for the betterment of California.”\n\nBianco didn’t hold back when sizing up his Republican rivals, dismissing them as unserious and unelectable.\n\n“The reality of the Republicans that I’m running against — there is not one single one of them that has a chance of winning a statewide election. There is not one single one of them who has even run a campaign before,” Bianco said. “You have a couple of them that think they can run for governor every time the governor race comes up, but they have absolutely zero chance of winning this election.”\n\nHe warned that their “egos” and “narcissistic attitudes” threaten to sabotage the GOP’s chances.\n\n“And all they’re going to do is, because of their egos and their narcissistic attitudes, they’re going to stay in this race, pull maybe a million votes combined away from my race — maybe even more than that, if Hilton stays in — and then we ensure that we’re going to lose,” he said.\n\nSteve Hilton, a conservative pundit also running for governor, was the only rival Bianco called out by name. Hilton’s campaign did not respond to the Caller’s request for comment.\n\nWith more than 30 years in law enforcement, Bianco acknowledged his style can come off as blunt — even hostile — but said he sees himself as a team player willing to take the buzzer-beater shot for Republicans if it means giving the party a fighting chance.\n\nBianco insisted the key was simply getting through the primary, saying he’s fully convinced he can win the governorship if the field clears.\n\n“I don’t think it’s going to be hard, I honestly don’t,” Bianco said.\n\nHe pinned this confidence on the belief that reality will set in for his rivals as election day approaches.\n\n“It’s going to be crystal clear that they have absolutely no chance,” Bianco said. “You need to get out before — you’re going to ruin this for us, and we’re going to end up losing this state to another Democrat because of silliness, because of pettiness.”\n\n“In the end, it’s going to be coming down closer to the wire,” he continued. “They’re all so angry and egotistical that they truly believe that they’re important and that they can win. And so there are none of those discussions.”\n\n No city has been harmed more by the Democrats’ outrageous pro-criminal policies than Oakland.

He questioned how anyone could be “so weak that you’re going to give up on the greatest state in the country,” and vowed he won’t be among them.","summary":"'They're all so angry and egotistical'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/17/gop-infighting-californias-governor-race-chad-bianco-says/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2177538307-scaled-e1752762720872.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 14:40:25","author":"Derek Vanbuskirk","authors":["Derek Vanbuskirk"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":342609172,"title":"Nolte: Far-left Variety Claims Free Speech Undermines Free Speech","text":"The organized left, which the Hollywood-trade Variety is very much a part of, understands how important the legacy/corporate/regime media are when it comes to spreading leftist propaganda.\n\nBecause the left’s ideas and policies are all proven failures (see: Democrat-run cities, especially Variety’s home of Los Angeles), propaganda is all they got, and the legacy media is a vital leg in that three-legged propaganda stool (the other two are academia and Hollywood).\n\nWell, since the arrival of New Media and Donald Trump, combined with this…\n\nIsraeli Troops Murdered Food-Seeking Palestinians Hoax\nTrump Tariffs Will Explode Prices Hoax\nMaryland Man Hoax\nBlack Newborns Much More Likely to Die If Doc’s White Hoax\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nMass Hysterectomies Performed on Immigrants Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\n…the power of the corporate media to influence public opinion—at least public opinion outside of over-educated, narcissistic, smug white women—has cratered. For obvious reasons, this terrifies the left, which reduces them to the kind of fascism that arrived this week in the form of a Variety cover story, which argues that holding the regime media accountable is a threat to the First Amendment.\n\nThe headline reads — Defeat the Press: How Donald Trump’s Attacks on News Outlets Undermine the First Amendment\n\nThe article itself is a self-important piece of overwriting (4,000+ words), but here’s the basic theme…\n\n“Kiss the ring; bend the knee. Whatever metaphor you choose, President Trump has cowed the owners of two major media outlets into paying him millions of dollars,” is the Variety opener. “Trump has long derided what he dubs ‘the fake news,’ and he has famously called the press ‘the enemy of the people.’”\n\nNow we get to the best part: “In the 10 years since he announced his first run for president on June 16, 2015, Trump has written nearly 3,500 social media posts that attack the press[.]… “Over the course of a decade, that’s roughly one per day.”\n\nVariety is especially butthurt over ABC News and CBS News settling with Trump for millions, and the fact that PBS and NPR are about to lose —tee hee— their corporate welfare federal funding.\n\nSo, according to Variety, criticizing and suing a media outlet represents a direct attack on free speech.\n\nDo you see what’s happening here? Do you grasp the play here…? These fascists at Variety are using the court of public opinion to shame us out of our right to defend ourselves against powerful media outlets owned by multi-billion-dollar corporations. Apparently, Variety believes these multinational corporations should be granted special rights in the form of total immunity from criticism and accountability. Well, that leaves me with just one question…\n\nIf we’re not allowed to criticize or sue the media, what do we do when the media lie, which is constantly (see: above list)?\n\nVariety wants us to roll over and shut up to … protect the First Amendment.\n\nVariety never explains how silencing people’s speech protects free speech.\n\nFact: ABC News lied about Trump. ABC News repeatedly and falsely claimed a jury had found him “liable for rape.”\n\nBut according to the fascists at Variety, the only way Trump can protect the First Amendment is do nothing in response to a blatant smear spread by an outlet that knew it was lying. A good American, according to Variety, would remain silent and let the smear stick.\n\nIn the case of CBS News, mere weeks before a presidential election, far-left 60 Minutes maliciously edited an interview to make one of the candidates look less dumb than she is. Rather than broadcast her full word salad, her answer was snipped in a blatant effort to aid and abet her campaign. Worse still, this was done by CBS News using the public airwaves, which CBS is allowed to use for free. Worser still, CBS News arrogantly refused to release the full interview transcript.\n\nRELATED: — Jim Jordan: Greatest Worry Is Threat to First Amendment, ‘Hallmark of Western Civilization’\n\nAccording to the fascists at Variety, Trump should neither criticize CBS nor file suit for election interference, which it obviously was.\n\nPeople who care about free speech protect all speech, including criticism of speech, and they support a legal process for litigating claims of slander and libel. People who care about speech never claim that speech hurts free speech or the First Amendment.\n\nThat would be absurd, no?\n\nAnd it’s not like these massive multinationals don’t have the money to fight against a lawsuit. Methinks discovery is what they fear most. Can you imagine how the media behave when they believe no one is looking?\n\nClaiming that certain speech hurts free speech is what actually hurts free speech, no? And yet, that is exactly what Variety is doing.\n\nNot to belabor the point, but Variety is arguing that a good American would say or do nothing if the corporate media falsely accuse them of rape. Rape!\n\nThese are dangerous people, deranged with hate and driven by a smug sense of entitlement that they are above being criticized and challenged. Since all the ideas they cling to have failed, all they got left is to tell us to shut up … in the name of free speech.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

With his latest troubles—caused by his administration’s declaration that there’s nothing new to see or investigate regarding deceased pedophile and sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein—Trump is once again screaming “hoax.” Yet it is not quite doing the trick.\n\nOne of Trump’s brilliant moves as a demagogic politician was to train his supporters to believe that he was the target of conspiratorial forces and “fake news.” So whenever he was hit by a critical news report or investigation, he could explain it away by declaring that he was a victim of evil forces that aimed to destroy the nation.\n\nThis began in the earliest days of his first presidency. As the press, the FBI, and congressional committees investigated Moscow’s attack on the 2016 election and interactions between Trump’s campaign and Russia, Trump tried to swat all that away by declaring it was a “hoax” and a “witch hunt”—a product of “fake news.” No matter that the intelligence community, a special counsel, and congressional committees repeatedly confirmed the basic facts of that scandal—Vladimir Putin launched a covert operation to try to help Trump win, and Trump and his campaign aided and abetted that attack by repeatedly echoing Putin’s false denials—Trump consistently repeated these catchphrases. “Russia, Russia, Russia” became the derisive nickname he deployed to obliterate a significant reality of the 2016 election.\n\nIt worked. \n\nHis devotees fully embraced his characterization. Right-wing media constantly cast the Russia investigation as a scheme orchestrated by Democrats, something called the Deep State, and mainstream media. For Trumpland, it was indeed a “hoax.” For instance, Kash Patel, now Trump’s FBI director, has routinely asserted that the Russia inquiry was “the greatest political scandal” in US history, describing it as a con job entirely cooked up by spooks, Dems, and journalists. He has gone so far as to claim absurdly that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election.\n\nOnce Trump established this Russia hoax narrative, he found he could apply it to other jams. When he was impeached for the first time for having threatened to withhold weapons from Ukraine unless its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, launched an investigation of Joe Biden, Trump called this affair a “hoax,” comparing it to “Russia, Russia, Russia.” It was also a “witch hunt,” a “scam,” and a “sham.” Once more, Trump was the victim of diabolical plotting. During the impeachment hearings, Trump’s Republican defenders tried to deflect from the topic at hand by tossing out conspiracy theories about the Russia investigation.\n\nWhen Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020, it was, in his view, another “hoax.” The Deep State—along with China, Venezuela, Dominion Voting Systems, the media, Italian satellite operators, and election workers in Atlanta—had rigged the election. Trump’s assaults on the news media for covering up the purported theft of the election were a callback to his “Russia, Russia, Russia” rhetoric.\n\nAfter the insurrectionist January 6 riot that Trump incited, as the House moved toward a second impeachment of Trump, he again hurled the same charge: “The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country.” For Trump, every new political or legal threat he faced was an extension of the vicious and underhanded war against him that began with the Russia investigation.\n\nWhen the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in search of classified documents Trump took with him when he left the White House, his spokesman declared, “The Democrats have spent seven years fabricating hoaxes and witch hunts against President Trump, and the recent unprecedented and unnecessary raid is just another example of exactly that.” Trump called the prosecution that ended with him being convicted of 34 felony counts a “scam” and a “sham.” And E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit accusing Trump of sexual assault? “It is a hoax and a lie just like all the other hoaxes that have been played on me for the past seven years,” Trump said in a deposition. At her one debate with Trump during the 2024 election, Kamala Harris slammed Trump for having said there were “very fine people on both sides” following the 2017 rally in Charlottesville organized by white supremacists that became violent; two days later, Trump called this the “Charlottesville hoax.” \n\nIn each of these episodes, the hoax strategy succeeded. At least with his people. MAGA World stood by him, and the right-wing media embraced his false accusations. So much so he won his way back to the White House. \n\nNow he’s facing a tsunami of outrage and criticism from Republicans and MAGA champions for sitting on Epstein material that they assume would bolster their long-running QAnon-ish conspiracy theories. And Trump, yet again, is turning to his standby sidestep. He’s calling this a “hoax.”\n\nAs the anger swelled among his flock this past weekend, on his social media platform, Trump compared the fuss to the “Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax.” He complained that “selfish people” were trying to “hurt” his “PERFECT Administration” over Epstein. He asserted that the Epstein files were “written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration.” That is, he was advancing another conspiracy theory: His enemies had concocted fake Epstein files. That didn’t make much sense. But Trump was trying to rope this latest hullabaloo into his long-running “hoax” narrative.\n\nThat post did not stem the fury from the right. Many replies to it were from self-declared Trump backers who expressed dismay that Trump was not keeping what they believed was a promise to tell all about Epstein. MAGA influencers called for firing Attorney General Pam Bondi. Congressional Republicans urged the release of files from the Epstein case.On Wednesday, Trump tried again with another post. He once more proclaimed the whole Epstein thing was a hoax akin to “Russia, Russia, Russia.” He brayed, “these Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at – It’s all they have… Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker. They haven’t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years.” He pulled out his classic pushback: the “Fake News” and Democrats were orchestrating “the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”\n\nTalking to reporters in the Oval Office later in the day, Trump reiterated his new mantra: “I know it’s a hoax. It’s started by Democrats. It’s been run by the Democrats for four year….Some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net… I call it the Epstein hoax.”Factcheck: Trump was not telling the truth. Most of the noise about the Epstein files has arisen not from Democrats but from MAGA—people who Trump now denounces as idiots and “past supporters.” And Trump, no surprise, did not specify what he means by “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.” There’s no question that his Justice Department and FBI released a memo declaring that Epstein had committed suicide and that there were no new and undisclosed revelations—and no so-called clients list—within the files of his two criminal cases. Where’s the hoax? It looked as if Trump believed that after all these years of pushing the “hoax” button, he could do so once again as a getaway. Drop the H-word and—presto!—his believers will fall in line. \n\nBut the MAGA crowd wants more. After years of the right promoting conspiracy theories that demonized Democrats and elites as cannibals and pedophilic globalists—see Pizzagate and QAnon—Trumpers expected the Trump administration to finally produce the goods with presumed evidence from the Epstein case. Patel, Donald Trump Jr., deputy FBI director Dan Bongino, and other MAGA leaders had long demanded the Epstein files be released. Trump himself had indicated he would do that if elected to a second term.\n\nInstead, nothing has been revealed, and Trump is saying it’s time to move on and castigating his fans who feel betrayed. That’s not playing well. There’s no telling yet if his familiar move of yelling “hoax” will work this time. His steady shouts of “hoax” over the years have themselves been a long-running hoax. Usually, his voters responded as he wished.

His company recruits and manages individuals who appear at rallies, protests, and public events on behalf of paying clients.\n\nSwart argued that compensating activists is not unethical. He said the service allows people to engage in causes they support but might not otherwise be able to attend.\n\n“All activism is what I call incentivized activism,” he said. “We compensate people for having their views known, but most people who attend demonstrations have some reason for being there other than the so-called purity of their beliefs.”\n\nSwart offered examples to bolster his claim, including the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n“How many real housewives went out to protest for [the Black Lives Matter campaign] in the summer of 2020?” he said. “Do you think it’s because they cared about institutional racism? Or do you think it’s to flex on social media?”\n\nHe added that labor unions sometimes pressure members to attend demonstrations, with threats of less favorable work shifts, and political aides are often expected to take part in campaign events during their personal time.\n\nPaid demonstrators typically earn several hundred dollars per day, according to Swart. Nationwide publicity campaigns, he said, can cost millions. He noted that he recently turned down a $20 million offer from political interests opposed to US President Donald Trump.\n\nSwart emphasized that his rejection of the offer was not driven by ideology but by concerns that the campaign’s likely failure would damage his firm’s reputation.\n\n“The problem is that these are the same consultant class who propped up [former US President Joe] Biden, who propped up [former Vice President] Kamala Harris, who fundamentally failed so miserably in the 2024 election, and who have failed every single day since then in reigning in Trump's agenda,” he said.","summary":"Pay-for-protest CEO claims ‘All activism is incentivized activism’ \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621613-us-political-protest-secrets/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/6878f4a185f540224047ce65.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 13:06:58","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":342532020,"title":"A party resolution accusing Israel of genocide divides Democrats in a key swing state","text":"When the executive committee of North Carolina’s Democratic Party passed a resolution in June calling for an immediate arms embargo on Israel, it set off another episode in the party’s ongoing struggles with how it addresses the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSome Jewish Democrats in North Carolina said the resolution was consistent with their support of Palestinian human rights while others characterized it as divisive. The resolution’s backers are talking to Democrats in other states who want to take the same stand. And top state leaders – notably the party chair and North Carolina’s Democratic governor – have declined to comment.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war still divides the party as it did before the November election, when Democratic nominee Kamala Harris faced protests and boycott threats from parts of the base before eventually losing to President Donald Trump.\n\nIn North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis’ retirement opened an opportunity for Democrats to flip a Republican-held seat, some in the party are worried the disunity will make it harder to compete in a race they almost certainly have to win next year to regain Senate control.\n\n“This is an issue that’s going to divide Democrats at a time when Democrats need to be working together on the issues that voters actually care about, the kitchen table issues,” said Kathy Manning, who chairs the Board of Directors for the advocacy group Democratic Majority for Israel.\n\nAlan Smith, a lead sponsor of the resolution and a member of the state party’s progressive caucus, sees it differently. Passing the resolution, he argues, shows the party is responsive to the will of Democratic voters.\n\n“I think it’s only going to help the Democratic Party. It’s going to get people to come back,” Smith said.\n\nAccording to a May survey from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Democrats younger than 45 are far less likely than their older partisan peers to favor the US supporting Israel militarily, with only 38% saying they favor military support until the hostages are returned, compared with 48% support among older Democrats.\n\nDisputes over the war have shaped other Democratic races, notably the New York mayoral primary, where Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and strident critic of Israel, scored an upset victory despite criticism from some Jewish groups that he hadn’t sufficiently denounced antisemitism.\n\nAnd in Michigan, where Democrats hope to retain control of an open Senate seat next year, the main candidates in the primary have taken sharply different positions on the war. Trump flipped Michigan in 2024 in part by capitalizing on anger in both Jewish and Arab American communities.\n\nHow the resolution passed\n\nThough other Democratic state parties, in Wisconsin and Washington, have recently passed resolutions critical of Israel since the country launched its war against Hamas following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, the language passed by North Carolina Democrats is the only example that explicitly calls for an embargo on military aid and weapons transfers and accuses the state of committing genocide and apartheid.\n\n“The military resources that have been made available to Israel through annual and emergency military aid have been used to commit the crime of genocide and other war crimes in Gaza,” it reads.\n\n“The North Carolina Democratic Party supports an immediate embargo on all military aid, weapons shipments and military logistical support to Israel,” it continues.\n\nThe resolution also won the support of NCDP’s African American Caucus, the Arab Caucus, the LGBTQ+ Caucus, the Association of Teen Democrats, the Jewish Democrats and various other groups within the state party.\n\nIsrael rejects claims that its war against Hamas, which killed 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and still holds Israeli hostages, constitutes a genocide. It also rejects allegations that its treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank is akin to apartheid. Earlier this month the Gaza Health Ministry reported the Palestinian death toll had passed 58,000, with the most recent rounds of casualties taking place near food distribution sites.\n\nManning says Democratic Majority for Israel is in conversations with Democratic voters across the state and helping them to make their displeasure with the resolution known to state party leadership.\n\nThe resolution’s advocates worked over a multiyear process to get the statement passed, starting at the local precinct level, on to the county convention, then through the congressional district convention, the platform resolutions committee and ultimately the party’s state executive committee.\n\n“We see it as an issue of unity and an issue that is local, because we want taxpayer dollars to be invested here, and we believe that speaking up for human lives, including Palestinian lives, is actually a local issue and is a reminder that when grassroots groups come together, that they can accomplish the things that they wish to see within their party,” said Reem Subei, chair of the party’s Arab Caucus.\n\nSince the resolution’s passage, Subei says those engaged with their state-level executive committees have reached out to her asking how they could mirror this effort, including organizers in Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota.\n\nLisa Jewel, president of the state Democratic party’s Jewish Caucus, condemned the resolution as divisive and leaned on leadership to block the effort.\n\n“Our leadership needs to call these extremists out. They need to take a strong stand against antisemitism. By placating these extremists, it helps raise the drum beat that leads to violence,” said Jewel, arguing that state Democrats should be focused on cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, women’s reproductive health, the cost of housing, gerrymandering, and other consensus-driven issues. She also voiced fear in the wake of threats against her own synagogue.\n\nThe Jewish Caucus was created last year in response to what Jewel described as growing antisemitism in the Democratic party and across North Carolina. This is not to be confused with the state party’s Jewish Democrats, a separate group that supported the resolution.\n\nFor a long time, party leadership resisted religious groups creating their own caucuses and wanted the groups to all fall within the Interfaith Caucus out of fear of these very types of disputes, but Jewel says some Jews did not feel welcome in the interfaith group and insisted they would go out on their own.\n\n“It is not feasible for us to disconnect our Judaism from Israel, regardless of the politics that are happening there. It’s just part of who we are,” said Jewel.\n\nMark Bochkis, who leads communications for the Jewish Democrats, said he moved to Greensboro as a child from the former Soviet Union and that his extended family lives in Israel.\n\n“We have to take a look at what wins statewide, and we cannot ignore the will of Democratic voters or their values. And their values right now are saying we care about Palestinian human rights,” Bochkis said.\n\n“This is the new North Carolina Democratic Party. This is the way forward. I think the Jewish Caucus represents kind of a view that we’re moving past,” he added.\n\nThe next flashpoint will be if or when the resolution is ultimately adopted into the party platform. Its supporters believe they have cleared all the necessary procedural hurdles and that it will eventually be a part of the party’s mission statement, but its opponents argue party leadership can still block that from happening. The timeline for when the platform will be voted on is unclear.\n\nMany state party leaders have stayed silent\n\nThere is no readily available record of who supported the measure and no video or even mention of the proceeding on the state Democratic Party’s website, though proponents of the resolution say it passed 161-151.\n\nAccording to people who attended the vote, party chair Anderson Clayton and other party officers abstained. Clayton has not commented publicly in local press in the weeks since the resolution passed and declined to speak to CNN.\n\nGov. Josh Stein, the state’s first Jewish governor, and his predecessor, Roy Cooper, who many state and national Democrats are pushing to run for Tillis’ open Senate seat, also declined requests for comment. An adviser to Cooper told CNN that he generally does not opine on party resolutions.\n\nFormer US Rep. Wiley Nickel, who is already running for Tillis’ seat, dismissed the resolution as one-sided but also criticized the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n“In an issue as complex as this, nuance is essential, and that’s something politics often overlooks.

Used with permission from Getty Images.\nGetty Images/Richard Fowler\n\nAfter years of headlines and reports warning of rising violence and disastrously high crime rates, something remarkable is happening: America’s crime rates are quickly dropping.\n\nAccording to new data from the Vera Institute of Justice and the Council on Criminal Justice, homicides in the U.S. fell by 16 percent in 2024, with early 2025 showing an even sharper decline. In some cities, shootings are down nearly 40 percent.\n\nThe national murder rate is now approaching pre-pandemic levels—despite political rhetoric suggesting otherwise.\n\n“In and even in 2024, we are nationally at crime rates that match pre-pandemic lows.” said Insha Rahman, vice president of advocacy and partnerships at the Vera Institute of Justice. “The increase in crime that happened as a result of the COVID-19 was basically wiped out entirely by 2024 and now we are witnessing declines that go even beyond pre-pandemic lows.”\n\nRahman, who’s also director of Vera Action, an independent, but aligned, sister nonprofit organization, highlighted double-digit declines in homicides and violent crime in Chicago, Baltimore, Birmingham, and Detroit. She and Vera Institute credit this decline to the work of municipal leaders and their crime prevention strategies.\n\n“Cities in particular, and this isn't just big urban cities, but actually more suburban communities, are making real investment in building out a larger, comprehensive public safety infrastructure that supports police to focus on serious crime and then expands the tools and the toolkit of who should be the right first responder to a crisis to prevent crime,” she said.\n\nInsha Rahman (Photo by David Buchan/Variety/Penske Media via Getty Images)\nPenske Media via Getty Images\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhile the downward trend began nearly a year before President Trump’s return to the White House, the Trump administration has taken credit, without any evidence linking their deportation strategy to an overall decrease in crime.\n\n“We’ve removed thousands of violent criminal, illegal aliens from our communities… and just a few months into office, the national murder rate has plummeted by 28 percent,” the President said during a roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nDespite shifting political rhetoric from Washington, the data tells a different—and encouraging—story.\n\nThe United States is in the midst of a sustained, nationwide decline in violent crime. Part of a broader, multi-year trend led by local governments, the decrease began in the wake of the pandemic’s peak. However, federal budget cuts stand to threaten the progress driven by targeted community investments, data-informed law enforcement, and a renewed focus on public and mental health.\n\nThis multi-year decline comes at a time when local police departments are operating with fewer officers. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police found that departments are operating with a nearly 10 percent staffing deficit, with 65 percent reporting reduced services.\n\nRahman sees this as further evidence that violent crime can’t be solved through law enforcement alone.\n\n“There has been decades of research that have found that simply adding more police is not going to drive down crime rates,” she said.\n\nShe went on to explain that, “we have actually seen in recent years as police departments have gotten smaller and again seen crime rates go down. So there’s just no correlation between investing more in police and more funding for police and crime going down.”\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson, a former middle school social studies public school teacher, visiting ...

The program targets neighborhoods on the South and West Sides where gun violence surged.\n\n\"It's policing and affordable housing, policing and mental and behavioral health services,\" Mayor Johnson said at the event. \"We have 29,000 young people that will have summer jobs this summer: a 45 percent increase. But it is also working with every single level of government.”\n\nThe $400 million public-private partnership expanded violence intervention efforts and aimed to address gun-related crime through holistic solutions. According to the mayor’s office, fatal shootings are down 25 percent over the past 12 months, and overall crime is down 33 percent.\n\nAs Rahman explained, Johnson’s administration has invested in public schools, parks, and programs to support vulnerable residents—all while navigating a politically resistant city and statewide apparatus.\n\nInvesting and supporting Community Violence Interruptors is a core element of Chicago’s efforts to ...

At a visit to the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago, Johnson sat down with a group of Interrupters to hear about their 4th of July weekend efforts to reduce violence.\nThe Office of the Mayor — Chicago\n\n“There’s a lot to be said about managing a big city where a lot of politics is against you, as Mr. Johnson has experienced from the beginning of his mayoralty,” she said.\n\nGiven those circumstances, Johnson told Forbes he and his team are proud of what they’ve accomplished.\n\n“We’ve seen a significant reduction in crime and violence in Chicago because of our focus on more effective and strategic policing, our partnerships between law enforcement and community violence intervention groups, and our investments in people, particularly mental health services and youth summer jobs, \" he said.\n\nJohnson, a longtime resident of Chicago’s Austin neighborhood, which was deeply impacted by the pandemic crime spike, focused safety efforts on the 35 most violent police beats in the city, often characterized by the convergence of poverty, unemployment, and historic disinvestment.\n\nMayor Brandon Scott, a father of three, visiting residents of Baltimore’s Cherry Hill neighborhood ...

The program includes job training, education, and relocation services for individuals most at risk.\n\nBaltimore is also seeing citywide declines in auto thefts (down 34 percent), robberies (22 percent), arson (10 percent), and carjackings (15 percent). Scott credits the work of residents and long-term investments poured into the community under his leadership.\n\n“It takes investments beyond the police department, including in resources like rec centers, parks, pools, and schools, to build healthy, resilient communities that nurture healthy, resilient people,” Scott said.\n\nThese gains also come as migration to the city increases at a relatively high rate. Scott attributes this gain to community members who are making the choice to heal their city.\n\nMayor Brandon Scott addressing youth at Baltimore’s 5th Annual Safe Summer Event.\nMayor of Baltimore City/ J.J McQueen\n\n“But our work is far from over. 68 lives lost to violence is 68 too many,” Scott said. “While we acknowledge the historic lows we are experiencing, we must simultaneously acknowledge that there is much more work to do and our success makes me commit even further to doing it.”\n\nIn Birmingham, the year-to-date homicide rate dropped by 52 percent as Mayor Randall Woodfin champions a community-first approach.\n\n“The Birmingham Police Department is extremely aggressive in what they are doing and how they’re taking a different approach in policing our community.” Woodfin told The Washington Informer.\n\nBirmingham, Ala., Mayor Randall Woodfin, moderates a conversation with Vice President Kamala Harris ...

It also triggered investments in mental health care, housing, and responses to other root causes of crime.\n\nBut in July, much of that funding was repealed through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which cut Medicaid, food programs, and community-based safety initiatives—returning to a traditional law-enforcement-heavy strategy.\n\nMayor Randall Woodfin addressing city residents at during the National Institute for Criminal ...

This is “The Daily.”\n\n[THEME MUSIC]\n\nDuring an Oval Office meeting with congressional Republicans a few days ago, it didn’t take President Trump long to turn to his favorite subject, his hatred for the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell. In fact, during the meeting, Trump proudly showed off the draft of a letter that would fire Powell for good. It’s the latest chapter in a dysfunctional relationship that has major implications, not just for the American economy, but for the global economy.\n\nToday, I speak with my colleague, Colby Smith, about what’s really at the heart of Washington’s ugliest drama, Trump versus Powell.\n\n[THEME MUSIC]\n\nIt’s Thursday, July 17.\n\nColby, nice to have you.\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nSo this is an episode about some pretty heavy-duty topics, monetary policy, interest rates, tariffs. But really, at its core, it’s an episode about a toxic personal relationship between the president of the United States and the country’s most powerful economic official. So tell us that story of how this relationship has become so toxic.\n\nSo it’s a complicated relationship, to say the absolute least. As you mentioned, these are two of the most powerful policymakers in the entire world. And their decisions have massive economic ramifications for the global economy, the global financial system. And at the heart of the matter, you have President Trump, who has been able to unveil all the different aspects of his economic agenda that he’s campaigned on. He’s been successful in pushing tariffs through. He’s been successful in pushing these tax cuts through. He’s been successful in cracking down on immigration.\n\nThat’s why we say this is Trump’s economy.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHe’s made it his own.\n\nHe owns it through and through. And in this one area that has massive economic, political, and financial ramifications, he does not have control over that. And that is the Fed’s interest rate.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHe sees this as this blockade that is making it difficult for him to achieve what he set out to achieve on the campaign trail. And for him, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, he is his enemy in this process.\n\nWe’ve had non-stop name-calling.\n\nHe’s referred to Chair Powell as a major loser, a numbskull.\n\nKnucklehead.\n\nYeah, knucklehead.\n\nWe’re not seeing President Trump talk about the Fed as being a steward of the economy and someone keeping the economy on track, but rather it’s in opposition to the president.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo this really reached a climax on Tuesday night. So President Trump, he’s sitting in the Oval office with House Republicans. They’re not meeting to talk about Powell. And yet, this is Trump’s favorite topic. And it comes up, and he starts bashing the Fed chair. And he’s asking around, saying, should I fire him? Should I not?\n\nHe’s polling these House Republicans, should I fire the Fed chair?\n\nRight. And in all of these exchanges, he whips out this draft letter that he has actually firing Powell.\n\nNow this is not something that he has sent. He’s not even saying that he is going to send it. But the fact of the matter is that he clearly has it at the ready, and that’s a real escalation in his threats against the chair. And I think, just for context, it’s important to note that throughout history, presidents have always bashed on their Fed chairs. They’re a very useful scapegoat in that sense because they do operate independently from the White House. But I think the relentlessness of his attacks has really stood out.\n\nAnd we should just say the reason why the president, why any president, wants control of the interest rate is because the interest rate is this accelerant or deaccelerant of economic activity. And just to be really wonky about it, the Fed can raise interest rates when it’s worried about inflation, higher prices because that will slow the economy down and help bring prices down.\n\nOr the Fed can lower rates when it’s worried about a recession because that’s a way to stimulate economic activity. The interest rate, in short, is this very unique tool, weapon, whatever you want to call it. And if you’re the most powerful person in the world, you’d want that.\n\nExactly. The Fed pulls up on a lever or pulls down on that lever, and that has a widespread impact on how people spend throughout the economy, whether businesses decide to invest more or whether they decide to pull back, whether they hire or they fire workers. So that’s why President Trump wants it so badly. But that’s also why the Fed is acting so cautiously here because they know if they make the wrong move, they could potentially be guiding the economy in the wrong direction.\n\nSo, Colby, how exactly did this relationship become so testy, name-cally, at times ugly, and I guess we should say one-sidedly ugly? It’s not like Chairman Powell is calling Trump names. And I ask that question because Trump appointed Jay Powell to the job of running the Federal Reserve. So at one point, he clearly liked him enough to give him the job. So what is the story of how we got from there to here?\n\nSo their relationship stretches back to November 2017. That’s when Trump nominates Powell to be the next Fed Chair. And in doing so, he broke with tradition, actually, because most presidents they end up keeping on their predecessor’s Fed Chair. And that’s something he decided not to.\n\nThat was Janet Yellen.\n\nIt was Janet Yellen, who was appointed by President Obama. And so she served only one term.\n\nAnd what exactly does Trump like about Powell?\n\nHe’s a Republican, he is wealthy, and he is seen as a pragmatist and a centrist. And so he fit the bill in a lot of ways for the president.\n\nAnd I always think back to the announcement in the Rose Garden.\n\nWhen President Trump announces that he’s picking Powell to be his chair —\n\nAnd he has all these nice things to say about him. He calls him smart. He says he’s committed. He says he’s strong and would be this wise steward of the Fed.\n\nAnd in accepting the nomination, Chair Powell talks about the objectivity he’s going to bring to the role.\n\nAnd you really get the sense that he understands the position that he’s about to step into here.\n\nRight. And we, as omniscient storytellers, can tell that the seeds of a future conflict have been laid. Independence, on the one hand, and strong person that I want in the job for me on the other.\n\nExactly. We have our main characters.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAnd I think the timing of this is really important because Powell takes over in February 2018. This is right around the time that Trump embarks on his first trade war, where he’s putting tariffs on Chinese imports and the Fed is raising interest rates. But tensions don’t really start boiling over until July, when President Trump starts to be more vocal about his misgivings about what the Fed is doing.\n\nWhat is he saying?\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo he’s starting out relatively benign.\n\nHe’s saying I’m not really thrilled with what they’re doing here. I don’t really think they should be raising interest rates. But he doesn’t do anything or say anything that seems like he’s coming after their independence in any way, shape, or form. The attacks really start to escalate as we get into the fall.\n\nHe says the Fed has gone crazy. They’re out of control with these interest rate increases.\n\nAnd things start to really take a turn in December, when he was asking around whether he has the legal authority to fire the chair. And these conversations end up becoming public, and it leads Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary at the time, to have to go out there and assure financial markets in the world that the president isn’t about to get rid of his Fed Chair. He says something along the lines of the president isn’t happy with what Powell’s doing here, but he kind of understands that he’s sticking around. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJust to step back and try to understand what’s really happening here between Trump and Powell, clearly, there’s not just a divergence about whether the interest rate should be raised or cut in this moment. That’s clear enough. There seems to be a divergence over the role of the Fed and who should control it.\n\nRight. Absolutely. I think Trump sees the Fed as an institution that can act at his behest, that can help him fulfill his economic and political ambitions. For the Fed, what they’re trying to do is steer the economy in the right direction. And they’re doing so without the influence of the White House.\n\nRight. There is this inherent tension. The Fed is trying to manage the long-term health of the economy. The president, for obvious reasons, wants a strong economy during his or her tenure. And what’s good politically for the president in the short term, in many cases, low interest rates, isn’t necessarily good for the economy in the long term if you are the Fed.\n\nThat’s right. And I think it’s important here to unpack how the Fed goes about making its decisions because it’s not up to one person. It’s a consensus-driven organization. So there is a committee of 12 officials. They vote on policy at any given moment. So they need to be certain that this is the right thing for the economy in order to get there. And this isn’t something that is just like flicking a switch, like President Trump has talked about.\n\nRight. It’s a carefully and slowly-considered process that it sounds like everyone at the Fed sees as deeply independent of politics.\n\nExactly. It’s very deliberate. And the idea here is that a Central Bank that’s independent is going to put the economy on the best footing possible because they’re not worried about the whims of a political party. They’re not worried about an election cycle. They are chiefly focused on making sure they’re prioritizing that inflation is staying low and stable and the labor market is healthy. And those two goals are what gives people confidence that the economy is in good hands.\n\nSo how does that tension continue to play out in Trump’s first term?\n\nSo I think everything gets overshadowed at some point by the pandemic. Basically, the entire world shuts down. The economy is in freefall. Financial markets are seizing up. At that point, tension between these two individuals somewhat evaporates because we’re in a crisis-fighting mode. So the Fed knows exactly what to do in a crisis situation like this. They cut interest rates to 0. They’re wading into financial markets. They’re buying unlimited government bonds. They’re doing everything in their power in order to stabilize the situation.\n\nAnd the Trump administration pushed through two big stimulus packages to prop up the economy. And then Biden came into the office and did another big package as well to shore up growth. And this is when Powell makes this big miscalculation that he even concedes is an error on his end. It happens in 2021 when Biden is in office. And this mistake ends up haunting the Fed and eventually influencing his relationship with Trump now.\n\nWell, just explain that.\n\nSupply chains are all gummed up. There’s shortages in goods everywhere at exactly the moment that all this money is coming into the system. So that just helped to bid up prices over time. So as this situation starts unfolding, Powell is faced with this big question, is the inflation that started to show through, is that temporary or is that persistent?\n\nPowell ends up putting his stake in the ground on inflation in August of 2021.\n\nHe makes this big speech in front of global policymakers and the world, frankly, where he says this inflation is temporary, we’re going to keep interest rates low in this environment. And that ends up being the wrong call because what ends up happening is that inflation really starts to re-accelerate from that point on. And the Fed, because it’s slow to catch on to the extent of the problem, inflation ends up spiraling as high as 9 percent in the summer of 2022. So eventually, after a series of historic interest rate increases, the Fed does get a handle on inflation.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nBut I think the long-term lesson here for the Fed and for Chair Powell in particular is not to be complacent about it because if they misread the inflation situation, they let things get out of hand, then they’re going to be potentially facing down a much worse problem later down the line.\n\nAnd just to be very clear, for Powell, the lesson is do not for a second take your eye off inflation. And the minute you see inflation, slay the inflation dragon.\n\nThat’s the lesson from this whole period. And it’s something that we see the Fed and Chair Powell bring up time and again in Trump’s second term in the White House. And that lesson makes an already bad relationship even worse.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\nSo, Colby, talk about how this already not good relationship in term one further devolves in term two, and how this lesson that Jay Powell has observed somehow fits into it.\n\nSo it starts to devolve even before President Trump is back in the White House. So on the campaign trail, he is attacking the chair for lowering interest rates, which they started to do in September, just a couple of months before the election.\n\nAnd why are they lowering interest rates?\n\nSo they’re doing this because they wanted to support the economy. At this time, inflation had receded from some of that post-pandemic peak and the labor market was starting to cool off. And this was the big first rate reduction that we had seen in the post-pandemic period. And in Trump’s eyes, this was entirely political. They were doing this to tip the scales towards Kamala Harris’s campaign to juice the economy, basically, before all the voters descended to the voting booths.\n\nGot it. So in Trump’s mind, if the interest rate is being cut when he is a candidate for president, and Biden is the incumbent, and Harris is running, then it’s being done, in some ways, to screw with him.\n\nAnd also, it was the magnitude that I think pissed him off even more. Typically, the Fed moves in these quarter point increments, and they ended up moving much faster than that for the first cut. And then the Fed ended up cutting interest rates again in November. They cut interest rates in December. And then Trump comes back to the White House, and then the Fed presses pause on all of it. They say we’re going to wait and see, and we need to take stock of what President Trump has planned for this economy.\n\nRight, because Trump has a lot planned for the economy in the second term. Once he gets in, he is issuing executive orders on immigration. He is levying tariffs on countries across the world. DOGE is cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs. The things Trump campaigned on, he’s now doing. I’m hearing you say that the Fed, looking at all of this, is saying, that’s a lot. We need to see how it filters through the economy before we can make any educated decision about the interest rate.\n\nRight. Tariffs, for instance. The thinking there is that it’s going to raise inflation at the same time that it slows down growth. The immigration crackdown, that’s going to shrink the labor force. And it also could mean higher inflation as well. You also have tax cuts layered on top of that and deregulation. So there’s a lot of moving parts. And the Fed, they move slowly. It takes a lot of time to gain consensus amongst all the various officials to get to the right point and know which direction to go in terms of interest rates. And they don’t want to rush.\n\nAnd their argument here is that the economy is on solid enough footing that there’s no urgency here. Meanwhile, Trump is like, we got to cut interest rates now. I want lower borrowing costs that’s going to be better for my economic agenda.\n\nExactly. Deja Vu.\n\nAnd what’s still very much at the heart of this perhaps irretrievably dysfunctional relationship is Trump wants Jay Powell to lower interest rates. Powell isn’t giving in to Trump’s demands. He’s keeping them exactly where they are. But I wonder, just based purely on the economic situation we’re in now, whether Trump has any point here that may make him right, even if it might seem to Powell like his motivations are wrong.\n\nSo he’s right in the sense that inflation has come down over time, that we are in a situation in which, compared to where we were a couple years ago, price pressures are a lot more muted and the economy is looking OK. And in an environment like that, it makes total sense that the Fed would be cutting interest rates from these relatively elevated levels and providing some support.\n\nBut the problem is is that the policies that he has laid out are inflationary. That’s at least what economists and policymakers think is the case. And when you have a situation where you think inflation is coming down the pipe, you’re not going to lower interest rates now if you eventually have to reverse course later because consumer prices start rising again in a significant way.\n\nAnd specifically, when we say that Trump’s policies are inflationary, I’m assuming we mean his tariffs in particular.\n\nIt’s tariffs in particular, but I also think it’s immigration restrictions. When you cut back the supply of labor in the economy, that means fewer workers. That could potentially mean companies have to provide higher wages to get people in the door again. So there are reasons to think that inflation has not been vanquished entirely here.\n\nRight. And as we know, that is the very thing Jay Powell is most anxious about, not having done vanquishing inflation.\n\nThat’s the lesson that is being internalized here at the Fed and what’s fueling this debate that’s ongoing amongst officials at the current moment. So Jay Powell isn’t alone in wanting to be patient in terms of cutting interest rates. There’s a large group of policymakers that are also kind of in his corner. But other officials have taken a different view that are slightly more aligned with what the Trump administration is at here. So what the heart of the debate comes down to is how to view inflation caused by tariffs.\n\nWe go back to the same kind of question that we grappled with after the pandemic, is this inflation temporary, or is it persistent? Now the thinking here amongst this cohort of officials is that tariffs are actually going to lead to only a temporary burst in inflation. So the case that this is temporary rests on this assumption that these price pressures are going to come through, but they’re not going to feed on themselves. So back during the post-pandemic period, what we ended up seeing was that these price pressures broadened out.\n\nSo it wasn’t just in the supply chain-disrupted sectors. It spread well beyond that into services, into areas that were not directly impacted by the pandemic. And the thinking of this group of officials is that it’s going to stay pretty contained. And that means that over time, it’s not going to lead to inflation getting out of control again. Now that’s really, I think, where the Trump administration is at in terms of what is going to happen to inflation over time.\n\nBut what is preventing the bulk of the Fed from moving in that same direction is the fact that they don’t want to make the same mistake again twice. They want more data. They want to take a little bit more time. They want to have more certainty than otherwise would be the case had they not just made this error a couple of years ago.\n\nRight. And we should say, you and I are talking after the government just released monthly inflation data that showed that prices rose 2.7 percent in May compared with May a year ago, which is to say that if you’re at the Fed and you’re in the Jay Powell camp of wait and see, you’ve just seen data that suggests that prices are continuing to rise, and your instinct is probably not to defer to the Trump camp that says cut interest rates, roll the dice, hope it’s temporary. Your fear is that it’s not temporary. And your evidence, in part, is this new data.\n\nRight. And the data showed clear evidence that tariffs are starting to impact consumer prices. And I think what’s worrisome about this is that this is the early stages of this. So the expectation for economists and policymakers is that as the summer continues, this is just only going to intensify as we get new data. And so that puts the Fed in a really uncomfortable position. How is it going to justify cutting interest rates when price pressures are moving away from their stated goal and the economy is still kind of doing OK?\n\nIt doesn’t seem like the rationale is really there just yet. And so I think that’s why we can broadly expect them to see them extend this whole wait-and-see approach at least for the next couple of months.\n\nWhich of course explains why the president is now so evidently furious at Powell, so much so that he waves that draft letter saying you’re fired in the Oval Office. We should be careful and say he hasn’t sent that letter. It’s therefore not official. But that raises the question, can Trump fire Jay Powell?\n\nSo the president can’t outright fire a Fed chair. The rules stipulate that once they’re in that position and confirmed by the Senate, they’re relatively protected here. And the only mechanism that the president has, which was just recently reestablished by the Supreme Court earlier this year, is that the president has to find cause in order to get rid of a Fed official.\n\nRight. You can’t just fire him because you disagree with him. You have to fire him because he took a bribe.\n\nRight. It can’t be about a rate decision. It has to be severe misconduct or some kind of dereliction of duty. And that really raises the bar for Trump to find something in order to get Powell removed. One of the avenues that we have seen most recently is Republicans going after the Fed chair for renovations taking place at the Central Bank’s headquarters down in DC. These are very costly. They attract a lot of attention at a time when there are cuts across the government.\n\nAnd recently, there was an allegation that Chair Powell had lied to Congress about the extent of the plans. And when legal experts have pieced through these accusations, they have been concerned that this is one of the ways in which the Trump administration is trying to build the case for cause. Now that’s a really hard argument to build, and I don’t think a lot of people think it’s going to be successful.\n\nSo what are the other options?\n\nSo the other options that the president has toyed with is naming Powell’s successor early. So Powell’s term ends in May of 2026. And so the idea here is that by naming someone early and having them come out and talk about a very divergent path for interest rates or to put forward a very different view on the economy that more aligns with President Trump’s, that that’s a way for them to discredit Powell and put more attention on whoever’s going to be taking the reins in a couple month’s time.\n\nIt would kind be like having two popes. You’d almost have, in theory, two Fed chairs, one official, one kind of shadow.\n\nAnd that is a recipe for disaster in terms of communication for the Fed because what they rely on is that financial markets have an understanding of where they’re going with interest rates and policy, and that is what makes their policy-setting effective. So if you have the same institution essentially speaking in completely divergent ways, that could lead to a really bad outcome where people don’t know who to listen to.\n\nAnd so in a world where Trump does not get what he wants for the next many months — let’s even, for the sake of argument, say he may not get a rate cut before Jay Powell’s term is up next May. Suddenly, the president has the opportunity to put in place a replacement for Jay Powell. And I think we can presume it’s going to be someone who agrees with the president that, generally speaking, interest rates should be cut.\n\nWhat is it going to look like for us to have a Fed chairperson who may be in the mold of the rest of Trump’s appointees to various government agencies who see their role as fulfilling his vision? That’s not what Jay Powell thought. If we suddenly have a Fed chair who says, I wake up in the morning and my job is to see the economy as Trump sees it, what does that mean for us all? What does that mean for the US economy, and maybe even the global economy? It’s a big change.\n\nI think it’s a really worrying development. And it’s something that people are already grappling with today, this idea that this institution might not be this beacon of credibility that it has always been. If you have someone leading the Fed who is being influenced by the White House, that really changes your perception about the decisions that that person is trying to usher through.\n\nAnd one investor I spoke to was like, I don’t even know who the next Fed chair is, and I already don’t trust him. And that’s such a huge issue for whoever is in the role because the role is based upon having the support of financial markets and being seen as a credible individual guiding the economy in the right direction.\n\nWhat that investor was basically telling you is that what Trump has done in bludgeoning Jay Powell the way he has over these now many years is made it impossible for people to see his next choice as someone who can operate independently.\n\nAnd the stakes could not be higher.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nYou could easily see a situation where we have higher inflation, a worse economic backdrop, and a person in the role who is not willing to make the tough choices that would potentially go against the president that would benefit the long-term health of the economy over these short-term gains that President Trump has focused on.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWell, Colby, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, President Trump issued a blistering rebuke of those on the right who are upset with him over how he’s handled files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender whose connections to the rich and powerful have spurred conspiracy theories about his suicide. In a social media post, Trump mocked those who are criticizing him as past supporters who have, quote, bought into this bullshit hook, line, and sinker.\n\nBut the reality is that current supporters are among his critics, including Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and the conservative activist Laura Loomer. And —\n\nDuring an audacious attack in broad daylight, Israel launched deadly airstrikes on the capital of Syria, damaging its Defense Ministry and nearly hitting its presidential palace.\n\nIsrael said that the strikes are an attempt to stop Syria’s new government from attacking a minority group in the country’s Southern region, which borders Israel. Israel said that it would keep striking Syria’s government until Syrian troops withdraw from the region.\n\nToday’s episode was produced by Rikki Novetsky, and Olivia Knapp, with help from Rachelle Bonja.

Stephen Miller just wants to deport people. I’m for deporting people. I really like Stephen Miller. Evangelical support for deporting illegal immigrants is very high. In the world of online influencers, one evangelical Christian writer and podcaster stands out. So we’ve got a lot to get to on today’s episode of Relatable. Offering her audience a blend of politics, theology, and lifestyle advice. Trump round 2 is not here to make friends. And I love that. Progressive propaganda is everywhere, especially on TikTok. Wear a dress to church. Don’t act ugly. Is Allie Beth Stuckey an example of what religious authority looks like in America today? Satan is in a battle not just for our souls, but for our bodies. Liberals will do anything but read their Bible. And why does she think the biggest problem in American politics isn’t too much cruelty, but the wrong kind of empathy? Your empathy becomes toxic when it encourages you to validate lies. To affirm sin. And when we ignore facts in favor of feelings, we tend to push for policy that does not make sense and is destructive. Allie Beth Stuckey, welcome to Interesting Times. Thank you, I appreciate it. It’s- no, the pleasure is all mine. So we’re going to try and have a conversation that covers evangelical Christianity, some of the divides within it, its relationship to Donald Trump. But first I want to talk about what it is that you do. So you make a podcast called Relatable, and The Atlantic wrote a profile of you a little while ago, and I think they called you something like “the New Phyllis Schlafly,” which is a reference, of course, to the famous female conservative activist from the 1970s and 1980s. So just to start out, what is it that you do? Are you a political commentator, a religious teacher, a lifestyle influencer? Yes, that’s a great question. So I try to occupy that space where politics and theology intersects Christian theology, specifically. And I describe myself as a Christian wife and mom who is trying to navigate the chaos of our culture with as much clarity and courage as God is willing to give me. And so that does mean talking about politics. There are seasons over the past few years that I have focused mostly on politics, especially in an election year. “You’re not simply voting for the lesser of two evils, you are voting to lessen evil.” I really want, especially the mostly suburban moms and women ages 25 to 45, that are listening to this show to understand what is at stake, what’s the difference between the two candidates. And I don’t try to remain neutral in that. Everyone knows I’m a Christian conservative. Thus far I have always voted Republican, but there are also a lot of times, and I would say right now is this kind of season where I and I think my audience kind of feel exhausted by the news cycle. They’re not as interested in politics as they were before. And they’re more interested in talking about the deeper underlying theological issues or topics or trends. And I like to focus on that. And so, I don’t know if I could say that I am squarely a political commentator. I certainly wouldn’t call myself a Bible study leader or religious teacher. I just try to occupy the space where those two things very clearly mix together and intersect as much as I possibly can. There’s also just a strong parenting and motherhood and, sort of, female life element. I feel like, to what you do and what you talk about. So just looking at, looking at your recent podcasts. There’s discussions about Christian evangelism in L.A., and abortion and politics. “We need to start thinking about the dignity and the humanity of every human being from the moment of conception.” And then there’s also discussions about sunscreen and parenting styles, right? And the secret to fixing your period. So it sounds like there are a lot of potential natural remedies for the menstrual issues that people have. So I almost feel like you’re selling yourself almost a little bit short by saying it’s just about politics and theology, right? Like, it’s a larger discussion about how to be a Christian woman with an emphasis both on “Christian” and on “woman.” Yeah, I think that’s a fair point. We certainly do talk about lifestyle things, and while I don’t consider myself some mainstay in the MAHA movement, there are a lot of principles in that I really appreciate. We have been talking about health and wellness, certainly since COVID, some of the deception that we see in the medical industry coming from official science and scientific institutions like the C.D.C. And I think that has kind of given way to a conversation consistently on my podcast about O.K, what is actually true scientifically? What is true about our bodies and how do we apply that to how we take care of ourselves and how we take care of our families? And so, yes, that definitely intersects with motherhood. But I also don’t consider myself some kind of family or motherhood influencer, if that makes sense. Yeah no, it absolutely does. So who is your audience right now? Who is the Allie Beth Stuckey listener? Yes, I would say it is mostly Christian conservative women ages 25 to 45. There are obviously men who listen as well, but that is- How many men, how many men listen to the show? Well, they have their own name- You don’t have to give me a specific number but- They’re even called the Relatabros. And I call my husband chief Relatabro. He is the head of the Relatabros. And I would say, at least from the YouTube demographic information that we have, I believe it’s 85 percent female or maybe 80 percent female. And so, there’s a chunk, there’s definitely a chunk of men who listen to and watch the show. And it’s not like always- some episodes like “How to Fix Your Period” - probably not going to be for them, but other episodes they can enjoy just as much. So Relatabros. Women 25 to 45. What else would you say that people who are in your sphere are listening to and reading and consuming? Do you feel like you’re part of a larger millennial and maybe Zoomer ecosystem for younger Christians? I would say if my audience wants day to day news, they are probably a lot of them are probably watching Megyn Kelly, which I would say me too. I love Meghan and I love her analysis of the news. And so I think a lot of them are probably going to her for that for a big chunk, it seems, of my audience, I am the only connection to the news and politics that they have, which I take that role very seriously in their lives. And so they’re not listening to a bunch of other political shows, too. That’s really interesting. Do you feel like you’re the main religious of conversation partner for. Yeah, not in terms of the home or church, but in terms of the internet. I don’t think so. I think for Christian women, I think in the Christian world I am seen as political. So in the larger evangelical world, if they think Allie Beth Stuckey, they’re thinking she talks politics. I think in the political world, when I’m going to speak at Turning Point or speak at a conservative organization conference, they think of me as the Christian one. I am going to talk about the legacy of Christian courage that is our heritage as Christians. The one who is always talking about the Bible. So yeah, I think for one group, I’m probably the plugin for religion and Christianity. For another group, they see me as their connection to politics. Interesting and why do you think younger women are drawn to your particular style, your way of talking about the world. I think it is number one, clarity. I think, from a lot of evangelical leaders and pastors who have, I would say, a tougher job than me in a lot of ways. So I’m not trying to throw all of them under the bus, but they’re just not as clear about what. What does the Bible say about gender. What does the Bible say about marriage. Does the Bible have anything to say about immigration. I think the biggest surge in followers, listeners that I had, at least at in a short period of time, was in 2020 when everyone was posting the black square. Everyone was saying that George Floyd was killed because of racism. Everyone was saying that white people, and especially white evangelicals, had a role to play in George Floyd’s death. We all need to sit back and listen and learn. And even in churches, we need to be reading white fragility, and I don’t like to Pat myself on the back at all, because I certainly wasn’t alone. But among white evangelical women, I have been one of the only ones to say, no, that’s not biblical, and that’s not how I’m talking about it. I’m not going to shame white women. I’m not going to say that they need to sit down and shut up and be lambasted for something that someone who might have looked like them in the same geographical region did 200 years ago or 50 years ago. That’s not the biblical definition of justice. And so I think that there have been a lot of points like that over the past five years where it seems like evangelicals have gone soft, just moved to the left, especially on social justice and race issues, where I have been one of the only ones that these women are listening to willing to say no. And not because I’m cruel, not because I’m harsh, but because I don’t think that’s what the Bible says. And I think God’s justice and love and mercy And truth are much better than the secular social justice mongers would have you believe. So I want to go further on the argument that you just raised the critique of evangelical leaders drifting to the left. But before that, can you talk a little bit about how you grew up and your religious upbringing. Yes so I am very grateful that I was raised in a conservative Christian home. I don’t remember talking about politics a whole lot growing up. I do remember really caring about the bush-gore election. Now, mind you, I was in second grade at this time, and I remember we had this mock election in our classroom, and only one girl said that she and her parents were going to vote for Gore. And it was this huge deal. And because I was raised in a very conservative suburb of Dallas, and I went to a conservative Christian school, kindergarten through 12th grade. And so all of that, I’m sure, contributed to my natural conservatism. But certainly a Christian upbringing, certainly, that contributed to the values that I still hold today. Southern Baptist church growing up, Wednesday, Sunday morning, Sunday night, all of that good stuff. Parents really not only talk the talk, but walk the walk, which I think also has helped me. And are you still a Southern baptist? Yes, I still go to a Southern Baptist church. I don’t know if I align with every single doctrinal belief that I had in the churches growing up, but I do still consider myself a Southern Baptist. We’ll talk a little bit about that. Was there any kind of pivot point in your own religious development. So I grew up going to Southern Baptist churches in high school. I started going to a nondenominational, non-denominational church by myself, I think, when I was a junior. I do remember that church and a Bible teacher that I had in school in my junior year, really kind of opening my eyes to reformed theology. And it was in college that I probably would have started identifying as reformed. So go, go a little further, because my suspicion is that at least part of our audience isn’t intensely familiar with, for instance, reformed or Calvinist views on the end times. So what does it mean to in the context of American protestantism? If somebody says, I identify as reformed, what. What does that mean. Well, a lot of things within Protestant in less than in less than, Yes, in less than all I’ll say it’s a long there’s a long answer, a short one, I’ll give a short answer. But suffice it to say, there are disagreements about what it means to be reformed. I would consider myself a reformed Baptist. What I mean by that is that gosh, I don’t know if there’s a short way to explain all of this talking about predestination that is a centerpiece of Calvinism, whether you believe that people were predestined to be Christians or whether it is by human effort that we are saved. But I fall into the predestination camp. We also just have a really big emphasis on theological study. And I would say biblical literalism in a lot of ways. And yeah, gosh, I don’t know. It just depends on when you want me to go. Well, we don’t want to take up the whole conversation with this, but let’s extend it in a couple ways. So reformed. Means, let’s say, a really strong emphasis on God’s grace and God’s will over and against human effort, human effort alone. There’s an incredibly strong emphasis on the Bible, not just as the word of God, but as the defining test of Christian life in a way that again, is distinct from catholicism’s emphasis on the authority of the Pope or the bishops. But let’s do the beginning and the end of the world, and then we’ll. And then we’ll move on. So we can do the end of the world first. So there’s a lot of debates in evangelical Protestantism about the end times and what Christians should expect, how to interpret the Book of Revelation, all these kinds of things. So where does your tradition fall on that. Yeah, I would call myself a classic or historic pre realist. And for those out there that are like, what are y’all even talking about. I’m sorry. You don’t need to know this right now to become a Christian. But like classical premillennialist means that I don’t believe that Christians are going to be raptured before the tribulation. I think that we are here for that. We’re not going to escape that by rapture. And then there are differences in view as well. On the role of Israel. What is Israel. Who is Israel. There’s a lot of debate about that right now within Christianity, too, especially in light of the end times. And just to oversimplify, your camp is a little less likely to identify the current state of Israel with the biblical Israel in a way that other evangelicals might be likely to do. And that is where I would diverge from the vast majority of Southern Baptists who do believe that God has a special particular plan for Israel salvation, that it is the current geographical state of Israel. Whereas I would point to several passages in scripture to say that that’s not quite right, even though, as I’ve said many times, I do support supporting Israel in a variety of ways for other reasons. And so just since I promised the beginning as well. Are from your perspective. Are you. Are you a six day creationist? Do you think I am. The world was literally. It literally made in six days, right. As in as in the beginning of Genesis. Right Yes. It seems to me that that’s what Jesus believes. And when he speaks about the Old Testament and the creation order, he seems to speak of it in a literal sense when he’s speaking in the Gospels. And that’s a good verification for me. So that’s where you’ve ended up. You belong to a tradition that does not have female pastors that, follows Saint Paul’s words about how women should not be leaders speaking in church. And so on. And I think a lot of people outside your religious context would see that as a tension. That here’s someone who belongs to a church that doesn’t have female pastors, and yet is presenting herself as an authority figure. As in your framing filling the breach when actual pastors are failing. So do you think that’s a tension. That’s a great question. Yes I do. Take literally Paul’s admonition that women are not to teach in church. Now, there is a debate and we could even get into this. This would probably be an interesting conversation. How I think the Christian right has actually changed in the past five years when it comes to how they see the role of women. Five years ago, no one talked about that tension to me. No one had an issue with me saying, yeah, I don’t think women should be pastors and preachers, but I don’t take that to mean that women shouldn’t talk, that women can’t be persuasive, that there aren’t different ways for women to lead and influence and persuade outside of the context of the pulpit and the local church on Sunday morning. It does get tricky when it seems like I am saying, which I try not to say explicitly, but hey, your male pastor is acting cowardly and he’s not being clear on this. Don’t listen to that because he’s asking you to compromise. But I’m not trying to say, listen to me or follow me, or you should listen to this podcast instead of going to church. I’m trying to say, whether you listen to me or not, read your Bible, and I want your reading of the Bible to determine what church you go to. And if you don’t go to a church that is preaching the entire counsel of God, even when that is inconvenient for the culture, then you should go to a different church. What do you think Paul means then. Or what do you what do you think is the key distinction here between church Sunday morning as a space of male authority and Tuesday morning podcasting as a space of we’ll just call it female communication, but. But look, let’s be honest. You’re not just communicating, right. You’re making an argument, you’re making a critique. And whether you invest yourself with a pastor’s authority or not, there are people who regard you as authoritative. So what is the theological distinction from your perspective, between that kind of Sunday morning space and your work outside of the work of a pastor. Well, one is church and one is not. And the church has a distinct governing body, and the pastor has not only the role of persuasion. Although I agree with you, that’s basically what a sermon is. But he’s not just a preacher, he is also a pastor. He is also a shepherd. He has the ability to exercise church discipline. And I am not that I don’t have the authority to exercise those things over someone’s life. And Yes, of course, people do regard me as a leader in some sense, but I don’t think that there is any command against that kind of influence. And mode of persuasion in scripture when it comes to women. The church is the body of Christ, or the church is the bride of Christ, rather is what I meant to say. And it is distinct from a Podcast Studio, as and I’m sure you agree with this as a Catholic, it’s not just four walls. It is distinct from the rest of the world. I do agree, I think that in if you look at the Catholic tradition, you see a lot of cases where prominent female leaders seem to emerge with a message that seems intended to honestly, to shame men in authority in the church. And I’m curious if you think that the exercise of female authority in your church, in your religious landscape, is itself a reflection of male failure, right that you’re here and people are listening to you because men are failing. I do think that many pastors are failing. I don’t know if I can say all men in the Southern Baptist or evangelical world not all are failing. Not all, but I think many. And now I think that there are a lot of clear and obedient and courageous pastors. And just because they’re not going viral or they’re not written about in the media, that doesn’t mean that they don’t exist. But there are some very prominent leaders and prominent figures within evangelicalism who are straight up soft. They’re soft when it comes to sexuality. They were soft when it came to the necessity of churches meeting together physically during COVID. They were soft when it came to the difference between biblical justice and secular social justice, and they are unwilling to say simply what the Bible says about these things. I don’t think that pastors should get up every Sunday and tell you what’s going on in the news. I don’t think that they are bound to the news cycle, but when the Bible says, in the beginning, God created them male and female in his image, he created them. They shouldn’t avoid that. They shouldn’t pretend like that doesn’t mean what it means. We shouldn’t pretend that the Bible doesn’t speak so clearly to so many of the so-called culture war issues of our day, and because they are scared of what they may lose by speaking up, because they like to be written about nicely in the New York Times’ or wherever, they’re just not willing to say it. And I think that’s a travesty, because I think clarity is the most loving thing that we can give the people who listen to us. All right. So let’s go a little deeper into this critique. So you wrote a book entitled toxic empathy how progressives exploit Christian compassion. And so you can see just from the subtitle that it is effectively both a critique of secular progressivism and also a critique of your fellow Christians. And I think a lot of people hear a word like empathy and think that it is just something that Christians are automatically called to and that a critique of empathy is effectively a critique of Christianity itself. So what is toxic empathy. What is wrong with some forms of empathy from your perspective. And that is correct. Some forms of empathy, I argue, and this is not my original argument. I heard Abigail Shrier first say this, and I think she might have even gotten this from Paul Bloom, which is a Yale psychologist who wrote a book called against empathy. An interesting side note is that in fact, my own mother once wrote an essay critiquing empathy for First Things magazine some years ago, in which she drew on Paul Bloom, who is a secular psychologist, criticizing from a secular perspective a overidentification with other people’s feelings. All of which is to say I am. I am a somewhat sympathetic audience for this kind of argument. So I just wanted to give proper credit to what for this first line that I’m about to say is that empathy by itself is neutral. Empathy by itself, I believe, is neither good nor bad. And I that’s probably not an exact quote from Paul Bloom, but that’s kind of where I got that line of reasoning, is that it is not in itself a virtue. It is not in itself, something that we should aspire to. And that alone kind of like knocks people off their skates. When I say that, I say that it can be positive in what it can lead you to or it can be negative in what it can lead you to. An example I give in my book. I was traveling with my three-year-old at the time we were going to Atlanta. My hands were full. She was in her runaway era. I was trying to get down the jet bridge. There was no way that I could control her and get all the stuff that I needed down. So I just literally sat down and I didn’t know what to do, and I was almost on the verge of tears. And this woman came up to me. I had all these people pass me by and this woman came up to me and she just looked at me and she said, it’s O.K, I’m a mom. I get it. And she got one of my bags and we made it to our seat and it was great. And then just a couple weeks later, I was traveling by myself and I saw this mom with her toddler. She had her stroller, she had all of her stuff, and I could see it like she was on the verge of tears. She was trying to get to her seat and she didn’t know how she was going to do it. Well, I had been there. I felt so deeply exactly how she felt. And because of that, because I just knew so personally the stress that she was feeling, I was able to meet her need and I grabbed her bag. She made it to her seat, and she was good to go. And so having been there, being able to put yourself in someone’s shoes can lead you to do the right thing. It can lead you to sacrifice. It can lead you to selflessness. It can lead you to acts of love and kindness. But putting yourself in someone’s shoes, feeling what they feel can also lead you. I say to do three things that makes empathy toxic, and that is one validate lies. That is to affirm sin, and that is 3 support destructive policies. Those are the three characteristics that I put on empathy that I think can make it toxic. So in your definition, just so listeners are clear, empathy means the act of feeling or trying to feel what others are feeling. And it’s distinct, therefore from compassion or sympathy where you are trying to help someone, you might feel bad for them, but you aren’t trying to feel directly their set of emotions. This is primarily, then, about empathizing with people who are either doing something that is wrong for understandable human reasons, or who are supporting policies that are themselves going to lead to bad outcomes, even if they have charitable motives. Well, it’s not against even feeling trying to feel how they feel. It is allowing feeling how they feel to lead you to justify what they are doing, which happens in abortion, in the gender debate and the sexuality debate and the Justice debate and the immigration debate, because we feel so deeply for this one purported victim. We say, well, maybe deportation is wrong, or maybe I should affirm this person’s stated gender even though it Mrs. mismatches, their biology. Or maybe I should affirm the right to have an abortion because I feel so deeply for this person’s plight. That is when your empathy has led you in a bad direction. And I think has turned toxic. But this is somewhat distinct, then, from one of the arguments that Paul Bloom makes in his book. which is that one problem with empathy is that it can actually lead in the other direction towards this kind of helplessness. Everything that happens in the world, you feel in some way because you’re empathizing with other people so much, and this paralyzes you. It’s like, O.K, the problems of the world are too large. I can’t possibly solve them. Do you think that’s a problem with empathy as well. Yes that’s not a theme that I explore in my book, although I think it’s interesting. I also think it’s interesting that actually, the more you emphasize, especially with kids like in the classroom, the more you emphasize empathy, the meaner those kids can get to those in the outgroup. I think that Abigail Shrier phrased it like this full of empathy and mean as hell. And I see that with a lot of progressives, and I call it misplaced mothering. I think a lot of progressives, they take under their wing those that they see as victims. So say it is the man who identifies as a woman who wants to go into the women’s bathroom, wants to play against women in sports. They see this person as marginalized, as vulnerable, as misunderstood, and they feel so deeply for them. They feel so deeply for their pain that anyone who comes against their chosen victim, this person that they care for, they have a hostile reaction to in the same way that a mama bear would have a hostile reaction to someone who is trying to attack her Cubs. That is how I think a lot of deeply feeling progressives feel about illegal aliens, or whoever they see as a victim. Those of us who are on the other side of the issue, they actually see as oppressors, as enemies of their chosen victims. And I think that’s why it causes just the absolute cruelty that often we see from progressives who simultaneously say that they are deeply empathetic and loving. So this is a critique of progressivism and how progressivism has ended up essentially taking particular sides in the immigration debate and the debates about transgenderism, other issues like that. But then it’s also a critique of your fellow Christians, right. You think that this is a trap, that people who have theologically conservative commitments, in fact, in many cases have fallen into, especially over the last five or 10 years. Yes, especially, I would say in the summer of 2020. I mean, I saw this a lot with COVID, but I also saw this a lot when it came to the conversation about race and police brutality. We’d have these claims that America is systemically racist, that the church has played a large part in that white people need to be apologetic and humble and listen and learn and all of this stuff. And I would point to certain statistics or I would question certain narratives. And what I got told over and over again is that sometimes the truth doesn’t matter. Sometimes it doesn’t matter what the data says, that you just have to have empathy. And while I don’t disagree that sometimes you shouldn’t bring up data and facts in a conversation with a person when you just need to have compassion for them, the truth actually does matter, especially when it’s leading to certain policy decisions. And so I just don’t buy that idea that sometimes we have to exchange the truth for empathy and let people believe a lie, because it feels better for them. I think that is actually really cruel and hateful and ultimately destructive. So now let’s talk about how this argument looks from the other side of the debate for a minute. And I think what’s interesting about how you’re describing this is you’re framing the divide in terms of what happened in the year 2020. And that from your point of view, it seems like the divide reflects the evangelical response to COVID, to the pandemic, to whether churches should accept long running restrictions and Trump and Trump. So that’s what I wanted to bring it around to because from the point of view of I think a lot of people who you have criticized or and who have certainly criticized you, the divide just starts with Trump. And where you see toxic empathy. They see, I think, I’m not sure if there’s a single word for it, but a systematic delight in other people’s tears. I think that is cruel. Actually I mean, cruel cruelty. I guess cruelty, I guess is the one word phrase that Trump himself is cruel. He mocks people, he’s savage to people and so on. But that also attached to this. There’s this sense of we love to hear the liberals cry. If we’re deporting people. You see this in the second Trump term. We’re going to make a YouTube video about deportation, that reveling in reveling, reveling in rounding people up and these kind of things. Yeah And I think clearly, if empathy can be toxic, cruelty can be even more toxic, right. And so I do. Do you think that is a fair critique of Trump and Trumpism and its impact on American politics. Maybe but it’s not a fair critique of my argument. It’s not a fair critique of my book, because my argument is that toxic empathy is cruel, that it ignores the people on the other side of the moral equation. For example, if you take the abortion issue, I start out by telling the story of a woman named Samantha. Her story was first told by NPR. She found out that her baby had a fatal fetal anomaly at the 20 week mark. But in Texas, she wasn’t allowed to abort her child. NPR tells the story as if this was horrible for Samantha, who had to go through the financial, physical, and emotional burden of bearing this child only to have this child to die by the end of the story, the reader feels exactly how it seems NPR wants them to feel, which is that this is a great injustice towards Samantha. How dare these draconian laws force her to do something so painful, so financially burdensome. We need to liberate women from these anti-abortion laws that are making them go through so much. O.K, so you have so much empathy for Samantha that you support the pro-abortion position by the end of through the mode of storytelling. But then what I try to do is tell the story from the other perspective. The actual victim in this story, the would be victim in this story that NPR and most mainstream media outlets do not want you to know about. And that is the baby. They don’t want you to think about the actual victim of abortion. So what would have been this baby whose name is Halo. What would have been her fate if Texas had not had this quote unquote draconian pro-life law. She would have been poisoned. She would have dismembered, been dismembered, she would have been discarded like toxic waste. But instead she was delivered and clothed and named and held and loved and buried like the full human being that she is. So my argument is that toxic empathy, because it only focuses on one purported victim and ignores the actual victims on the other side of the equation when it comes to any issue, not just abortion. It is actually cruel and destructive and deadly, both for the individual and for society. So we can agree that some of the things that Trump has said, that even Republicans, they’re much more brazen. I would agree with you now about what some people would call cruelty. And we can get into that. But it’s I’m not saying that all compassion is bad. Actually, compassion and empathy aren’t even the same things I’m saying. No what you progressive in many cases are calling empathetic are calling nice is actually really cruel. It’s actually really bad. So yeah, that’s what I’m saying. I’m actually saying that the progressives use empathy as a vehicle to ultimate cruelty. But, but so let’s talk about a different issue for a minute though. Let’s talk about immigration. So part of your argument is that as I understand it would be that you have a set of conservative leaning evangelicals who are alienated from Donald Trump in some way alienated from the Republican Party and end up being pulled to the left. But that this happens not just on issues like abortion and transgender issues, but it also happens on an issue like immigration. And seems to me that immigration is just an issue where you have competing entirely and entirely reasonable forms of we don’t even have to call it empathy. We can just say sympathy instead a reflection that people have understandable desires to have a better life. And people have understandable desires to have immigration proceed at a reasonable rate that doesn’t overwhelm their communities. People have understandable fears about crime and disorder and violence. But these things need to be balanced in various ways. And it doesn’t seem to me that there is a single definitive. Christian position on what the absolutely best immigration rate should be or anything like that. Yeah, I would agree with that part. Where do you think your fellow Christians have gone wrong on immigration. Yes so you are absolutely right. There are always going to be people on any issue, but especially immigration, who demand our empathy. And, I’m O.K with saying that. Or you could say sympathy or just feeling deeply for their plight. I would say a lot of people on the progressive side don’t even consider the plight of those who have been negatively impacted by illegal immigration on a large scale or on an individual level. I think that ultimately, and this is really kind of my argument in the book, is that there are always going to be people on both sides of any story with real pain, with real stories that matter. And both people are made in the image of God. So at the end of the day, that’s why you can’t be led by empathy. Because if you allow yourself, you can feel really deep empathy for people with competing needs and interests. And so at the end of the day, I think the Christian has to ask ourselves, but what is true. And then what does the Bible say. And you’re right. On an issue like immigration, it’s not as clear as where the Bible stands when it comes to the reality of the gender binary of male and female. The definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, or the value of life starting at the moment of conception, as made in the Imago DEI. Immigration is not as clear. We can only look to scripture to see the principles of nations of governance, of laws, of borders, of security, of God’s provision through walls, the book of Nehemiah and say, O.K, can we apply those principles to America today. Do they still have wisdom. Does it make sense why God wanted secure walls for Jerusalem. Does that still apply to America. We can just use logic to say, O.K, if we don’t have borders, we don’t have sovereignty, then we don’t have citizenship, then we don’t have rights. And that’s bad for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. And if we can’t enforce immigration law, then we essentially have no borders or sovereignty. And of course, there are going to be sad stories within that. But at the end of the day, sovereignty matters for every single country, not just for America. That’s how I think through it. And I think that there are people in good faith who are sincere Christians who could agree, disagree with me on different forms of immigration policy. But for the people who simply use this issue to what I would say, virtue signal, say, I can’t believe ICE is doing this or Trump is doing this, or this is so bad. Or look at this one story, even though they’ll never talk about Kate Steinle or Lincoln Riley or the stories on the other side of it. The stories on the other side are stories of Americans who have been murdered or assaulted by illegal immigrants. I forget the New York Times’ audience might not just know those stories automatically in those names, but I just want to What is their solution. Really any progressive, not just a Christian, but what is their solution. Like, I guess I don’t know the answer either, but I don’t hear from the other side. Like, do we have an unconditional, unmitigated obligation to accept everyone into America no matter what just because they want a better life. Is there any limit. Is there any immigration law that we can enforce. Is there any kind of way to nicely deport and detain people who shouldn’t be here. And so I’m not hearing a whole lot of solutions from the other side either. And maybe that’s I don’t a place that we can try to come together and figure something out. Well, I guess what I’m interested in is in part, just how evangelicalism has ended up so polarized. And this does seem like a case, honestly, where it kind of makes a case for empathy that where I feel like my evangelical friends who are very, very anti-trump extremely anti-trump, often show a failure of understanding toward why so many conservative Christians would end up voting Republican, even under Trumpian conditions. And I feel like there’s a pretty clear failure of just understanding how the world looks from the perspective of somebody who decides to stay Republican and decides to stay a Trump voter. I feel like I see this, I see this all the time, but I also feel like there’s a failure of empathy from your side. You’re an evangelical Christian. In 2015, 2016, you watch your political party being taken over by a man whose personal life obviously defies all of the moral norms that evangelicals struggled so hard to uphold in the 1990s. During all the Bill Clinton controversies and so on, a man whose policies break with places where sincere, pro-life, pro-marriage conservatives were deeply, deeply involved in work aid, aid to Africa, aid to the developing world, and a president who on immigration doesn’t just say, we need to build the wall, right. He also clearly uses the language of scapegoat and cruelty around the very large number of people who have understandable reasons to migrate to the United States, whether or not it’s reasonable for the United States to welcome them. Sincere Christians recoil from this man, recoil from his takeover of the Republican Party, and in the process, Yes, end up kind of inevitably pulled somewhat to their left on issues where previously they were further to the right. But isn’t that understandable. Like, doesn’t that seem understandable to you as someone who disagrees with these people. It’s totally understandable. And I would say that I have given a lot of credit to that over the years, not only because I sincerely understand it, but because it’s more persuasive when you try to Steelman someone’s concerns rather than diminish them. And I’ve never voted for Donald Trump in a primary, because I’ve had plenty of issues with how Donald Trump talks or conducts himself. And honestly, my critiques have been from the right, though I have been troubled by some of the things that he said about abortion, have worried if he was really strong enough on the issues that I care about or if the second term would only be about some kind of personal vendetta. I’ve actually been very pleasantly surprised and pretty satisfied with a lot of the things that he has actually done in the way of conservatism. And so what I would want the other side to understand is that I hear you. I absolutely hear you. However, from my perspective, the other side is worse. Is was Donald Trump my pick in the primary. Obviously, he was the pick of a lot of people, but was he my pick in the primary. And there’s a lot of substantial majority. Yes And for a lot of Christians, though, who are in my camp, there are plenty of things about Donald Trump that we don’t love. But at the end of the day, when we look at the policies that affect our country, that affect our family, and Yes, when we weigh them against scripture, especially when it comes to the gender debate, Donald Trump wins every time against Joe Biden, every time against Kamala Harris and all of the things that they say that, well, at least the Democrats do this better or more compassionately or more biblically. I just don’t think that’s true. I judge policies by their outcomes, not by their stated intentions. Democrats have a lot of good stated intentions. I don’t think that the outcomes are kind or good, beneficial for society. And so Yeah, understand that there’s a lot of us over here who hear your concerns about Donald Trump, who don’t like his past adultery and different things that he has said, who would even take issue with him saying the F word. There are a lot of us out there like that who still say, Wow. But under Joe Biden, the USDA took funding away from public schools that didn’t allow boys into girls’ bathrooms. That’s evil. And the Trump administration is doing the opposite of that. And that’s good. So yeah, there are some really big things and a lot of big reasons that for I mean, we would just never wouldn’t vote for Donald Trump if it’s against another Democrat like that. I want to go just further into your critique of Trump and his second term, but just to pause on that issue, on the question of good and evil policies. Is there something that Donald Trump could do on immigration policy that you would consider evil. I am most sympathetic when it comes to the taking in of Christian refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere. I want these people to be protected. I mean, my highest priority is the protection of the preservation of Christians and especially persecuted Christians. And so the stories that I’ve seen about that of Christian refugees from war torn areas having a difficult time coming to the United States, that I would say is the most difficult for me, although even in that it’s so difficult because I don’t think that I can trust Christianity today and other liberal outlets to tell the total truth, because I know that they hate Donald Trump. And so it takes a lot of effort for those of us who are on the conservative side, who are open to arguments against some immigration policy, if it is truly cruel, if it is truly unwise. It’s difficult for us to know where to go to get the accurate information, because when you’re only seeing that stuff from people who hate Donald Trump anyway and want Christians to hate him, it’s a little hard to take that at face value. And do you do you think that there are clear theological what issues have clear theological answers and meaning. Is there a distinction between culture war issues or abortion or right to life issues. And we haven’t talked about climate change, but that’s another issue. Where there’s a critique of evangelical elites or evangelical pastors drifting to the left. But it seems to me that there are certain issues that Christian tradition speaks to in a way that is distinct from how to think about scientific debates about the rate of the impact of like, that’s just not a question where you open Nehemiah and say, this is the thing to take out of the Bible. right, right. Now, I agree with you. I would distinguish between creation order issues and non-creation order issues. I think that a lot of the so-called culture war issues that we debate today are answered. I mean, I could say in the first 27 verses of the Bible, but you could say in the first three chapters of the Bible or the first 11 chapters of the Bible, we get a lot of questions answered. I don’t think there’s any wiggle room about the definition of gender or marriage, or the value of life inside the womb, when it comes down to the nitty gritty of policy. Maybe, although I think there’s very little wiggle room when it comes to policy on those three issues when it comes to climate change, I actually do think that goes back to the creation order, our stewardship of the Earth, but also realizing that we do as humans have Dominion over the Earth. It’s not the other way around that human beings do matter more than plants or animals or any other part of creation. But when it comes to all of the different scientific discussions and policies surrounding that, you’re right. I don’t think that the Bible speaks clearly to that. I think we can look throughout Scripture to see the principles for a lot of things Justice and immigration and all of that, but those are going to be open to more debate and discussion, which I am also very open to than the big three abortion, gender and sexuality, which I think there should be zero debate on within Christianity. So in theory, though, then there isn’t any reason why you couldn’t share a church or a tradition with someone who was pro-life pro-traditional marriage and thought Christian refugees from the Middle East deserve better treatment than the Trump administration is giving them. Oh Yeah. Totally But in practice, though, it does seem like you think that conservative Christians who hold those views are in too far inside the liberal bubble. In the grip of us, in the grip of toxic empathy. Maybe in some cases, but. But mistaken. No, it would really depend. I mean, sure, if they were posting out there, if. Here’s the thing. This is what. Something that bothers me when I see this among a lot of evangelicals. They will only post about the news when it is an opportunity to be critical of Trump, and they will claim they’re not being political. They will post about if there is a case that seems like it is racism against a Black person by the police, or that’s how maybe the New York Times’ or another outlet is describing it, or whether it seems that the Trump administration is being cruel to refugees or to immigrants, they will post those stories, but they will never post stories that are critical of Joe Biden or the Democrats or on the other side of the equation. I think we can disagree as Christians on some of those things and the policy solutions to some of those things. But Yes, if you are allowing your outrage and your compassion to be exclusively or primarily dictated by what the mainstream media says is right and wrong, then Yes, I do think that you are probably being led by toxic empathy. Now if you’re truly outside of the political binary and you’re like, I always care about the issues no matter what human dignity like is my. That’s what I’m following. And I care about whatever story is out there, no matter how it makes any politician look. I can respect that. All right, so let’s then let’s finish with Trump himself and Trump’s second term. You mentioned earlier that you have critiques of Trump. You have critiques of his administration, but that there are often critiques from a culturally conservative perspective. And these range from critiques of Trump tap dancing or just striding away from some pro-life positions during the campaigns. You’ve been pretty critical of the Trump administration’s pro-life stance, which is, I think, pretty clearly a violation of pro-life principle from almost any reasonable definition of the term. Has Trump done anything, though, that isn’t in some way functionally pro-choice on abortion policy. Well, I know that he issued that executive order on IVF, which didn’t have a whole lot of teeth to it. I think he was just trying to communicate. Hey, I promised that I was going to do this when I was campaigning. And look here, I’m doing it. Obviously, I think that that’s a step in the wrong direction. You and I think, share that ethic on life that a lot of people out there, including conservatives, including a ton of evangelicals, maybe even professing Catholics, do not understand what you just said, that it is a violation of the pro-life ethic to be pro IVF. And I don’t expect Trump to understand that. And I don’t even know that. I expect a lot of people around Trump to understand that, because what I’ve realized in conservative evangelicalism at least, that is a very niche view. I just think it’s clear from a rhetorical perspective, that Trump, in the aftermath of Roe, has positioned himself as someone who says the issue should be returned to the United States. We’re not going to have national policy on abortion. We’re going to have some kind of support for, or at least rhetorical support for IVF, which I agree with you. Pro-life opposition to embryo creation and destruction in IVF is a. Narrower it’s a more niche position even within the pro-life movement. But I guess to me, right. It seems that religious conservatives got a. Lot out of the bargain with Donald Trump. More than a lot of anti-trump evangelicals and anti-trump religious conservatives expected. They did, in fact, get Roe v Wade overturned. They got a lot of moves, including moves on issues related to gender identity that would not necessarily have been predictable 5 to 10 years ago. So I would never argue that religious conservatives have just been taken for a ride by Trump. At the same time, when I look at Trump’s second term. When I look at the issues that he’s invested in, the issues that people around him are most invested in, very few of them seem to have anything to do with cultural conservatism, religious conservatism. Trump doesn’t want to talk about abortion. You can defend his policy on immigration from a religious perspective, but I don’t think anyone would argue that, Stephen Miller is sitting in his office in the White House carefully balancing the dictates of Christian charity and the biblical admonitions about the importance of building walls. Stephen Miller just wants to deport people. It just seems to me that at this moment, religious influence on the Trump administration and on conservatism is ebbing. And I’m curious if you think that’s right, or if you think I’m overreading that from my position at the New York Times’ Yeah, maybe so. I mean, I’m for deporting people. I really like Stephen Miller. Evangelical support for deporting illegal immigrants is very high. And I just I see a lot of effort from the left. It seems to go after that Christian demographic who is not so sure about Trump and is almost looking for an opportunity to not support Trump anymore by highlighting these stories of supposed cruelty from ice or the Trump administration. So that more and more Christians will say, yeah, I voted for Trump, but this is just too far. And I was more sympathetic. But wait, but wait, isn’t that but isn’t that a reasonable thing to say. Like, don’t you want people in the position of the Christian supporter of Donald Trump to say, I support deportations, but the way we’re deporting people to a prison in Salvador seems like a violation of natural log. I mean, you just did. I support Trump’s position generally on abortion, but I think what he’s doing on IVF is wrong, you’re worried about the progressives, and toxic empathy leaking into leaking into conservative evangelicalism. But doesn’t conservative evangelicalism have more credibility if it can critique Trump. I would say it might be reasonable. It might be reasonable. I’m not saying that it is always unreasonable to listen to those critiques of Trump, or to see those highlights of supposed cruelty from the Trump administration and to say, Wow, that does seem bad. What I’m saying is that if Christians are looking to have credibility with the left or credibility with progressives or credibility with the world, and they are looking for an escape route to no longer like Donald Trump or support Donald Trump, that they so easily, without thinking, latch on to the deeply feeling stories that we are given and say, this is just too far for me without even digging in and asking the question, but is this true. Or what is the other side to the story. That’s what I see as a form of toxic empathy. That’s what leads to what I call the mushy middle. That’s where I see a lot of evangelicals are going. That’s the question that I always want people to ask whether I’m talking or the New York Times’ is talking, but is this true. If it sounds too good or too bad to be true about either side. That’s the question that we need to ask. But is this true. And what is on the other side of it. So like I said, not always unreasonable, but it’s unreasonable if you’re not using reason. What would you say to someone watching or listening to this program who is in the mushy middle. Who doesn’t like Donald Trump. Who is not maybe not a reformed Calvinist Protestant, but is religious, is Christian, is sympathetic to some of your views on abortion, some of your views on transgender issues, but feels like Trump is using Christianity rather than Christianity operating through Trump. Like what is. What is your evangelical in the fullest sense of the word. Are a public representative of Christianity, right. You’re talking about what is truth. You are you are an arbiter of truth in contemporary America. What is your message of outreach to someone who is not sure who is cross-pressured? Yeah what I would say is. I really don’t care how you feel about Donald Trump. You can loathe Donald Trump. You can be someone who never voted for Donald Trump. But maybe you’re starting to see that progressive policies aren’t in alignment with the Bible, or that they are just destructive. And I am happy to have people like that in my community. There are people like that in my audience who have never voted for Donald Trump, but they really agree with me when it comes to the policies. What I would say to that person, even if your mind never changes on Donald Trump, I don’t care. Politicians come and go, but things are clearer than you think. Make sure that you are not using nuance as an excuse not to dig into the truth about something. And what would it take to alienate you from politics. I know a lot of people in the camp of never Trump or anti-trump evangelicals never Trump anti-trump Christians. Some of them have become vehement partisans of progressive politics. Some of them have become reluctant supporters of the Democrats. Some of them have just said, look, American politics doesn’t present choices that Christians in good conscience should be deeply associated with. Like maybe you still vote and so on. But you just back out, opt out a little bit. Is there a line like that for you. Well, I already don’t like politics very much, and I feel like a lot of people do after the election is that I have backed away from talking a lot about politics because we were so in it before the election. And I think a lot of people are just tired of it. I’m not even saying that’s the right thing, but I think that’s the feeling that a lot of people have. I see my role as an anchor on the right, as basically as conservative as you can get on virtually every issue, but especially the life issue, especially gender, especially marriage. I mean, we are few and far between those of us who actually believe that the law should have something to say about the reality of natural marriage between man and woman, and that children have a right and should have a legal right to their mom and dad. A mom and dad at the very least. I mean, there aren’t very many of us over here, but we have a role to play in persuading people and pulling people as far as we can into our camp. But that would imply basically that there’s never a moment when you leave because like functionally on same sex marriage, right. The Republican Party under Trump has basically abandoned that fight and that debate. If you cast a vote for a Republican politician today outside of some very particular situations, you’re just not casting a vote for the traditional definition of marriage. You’re not. And there was a time, it seems, that Republicans probably felt like they had given up on the abortion fight, too. And then, of course, Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. And so things can change. And so you’re so your view is you stay in stay in the fight basically. Well I guess it depends on what you mean by stay. I am not really that involved in politics. I care about the underlying issues and making sure as much as we possibly can that the Bible is informing our views on those issues. When it comes to election years, I’m going to speak up and say what I think Christians should do. So if your question is, will I ever stop doing that. Will I ever stop saying, hey, I do think Christians should vote for this person. It depends on if the left stays as bad as it is, and if the left stays as bad as it is the unfortunate reality. And I truly don’t like this reality as long as the right is to the right of that, as long as the right is more sane than the left, than my position right now is that we have an obligation to vote for the more sane policy platform. I think that’s a low bar right now. Maybe I could change my mind in a few years, but that’s where I am right now. All right. On that note, Allie Beth Stuckey, Thanks so much for joining me.

The investigation also focuses on pardons allegedly signed by autopen, which have come under GOP scrutiny.What To KnowPleading the Fifth refers to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that no individual shall be \"compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"Bernal's invocation of the amendment drew scrutiny from conservatives, with Representative James Comer of Kentucky, who leads the House committee, writing in a statement, \"During his deposition today, Mr. Bernal pleaded the Fifth when asked if any unelected official or family members executed the duties of the President and if Joe Biden ever instructed him to lie about his health.\"\"This is a historic scandal and Americans demand transparency and accountability. We will continue to pursue the truth on their behalf and examine options to get the answers we need,\" he wrote.Representative Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican, shared similar sentiment, writing to X, formerly Twitter, that Bernal \"couldn't answer A SINGLE QUESTION.\"Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, wrote on X, \"If there's nothing to hide, why plead the Fifth? The American people deserve answers and we will get to the truth.\"Legal analysts told Newsweek that pleading the Fifth does not necessarily mean a person believes they have committed a crime.\"If someone pleads the fifth, that indicates that they are worried that their answers could put them in legal harm's way. If you get immunity, you cannot plead the fifth. But if you don't get immunity, you plead the fifth because you are concerned that your answers could [cause] criminal charges to be brought against you,\" former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi told Newsweek.Pleading the Fifth \"makes perfect sense\" in light of Trump's retribution promises, Rossi said.The move is not surprising, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani also told Newsweek on Wednesday.\"It has less to do with them being guilty than it has to do with their legal exposure. [President Donald] Trump and his Department of Justice officials have made public statements indicating that they may go after Biden appointees,\" he said.There is a \"real\" risk of political retribution, he said, noting that testifying before the GOP-led Congress \"is a no-win situation\" for ex-Biden officials and \"can only create evidence that can be used against them.\"Conversely, Michael McAuliffe, ex-federal prosecutor and former elected state attorney, told Newsweek that he invocations surprised him.\"The fact that two former Biden aides invoked their fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination in congressional investigation depositions is surprising,\" he said. \"As to the former White House physician, his attorney stated the invocation was to avoid releasing patient-doctor information. If that's so, invoke that privilege, not a right against self-incrimination.\"They could be pleading the Fifth for tactical reasons—not necessarily based on evidence of criminal liability, McAuliffe said, adding that is not \"technically the correct method of protecting a client from an investigation, but it might prove effective in the event the congressional inquiry proves overly partisan, or excessively punitive.\"Whether there is a potential crime to support the invocation, however, is \"speculative at best,\" McAuliffe said.Lawyers for both Bernal and O'Connor also asserted that pleading the Fifth does not mean their clients committed a crime. \"We want to emphasize that asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege does not imply that Dr. O'Connor has committed any crime,\" O'Connor's lawyers said in a statement last week.The use of the Fifth Amendment is certainly nothing new in today's political climate. Several former Trump officials who testified before the House committee investigating the January 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol waged by the president's supporters frequently invoked the Fifth during questioning.Trump himself invoked the Fifth 450 times during New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into his businesses, reported NBC News.Rossi said that those testifying before the January 6 committee viewed it as a \"witch hunt\" aimed at establishing criminality, so it was \"justified\" for them to plead the Fifth as well.What People Are SayingRepresentative Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, wrote to X: \"These are simple questions... If Joe Biden was really 'healthy, active, robust,' why take the Fifth? This is a pretty unconvincing cover-up.\"McAuliffe also told Newsweek: \"The invocation of the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination is a bedrock constitutional right and courts tend to broadly define it. However, 'pleading the fifth' has become a tactic of choice when being subpoenaed to testify about executive activities, and particularly, in politicized scenarios like a congressional inquiry run by one party.\" Bernal's attorney, Jonathan Su, said in a statement reported by The Hill: \"Under these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate and justified for Mr. Bernal to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"What Happens NextHouse Republicans will likely continue their investigations of the Biden administration over the coming months. Comer told ABC News that former Vice President Kamala Harris and Jill Biden should both be subpoenaed.\"So we're going to bring in everyone. We're moving up the line,\" Comer said.","summary":"Legal experts weighed in on why Biden associates may be pleading the Fifth.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-associates-pleading-fifth-amendment-raises-red-flags-2099993","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2684685/joe-biden-associates-pleading-5th-raises.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ae87053ca189b061f6a4cec4ba8849ba","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 09:00:02","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":342450048,"title":"Trump Approves Law Making Fentanyl-Related Substances Schedule I Drugs","text":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law, which permanently schedules fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs.\n\nTrump held a signing ceremony in the East Room of the White House, which some 200 people attended, including everyday Americans who have lost a loved one to fentanyl poisoning.\n\nBefore signing the legislation that makes permanent the Schedule 1 listing for fentanyl-related substances under the Controlled Substances Act, Trump spoke to those in attendance. Those who had lost a loved one to fentanyl stood behind him, holding up pictures of their fallen family member or friend.\n\nTrump said to a 17-second round of applause:\n\nToday, we strike a righteous blow to the drug dealers, narcotic traffickers and criminal cartels that we’ve all been hearing so much about for so many years … and we take a historic step toward justice for every family touched by the fentanyl scourge as we saw in the halt fentanyl Act into law.\n\nTrump blasted former President Joe Biden for the “open borders nightmare” that “flooded our country with fentanyl” and illegal aliens, and he highlighted the many steps he has taken to secure the border since taking office.\n\n“On day one of the Trump administration, we declared an all-out war on the dealers, smugglers, traffickers, and cartels,” Trump said.\n\nHe noted that since he has returned to office, the Department of Justice has seized over 4,500 pounds of fentanyl, which he said was “a record.”\n\nTrump invited several parents who have lost their children to fentanyl or drug poisonings to share their stories at the podium.\n\nGregory Swan, whose son Drew was killed by fentanyl poisoning, said, “It’s the honor of my life to be here,” and the “happiest day of my life” was when Drew was born, as he held his son’s photo for the world to see. He went on:\n\nHis passing ruined, I thought, my life, and every parent back here that I meet and in the audience, some of my friends, their life is gutted when they lose a kid–there’s despair and there’s hopelessness–but we’ve been able to find some repose in going out and advocating.\n\nSwan added, before commending Trump on halting border crossings:\n\nAnd we want to hit every school in America. There’s 26,727 of them. We want to go into everyone. The kids are silent when they hear we lost somebody to this, and we tell our story, and they leave unequivocally ready to run away from fentanyl,” Swan added, before commending Trump on halting border crossings.\n\nAnnne Fundner, who lost her 15-year-old son Weston to a fentanyl poisoning in February 2022, spoke after Swan. Fundner previously noted that under peer pressure, Weston ingested a substance, which he believed to be something other than fentanyl. His father discovered him unresponsive the next day.\n\nAs Fundner began to deliver her remarks, she went to set down Weston’s photo on the podium, but Trump quickly grabbed it and displayed it for all to see.\n\n“President Trump, for four years, we felt ignored, but you’ve changed that.

Forty-nine LGBT+ people were murdered, and, at the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in US history. \n\nIt happened on the same day as the 2016 Washington DC Pride Parade. We’d spent the day in queer celebration, only to have that joy ripped away in the early hours of the morning. All I could think was that with the USA’s lax gun laws, it could have easily been any bar in the country. It could have easily been the bar that I was in.\n\nThese thoughts resurface as I plan my trip to World Pride in Washington DC. Every few years, a different destination is chosen to hold the global queer gathering, with cities like Sydney, Toronto and Madrid hosting in previous years. Each place has been unmistakably LGBT+ friendly, and while the same is true of DC, when they were chosen as the host for 2025, we didn’t yet know who would be residing in The White House. \n\nIt felt like a tremendous gamble, and when the election was finally called, it made me nervous that something was going to happen.\n\n https://www.instagram.com/p/DK4p6CixSfG/?hl=en\n\nWe’d already seen the violent uprising at the US Capitol in 2021, and with so much anti-LGBT+ sentiment being pushed by the Trump administration, it made me question whether it was safe or sensible to visit.\n\nBooking.com’s Travel Proud research shows that 80% of LGBT+ travellers consider their safety before booking a trip, and in this instance, I was very much one of them. World Pride happening in America’s capital – surely it would be a target for those filled with hatred for my community? \n\nBut this year, on my journey to tell the story of Pride around the world, it felt crucial to put my fears aside and attend this significant event. \n\nNot in spite of who is in The White House, but because of it.\n\n In Washington DC, I found a city united (Picture: Calum McSwiggan)\n\nHaving already travelled to Pride in many countries this year, I’ve picked up on consistent criticism of the US government. \n\nPeople chanted against the American president in India, people carried anti-Trump banners in Finland, and the drag queens in Canada called out audience members for wearing MAGA hats. It feels like the community is united in their distaste for the leader of the ‘free world.’\n\nI knew this year’s Pride would be punctuated by feelings of anger, defiance and protest, but the thing that surprised me most was that there was virtually nobody pushing back against it. In DC I expected counter-protests, anti-LGBT+ signs, and conflicts breaking out left, right and centre. \n\nInstead, I found a city united in support for the community.\n\nAlthough this came as a surprise, when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. Despite the political climate in the USA, Washington DC still retains the highest percentage of LGBT+ residents in the country. Queer visibility is stitched into the fabric of the city. Pride flags may not fly from the White House like they had during the Biden or Obama administrations, but they still fly from every other building instead. The city is so loud and relentless in its support, that it’s easy to forget that we’re celebrating on his front lawn. That is until something snaps me back to reality.\n\n‘It’s the president!’ somebody calls from the crowd. I spin around to look to the stage, foolishly expecting to see a red cap approaching the microphone.\n\nBut of course, the 47th president of the United States wasn’t going to make an appearance. His track record of stoking hatred against us had made that abundantly clear. \n\nInstead, a sudden quiet falls over the crowd as Kamala Harris appears onscreen in his place. Silence at Pride is unheard of – we’re a loud bunch when it comes to protest and celebration – but you could hear a penny drop as the crowd waited for their president to make her speech. ‘In this moment, as you gather with friends and allies from across the world, let us be clear – no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together.’\n\n Pride Around the World \n\n Calum McSwiggan, author of Eat Gay Love, is a man on a mission. He plans to spend 2025 exploring how the LGBT+ community is celebrated everywhere on Earth: 12 months, 7 continents, 20 Prides.\nIn an exclusive Metro series, Calum will journey from the subzero climes of Antarctica to the jewel-toned streets of Mumbai, telling the story of Pride around the world.\nFollow his journey on Metro, in print and on our socials to learn how Pride is celebrated around the world. Next up? Ireland and Amsterdam.\n\nThose words feel healing, and it’s this message of solidarity that defines the festivities. In speeches and chants and rallying cries of protest, there is a repeated call for standing together. Recently, division has been weaponised, with repeated attempts to sever the LGB from the T. World Pride is our moment to push back as a united international community.\n\nI was given the honour of leading the Pride parade with a group of passionate queer changemakers, so I swap out my rainbow flag for a trans pride flag instead. When I step out onto the route, the cacophony is deafening. They’re not cheering for me – they’re cheering for the flag and what it represents. \n\nI’m not the only cis person to raise the trans colours, either. It seems that, this year, a lot of people have had the same idea. Alongside signs that declare ‘f*****s against fascism,’ pastel pinks and baby blues fill the sky as we join the march on the US Capitol. \n\nIt’s the most trans pride flags I’ve seen in a traditional parade, and while many commentators try to argue that our community is more fractured than ever, I have never seen such a proud display of unity. \n\n There is a sense of solidarity in the DC queer community (Picture: Calum McSwiggan)\n\nHope Giselle, a Black transgender activist, drives this message home. ‘As we march, as we walk, as we galvanise, as we move, we will do so together. We will fight together, we will own this s**t together.‘\n\nShe’s stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, on the same spot where Dr. Martin Luther King once gave his famous speech. ‘Because when they come for us – and they will come for us – they will come for us together.’ \n\nThis feeling carries from the Pride march right through to the celebrations.\n\n Sasha Colby, a transgender drag queen, is invited to throw out the ceremonial opening pitch at the Washington Nationals baseball game. While on stage at the World Pride music festival, Jennifer Lopez brings out the Gay Men’s Chorus to sing a rendition of George Michael’s Freedom against a backdrop of quotes from famous transgender activists. \n\n‘Shout out to all the trans people in the audience,’ Troye Sivan calls to the cheering crowd during his set, while Doechii is more direct: ‘Protect the dolls. F**k Trump.’\n\nIt’s a much needed reminder that we are still moving forwards. Washington DC is, and always will be, an inherently queer city.\n\nIt doesn’t matter which political power takes the White House, Pride will always live in these streets. Attacks on queer rights are at an all time high, but so is awareness and understanding that we need to protect the most vulnerable members of our community. World Pride is a reminder that the LGBT+ community is stronger than ever. \n\nYou can attempt to divide us all you want, but attacking our community will only drive us closer together.\n\n LGBTQ+ guide to Washington DC World Pride \n\n Getting there\nVirgin Atlantic runs daily flights between London Heathrow and Washington DC, with return economy fares starting from £429.\nWhat to do beyond Pride\n\n DC Pride Walks: From historic gay cruising to Abraham Lincoln’s allegedly gay past, take a guided walk through some of Washington DC’s fascinating LGBT+ history.\n\nLittle District Books: This LGBT+ bookstore is a celebration of everything queer, from banned titles to queer book clubs, they have something for just about everyone.\n\nWashington Nationals: Baseball is quintessentially American, and while their pride-themed game only happens in June, Nationals Park provides an inclusive environment year round. \n\nWhere to stay\n\nLyle DC (£)\nViceroy Washington DC (££)\nThe Fairmont Washington DC (£££)\n\nThese hotels all proudly display the Travel Proud badge after completing Booking.com’s LGBT+ inclusivity training.\nInclusive eats\n\nAnnie’s Paramount Steakhouse: Loudly and proudly serving the LGBT+ community since 1948, this long-standing institution is a piece of the city’s queer history.

Those who had lost a loved one to fentanyl stood behind him, holding up pictures of their fallen family member or friend.\n\nTrump said to a 17-second round of applause:\n\nToday, we strike a righteous blow to the drug dealers, narcotic traffickers and criminal cartels that we’ve all been hearing so much about for so many years … and we take a historic step toward justice for every family touched by the fentanyl scourge as we saw in the halt fentanyl Act into law.\n\nTrump blasted former President Joe Biden for the “open borders nightmare” that “flooded our country with fentanyl” and illegal aliens, and he highlighted the many steps he has taken to secure the border since taking office.\n\n“On day one of the Trump administration, we declared an all-out war on the dealers, smugglers, traffickers, and cartels,” Trump said.\n\nHe noted that since he has returned to office, the Department of Justice has seized over 4,500 pounds of fentanyl, which he said was “a record.”\n\nTrump invited several parents who have lost their children to fentanyl or drug poisonings to share their stories at the podium.\n\nGregory Swan, whose son Drew was killed by fentanyl poisoning, said, “It’s the honor of my life to be here,” and the “happiest day of my life” was when Drew was born, as he held his son’s photo for the world to see. He went on:\n\nHis passing ruined, I thought, my life, and every parent back here that I meet and in the audience, some of my friends, their life is gutted when they lose a kid–there’s despair and there’s hopelessness–but we’ve been able to find some repose in going out and advocating.\n\nSwan added, before commending Trump on halting border crossings:\n\nAnd we want to hit every school in America. There’s 26,727 of them. We want to go into everyone. The kids are silent when they hear we lost somebody to this, and we tell our story, and they leave unequivocally ready to run away from fentanyl,” Swan added, before commending Trump on halting border crossings.\n\nAnnne Fundner, who lost her 15-year-old son Weston to a fentanyl poisoning in February 2022, spoke after Swan. Fundner previously noted that under peer pressure, Weston ingested a substance, which he believed to be something other than fentanyl. His father discovered him unresponsive the next day.\n\nAs Fundner began to deliver her remarks, she went to set down Weston’s photo on the podium, but Trump quickly grabbed it and displayed it for all to see.\n\n“President Trump, for four years, we felt ignored, but you’ve changed that. We appreciate that so much,” Fundner said with noticeable emotion in her voice.\n\nFundner, along with other Angel Moms, in September, told reporters that they had never heard from former Vice President Kamala Harris regarding the tragedies that had befallen their families.

Gavin Newsom called for the remainder of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to be returned to state control Wednesday and highlighted the pervasive fear throughout communities in Southern California since the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nNewsom spoke to reporters at a church in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, where pastors confronted federal immigration agents as they detained a man in the parking lot last month.\n\n“This cruelty, it’s about terrorizing communities, it’s about appearing tough,” Newsom said.\n\nThe governor said that during his visits, his own security vehicles have been mistaken for federal immigration enforcement and put community members on edge.\n\nHe called for an immediate demobilization of the remaining 2,000 Guard troops so they can return to their work countering drug trafficking, providing border support, and assisting in wildfire forest management.\n\n Justice Department fires prosecutor on Epstein case, two people familiar with the matter tell AP \n\nThere was no specific reason given for her firing from the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, according to one of the people who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nHer termination comes shortly after she prosecuted Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The rapper was convicted of lesser prostitution-related offenses.\n\nThe Justice Department recently appeared to acknowledge the existence of an investigation into her father, former FBI director James Comey, though the basis for that inquiry is unclear. He was abruptly fired by Trump during his first administration in 2017.\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker contributed.\n\n Make American Coke Great Again? \n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion — though the company didn’t confirm such a move.\n\n“This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!” Trump wrote on his social media site.\n\nA spokesperson for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said in a statement that the company appreciated Trump’s enthusiasm and promised that more details on new offerings within its products would be shared soon. Coca-Cola didn’t elaborate further.\n\nAny switch from high-fructose corn syrup in Coke sold in the U.S. would put Coca-Cola more in line with its practice in other countries, including Mexico and Australia.\n\nReturning to sugar in U.S. production might affect the nation’s corn farmers, whose yields are used in artificial sweeteners.\n\n▶ Read more about the potential of cane sugar being used in U.S. Coke production\n\n Trump tries to blame others as tensions rise around handling of Epstein case \n\nOn Tuesday, he accused former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as former FBI Director James Comey, of making up the much-hyped unreleased records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case.\n\nTrump presented no evidence in claiming that Democrats and Comey tampered with documents related to Epstein’s case.\n\nComey was fired in 2017, two years before Epstein’s arrest, and Obama was long gone from the White House by the time of Epstein’s death.\n\nDuring Biden’s presidency, the Justice Department put on trial an Epstein co-conspirator, but there is no indication that he or anyone from the White House had anything to do with that case.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s claims against former government officials\n\n First your shoes and now your shampoo? \n\nMore changes may be afoot for airline travelers going through TSA checkpoints.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted there could be changes to the current 3.4-ounce (100 milliliters) liquid limit for carry-ons.\n\nNoem says she is questioning the liquids limit.\n\n“So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,” she told a conference on Wednesday hosted by “The Hill.”\n\nThis follows her recent announcement that travelers will be allowed to keep their shoes on during airport screenings.\n\nThe liquid limits were introduced after a 2006 plot involving liquid explosives was foiled.\n\n▶ Read more on Noem’s plan.\n\n Trump says his fentanyl bill is a ‘blow’ to drug cartels \n\nTrump said the bill will toughen prison sentences by permanently reclassifying illegal, fentanyl-related drugs as Schedule 1 narcotics.\n\n“We’ll be getting the drug dealers, pushers and peddlers off our streets,” Trump said before signing the bill into law Wednesday.\n\nFentanyl is a highly potent opioid drug that doctors sometimes prescribe for severe pain.\n\nBut illegal forms of the drug, often fabricated in China, have been driving U.S. overdose deaths for years. Illicit producers have developed an array of tweaked versions of the drug to get around U.S. regulations.\n\nThe new bill automatically places all fentanyl-related copycat drugs into the government’s most highly restrictive category of banned substances, which also includes heroin.\n\nThe legislation does not affect fentanyl when used for medical purposes.\n\nSeveral people spoke about losing their loved ones, including children, to fentanyl overdoses.\n\n Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleads with Trump to take action on Epstein files \n\nTrump’s first-term national security adviser isn’t satisfied with the president’s actions on Epstein, and he’s making it known.\n\nIn a post on X, Flynn said records of the late New York financier’s sex-trafficking investigation are not a “hoax,” as Trump has called them.\n\nHe urged Trump to reestablish trust between the government and the people by holding accountable anyone involved in Epstein’s abuse of children.\n\n“With my strongest recommendation, please gather your team and figure out a way to move past this,” Flynn wrote. “The roll out of this was terrible, no way around that. Americans want America to be successful, therefore, WE NEED YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL.”\n\n House Speaker Mike Johnson insists he and Trump see eye-to-eye on Epstein \n\nJohnson is emphatically denying that his views differ from the president’s on whether records related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation should be made public.\n\nHe told reporters he has been “misquoted and misrepresented” as he attempted to bring together a coalition that has been roiled by the administration’s handling of the issue.\n\nJohnson said on a podcast Tuesday that on the Epstein files, the Trump administration “should put everything out there and let the people decide.”\n\nThe House Speaker was more specific Wednesday, saying he agrees with the president that all of the “credible” information should be released.\n\nTrump has been trying to get supporters to move on from Epstein. He told reporters Tuesday that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible,” but followed that with suggestions that the documents had credibility issues and were “made up” by Democrats in past administrations.\n\nOn Wednesday, he reiterated those claims and lambasted what he called the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.” He also lashed out at his own base, saying he no longer wanted the support of people who are still talking about Epstein.\n\n A federal judge in Tennessee may rule on whether to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from jail \n\nLawyers for the Justice Department have said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will detain Abrego Garcia if he’s freed.\n\nThe Salvadoran national is awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. The judge could rule in his case on Wednesday.\n\nICE officials have said they will initiate deportation proceedings against Abrego Garcia if he is released, and may even send him to a third country such as Mexico or South Sudan.\n\nAbrego Garcia became a flashpoint over Trump’s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. That expulsion violated a U.S. immigration judge’s 2019 order that shields Abrego Garcia from deportation because he likely faces threats of gang violence in El Salvador.\n\n Justice Department alumni urge lawmakers to reject Trump’s judicial pick \n\nIn a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than 900 former Justice Department lawyers raised concerns about elevating Emil Bove, a top department official, to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThey cited Bove’s role in the dismissal of New York Mayor Eric Adams’ case, and the claims of a whistleblower who says Bove suggested the department might have to flout court orders.\n\n“It is intolerable to us that anyone who disgraces the Justice Department would be promoted to one of the highest courts in the land, as it should be intolerable to anyone committed to maintaining our ordered system of justice,” they wrote.\n\nThe committee is expected to vote Thursday on Bove’s nomination.\n\nBove, who also defended Trump in his criminal cases, has denied the whistleblower’s claims. He told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing: “I am someone who tries to stand up for what I believe is right.”\n\n Vance wraps Pennsylvania speech \n\nThe vice president urged those in the crowd to, “Talk about what the bill does for American citizens,” ahead of the next year’s midterm elections.\n\nVance also called the vice presidency a “fun job” and said it was the honor of his life.\n\n Vance rails against ‘elites in Washington’ promoting four-year college \n\nThe vice president says the Trump administration is pushing for Americans coming out of high school to be able to “chart your own course in your own career path.”\n\n“Why is it that we force every single young person to get a big chunk of debt at a four-year college or university. Why don’t we give our young people more options?” Vance asked.\n\nHe added, “We think it’s fine, if you want to go to college, go to college.”\n\nBut he continued: “If you want to work with your hands, if you want to build a house, build a bridge” then “your government should not be forcing you to do what elites in Washington want you to do.”\n\nVance himself graduated from Ohio State University and Yale Law School.\n\n Vance touts Trump’s budget bill in Pennsylvania \n\nVice President JD Vance is speaking in Pennsylvania, working to sell Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package in a blue-collar district that could see a ferocious congressional campaign next year.\n\nVance addressed the crowd at Don’s Machine Shop in West Pittston saying: “While you guys thrived with bad policy coming from Washington, D.C., I think that you’re going to take off into a rocket ship with good policy coming from Washington, D.C., under Donald J. Trump’s leadership.”\n\nHe highlighted how the measure cuts taxes, including federal levies owed on overtime pay.\n\nThe vice president also said the measure cuts taxes for companies creating jobs in the U.S. and pledged that the Trump administration would keep fighting for people who “want to work with your hands.”\n\n The Pentagon offers a peek at the future of drone warfare \n\nThe Pentagon is showcasing the next generation of autonomous military equipment with a demonstration of aerial, undersea and terrestrial drone technology.\n\nThe Department of Defense displayed more than a dozen prototypes Wednesday during an exhibition in the Pentagon’s central plaza. The event was designed to highlight emerging technologies that military leaders hope will soon be available on the battlefield.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth toured the exhibition and spoke about the need to incentivize more partnerships between the military and private tech companies.\n\n“On drones — large, small, all classes — we need to be world class,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe equipment included several unmanned aircraft designed to execute offensive and defensive missions. There were also unmanned water vessels and an autonomous submersible that generates power from temperature fluctuations in the ocean.\n\nOther high-tech devices included weapons stations that can fire bullets or rockets.\n\nThe exhibition comes as Trump has issued new rules intended to spur innovations in drone development in the U.S.\n\n Trump waves a ‘prop’ letter about firing the Fed chair while meeting lawmakers \n\nThe president waved it during a discussion with lawmakers Tuesday night about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, but it was essentially a prop drafted by someone else.\n\nTrump hasn’t drafted an actual letter firing Powell, according to a person familiar who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting.\n\nThe president has called for Powell’s resignation and indicated that a renovation of Fed buildings could be grounds for dismissing the leader of the U.S. central bank.\n\nBut no final decision has been made by Trump on whether he will try to dismiss Powell, or wait out the Fed chair whose term expires in Mary 2026.\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that it’s “highly unlikely” he will fire Powell.\n\n— By Josh Boak\n\n Speaker Mike Johnson says a new Fed chair would be ‘helpful’ \n\nJohnson stopped short of calling for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to be fired, saying he wasn’t certain about the “executive authority” involved.\n\nBut he did say “new leadership would be helpful at the Fed.”\n\n“I’ve been unhappy with the leadership there personally,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday when asked whether Trump should remove Powell.\n\n Tempers flare as State Department defends mass layoff in congressional committee \n\nDisagreements erupted into a shouting match during a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, when a Democratic lawmaker accused a top department official of lying about the extent of staff reductions.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State for Management Michael Rigas testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday about the firing of more than 1,300 civil servants and foreign service officers last week.\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey was visibly angry as he confronted Rigas with a list of what Booker said were misstatements, half-truths or lies.\n\n“I don’t trust you, Mr. Rigas,” Booker said. “Your statements lack veracity.”\n\n“This is outrageous,” Rigas replied as he sought to respond despite multiple interruptions from Booker.\n\nBooker’s list resembled one compiled by former State Department officials that identified certain eliminated positions that Rigas said had been largely spared from the so-called “reduction in force.” Those include employees in the bureaus of intelligence and research, consular affairs, diplomatic security, energy and international organizations.\n\n“Sir, you have not been truthful,” Booker said. “I have watched you lie to this committee I have watched you lie to the House committee.”\n\n Former Jill Biden aide declines to answer questions about former president's age during House Republican inquiry \n\nAnthony Bernal, Jill Biden’s former chief of staff, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\n“Well, unfortunately, that was short,” said Congressman James Comer, the committee’s chair.\n\nComer promised to continue the investigation and did not rule out subpoenaing former Vice President Kamala Harris or members of President Joe Biden’s family.\n\nOversight Republicans claim, without evidence, that Biden was mentally incapacitated during his term and that his use of the presidential autopen while in office was illegal.\n\n“This is corruption at the highest level,” said Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican running for governor of his state.\n\nDemocrats have dismissed the investigation as a sideshow.\n\n“They still look like losers,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat who sat in on Bernal’s deposition.\n\n US companies doing business in China hope for a leader-level summit \n\nA meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lower tensions in bilateral relations, according to Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n“The business community is very supportive of the idea of a meeting between the two presidents,” Stein said Wednesday.\n\nIn its annual survey released Wednesday, a record high number of council members said they had no new plans to invest in China this year. The survey also found a record-high number of companies indicated they may relocate business operations outside China.\n\nThe survey identified the U.S.-China relationship and tariffs as the top concerns for U.S. businesses operating in China.\n\nStein said tariffs and export controls by China and the U.S. are presenting challenges.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month said odds are high for the two leaders to meet this year but that there’s no firm plan.\n\n Trump defends Bondi, says she’s ‘done very good’ on the Epstein case \n\nThe president complained that Attorney General Pam Bondi has been “waylaid” over her handling of the case, but that he thinks “she’s doing a great job.”\n\nBondi has given out “credible information” about Epstein “and if she finds any more credible information she’ll give that, too,” he said.” What more can she do than that?”\n\nTrump said Bondi has “bigger problems” to work on and cited the administration’s work to remove criminals who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\n▶ Read more on the Epstein case\n\n Trump continues criticizing his supporters over Epstein conspiracy theories \n\nAlthough parts of the president’s base have clamored for more information about the Jeffrey Epstein case, Trump has made it clear that he’s done with the story.\n\n“It’s all been a big hoax,” he said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. “It’s perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.”\n\nTrump echoed a social media post earlier in the day, when he said talking about the case distracts from his accomplishments.\n\n Trump opens his meeting with flattery \n\nSitting with the crown prince of Bahrain, he described the Gulf nation as a “fantastic ally.” He said they would discuss trade and other topics.\n\nThe prince said they would announce $17 billion of investments in the United States, which “builds upon a legacy that we’re very proud of.”\n\n Trump only wants a Federal Reserve chair who would cut interest rates \n\nThe president said Wednesday that he wants to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with someone who would cut interest rates, setting one of the criteria for candidates seeking to lead the U.S. central bank.\n\n“I’m only interested in low interest people,” Trump told reporters.\n\nThe White House is pressuring Powell over the cost of renovating Fed buildings, but Trump has been outspoken in attacking Powell for declining to the Fed’s benchmark interest rate until the inflationary impact of the president’s tariffs is reflected in the data.\n\nTrump insists that inflation is low and has suggested anyone with a brain could be the Fed chair.\n\n“It’s not a tough job, to be honest, assuming you’re smart,” he said. “It might be one of the easiest jobs I’ve ever seen.”\n\n Trump floats Powell dismissal in meeting with lawmakers \n\nThe president indicated in a private meeting late Tuesday that he is leaning in favor of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nThe comments came in a meeting with House Republicans in the Oval Office, according to a White House official.\n\nDuring the meeting, which was scheduled on a separate matter, Trump asked lawmakers how they feel about Powell, and they expressed support for dismissing him, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation.\n\nIn response, the president communicated that he was leaning in that direction, according to the official.\n\n— By Seung Min Kim\n\n Bahrain’s crown prince arrives at the White House \n\nTrump met his guest at the door to the West Wing. He did not answer questions about the potential for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n Maine clinics sue over Medicaid defunding \n\nOne piece of the big budget and policy measure Trump signed this month sought to cut off Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood affiliates.\n\nBut the nation’s biggest abortion provider isn’t the only organization hit by the cuts.\n\nMaine Family Planning sued Wednesday seeking to have reimbursements for its clinics restored. The group says it can be hard for many people in rural Maine to access health care without it.\n\nMedicaid is already barred under federal law from covering most abortions. This defunding measure impacts other services – including contraception, cancer screenings and primary care – offered by certain abortion providers.\n\nA judge has already restored Planned Parenthood’s reimbursements for now.\n\n▶ Read more about the Maine clinics’ lawsuit\n\n Trump slams his own supporters as he tries to move past Epstein ‘SCAM’ \n\nTrump faces mounting criticism from his political base over the Justice Department’s failure to release much-hyped records in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation.\n\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bulls---,’ hook, line, and sinker,” he wrote on his Truth Social site Wednesday morning.\n\nHe goes on to say: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s Epstein crisis\n\n Rubio says US ‘very concerned’ by surge in Israel-Syria violence, seeking a restoration of ceasefire \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters he had just been on the phone with “relevant parties” and hoped to have an update later Wednesday.\n\n“We want the fighting to stop because we had a ceasefire,” he said. “Overnight it broke down, so we’re talking with both sides, all the relevant sides, and hopefully we can bring it to a conclusion.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Israeli military launched are airstrikes in the heart of Damascus, hitting the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters and near the presidential palace in the hills outside the capital.\n\nClashes have raged for days in the southern Syrian city of Sweida between government forces and Druze armed groups, and Israel has launched dozens of strikes targeting government troops and convoys. Israel says the strikes are in support of the religious minority group, and has vowed to escalate its involvement.\n\n▶ Read more about the fighting in Syria\n\n Trump to sign Louisiana senator’s fentanyl bill into law \n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., asks a question during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing, Wednesday, June 18, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy’s office says he has been pushing the HALT Fentanyl Act since 2021.\n\nThe bill would make permanent a 2018 emergency rule that classifies the synthetic opioid and its knockoffs as Schedule I controlled substances. That change would result in harsher sentences for possession of the drug.\n\nThe White House has a bill-signing ceremony scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.\n\n US and Bahrain pave the way for a civilian-nuclear cooperation deal \n\nThe U.S. and Bahrain signed the agreement as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to enhance global energy security.\n\nThe deal will open up negotiations on what is known as a “123 agreement.” It will allow U.S. and American companies to invest in and construct nuclear energy projects in Bahrain, an island nation off the coast of Saudi Arabia with a population of around 1.5 million people.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani signed the memorandum of understanding on Wednesday, after Rubio signed a similar agreement with Malaysia last week.\n\n“The United States is prepared to be partner with any nation on Earth that wants to pursue a civil nuclear program that clearly is not geared towards weapons and or threatening the security of their neighbors,” Rubio said.\n\n Huckabee makes surprise visit to Netanyahu’s trial \n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee’s visit to the courthouse was a rare act of involvement in his host country’s internal affairs. It comes after Trump condemned the trial as a “witch hunt.”\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.\n\nHuckabee said Wednesday’s appearance was a matter of “representing what the president has said repeatedly.”\n\n“The president has made his position very clear,” Huckabee said ahead of his visit to the courthouse in Tel Aviv. “It’s a personal thing for him. He considers the prime minister a friend.”\n\nAfter the visit, Huckabee reposted Trump’s call for the trial to be thrown out and added the comment: “My conclusion? Trump is right…again.”\n\n▶ Read more about Trump and Netanyahu’s relationship\n\n A look inside a lab making the advanced fuel to power growing US nuclear energy ambitions \n\nNear signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they’re packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today’s power plants use.\n\nThe United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.\n\nPresident Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.\n\nBut just like cars won’t run without gas, those plants won’t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.\n\n▶ Read more about US nuclear energy ambitions\n\n Wholesale inflation can indicate where inflation might be headed \n\nEconomists also watch it because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.\n\nInflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.\n\nBut it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump’s trade policies. Trump has aggressively stepped up pressure on the Fed to cut rates, a move that threatens the central bank’s independence.\n\n US producer prices unchanged, with wholesale inflation remaining under control \n\nU.S. wholesale inflation cooled last month, despite worries that Trump’s tariffs would push prices higher for goods before they reach consumers.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it hits consumers — was unchanged last month from May and up 2.3% from a year earlier. Both measures came in below what economists had expected.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices were also unchanged from May and up 2.6% from June 2024.\n\nThe report on wholesale inflation came a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices last month rose 2.7% from June 2024, the biggest year-over-year gain since February, as Trump’s sweeping tariffs pushed up the cost of everything from groceries to appliances.\n\n Trump’s schedule, according to the White House \n\n1. 11 a.m. ET — Trump will greet and host a meeting with Bahrain’s Prime Minister and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa\n\n2. 3 p.m. — Trump will participate in a bill signing ceremony\n\n3. 7 p.m. — Trump will have dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani\n\n Some Republicans remain skeptical of the rescissions package \n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House.\n\n“Nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,” Collins said. “That isn’t because we haven’t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.”\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget acts as a nerve center for the White House, developing its budget, policy priorities and agency rulemaking.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn’t want the Senate to be going through numerous rounds of rescissions.\n\n“We are lawmakers. We should be legislating,” Murkowski said. “What we’re getting now is a direction from the White House and being told: ‘This is the priority and we want you to execute on it. We’ll be back with you with another round.’ I don’t accept that.”\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats in voting against the Senate taking up the measure, but the large majority of Republicans were supportive of Trump’s request.\n\n Trump administration says it is ending deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles \n\nChief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced the decision Tuesday in a statement.\n\nRoughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been deployed. It was not immediately clear how long the rest would stay. The troops were tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they carry out arrests.\n\nThe president ordered the deployment of about 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 active-duty Marines in early June to respond to protests against immigration raids in and around Los Angeles.\n\nTheir deployment went against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued to stop it.\n\nA district court judge initially said Trump acted illegally in deploying the Guard over Newsom’s opposition, but an appeals court said the administration could keep control of the troops. The case is ongoing.\n\nNewsom said the National Guard’s deployment to L.A. has pulled troops away from their families and civilian work “to serve as political pawns for the President in Los Angeles.”","summary":"The Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey and a prosecutor in the federal cases against Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jeffrey Epstein","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/james-comey-justice-department-jerome-powell-pam-bondi-gavin-newsom-b2790547.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/00/Trump_10977.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 23:51:27","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.469},{"id":342317076,"title":"RFK Jr. sparks 2028 speculation with major move that could put him on the outs with Trump","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to be making the first steps toward a 2028 presidential run. \n\nAxios reported Wednesday that Kennedy's super PAC hosted an online event last week, with two sources telling the publication that while another presidential bid wasn't openly discussed it felt like the current Health and Human Services secretary was testing the waters. \n\nThe call attracted hundreds of supporters and influencers that are part of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement. \n\nAmong them - comedian Russell Brand - who has attached himself to the MAHA movement after becoming sober. Brand pleaded not guilty to rape charges in May in the United Kingdom. \n\nLeading the call were MAHA PAC leader Tony Lyons, vaccine skeptic Robert Malone and Stefanie Spear, who ran communications for Kennedy's 2024 campaign, Axios said. \n\nThe call was organized by Lyons' non-profit, MAHA Action, with sources telling the publication that Lyons' involvement signaled the PAC would again support Kennedy, should he give a White House run another go. \n\nLyons did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nKennedy stepping into campaign mode could ruffle feathers with President Donald Trump, who - with his large campaign coffers - is positioning himself as kingmaker for any future Republican hopefuls. \n\nWhen Kennedy announced his presidential ambitions in April 2023, he ran as a Democrat, the party of his famous political family. \n\nIn October 2023, when it was clear he wouldn't win a Democratic primary against President Joe Biden, he launched an independent presidential run instead. \n\nAfter Trump was nearly assassinated on July 13, 2024, Kennedy and the then Republican nominee started having conversations about joining forces. \n\nTrump said he would embrace Kennedy's MAHA movement, Kennedy in turn would endorse him. \n\nThat happened the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in August 2024, taking some wind out of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris' sails. \n\nThe Trump-Kennedy coalition helped Trump win all seven swing states on Election Day. \n\nTrump named Kennedy as his HHS head nine days later. \n\nSince taking over HHS, Kennedy has shrunk the size of the federal agency, canceled billions in grants to universities and public health departments and changed COVID vaccine regulations. \n\nDaily Mail's July poll conducted by J.L. Partners found that Kennedy's approval rating ran in the middle of the pack compared to other prominent political figures.\n\nTrump had higher favorables than Kennedy - with 26 percent holding a very favorable view of the president and 18 percent holding a somewhat favorable view. \n\nBut Trump's cumulative negative rating stood at 51 percent. \n\nWith Kennedy, 16 percent held a very favorable view of the HHS secretary while another 25 percent viewed him somewhat favorably.\n\nForty-six percent viewed Kennedy unfavorably, in a poll with a plus or minus 3.1 percent margin of error.","summary":"Robert F.

And don’t bother running for president again in 2028.\n\nBecause there’s a job that’s more important right now, for your state and your country, than either of those posts. \n\nIt’s a job that doesn’t yet exist, but California needs it if we’re going to survive this authoritarian moment. And it’s a job that would fit you even better than the bespoke Chloé power suits you wore during last year’s campaign.\n\nMadam Vice President, I write to publicly propose that you step forward to establish the California Autonomy Authority, and serve as its founding director. You have the stature to convince the legislature and governor to create such authority, which could be structured as an independent commission, or be located within the executive branch. \n\nCalifornia needs a new agency with broad powers — including to compel testimony, subpoena records, and respond to emergencies — to defend itself against the new and existential threat of a lawless and authoritarian American nation-state. \n\nThe Trump regime has effectively declared war against our people, our cities, our governments, and our democracy, demanding that we obey their dictates instead of our own laws. They’ve dispatched thousands of secret police to seize Californians off the streets, deployed troops to back up the secret police, cancelled our environmental laws, dangerously released our water, and illegally moved to cut off funding for emergency recovery and vital programs.\n\nWhile these occupiers of the U.S. government attack us constantly, we Californians have no full-time body to defend ourselves, and our state’s democracy, in this war. Instead, our officials are forced to split their attention between governing their own jurisdictions and defending against federal attacks.\n\nThat lack of focus has cost us, and put us on defense. In Los Angeles, the federal secret police set up shop and started arresting people, with local leadership, preoccupied with fire rebuilding and Hollywood’s woes, reacting slowly.\n\nOur governor, Gavin Newsom, has struggled to reconcile the monumental job of managing California’s crises of housing, homelessness, and climate — all of which require federal cooperation to mitigate — with the new full-time job of fighting against the federal invasion. His shifting public stances (He’s fighting Trump! He’s reaching out to Trump!) and his pursuit of the presidency are distracting, and sow cynicism rather than trust. Attorney General Rob Bonta is a similar bind, juggling constant litigation against the U.S. with his full-time job as the state’s top law enforcement official. \n\nWe need our public officials to focus on their actual jobs. And we also need someone else to take charge of defending California and protecting our autonomy and power to govern ourselves against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nYour whole career has prepared you for this urgent assignment. Your deep experience in local law enforcement — as a line prosecutor and San Francisco district attorney — will be vital to the task of getting local governments, especially local police, to collaborate in defense against Trump.\n\nYour six years as California attorney general, representing the entirety of the state government, gave insight into the full range of legal and governance vulnerabilities that the Trump people might exploit.\n\nYour four years in the White House, as an active vice president, taught you how intelligence, agencies, the military, and the U.S. government respond in crises — all lessons that can be applied now in defense of California. We will need allies in other states and other countries to defend ourselves against Trump, and you have databases full of contacts across this country (from your presidential campaign) and in world capitals (from your extensive travels as VP).\n\nYour combination of public service experiences would make you perfect for the varied dutie of this novel role. \n\nFor starters, you’re a crime-fighter, and this is a crime-fighting job. The new authority needs the power to subpoena and prosecute. Donald Trump is a convicted felon who is breaking the law and violating the constitution in office, and his administration, which embraces corruption, has likely been infiltrated by criminals or their enterprises. You should investigate, expose, and help prosecute such criminality — because the Trump-controlled U.S. Department of Justice won’t. You also could take action that local police won’t — by identifying and arresting the masked federal agents assaulting or kidnapping Californians. \n\nIn the process, your authority would create a record of the U.S. regime’s crimes that would provide a foundation for future federal or international prosecutions, or even a truth-and-reconciliation commission.\n\nThe job also would involve policy-making. You would determine which laws or governing structures offer California and its local governments the most protection against federal attack. Your mission here would be protecting — and extending — California’s autonomy so that the federal government can’t cancel education funding or rail projects, and can’t dictate what our universities teach, or the kind of medicine our hospitals might dispense. To do that, you might end up creating new agencies in California, and possibly other allied states, to replace the federal departments Trump is dismantling.\n\nTo do this job right, you must commit long-term. You term as authority director should be at least five years. You can serve as the bridge between the current governor, who leaves office at the end of 2026, and the next governor, thus discouraging the Trump administration from trying to exploit that transfer of power. And since your term would go to 2030, two years beyond the 2028 presidential election, you’d make clear to MAGA Republicans and feckless Democrats alike that California won’t stop defending its autonomy even after Trump is gone.\n\nYes, I know that taking this new gig would mean taking yourself out of the races for governor or president. But what would you really be giving up? While you’d be the favorite in the governor’s race, it would be a tough campaign. Your own donors are unenthusiastic, and polls show California voters are at best lukewarm about you. And the Trump people are already busy making sure the 2028 presidential election won’t be free or fair. (Betting markets actually give Trump better odds of winning an unconstitutional third term than of any Democrat winning the election.)\n\nSo please don’t sit at home in Brentwood debating between running to serve the state (in two years) or the nation (in four). Instead, stand up right now, and create and lead a new authority to serve both.\n\nJoe Mathews writes the Connecting California column for Zócalo Public Square, an ASU Media Enterprise publication, and is founder-columnist of Democracy Local.","summary":"California needs someone to take charge of defending our state and protecting our autonomy and power to govern ourselves against all enemies.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2025/07/16/opinion-theres-more-important-work-for-kamala-than-governor-or-president/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 21:58:16","author":"Joe Mathews • Zócalo","authors":["Joe Mathews • Zócalo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.258},{"id":342319184,"title":"‘Surprised’ Trump appears to forget he appointed Powell as Fed chair before blaming Biden for keeping him on","text":"Donald Trump appeared not to recall having been the president who first appointed Federal Reserve Board of Governors Chair Jerome Powell to the position he has held since 2018 — the second year of Trump’s first term. \n\nTrump, who has been flirting with the notion of firing the central bank boss over his failure to cut interest rates, was speaking during an Oval Office press opportunity alongside the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain when he was asked whether he was seriously considering the move, as has been reported.\n\nHe replied with a derisive set of remarks in which he assailed Powell for not pushing the central bank’s board to cut interest rates, citing the European Central Bank’s multiple rate cuts in recent months, and accusing Powell of only having assented to cuts during last year’s election to benefit the Democratic candidate, former vice president Kamala Harris and calling him “a terrible Fed chair” before expressing surprise that he had been named to the position in the first place.\n\n“I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump said. \n\nIn his next breath, the 79-year-old president possibly remembered that he was the one who nominated Powell to the job as a successor to Janet Yellen during his first term, and added that he had been surprised by Powell’s re-appointment to a second term by his successor and predecessor, President Joe Biden.\n\n“I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him,” he said.\n\nThe president’s apparent gaffe came just one day after he delivered a rambling speech in Pittsburgh in which he claimed that his uncle, a noted physicist who helped develop radar systems during World War II, taught notorious terrorist Theodore Kaczynski at MIT, despite none of it having actually happened. \n\nDuring his meandering remarks at Carnegie Mellon University, Trump invoked his late paternal uncle, Dr. John Trump, who he often describes as the “longest-serving professor” to ever teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, even though the noted physicist did not achieve that distinction despite teaching there for 37 years as a professor and another 12 as a senior lecturer after mandatory retirement. John Trump died in 1985. \n\nPresident Trump called the late Dr. Trump, a pioneer in cancer research who was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, a “smart man,” citing his multiple scientific degrees, and claimed that one of his students was Kaczynski, a mathematics professor who became widely known as the Unabomber when he was arrested in 1996 for a decades-long string of letter bomb attacks on figures in higher education and other industries. \n\n“Kaczynski was one of his students. Do you know who Kaczynski was? There's very little difference between a madman and a genius,” he said.\n\nTrump then claimed to have asked his uncle about the murderous ex-academic. \n\n“What kind of a student was he Uncle John? He said: “What kind of a student — seriously, good ... he’d go around correcting everybody. But it didn't work out too well for him. Didn't work out too well, but it's interesting in life,” Trump said. \n\nThe crowd did not show much of a reaction to the story, and it was unclear if the president was confusing Kaczynski, who died in a federal prison in 2023, with someone else. But it’s highly unlikely if not impossible that any of what he said about his uncle and the notorious murderer was true.\n\nNot only did Kaczynski — whose undergraduate degree was from Harvard and earned his Masters and Doctoral degrees in mathematics from the University of Michigan — never attend MIT, but even if the president’s uncle had crossed paths with the future terrorist, he could not have known that Kaczynski had been responsible for 16 bomb attacks between 1971 and 1995.\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley professor turned murderous recluse was one of the country’s most wanted fugitives until 1996, when his brother David Kaczynski, turned him in to the FBI after reading the now-infamous manifesto, Industrial Society and its Future, after The Washington Post published it at the recommendation of then-Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh.","summary":"Seeming gaffe comes a day after he fabricated a story about his uncle and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-powell-fed-chair-biden-blame-b2790464.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/22/9/40/GettyImages-869487498.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4XzOne0l-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-16 21:43:36","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.075},{"id":342490910,"title":"HART: Democrat NYC Mayoral ‘Heartthrob’ Zohran Mamdani Is Peddling Leftist Lies","text":"The Democrats have their stalwarts: Reps.

Now, the newest flavor of the month is the socialist New York mayoral heartthrob, Zohran Mamdani. \n\nMamdani was born in Uganda and is Muslim. He checks so many boxes for the Democrats he could go right to the top. In fact, I heard Democrats already have someone working on a Hawaiian birth certificate for him. \n\nOne minor problem: He lied on his college applications to Ivy League schools and other elite colleges, claiming to be black and/or African. You know, playing up that Uganda thing. I wonder why.\n\nBoth his mother and his father are South Asian (aka Indian). The only difference between Mamdani and Sen. Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren is that Mamdani’s claim to be an Indian can pass a lie detector test.\n\nSaying he’s black and Asian might get Mamdani sued by Tiger Woods for trademark infringement. Tiger patented that space and ran his great golf career with no affirmative action or DEI help. Unlike Mamdani, he is a hero.\n\nAnd while Mamdani is pro-Palestine, defends calls for intifada, and supports taking guns from and raising taxes on white people, Democrats are playing down his extremist stances. \n\nIt is scary that he was nominated to be the Democrats’ mayoral candidate. Wasn’t it Thomas Jefferson who said TikTok was why we needed an Electoral College? \n\nMamdani is perfect for the young left. Victims of liberal college dogma and student loan debt, they feel we should strive for the much more desirable system of socialism. You know, the type of socialism that has never worked anywhere in the world. \n\nYears of influence from Obama, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, AOC and the populist left-wing media have left today’s youngsters thinking that socialism is a utopia of wonderful things for which no one has to pay. \n\nAll the while, Bernie and AOC fly first class or privately all around the country for paid speeches. Without priority boarding, extra leg room, cocktails and a hot moist towel, how can they be expected to fight the rich oligarchy? \n\nIt is best they are in first class, anyway. History teaches us that by putting a socialist in the economy, they will ruin it. \n\nThe young left thinks socialism’s great offerings are free education, free health care and free housing. Yet they are not taught history’s clear lesson: Socialism’s three great failures always end up being breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nSocialism replaces capitalism, which rewards hard work. We have raised a generation of kids who are averse to hard work. When they hear “free markets,” they think that the government pays for them. \n\nThis is a bubble-wrapped generation, terrified of risk. If we have something to fear, it is that we fear too much. Risk is good. Risk teaches lessons. Failure is necessary for growth and should not be ridiculed. What deserves ridicule is not trying.\n\nLiberals insist upon the evils of capitalism and capitalists to sell their statist agenda. But the facts are clear: Free-market capitalism is a far more virtuous system than government and has done far more to improve the lot of mankind wherever it is allowed to flourish.\n\nTravel to any third-world country with a strong central government and a stranglehold on business. Witness the poverty, crime and misery spawned in places like Venezuela, North Korea and Cuba. The contrast could not be clearer. \n\nI am a fan of legal immigration. We need legal immigrants and they make us better if they assimilate and believe in the promise of America: hard work and capitalism succeed. After all, there was a guy working the McDonald’s drive-thru window just last year. He is now our president, ordering bombings of nuclear plants in Iran.

Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa at the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\"He's always been too late, hence, his nickname 'Too Late,'\" Trump said of Powell.\n\n\"He should have cut interest rates a long time ago,\" Trump continued. \"Europe has cut them 10 times in the short time that we have cut none.\n\n\"The only time he cut them was just before the election to try and help Kamala [Harris], but, obviously, that didn't work,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He does a terrible job,\" Trump continued. \"He's costing us a lot of money, and we fight through it.\"\n\nHe said the nation's economy is strong enough that the Federal Reserve's lending rate of between 4.25% and 4.5% doesn't affect the nation.\n\nInstead, Trump said, it hurts those who want to buy a house by saddling them with a higher mortgage rate.\n\n\"He's a terrible Fed chair, Trump said. \"I'm surprised that [President Joe] Biden extended him, but they did.\"\n\n\"We're not planning on doing anything,\" Trump said, but \"we're

to the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump has denied he is planning to fire Powell, unless evidence of fraud arises, CNBC reported on Wednesday.\n\nBut on Tuesday, he asked some House Republicans if he should fire Powell and was told he should, CNBC and The Hill reported.\n\nAn unnamed participant said Trump told the group he would fire Powell, media reported.\n\nTrump later denied he would fire Powell and said he has not drafted a letter to remove Powell from his chairmanship.\n\nTrump on Wednesday acknowledged he asked the group of House Republicans \"about the concept of firing\" Powell, CBS News reported.\n\nHe said it only would happen if there were some cause, such as possible fraud involved in a $2.5 billion improvement project for the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"He's already under investigation,\" Trump said of Powell. \"He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding.\"\n\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought last week accused Powell of undertaking a renovation project that has lasted for years that might run counter to federal law, CBS News reported.\n\nPowell in June told a Senate panel some of the criticisms of the renovation of the Federal Reserve's Washington, D.C., headquarters are \"misleading and inaccurate.\"\n\nTrump has criticized Powell for the Federal Reserve not lowering interest rates.\n\nPowell has cited Trump's often-changing tariff policies as the reason for not lowering the Federal Reserve's lending rate.\n\nPowell also has said he won't let politics influence the decisions of the

Virginia—Polls","text":"Former Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger held a double-digit lead against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears in the latest poll of the Virginia gubernatorial race released on Wednesday.Political scientist Larry Sabato told Newsweek the poll \"reinforces the widespread view that, for now at least, the Democrat is well ahead.\" Meanwhile, a Spanberger spokesperson told Newsweek it \"echoes what Abigail has been hearing from families across the Commonwealth.\"Newsweek reached out to the Earle-Sears campaign for comment via email.Why It MattersVirginia's gubernatorial race in November is a key test for both political parties this year. Once a battleground, Virginia has shifted toward Democrats over the past 20 years, though Republicans have proved competitive in the state's off-year gubernatorial races.The election pits Spanberger, a centrist Democrat who previously represented Virginia, against Winsome-Sears, the state's lieutenant governor, who was elected in 2021. Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, who narrowly won four years earlier, is ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.The race will be a crucial test for Democrats' messaging in the Trump 2.0 era—and a test of whether Republicans can maintain support from voters who shifted rightward in the 2024 election.What To KnowThe new Virginia Commonwealth University poll gives Spanberger an advantage over Earle-Sears, with 48 percent of respondents saying they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate and only 36 percent backing the Republican.The poll also found Democrats leading in other statewide races. Democrat Ghazala Hashmi leads Republican John Reid in the race for lieutenant governor by nine points (45 percent to 36 percent), while Democrat Jay Jones leads Republican incumbent Jason Miyares by nine points in the attorney general race (46 percent to 37 percent).The poll surveyed 809 adults, 764 of whom are registered to vote, from June 19, 2025, to July 3, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.16 percentage points.Other polls have similarly shown Spanberger with a lead. A HarrisX poll of 1,000 likely voters from May 9 to May 13, 2025, showed Spanberger up four points (52 percent to 48 percent). A Roanoke College poll of 658 Virginians from May 12 to May 19, 2025, showed her up 22 points (48 percent to 26 percent).Sabato told Newsweek that Spanberger has led every public poll so far.\"This survey just reinforces the widespread view that, for now at least, the Democrat is well ahead,\" he said. \"Of course, voting doesn't start until the end of September, and most votes are cast in the last two weeks and on Election Day.\"A key dynamic of the race is Trump's \"deep unpopularity in Virginia\" versus Youngkin's \"relative though not overwhelming popularity,\" Sabato said.Virginia, home to many federal workers, is a state that has been hit especially hard by Trump's cuts to the federal workforce.Last November, then-Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by less than six points, down from former President Joe Biden's 10-point margin of victory in 2020.Historically, the party out of the White House performs well in the Virginia gubernatorial race. That was the case four years ago, when Youngkin defeated former Governor Terry McAuliffe by fewer than two percentage points.What People Are SayingA Spanberger campaign spokesperson told Newsweek: \"This poll echoes what Abigail has been hearing from families across the Commonwealth — that the high cost of living continues to be top of mind for Virginians. During this moment of uncertainty, Virginians deserve a Governor who is laser-focused on making life more affordable.\"That's why Abigail rolled out her Affordable Virginia Plan to lower costs for Virginia families across the board — including healthcare, energy, and housing costs. As the next Governor of Virginia, Abigail will work tirelessly to make sure every Virginian can afford to call the Commonwealth their home.\"Former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, wrote in the polling report: \"Virginia voters are not buying political spin. They want action on the issues that hit hardest: the rising costs of living, threats to women's rights and immigration policies. The shift from education to economic and personal freedoms shows an engaged electorate.\"Dr. Harry Wilson, interim director for Roanoke College's Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, wrote in a May poll write-up: \"Six months in a gubernatorial election season is an eternity in politics, but one would prefer to be ahead by 17 points. More than a quarter of Virginians are undecided, and there is good news for both candidates.\"Spanberger is obviously leading at this point, and she leads among independents, but a large number of Republicans are undecided, and they will most likely end up voting for Earle-Sears. The favorable rating for Earle-Sears, however, should be cause for concern.\"What Happens NextThe Virginia gubernatorial election is on November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report currently classifies the race as Lean Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive races, but one party has an advantage.\"","summary":"A new poll showed Spanberger with a double-digit lead in the Virginia gubernatorial race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-chances-governor-virginia-polls-winsome-earle-sears-2099914","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2684661/abigail-spanberger-poll-virginia-governor-race.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e9b6f931a1f60841a7a10ed474a980a7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 20:36:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003}]}
