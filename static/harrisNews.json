We have to rebuild the American people’s faith and trust in the Secret Service as an agency.'\n\nCheatle was replaced by current Secret Service Director Sean Curran, who entered the role in January this year. \n\nSince then, there have been no serious assassination attempts on the president's life, but the Secret Service has still suffered a number of embarrassing incidents and political violence has been on the rise. \n\nOver Labor Day weekend, a Secret Service officer failed to notice a Glock pistol after screening the bag of a man entering Trump's DC golf course while the president was on site. The man noticed the mistake and self-reported the firearm.\n\nIn mid-September a Secret Service agent attributed Charlie Kirk's assassination to 'karma' was placed on administrative leave.\n\nWhile earlier this month, a Secret Service agent fell asleep in public while providing security for the UN General Assembly and left his fully-automatic assault rifle unattended when he went to the restroom.","summary":"Alison Zupancic provided protection to former Vice President Kamala Harris's stepdaughter Ella Emhoff despite not achieving all the requirements of a Secret Service agent.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15220649/Secret-Service-plus-size-model-failed-test.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/23/20/103263901-0-image-m-15_1761249323162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 21:10:13","author":"Editor,Eliot Force","authors":["Editor","Eliot Force"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.05},{"id":371999752,"title":"Hunter Biden laments Kamala Harris’ ‘painful’ book, implies Joe picked her because she’s black","text":"WASHINGTON — Scandal-scarred former first son Hunter Biden lamented former Vice President Kamala Harris’ “personally painful” badmouthing of his father in her new memoir and book tour.\n\nThe younger Biden, 55, chalked up Harris’ bluntness about his father to a desire to be more authentic — and strongly insinuated that her race played a key role in his father’s decision to tap her as vice president.\n\n“I didn’t read it. I really didn’t. I’m just really disappointed. I’ve just heard some of the things. I tried to block it out,” the budding artist told journalist Tommy Christopher during a rare three-hour interview on his Substack platform.\n\n“I’d have to admit, it’s personally painful,” he continued, “for her to, in a book, to try to distance herself and take what I would call the really easy path to distance herself to what I guess she thinks … the biggest complaint about the vice president has always been is that — which I never believe, and I really mean it — is that she is not authentic.”\n\nHarris, 61, rolled out her new memoir, “107 Days,” last month, detailing her historically short stint atop the Democratic ticket for the presidency.\n\nThe former veep had strenuously avoided distancing herself from former President Joe Biden, 82, during the 2024 campaign cycle, much to the chagrin of some prominent Democratic strategists. \n\nBut in the book, she gave her seemingly unvarnished takes on him, calling his decision to seek a second term in the White House “recklessness.”\n\nShe detailed a stunning call she received from the 46th president just before her debate against President Trump, in which he pressed her over rumors she had been trashing him to donors. \n\n“My head had to be right. I had to be completely in the game,” Harris wrote. “I just couldn’t understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself.”\n\nHarris also opened up about the rift between her staff and Biden’s, a dynamic that had been widely reported during their time in the White House.\n\nDuring her book tour, Harris distanced herself from some of the Biden administration’s decisions, including the snubbing of tech mogul Elon Musk during a White House electric vehicle event.\n\nFollowing her book release, Harris revealed that she had a conversation with the former president about her memoir, but didn’t detail what he said to her.\n\nDespite his frustration with Harris’ candidness, Hunter defended his father’s decision to tap her as VP.\n\n“I love what she represented, and I love the fact that my dad made the decision,” he explained. \n\n“Let me tell you about loyalty,” Hunter went on. “The reason that he picked Kamala Harris is because of the fact that he believes, and I certainly believe, the most powerful force within the Democratic Party is and always has been the African American women.”\n\nIn early 2020, just after his once-struggling campaign began making a comeback, Joe had committed to making history by tapping a woman as his vice president. He only limited his selection process by gender, not by race.\n\nHunter called African American women the “heart and soul and the conscience of the Democratic party.”\n\n“He chose her out of loyalty,” the younger Biden grumbled. “I guess I don’t understand why someone would choose the expedient path as it relates to that relationship, their own political expediency.”\n\nThe Post reached out to Harris spokespeople for comment.","summary":"\"He chose her out of loyalty.

Smith Is Blaming Trump For NBA Gambling Arrests | Burack","text":"Hours after the FBI announced the arrests of NBA head coach Chauncey Billups and NBA player Terry Rozier in connection with alleged illegal gambling operations, ESPN host Stephen A. Smith blamed President Donald Trump. \"How many times for one incident after another have I said, Trump is coming. He’s coming,\" Smith said on Thursday. \"I’m gonna say it on national television again. Bad Bunny is performing at the Super Bowl, and all of a sudden, you’re hearing ICE is gonna be there looking to engage in mass deportations. The Super Bowl, disrupting things. Big night for the NBA, Wembanyama put on a show, that has now been smeared because we’re talking about this story. Remember, Trump has a long, long history connected to the world of sports because he had those casinos.\" Smith added: \"Don’t be surprised that the WNBA is next on his list.\" Stephen A. provided no evidence or credible source to link Trump to the investigation. That's because there isn't any. The investigation began long before Trump was president. But Smith trying to discuss politics in a misinformed fashion is hardly new. The question is why he’s doing it. To OutKick readers, the answer is obvious. As we predicted last week, Smith would enter an overcorrection phase following his coverage of Rep. Jasmine Crockett. After questioning whether Crockett was more interested in viral headlines than lawmaking, Smith faced backlash from Black Lives Matter activists, podcast hosts, and former MSNBC contributors who accused him of \"disrespecting\" black women. In response, Smith apologized — repeatedly. He called Crockett his \"sister,\" then extended apologies to Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama. \"I have no problem apologizing to my sister because I want her to know I don’t feel that way about her,\" Smith said. \"Just like I didn’t feel that way about Kamala Harris. Just like I don’t feel that way about the marvelous, the wonderful, the incomparable, the greatest first lady ever, Michelle Obama.\" Last Friday, Smith appeared on CNN, challenging anyone who called him \"conservative\" to listen to his next comments about Trump. During that segment, he claimed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard was unlawful — a reversal from his prior stance supporting it. He also accused LeBron James of favoring white reporters and trying to fight black ones. This fits a pattern: whenever Smith is accused of pandering to white people, he redirects by accusing other black men of doing the same. He made a similar accusation against Jason Whitlock last year after former NFL player Terrell Owens questioned how \"black\" Smith was. His current backpedaling mirrors how he responded to criticism after appearing on Fox News before the election last November. Smith cited a legitimate poll showing Trump’s growing support among black men — then apologized when progressives objected. \"I’m fully aware that I have been in the news the last few days after comments I made on Fox News’ Hannity last week,\" Smith said. \"Quite a few were offended, as my words were interpreted as associating support for Trump by the black community with all the legal issues he’s facing. For that, I sincerely apologize.\" He apologized for citing a poll – an accurate poll. Smith presents himself as a fearless, politically balanced commentator. In reality, he's cowardly and over his skis. He folds under even modest criticism from within what he calls \"the black community.\" When challenged, he retreats and performs public contrition. It’s remarkable anyone still takes him seriously. Smith is not a political thinker — he’s a performer. His positions shift to fit the audience: conservative on talk radio, liberal on The View, \"independent\" with Bill Maher, and racially obsessed on ESPN. This is the same commentator who wrote a memoir on embellishment. He's a fraud. To his credit, Smith has mastered the system. That he’s now hosting political panels with Chris Cuomo and Bill O’Reilly while also appearing on Monday Night Football proves how little knowledge or consistency is required to succeed in modern media. The game really is that rigged. Still, it’s embarrassing to watch. Imagine asking a valid question about a rabble-rousing congresswoman, then spending a week apologizing by spewing BET-approved talking points about Trump, race, and LeBron James. That, more than anything, tells you who Stephen A. Smith really is.","summary":"Here is the real reason Stephen A.

The Post’s book critic, Becca Rothfeld, offered a scathing take on Jean-Pierre's memoir about her time working for former President Joe Biden, \"Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\" dismissing it as a personal airing of grievances against the Democratic Party. \"Jean-Pierre’s central complaint boils down, more or less, to a vague sense of personal grievance. The Democrats were mean to Biden, her boss; they were mean to her personally, as she outlines in a lengthy diatribe against fellow staffers who leaked unflattering information about her to Politico; and they were mean to Harris, whom they refused to anoint as the nominee without a fight,\" Rothfeld wrote. KAMALA HARRIS COMPLAINS ABOUT 'IMPOSSIBLE' LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BIDEN'S COMMS TEAM, INNER CIRCLE \"Indeed, at no point in ‘Independent’ does she articulate a serious critique of Democratic policies,\" the critic added. \"Instead, in an unsubtle attempt to elevate her gripes to the status of more principled objections, she peppers the book with platitudes about the need to ‘tap into out of the box thinking’ and reject ‘an out-of-touch leadership working from an outdated playbook.’\" In her book, published Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said she couldn’t \"stomach\" the party's treatment of the former president and its efforts to force him out of the 2024 race. After a long career as a Democratic Party flack, Jean-Pierre suddenly left the party earlier this year, drawing ridicule from both sides of the aisle. Rothfeld said that there were many issues Jean-Pierre could have named as the problems with her party, but she chose to call out its treatment of Biden — something Rothfeld argued was not a real issue, and maybe one of the Democratic Party’s more \"sensible\" strategies in recent memory. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE RIPPED OVER 'FIRING SQUAD' RECAP OF BIDEN'S EXIT FROM RACE: 'STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND' She wrote that rather than call out the party for its support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, its failure to mount meaningful opposition to President Donald Trump, its inability to protect immigrants and expand access to healthcare, the official went after \"the single sensible — if very belated — thing they have done in recent memory, which was to usher a doddering Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race.\" Rothfeld added, \"These contortions are hard to imagine from anyone but the most devoted apparatchik, which is exactly what Karine Jean-Pierre is.\" The critic went on to call Jean-Pierre’s work dated and tone-deaf. \"It was dated before it arrived at the printers, perhaps before it was even written; no doubt it will be studied by the historians and anthropologists of the future,\" she wrote. \"Jean-Pierre is an artifact of an age that looks recent on paper but feels prehistoric in practice — the age of pantsuits, the word ‘empowerment,’ the musical ‘Hamilton,’ the cheap therapeutic entreaties to ‘work on yourself’ and ‘lean in’ to various corporate abysses.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS Rothfeld mocked Jean-Pierre’s decision to become an independent, writing that the move appeared to be more style than strategy. \"For her, becoming an independent seems to be less of a strategy than a style. ‘Independent’ is a primer in the rhetorical tactics that have served Democrats so poorly of late, full of squishy and congratulatory therapy-speak.\" \"Ultimately, she tells her fellow independents, ‘we’re leaning into our own truth.’ Worse, she assures them, ‘it’s also about self-care,’\" Rothfeld added. \"She could often be mistaken for a motivational instructor in a Soul Cycle class… It is incredible — and emblematic of the Democrats’ total aesthetic and intellectual driftlessness — that someone who writes in such feel-good, thought-repelling clichés was hired to communicate with the nation from its highest podium.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Representatives for Jean-Pierre did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Karine Jean-Pierre&apos;s new book defended Joe Biden and criticizes Democratic Party treatment, prompting harsh criticism from Washington Post book critic Becca Rothfeld.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-shreds-jean-pierres-new-book-says-its-full-squishy-congratulatory-therapy-speak","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/karine-new-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 20:24:40","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":371974772,"title":"Dem congressman's pledge to 'work with Trump' hard to swallow after he invested in distillery that sells 'Fascist Tears Vodka' and prefers 'ICE crushed'","text":"Moderate' Democrat Congressman Josh Riley said he was ready to work with President Trump when he narrowly won his New York seat last year.\n\nBut his 'pledge' may be hard to swallow as Daily Mail can reveal he took money from a group that wants to 'abolish ICE' and invested in a distillery that sells 'Fascist Tears Vodka' and quips they prefer their 'ICE crushed'.\n\nHe touted his Republican-supporting family and decried political divisions in the US.\n\nBut his campaign filings show he took contributions from groups far further out on the political spectrum.\n\nThe New York congressman – who won his seat with a margin of just over 8,000 votes – took a $1,000 donation from Voters of Tomorrow PAC; a group focused on Gen-Z activism which advocates for criminal justice reform.\n\nIn June, Voters of Tomorrow posted a video on Instagram about Immigration and Customs Enforcement with the caption: 'Abolish ICE'.\n\nThe video said Trump was 'racist' and 'anti-immigrant', accusing him of a 'dangerous abuse of power' by mobilizing the national guard in Los Angeles, and saying his policies are 'f**ked up'.\n\nLast month, Riley, 44, released financial disclosures revealing he invested in a liquor distillery selling Fascist Tears Vodka and Dissent Gin, which boast that it prefers its 'ICE crushed'.\n\nThe congressman, whose district covers the cities of Binghamton, Catskill, Hudson, Ithaca, and Monticello, invested between $1,001 and $15,000 in Wasdhington, D.C.-based Republic Restoratives LLC, which says it is a 'women-owned, queer-led' company.\n\nOn its website, the distillery says every bottle of Dissent Gin supports a pro-abortion group and is inspired by late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\n'This moment calls for stiff dissent and a stiff drink,' the site says. 'For, in the words of RBG: “The greatest menace to freedom is an inert people\".' \n\nIts Madam Vodka was inspired by Kamala Harris, the first female vice-president. \n\nThe distillery also sells clothing such as a 'no kings' cap, a sweatshirt with the slogan 'Thriving under Fascism', and a tank top emblazoned with 'make Pride a riot again'.\n\nBack in November last year, fresh from his election win, Riley struck a much more conciliatory tone.\n\nSpeaking to politics site City & State New York, he said he foresaw 'lots of opportunities for me to work with the Trump administration' and preached bipartisanship.\n\n'I'm a Democrat. I come from a Republican family,' he said. 'To this day, I couldn't tell you the political party of a lot of my friends and neighbors from growing up, and so we ran a campaign that was rooted in that experience.\n\n'I think if we had more of that across the country, we wouldn't be as divided as we are these days.'\n\nBut this month, Riley was instead lashing out at his local Republican opponent Peter Oberacker on X, falsely accusing him of 'hiring Nazi sympathizers'.\n\nThe congressman was referring to a scandal that erupted this month among the GOP's New York youth wing, when a leaked group chat exposed members using racist and homophobic slurs.\n\nOberacker, who is running against Riley in New York's 19th district, was in talks to hire one of the chat participants, New York State Young Republicans chair Bobby Walker, as an aide.\n\nBut his spokesperson said Oberacker nixed the process when he found out Walker allegedly referred to rape as 'epic' in the leaked text messages, among other offensive remarks.\n\nOthers in the chat referred to black people as monkeys and 'the watermelon people' and joked about sending people to the 'gas chamber'.\n\nRiley has remained silent, however, on another fight over racist slurs.\n\nA video emerged last month of Miles Burnett, Democrat candidate for Binghamton Mayor, using the N-word in a social media post when he was a teen, sparking a local scandal.\n\nBurnett, 33, has been photographed several times with Riley and received a special invite to the Congressman's swearing in ceremony.\n\nThe mayoral candidate apologized in a statement on Facebook saying, 'it was a stupid thing to do, and I would not make the same choice today as an adult.'\n\nBut when contacted for comment about the incident, Riley did not respond.\n\nA Republican spokeswoman slammed the Democrat in a searing response.\n\n'Josh Riley's silence on everything from the dangerous groups that bankroll him to the pro-crime, anti-law enforcement distillery that he owns and his friend's hateful rhetoric tells you everything you need to know about who he actually is: A radical, dishonest politician who is only looking out for himself, not Upstate New York,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole told Daily Mail.","summary":"Dem congressman Josh Riley successfully won his campaign in NY off his 'moderate' stance and willingness to work with Trump, but his investment in an anti-fascist distillery paints a different picture.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15212755/ny-congressman-josh-riley-trump-investment-distillery-fascist-tears-ice.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/21/15/103178931-0-image-m-54_1761057521181.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 19:05:50","author":"Editor,Josh Boswell","authors":["Editor","Josh Boswell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.19},{"id":371992406,"title":"David Ellison has ‘Trump card’ in Paramount’s pursuit to take over Warner Bros. Discovery","text":"Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison remains committed to his bid to take over Warner Bros. Discovery despite the media giant rebuffing his past three offers, believing he has a “Trump card” in his back pocket that makes him the only buyer who can close the deal.\n\nAdditionally, Ellison – whose father is Oracle founder and close Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison – has reportedly expressed reluctance to overpay for the rival studio and media conglomerate, believing he won’t have to pay more than $25 a share for WBD because he has the president “in his corner.” \n\nRaising Ellison’s confidence that he will be able to merge Paramount with Warner Bros’ Discovery – and combine the companies’ movie studios and streaming services – is the president’s well-known resentment of Brian Roberts, the CEO of potential rival bidder Comcast.\n\nWhile it has been known for weeks that Ellison – with the backing of his father, the world’s second richest man – desperately wants to add Warner’s assets to his burgeoning media empire, it’s only now apparent just how aggressive he’s been with his overtures.\n\nA representative for Paramount declined to comment.\n\nEarlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav essentially hung a “for sale” sign on the company’s door, announcing that WBD was considering a variety of potential deals, which would include either a total sale of the company or a spinoff of various assets. Zaslav also stated that this was in response to interest from several suitors.\n\n“We took the bold step of preparing to separate the company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward,” he declared in a statement, adding that “it’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market.”\n\nAt the time of Zaslav’s announcement, both Comcast and Netflix had been reported as parties interested in purchasing some or all of WBD’s assets. Comcast, however, may only want to acquire a portion of Warner Bros., particularly as it has recently spun off most of its cable properties – including MSNBC and CNBC.\n\nEarlier this year, Zaslav outlined plans to split the company's cable and streaming operations. One business would consist of HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros. Television, DC Studios, and Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The other spinoff would feature cable channels CNN, Discovery, TNT Sports, TBS and other digital properties, including Bleacher Report and the streaming service Discovery+.\n\nThe New York Times, meanwhile, reported on Wednesday that the announcement that Warner Bros. was up for sale was prompted by Ellison ratcheting up his takeover bids in recent weeks, culminating in an offer this month to buy the entire company for $23.50 a share.\n\nIt was that latest bid that seemingly kicked off the feeding frenzy from other suitors, who began kicking the tires to gauge Warner Bros.’ interest or at least force Paramount to raise its bid to merge the two media giants.\n\nAs the Times noted, a “takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount would be a tectonic shift” for the industry at large. \n\n“It would combine two of the largest Hollywood studios, Warner Bros. and Paramount, granting huge clout at the box office and putting CNN and CBS News under the same corporate umbrella, which would give the new company enormous sway over the news industry,” the Times pointed out. “It would combine Paramount+ and HBO Max, two of the biggest streaming services, bringing the company’s movies and shows into hundreds of millions of living rooms.”\n\nIn a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors, who unanimously rejected his latest offer, Ellison wrote that Paramount “was confident that we are the best partner for WBD” and that it was the only viable suitor for a merger. “Other potential acquirers of WBD — today or in the future — would need to overcome significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles given their dominant market positions,” he added.\n\nWhile any merger attempt from a media rival would face regulatory scrutiny, which has also led some potential suitors to abandon past efforts to combine with Warner, Ellison's message to the WBD board seems to imply that the administration will be sympathetic to Paramount.\n\nIt was just a couple of months ago that Ellison’s Skydance Media closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount after a politically fraught process. Prior to receiving the Trump administration’s approval for the deal, Paramount paid the president $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, a payoff that has prompted a Democratic probe into potential violations of anti-bribery statutes.\n\nTrump, who claimed that Ellison reached a pre-merger “side deal” with him as part of the settlement, has repeatedly praised the Paramount chief and his father, calling them “friends of mine” and “big supporters of mine.” \n\nSince taking over Paramount, Ellison has also hired a former Trump appointee to be CBS News’ ombudsman, purchased the anti-woke digital site The Free Press and installed Free Press founder Bari Weiss as the news network’s editorial leader, prompting criticism that Ellison is pushing the company in a rightward direction to appeal directly to the president.\n\nAccording to CNN’s Brian Stelter, Ellison is “publicly remaining quiet but is privately exuding the kind of confidence that comes from having tens of billions in cash,” all while Paramount argues that Ellison is the only one who can gain approval from the Trump administration. “That's the Trump card,” an Ellison adviser told Stelter.\n\n“Paramount is leveraging this relationship in its pursuit of WBD. ‘Trump's implicit support for the deal is their number one talking point,’ the person involved in the negotiations said,” Stelter further reported, though some Paramount insiders retuted that and claimed Ellison made other pro-merger arguments in his letter to Warner Bros.\n\nThe New York Post’s Charlie Gasparino, who is also a Fox Business correspondent, reported this week that Ellison believes he doesn’t have to increase his offer to WBD by much more because of his friendly relationship with the president.\n\n“That’s because Ellison is being advised that US antitrust concerns and personal gripes will be a major stumbling block for rival bidders – and that, on that front, Paramount Skydance will have the backing of President Trump,” Gasparino wrote, noting that the president’s disdain for Roberts will also help Ellison.\n\n“No less significant, sources close to Ellison say, is the fact that the president is said to privately loathe Brian Roberts, the chief executive of cable giant Comcast, who in many respects is the most logical rival bidder for WBD,” he reported. Indeed, Trump has repeatedly blasted Roberts on social media and in remarks from the White House.\n\nIn the wake of Gasparino’s story, media reporter Tim Baysinger observed on social media that mergers and acquisitions are “now solely based on whether or not the President likes you,” prompting the Fox personality to admit that “this is funny and kinda true.”","summary":"‘Trump's implicit support for the deal is their number one talking point,’ an Ellison adviser told CNN this week.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/david-ellison-trump-warner-bros-offer-b2851127.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/23/17/58/US-ENTERTAINMENT-MEDIA-CONFERENCE-bnjf8prt.jpeg?crop=4822.5,3215,x0.2,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 18:43:28","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":371958714,"title":"Bernie Sanders slams Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, says she failed to focus on important issues","text":"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign on a podcast Wednesday and said she failed to focus on issues that mattered to working Americans. \"Why is there such a cover-up with Biden’s mental decline? Why is there no primary, a quick one even, after he is judged unfit to run? Why is there no transparency there? That’s a huge problem, and I think it delivered — I mean, I know people blame five podcasters, but I think that process helped deliver the country,\" host Tim Dillon asked Sanders during \"The Tim Dillon Show.\" Sanders began by praising Harris and noting that he ran against her in 2020. He added that he had campaigned hard for her in 2024. \"I think the reason that she lost that election gets back to the point we discussed at the beginning of this podcast and that is money in politics. Kamala did not run a campaign focused on the needs of the working class, didn’t run a campaign focused on healthcare, on economics, and raising the minimum wage, on paid family and medical leave, on housing, on all of the issues that working people are struggling with right now,\" Sanders said. KAMALA HARRIS HINTS AT POLITICAL FUTURE, TELLS CHARLAMAGNE SHE'S 'IN IT FOR THE FIGHT' \"And I think her not focusing on those issues allowed Trump to win, in my view,\" he added. Sanders previously criticized Harris’ campaign in an August interview on CNN, saying her consultants were \"heavily influenced by wealthy people.\" \"I like her, she’s a friend of mine, but her core consultants, you know, were heavily influenced by very wealthy people. How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crises facing working families?\" Sanders said.

Smith apologizes after calling out Jasmine Crockett","text":"Radio host Stephen A. Smith posted a video on Wednesday offering an apology to Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, after he previously called out her performative politics.\n\nAhead of his show, Smith released a video titled “An apology to Jasmine Crockett” that addressed his past attacks on the Texas representative’s fiery behavior.\n\nThe cultural commentator said his comments had “been misconstrued and misinterpreted” by critics, but he felt compelled to defend Crockett after seeing “disturbing” comments about her from President Donald Trump.\n\n“I have no problem apologizing to my sister, because damn it, I want her to know I don’t feel that way about her,” Smith said. “Just like I didn’t feel that way about Kamala Harris. Just like I don’t feel that way about the marvelous, the wonderful, the incomparable, the greatest first lady ever, Michelle Obama, in my estimation or anybody else.”\n\nHe continued, “But what we’re going to do on this show is understand who the hell I am and how it’s going to be as long as I’m doing this show. I have no problem apologizing if I’m wrong. I have no problem apologizing if I’ve made somebody feel a certain kind of way.”\n\nSmith said he did not consider his remarks about Crockett’s demeanor misogynistic or disrespectful, but understood why people pushed back when compared with Trump’s rhetoric.\n\n“I’m going to call it like I see it,” Smith said. “I can look Jasmine Crockett in the face and say, ‘I’m sorry for any kind of noise I caused in your direction because she is accomplished, and she is smart, and she does have an incredible, incredible challenge working in this political climate on Capitol Hill.’ I got it.”\n\nHe continued, “And when Trump came at her like that, I said, ‘Damn it.’ I was p—– off because I said that’s what they’re talking about when they’re saying, ‘You know what. When you question something about her, it’s going to invite that.'”\n\nSmith said he did not wish to be associated with Trump’s rhetoric attacking Black women and hopes to do right by Crockett.\n\n“[T]hat doesn’t mean I’m always right,” Smith said, going on to say Crockett was welcome to come to a televised town hall with him next month. “And it doesn’t mean that I’m beyond apologizing when I’m wrong in any way because I’m not here to hurt. I’m here to help.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Crockett’s office for comment.\n\nSmith stood by general efforts to criticize Crockett and “challenge” authority. Nevertheless, he added that he respected “the hell” out of Crockett and encouraged her to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nEarlier this month, Smith called out Crockett for appearing to care more about saying provocative things to get noticed rather than serving her constituents.\n\n“’I’m just going to go off about Trump, cuss him out every chance I get, say the most derogatory, incendiary things imaginable, and that’s my day’s work,'” Smith mocked.","summary":"Stephen A.

The elder Platner has also donated $4,000 to Independent Maine Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe younger Platner has been presented as the “working class” Democrat challenging Republican Senator Susan Collins. His father has donated $8,600 to the election committee of Democratic Maine Rep. Jared Golden — who has backed Graham Platner’s campaign.\n\nGraham Platner attended the elite Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, which costs over $75,000 a year, The Washington Free Beacon reported, citing a 1999 article in a Maine newspaper.

The two former Marines’ meeting took place years after Platner made a $1,000 campaign donation to Golden’s election committee in March 2018, according to FEC records. (RELATED: Maine Mamdani: So-Called ‘Grassroots’ Oyster Farmer Has Deep Connections To Far-Left)\n\nPlatner’s father also contributed $5,600 to former Maine House Speaker and Democratic Senate candidate Sara Gideon, who lost to Senator Susan Collins after being endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC).\n\nFEC records show that Bronson Platner has also donated to the Senate Majority PAC (SMP), the Maine Democratic Party and the campaigns of former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris over the past nearly 14 years.\n\nGraham Platner, who has been endorsed by Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is facing backlash after a series of his past online comments resurfaced. In a now-deleted 2018 Reddit post, he wrote that “an armed working class is a requirement for economic justice” and argued that anyone who thinks they can “fight fascism without a good semi-automatic rifle” should “do some reading of history,” according to a Politico report.

Instead, Republicans are trying to accelerate the process and eliminate districts where voters have backed Democratic candidates.\n\nRecent polling has shown strong support for Proposition 50 and GOP-aligned groups opposing the ballot measure have been scaling back advertising ahead of November’s elections.\n\nTrump is still pushing strongly to lock in the current, narrow, Republican majority in the House that has refused to fill its constitutional role of providing oversight of his presidency.\n\nEarlier this month he called a meeting of Indiana’s state Senate Republican caucus to push them to redraw that state’s maps. Indiana is overwhelmingly Republican, having voted for Trump by 16 points over former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election—but Republicans still are pushing to eliminate the state’s two Democratic congressional districts.\n\nPressuring Indiana would appear to be an acknowledgement of the weak position Republicans are in ahead of the midterm election. If Trump’s agenda and job performance were popular, it is unlikely that redistricting in safe Republican territory would even be a topic of conversation. But his approval has been falling since he took office.\n\nDemocrats currently hold an aggregate lead of 2.6 percentage points over Republicans in polling of the generic congressional vote. In eight of the ten most recent national polls the lead has gone to the Democrats.\n\nAs Obama explained, the motivation for Republicans in pushing to rig the process is abundantly clear.","summary":" On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama called out President Donald Trump’s push to gerrymander congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and endorsed the California ballot initiative seeking to counter Trump’s power grab.\n\n\n\nObama appeared on a video call with California Gov.

The agent, who was featured in a magazine profile, traded on her job in federal law enforcement and hinted at her Secret Service position in a photo shoot labeled, “Undercover, But Never Underdressed.”\nThe female agent, who bills herself as a “nationally published curve model, plus-size fashion and fitness influencer, and body-positive advocate” on social media, was assigned to protect Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, in New York.

In Illinois, however, some Democrats have rejected the idea, according to Capitol News Illinois.\n\n“I think there is next to zero appetite to do it,” one Democratic state House lawmaker told the outlet, while another lawmaker said, “There is no world where I see this happening.” (RELATED: California Dems Call Redistricting ‘Transparent’—But Refuse To Say Who Drew The Map)\n\nJeffries made a last-minute push to add redistricting to the agenda before lawmakers adjourn their fall session next week, according to Punchbowl News. However, with the candidate petition filing deadline for the March primary approaching on Nov. 3, lawmakers would need to either delay the primary or rewrite ballot rules, the outlet reported.\n\nAnother roadblock is opposition from the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus, which worries a new map could dilute minority voting power by spreading Black voters across more districts.\n\n“We’re going to fight back,” Democrat state Sen. Willie Preston told Punchbowl News on Wednesday. “We just won’t do so at the expense of our own power.”\n\nJeffries’ office did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nDemocratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who said in August that redrawing the state’s congressional maps was “on the table,” appeared more noncommittal this week. He stated that Democrats shouldn’t have to “sit on the sidelines,” but added that any redistricting decision is “really up to the legislature,” Capitol News Illinois reported.\n\nThe Illinois governor had previously pledged to veto any partisan maps and even had campaigned on amending the state’s constitution to create an independent redistricting commission.\n\nThe Prairie State’s congressional maps are already considered among the most heavily gerrymandered in the nation.\n\nIllinois Democrats currently hold a commanding 14–3 edge in the state’s congressional delegation after enacting one of the most partisan maps in the country in 2021. That map, which gave Democrats 82% of seats in a state former Vice President Kamala Harris carried with just 54.4% of the vote in 2024, earned an “F” from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project for political fairness and competition.\n\nPritzker was pressed about the maps when talking with Stephen Colbert on “The Late Show” in August. Colbert compared Illinois District 13, which stretches across seven counties, to a scorpion’s stinger. Pritzker responded by joking that a kindergarten class drew the map and called it his “independent commission.”\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have advanced new congressional maps in several states. Texas passed a map in August, expected to give the GOP five additional House seats in the midterms. Missouri followed in September with a map projected to add one Republican seat, and North Carolina approved a new map on Wednesday, expected to yield one more GOP seat.\n\nThe Trump administration has also turned its attention to Indiana, but state Senate Republicans say they currently lack the votes to pass mid-cycle redistricting.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The suit filed by the businessman-turned-politician dates back to 2021 when Trump sued the company (which owns Instagram and Facebook) but suspending his accounts after the January 6 riots.\n\nThe restrictions weren't lifted until 2023.\n\nOf the $25 million, $22 million will go towards a fund to pay for Trump’s presidential library, The Guardian reported, which will launch in January 2029.\n\nAt the end of September, YouTube agreed to pay Trump $24.5 million to settle yet another suit dating back to 2021. Like Meta, YouTube suspended Trump's channel following the US Capitol riots.\n\nThe president alleged that the video sharing platform had 'accumulated an unprecedented concentration of power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse'.\n\nThe case was dismissed in light of a settlement being reached.\n\nIn February, Twitter, now known as X, agreed to pay Trump $10 million. This was yet another social media platform that suspended his account after the 2021 riots.\n\nTwitter (which wasn't owned by Elon Musk at the time) said the permanent suspension was 'due to the risk of further incitement of violence'.\n\nIn July 2025, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, agreed to pay $16 million towards Trump's presidential library as part of a settlement or to charitable causes of his choosing, rather than straight into his pockets.\n\nTrump filed a suit regarding an interview the network broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn Sanders' tweet, he said the president was awarded $36 million from CBS. This is likely to be in reference to the $16 million payout from Paramount and the rumoured $20 million 'gift' from the network. \n\nAs per The Guardian, Trump said that the future owner of the US TV network CBS, David Ellison, will provide him with $20,000,000 worth of advertising and programming.\n\nNow he wants more...\n\nAside from already making a substantial amount of money this year in settlements, Trump now was $230 million from his very own Department of Justice, The New York Times reported on October 21.\n\nTrump reportedly wants the money as a means of compensation for the federal investigations into him.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, the settlement may be approved by senior department officials who have previously defended him and those close to the president.\n\nUNILAD has contacted the White House for comment.","summary":"![CDATA[Donald Trump has made substantially more than his presidential salary]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-settlement-money-received-this-year-2025-631176-20251023","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltf124a2f88b0f4668/68fa35e7b68078da9acb1838/bernie-sanders-breaks-down-how-much-trump-has-recie","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 15:03:05","author":"Niamh Shackleton","authors":["Niamh Shackleton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":371907676,"title":"CA Governor Candidate: Winning Back Lost Democrats | Opinion","text":"Bill Clinton had a vision for America.\n\nA balanced budget through deficit reduction and free trade. American leadership through global engagement. Reducing crime through increased police hiring and community policing. Welfare reform tied to work and opportunity expansion.\n\nPut another way, socially liberal, fiscally conservative.\n\nClinton absolutely crushed it. He achieved the first budget surplus in 30 years. Crime fell dramatically by hiring more cops. Unemployment went from 7.3 percent to 4.2 percent, creating 22 million jobs. Homeownership among minorities increased. Black unemployment fell from 14 percent to below 8 percent. He appointed many women and minorities to significant roles, including Janet Reno as attorney general.\n\nI believe the future of the Democratic Party lies in the past. Ironically, the progressive party needs to look backwards.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PA – SEPTEMBER 21: Donna Elms wears a Democrat donkey pin while lining up outside in advance of a campaign rally with former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, and Senator Bob Casey (D- PA) on September 21, 2018 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Midterm election Day is November 6th. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)\n\nWhen I landed in LAX last month and drove to Santa Monica, I saw two cranes. Two.\n\nWhen I land at PHX or GWB or PVG, all I see are cranes. We are not building anything in California, which is why I am running for governor of the state. That means we are not building for the future. For all the great software we build in California, we can’t pave a road to save our lives.\n\nOur infrastructure, along with our health care, education, small businesses, home insurance and more are all tied up in endless regulation.\n\nSomewhere along the line, the Democratic view of government being for everyone transitioned into government employing everyone. The state of California is the largest employer in the state of California.\n\nThere is a direct line from overregulation to unemployment and homelessness.\n\nCalifornia has lost half a million people in the last five years, largely because of housing costs. Housing is expensive because supply is low. Supply is low because regulations are unbearable.\n\nBacon is 28 percent more expensive in California than it is in Arizona. That’s because the gas to transport the bacon is 40 percent more expensive, and that’s due to regulation.\n\nEnergy prices in California are highest in the nation from a kWh perspective. It’s because we haven’t built nearly enough nuclear, solar, coal and wind energy, largely due to California Environmental Quality Act, a 50-year-old, redundant, overreaching piece of regulation.\n\nI could go on and on, but I’m sure that’s against regulation.\n\nThis is not the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton.\n\nInstead, this is the kind of government overreach that people feared under a Kamala Harris administration, and it’s why they handed her a lopsided defeat. Forty percent of California voted for Donald Trump, while the state’s own former U.S. senator and attorney general was running against him.\n\nLast month in Las Vegas, I attended a conference of the Progressive Policy Institute. They showed a clip of focus groups they had done, and people were spitting mad about the Democrats.\n\n“They want to convert my kids’ sex without my approval,” they said.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether this true or not. This is what Americans think of the Democratic Party. This is the epitome of overreach.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nFirst off, we need to change the focus of the party from social issues to economic issues: unemployment, housing, food prices, energy prices. That requires reducing regulation and the size of government.\n\nSecond, we need to stop criticizing businesses, ambition, growth and wealth creation. Not only because it’s wrong, but because it alienates the people who create jobs, who then defect to the only alternative.\n\nThird, we need some young blood. The average age of Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Tim Walz is 75. Seventy-five! To borrow a line from Mr. Clinton, we need people with more tomorrows than yesterdays.\n\nFourth, we need to draw a clear distinction and expel the far-left wing of the party. Zohran Mamdani won 573,000 votes in his mayoral primary, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received 123,000 in her last election. Together, that’s about the population of Oklahoma City, hardly a national movement. But they provide endless fodder for the Right to say the Democrats are socialists.\n\nI’d bet others agree with me on these solutions. If I’m right, I’ll win. If I’m wrong, I’ll lose.\n\nI’ve been told repeatedly that you can’t get elected without being an extremist anymore. I disagree.\n\nI meet a lot of rational, pragmatic folks who are frustrated. In California, we pay high taxes, and most of us are ok with it. But we expect to get something in...","summary":"I believe the future of the Democratic Party lies in the past.

The individual later stands up and walks past the building, with a backpack in their hand, before eventually turning around and retracing their steps through the Capitol Hill neighborhood. \n\nThe person returns to the DNC building and places a pipe bomb underneath the bench around 7:54 p.m.\n\nThe video later shows the suspect walking toward the RNC headquarters, holding the backpack at arm's length from their body. The suspect can be seen in the footage walking through an alley behind the building, then retracing their steps. \n\nThe bomb was planted in the alley behind the building around 8:16 p.m. The suspect is last seen on footage at 8:18 p.m wearing the backpack on their shoulders and walking away from the alley.\n\n“The bomb is believed to have been placed shortly before this video based on how the suspect is carrying the backpack,” the FBI states. \n\nThe law enforcement agency is offering up to a $500,000 reward for information to help identify the suspect. \n\n“As part of our ongoing investigation, we’re releasing an updated video fo the suspect, which includes previously unreleased footage, higher quality video, and longer clips of the subject’s movements,” the FBI wrote.\n\nThe suspect is approximately 5 feet 7 inches, and was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, black gloves, and black-and-gray Nike Air Max Speed Turf Shoes with a yellow swoosh logo that night.

The discovery prompted the evacuation of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris from the DNC headquarters. \n\nAuthorities have charged over 1,500 people in connection with the Jan 6 riots but they have not been able to track down the suspect involved in the attempted pipe bombing.\n\nSupporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, claiming it has been “stolen.” One police officer was killed, nearly 150 officers were injured and four rioters died in the attack. The riot caused over $1 million in damages.\n\nWhen he returned to the White House in January, one of President Trump’s first official acts was commuting the sentences of hundreds of rioters, many of whom were convicted of violent offenses against members of law enforcement.","summary":"The FBI has shared new surveillance footage of the suspect who planted pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters, the night before the January 6 riots, and offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fbi-reward-pipe-bomb-suspect-capitol-riots-b2850907.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/23/12/22/Pipe-bomb-suspect-footage.png?crop=600,400,x221.8,y0&trim=0,277,0,221&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jyRw2kAq-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-23 13:38:26","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":371890968,"title":"Introducing White House ballroom construction derangement syndrome","text":"White House ballroom construction derangement syndrome shall henceforth be known as the condition predicated on an irrational and overly emotional response to the president renovating an 80-year-old section of the White House to create a luxurious new ballroom, using private contributions to fund the changes. The Democratic response to this has been altogether absurd, easily rivaling anything the Left has been outraged over regarding Trump. It’s been so over the top that the only thing seemingly missing was assertions that building the ballroom was fascist, Nazi, or something Adolf Hitler would do.\n\nThe renovations have been labeled everything from “destroying history” to “an abuse of power.” Their rants have just become absurd tantrums rooted in envy and jealousy. Trump should hand out pearls to Democrats for Halloween to ensure they have plenty in stock for all of their clutching. \n\nConsider these unhinged hysterics by Democrats over renovations to the White House.\n\nMultiple-time failed presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, said, “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.”\n\nThis is not only overreactive and dishonest but also hypocritical, given that the Clinton administration renovated the White House when she was first lady. It wasn’t to the extent of adding a ballroom, but, like Trump’s construction, it was also funded by contributions and donations. \n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) posted on X that Trump was destroying the White House. \n\n“Donald Trump doesn’t want you to see this picture,” Newsom posted. “He’s literally destroying the White House.”\n\nMartha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist and retired professor from Towson University, somehow landed real estate in the Washington Post to claim that “they’re wrecking” the White House and “destroying that history forever.”\n\n“They’re wrecking it,” said Kumar. “And these are changes that can’t be undone. They’re destroying that history forever.”\n\nKumar might be shocked to know of all the changes presidents have made to the White House over the years. Yet, somehow, when presidents not named Trump did this, history was not being “destroyed.”\n\nThis is White House ballroom construction derangement syndrome.\n\nAnd speaking of the Washington Post, the news organization published an article on Wednesday, “Can anyone stop Trump’s teardown of the East Wing?” \n\nAll of this is nothing more than White House ballroom construction derangement syndrome. But wait, there’s more!\n\nOther examples include the obsessed Never Trumper Rick Wilson, the Lincoln Project executive who famously incorrectly boasted that Trump would lose to Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Wilson was irate over the White House enhancements. He has a long history of being wrong in politics and, as demonstrated below, suffers from a lack of grammar knowledge when posting on social media.\n\n“I hate him with the fire of a billions [sic] suns,” Wilson posted on X. \n\nLeft-wing, former CNN employee, and agenda-driven “journalist” Jim Acosta, while either being uninformed of White House history or just outright ignoring it, asked, “So any president can just start destroying portions of the White House? Is that how this works?”\n\nMSNBC analyst Fernand R. Amandi might have topped all of the comments. He somehow linked Trump’s White House renovations to the Democrats’ favorite bogeyman, especially Democrats between 2016 and 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAbove an image of the construction on the East Wing, Amandi said, “Putin watching the greatest triumph of his life.”\n\nBecause putting a 90,000 square foot ballroom in the White House is a Putin manipulation and Russian collusion. \n\nThis way of thinking is disturbing and not normal! Acosta, Amandi, and Kumar have White House ballroom construction derangement syndrome.\n\nThere were many more examples, all equally absurd and ridiculous. It’s indicative of the mental abnormalities that dominate contemporary left-wing political thought. And given such anger and hysteria, is it any wonder that depression and other mental health concerns are more prevalent in liberals, Democrats, and others on the Left?\n\nWhite House ballroom construction derangement syndrome is real and is currently dominating the rhetoric of the nation’s political Left. Their sole purpose in life appears to be just to be angry over anything and everything President Donald Trump does, even when the accusations are a complete detachment from reality. Like nearly everything these people say anymore, their antics are not grounded in reality and are completely unhinged.","summary":"Hell hath no fury like Democrats’ scorn for President Donald Trump renovating the White House!

Jones fantasized about urinating on the graves of political opponents as well as shooting then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert with “two bullets to the head.”\n\nHe also texted that he hoped Gilbert’s wife, Jennifer, would one day hold one of her children as they died.\n\nHe followed that post with the same tropes used against all Republicans about “saving our democracy” and accusing incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares of being someone “who takes directives from [President] Donald Trump.”\n\nSo what makes the stakes higher in this local election?\n\nIs it character? There is none evident here. How can he tell voters he has the comportment to govern?\n\nAnd how hard is it for Virginia Democrats to demand that he face consequences for his behavior? Where are Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Tim Kaine, D-Va.? Gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and lieutenant gubernatorial nominee Ghazala Hashmi? Yes, they have tepidly called Jones’ texts inexcusable. As for consequences? Well, they all still endorse him.\n\nOne Democrat they didn’t support after a major scandal was former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. They tried very hard to drive him out of office in 2019 when it was unearthed that he appeared in blackface in a college yearbook in the 1980s.\n\nIt didn’t work. He stayed, defying all the pressure.\n\nAt the time, Warner and Kaine said in a joint statement, “We no longer believe he can effectively serve as the governor of Virginia and that he must resign.”\n\nSo did every major national Democrat, from former Vice President Kamala Harris to former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to former President Joe Biden. Yet there is no call for Jones to exit the race.\n\nPerhaps it is because Democrats know it is too late to replace him on the ballot. Early voting has already started, and perhaps they don’t want the Republicans to score a win in the off-year cycle. Or, perhaps, and this is the worst possible scenario, the Democrats are secretly OK with what Jones texted.\n\nJones has a host of other problems as well. He was stopped by law enforcement in 2022 for going 116 mph in a 70-mph zone, an infraction that could have resulted in jail time for reckless driving. Instead, his lawyer and the commonwealth’s attorney worked out a deal by which Jones was only required to do 1,000 hours of community service, the bulk of which was performed by Jones for his own political action committee in lieu of jail time.\n\nVirginia Democrats come across looking as though murder and gaming the system are not issues that deserve consequences. They aren’t going to stick their necks out to make Jones leave the race.\n\nThis story has totally blown up the race. However, the lingering question remains about the mindset of the Virginia Democrats, and indeed the mindset of national Democrats.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Still, his entrepreneurial granddaughter’s photo suggests the problem may predate that.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president himself first addressed the dark bruises in an interview with Time magazine last December, when he said the problem had arisen “from shaking hands with thousands of people.”\n\nHe was seen with alarming red sores on his fingers and palms in January, and the bruising has been remarked upon many times since, with Trump not always taking the trouble to hide it with concealer.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and the president’s personal physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, have subsequently insisted that Trump is in “excellent health” and repeated the handshaking explanation while also attributing it to his consumption of aspirin.\n\n“This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,” Dr Barbabella said in an official memo in July. “This is a well-known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.”\n\nTrump also revealed this summer that he has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means he experiences swelling in his lower extremities as the veins in his legs ineffectively pump blood back up toward his heart.\n\nThose answers have not satisfied some online, however, who continue to speculate that the president may be receiving undisclosed medical treatment through an IV drip or that doctors may be conducting frequent tests on him, such as blood withdrawals.\n\nTheir feverish interest in Trump’s well-being also led to a wild conspiracy theory that he had died and it had been covered up, Stalin-style, over the Labor Day weekend – but there is some basis for doubting the official word on his health.\n\nTrump’s doctor for 35 years before his first term, Dr Harold Bornstein, for instance, insisted he was the “healthiest person ever elected to the presidency” in an open letter in 2016, only to confess two years later that the patient had dictated it himself. “I didn’t write that letter,” Dr Bornstein revealed. “I just made it up as I went along.”\n\nIt has also subsequently emerged that the president was much sicker when he contracted Covid-19 in October 2020 than the public was told at the time and that he required treatment for low blood oxygen levels, high fever, and lung problems during his recuperation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Maryland.","summary":"Latest social media post from president’s granddaughter hints at problem with skin blemishes earlier than previously thought","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-hand-bruises-kai-instagram-b2850862.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/23/11/21/Kai-Trump.png?crop=1097,731.3,x0,y132.7&trim=132,0,638,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EVeWtVpH-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-23 12:16:57","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.035},{"id":371901922,"title":"Stephen A.

On one side of the screen, Tulsi Virani — stalwart matriarch of Indian primetime melodrama — offered her trademark folded-hand salutation. On the other side, beamed in from across the world, Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder and global philanthropist, smiled and echoed her words: “Jai Shri Krishna.”The scene, part of a guest appearance on Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2, was meant to signal goodwill. Perhaps a nod to the show's wide appeal, perhaps a gesture of cultural diplomacy. But what stood out wasn’t Gates’ presence so much as his fluency. That three-word Sanskrit phrase, offered without hesitation, felt at once surprising and entirely plausible.Just months earlier, Kash Patel — former Pentagon chief of staff and nominee for FBI Director — opened his U.S. Senate hearing by saying the same phrase. With his parents seated behind him, Patel touched their feet and addressed the room in English before adding, “Jai Shri Krishna.” No translation followed. None was needed.In both cases, the phrase didn’t come with explanation. It simply hung in the air, as if its meaning had already traveled ahead of the words themselves. The West, it seemed, had begun to understand.Bhakti on a One-Way TicketThe story of how Krishna’s name became recognizable in the West often begins with a voyage. In 1965, a 69-year-old monk named A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada left Kolkata aboard a cargo ship bound for New York. He arrived with little money, a crate of translated scriptures, and a conviction that the message of Krishna consciousness — bhakti, or loving devotion to God — could take root in the West.At first, it was an improbable proposition. The America of the mid-sixties was culturally unsettled: urban unrest, civil rights uprisings, Vietnam protests. But it was also a place of spiritual restlessness. When Prabhupada began leading public chants in Tompkins Square Park and holding lectures in a small East Village storefront, curious young Americans — some disillusioned, others simply curious — began to gather.He founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in 1966. What followed was not mass conversion, but a kind of absorption. The movement aligned itself with the counterculture without fully surrendering to it. Western followers shaved their heads, wore saffron robes, and greeted strangers with “Hare Krishna.” It was a movement defined by music, repetition, and a quiet certainty that joy — both spiritual and communal — could be revolutionary.George Harrison’s GiftNo cultural movement cements itself in Western consciousness without help from the mainstream. In ISKCON’s case, it arrived in the form of a Beatle.George Harrison, already drawn to Indian music and philosophy, became one of the movement’s most visible patrons. He helped finance the first ISKCON temple in London and produced a recording of the Hare Krishna mantra that became a minor hit on British radio. Later, his own single My Sweet Lord blended gospel with Sanskrit chants, bringing Krishna’s name to the top of charts in Europe and the United States.Harrison also donated Bhaktivedanta Manor, an estate outside London that remains a major ISKCON center to this day. And it was through him that many first encountered Krishna, not through scripture or theology, but through melody. The mantras didn’t require belief to be sung. And in the singing, something shifted.Still, the movement remained, in the public eye, a curiosity. Saffron-robed devotees danced at airports and offered free food on college campuses. Krishna’s name was heard more often in pop culture. Yet through it all, the phrase “Jai Shri Krishna” lingered quietly, spoken less in public but rooted in private homes and temples. The groundwork for its future visibility was being laid.Institution Becomes InfrastructureBy the 1980s, the energy of the early movement had settled. ISKCON faced the challenges common to many religious institutions: leadership changes, internal scrutiny, and the slow departure of public novelty. But even as the headlines faded, the work continued. Temples were built. Farms were run. Food relief programs served communities across continents.Meanwhile, the Indian diaspora grew — and with it, a different kind of devotional visibility. Second-generation Indian Americans and British Indians began to assert their identities with less hesitation. “Jai Shri Krishna” was heard at weddings, community events, and holiday celebrations. It became part of the rhythm of diasporic life.This wasn’t the spectacle of street chanting. It was quieter, embedded in the everyday. Krishna moved from public parks to suburban homes, and his name became part of the domestic soundtrack. A grandmother’s greeting, a text message sign-off, a child’s temple recital. The phrase traveled, not through institutions, but through memory.Secular Fluency and Diaspora ConfidenceBy the early 2000s, Krishna was no longer unfamiliar. Yoga studios ended sessions with Sanskrit chants. Mindfulness apps included Gita verses. Pop music sampled mantras. The vocabulary of Indian spirituality had entered the global mainstream — often simplified, but rarely mocked.At the same time, the political visibility of the Indian diaspora began to rise. Leaders like Rishi Sunak, Kamala Harris, and Tulsi Gabbard represented different ideological strands but carried with them a certain cultural texture. Diwali was now celebrated at Downing Street and the White House. Bhagavad Gita verses were cited in American legislative debates. Public rituals were no longer hidden. They were staged.In this context, the casual appearance of “Jai Shri Krishna” — whether from a tech mogul or a political nominee — no longer seemed novel. Gates’ invocation may have been scripted, but it landed because it was legible. Patel’s salutation may have been personal, but it didn’t need explaining. The phrase had become part of the public grammar of diaspora belonging.Not Just a Salutation“Jai Shri Krishna” is more than a greeting. It’s a gesture, a signal, and a tiny piece of liturgy. It names a god, certainly, but also names a tradition — one of playfulness, wisdom, and intimacy with the divine. It’s the sort of phrase that doesn’t need to convince in order to resonate.Unlike doctrinal declarations, it asks nothing in return. It can be spoken out of belief, habit, pride, or affection. And it travels well. Between elders and children. Between friends across time zones. Between strangers who recognize the cadence before they understand the words.Its entry into public life didn’t happen because someone planned it. It happened because people carried it — sometimes consciously, sometimes not.From Devotional Murmur to Cultural EchoThe phrase “Jai Shri Krishna” did not arrive in the West with Gates or Patel. Nor did it spread solely through the momentum of one movement or one community. Its path has been uneven, shaped by accident as much as intention. Partly through the songs of a Beatle. Partly through the teachings of a monk. Partly through the Sunday school recitals of suburban temples. And partly through the persistence of memory among those who migrated but did not forget.Its current recognizability owes less to any concerted effort than to decades of quiet repetition. Ritual became routine. What was once whispered in courtyards now occasionally appears in the public record. These appearances should not be overstated. A tech billionaire repeating a Sanskrit phrase or a Senate nominee invoking Krishna does not mark a religious transformation. It signals something subtler — that Krishna’s name no longer startles, that his presence in public language no longer requires justification. The West has not adopted Krishna. But it has learned, slowly, to share space with him. In the long history of religious expression, that alone marks a shift worth noticing.","summary":"The story of how Krishna’s name became recognizable in the West often begins with a voyage.

The Supreme Court will rule on whether these districts violate equal protection under the Constitution.\n\nACLU Voting Rights Project Director Sophia Lin Lakin, who supports these majority-minority districts, said: “Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in safeguarding the promise that people of color can participate in our democracy on equal terms. It has been our shield against discriminatory maps and our answer to laws designed to suppress the vote. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act with overwhelming, bipartisan support -- and reauthorized it again and again -- because our leaders understood a fundamental truth: you cannot cure discrimination by pretending it doesn’t exist.”\n\nNAACP lawyer Janai Nelson told the court, “It was clear that, regardless of party, white Democrats were not voting for black candidates, whether they were Democrats or not. We know that there is such a significant chasm between how black and white voters vote in Louisiana that there is no question that even if there is some correlation between race and party, that race is the driving factor.”\n\nThe Supreme Court decades ago in Shaw v. Reno (1993) and Miller v. Johnson (1995) ruled against districts where gerrymandering by race was the dominant factor. “Ethnic cleansing!” cried Jesse Jackson after the Miller decision. Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said, “The noose is tightening.” Her colleague, Theodore Shaw, warned that once this decision goes through, the Black Congressional Caucus “could meet in the back seat of a taxicab.” But of the black House members in the four redesigned majority-white Southern districts who decided to run for reelection, three won. One chose not to run.\n\nIn 2016, the city of over 100,000 population that voted most for Donald Trump, with 80% of the vote, was Abilene, Texas, a city that is over 75% white. Shortly after Trump’s election, Abilene voted for its first black mayor. Black Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) recently said: “Myself, Wesley Hunt, Burgess Owens, John James -- we are all black men who represent majority-white districts (referring to Texas, Utah, and Michigan, respectively.) Tim Scott is the United States senator from South Carolina. South Carolina does have a strong black population, but it’s a predominantly white state. These are the facts.” America’s three largest cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, all have black mayors, though none of these cities is majority black. There are many examples of blacks elected to statewide offices in a country where no state has a majority black population. These include Sens. Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Carol Moseley Braun and Cory Booker, as well as Govs. Doug Wilder, Deval Patrick and Wes Moore.\n\nAbout the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s principal rival for the Democratic nomination was Hillary Clinton. Obama was attempting to become the first black president, while Clinton was attempting to become the first female president. On the Republican side, the two primary rivals were Mitt Romney, who would become the first Mormon president, and John McCain, who would become at 72 the oldest elected president. In February 2007, Gallup found that 5% of Americans said they “would not vote for” a black presidential candidate; 11% “would not vote for” a woman; 24% “would not vote for” a Mormon; and 42% “would not vote for” a presidential candidate who is “72 years of age.” So, Obama’s hurdle was the lowest.\n\nAs for the Supreme Court, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) calls Republican-appointed jurists “often underqualified or completely unqualified for their role.”\n\nNothing says qualified quite like a bartender-turned-congressional candidate. And AOC got elected, proving yet again that despite America’s “systemic racism,” there’s hope.\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.

Although he wasn’t on the Capitol grounds that day—he had been arrested forty‑eight hours earlier on unrelated charges and ordered to leave Washington—the Justice Department said he organized and inspired the most violent of the men who charged into the building wearing body armor and tactical gear, smashing windows, and beating police officers along the way. As Tarrio lay on the floor straining to hear the election night coverage, he believed the results would determine whether he would spend the next two decades of his life in prison or be set free.\n“If Trump won, I was one hundred percent certain he would give me a pardon,” Tarrio later told me.\nTarrio had been listening to the election returns on a small transistor radio he had bought from the prison commissary, but its single AAA battery died sometime around 11 p.m., before it became clear who would win. Tarrio called out to the nearby prison guards and pleaded with them to turn up the sound on the television they were watching, and one of them—“one hundred percent MAGA,” Tarrio told me—obliged. Before long, the voices of CNN anchors could be heard echoing down the concrete hall of his cellblock.\nAt 2:05 a.m., CNN projected Donald Trump as the winner of Pennsylvania, and Tarrio knew the election was effectively over (in fact, although Tarrio had no way to know it, Fox News had already declared Trump the president-elect). He leapt to his feet and began banging on the door of his cell in celebration, quickly joined by his fellow inmates in the cellblock who had come to know him as one of the ringleaders of the January 6 attack. Within minutes, the prison was erupting with the noise of inmates hollering and pounding on their doors of their prison cells to mark Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris.\nAs Enrique Tarrio celebrated Trump’s victory in prison, the incoming Trump administration was already taking shape at Donald Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Florida.\nThe Trump transition team’s official office was situated a few miles away from Mar‑a‑Lago—in what had been the campaign’s headquarters—but the key decisions that would shape the incoming administration were being made within the ornate and gold‑accented walls of Trump’s private club. As virtually everyone looking to influence the president‑elect or get a top job knew, proximity to Trump mattered more than anything else. The key was to be the last person to speak with him before he made a decision. Take, for example, Trump’s first personnel announcement: the selection of Susie Wiles as his chief of staff.\nWhile the president‑elect was meeting with Wiles on November 7 to offer her the job, two other contenders, Linda McMahon and Brooke Rollins, rushed over to Mar‑a‑Lago in a last‑ditch effort to derail the pick. Various Trump aides, most of whom had worked for Wiles during the campaign, managed to impede the two women on their way to see Trump. They even orchestrated a phone call with Vice President–elect JD Vance to delay the two aspiring chiefs of staff on their way to Trump’s office. By the time McMahon and Rollins got in to see Trump, it was too late. He had already asked Wiles to be chief of staff. They would have to settle instead for secretary of education and secretary of agriculture, respectively.\nAnother Trump ally who quickly realized he’d need to prioritize time at Mar‑a‑Lago during the transition was Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The day after the election, Kennedy and his entourage—far‑right pundit Tucker Carlson, former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard, and Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, his daughter‑in‑law and former campaign manager—spent at least eight hours at Trump’s club. Joe Biden was still the president, but for all intents and purpose 1100 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach was the center of the political universe.\nAmong the first to make his way to Mar-a-Lago after the election was Howard Lutnick, Trump’s billionaire friend from New York. Lutnick had been a Democrat for most of his life – he hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign – but Trump had named him the co‑chair of his presidential transition team after the Republican Convention, a role he would share with Linda McMahon, a fellow billionaire and co‑founder of World Wrestling Entertainment.\nBefore the election, Trump had little interest in the transition, but Lutnick took the job seriously, methodically compiling lists of names to fill various cabinet positions and other key posts. The suggestions were strictly notional—Kevin McCarthy was listed as a potential secretary of state and Aileen Cannon, the Florida judge who had thrown out the classified documents case against Trump, was named as a potential attorney general—because Trump, a bit superstitious about making plans before winning the election, didn’t want anything to do with the transition until he was president‑elect.\n“I don’t like to talk about transition until I win,” Trump told me in late October when I asked him about the planning that was underway. “When we win, you and I will talk about it. But until you win, I don’t like talking about transition.”\nNow that the election was over, Trump was eager to quickly put together his White House team and Lutnick was determined to be by his side. Mar-a-Lago has very few workspaces, so Lutnick made a land grab—securing the club’s “Tea Room” as his new headquarters. Located next to the living room that operated as the main lobby and steps away from the outdoor pool, the Tea Room was added to the club after Trump purchased the property in 1985. It’s relatively modern and bland compared with the rest of the club, but it was the only place on the property that resembled a private meeting room.\nLutnick had a conference table installed in the Tea Room, as well as several large television screens that he used for presentations to Trump about potential nominees. One monitor would display bullet points—no more than five—describing a candidate’s qualifications, while a second screen would be loaded up with video clips of his or her recent TV appearances. A third monitor would feature a large photograph of the candidate—a headshot—so that Trump could visualize whether he or she looked the part; whether they were, in Trump’s mind, out of “central casting.”\nAlthough he hadn’t wanted to think or talk much about the transition before the election, Trump clearly had more opinions about who would serve in his second administration than he’d had about who would serve in his first. In 2016, when he was still new to Republican politics, Trump was forced to rely on advice from others as he scrambled to staff the federal government. That’s how a number of people who were not ideologically aligned with Trump or unflinchingly loyal to him—James Mattis, Gary Cohn, Mike Pompeo, Rex Tillerson, Nikki Haley, John Kelly—ended up with top roles in his first administration.\nTrump wasn’t going to let that happen again. “The difference between now and before is I know everybody now, and when I first came I knew nobody,” Trump told me during a phone conversation on October 21, 2024. “We had a lot of great people. But I didn’t know people. Had to rely on recommendations. Now I know people.” Days after that call, he would make a seemingly unprompted announcement on Truth Social: “I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation.”\nAlthough Trump was generally only selecting people he knew personally for high‑level roles, they still needed to be vetted. And without access to FBI background checks, Lutnick scrambled to cobble together a team of lawyers tasked with digging into the personal histories of potential candidates for high‑level positions in the incoming administration. The finalists would be summoned to Mar‑a‑Lago and meet with Trump for an in‑person interview in his office upstairs. In the weeks after the election, the Mar‑a‑Lago living room became the crossroads of the MAGA world.\nOn any given day, you could spot billionaire donors, Republican politicians, right‑wing pundits, pro‑Trump influencers, and other would‑be cabinet secretaries hustling in and out or just hanging around. Elon Musk arrived on election day and almost never left, literally moving into the place and staying until shortly before the inauguration. Actor Sylvester Stallone was often there too, invited by Trump to sit in on a meeting with at least one foreign dignitary who came to Mar-a-Lago to meet the president-elect.\nAnother person seen regularly at Mar‑a‑Lago in the weeks after the election was Kash Patel, a deeply committed Trump loyalist who served in the first administration and wrote three children’s books about Donald Trump’s battles with his political enemies (a trilogy titled The Plot Against the King). Patel would often be seen hanging around the club’s living room, ready whenever Trump walked by to make his pitch to be the director of the FBI. Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign who did time in prison for tax and bank fraud, was spotted at the club, too, bringing his own candidate to be FBI director.\nSome aspiring candidates for top jobs in Trump’s White House struggled with the president‑elect’s process. One prospective cabinet secretary, for example, flew to Palm Beach from Texas a few days after the election because he had been told to be ready to meet with Trump at any time. This person, a highly successful business owner and executive and major Republican donor who had served in the first Trump administration and who spoke to me on the condition that I not reveal his name, told me he stayed at a nearby hotel for two days before finally being invited to see Trump the following morning at 9:30 a.m. Upon showing up at Mar‑a‑Lago, he sat down on a couch in the living room next to a candidate for attorney general—and he waited. Several other potential nominees came and went over the next several hours, all waiting for an audience with the president‑elect.\nIt wasn’t until 12:30 p.m. that this potential cabinet member was called in to see Trump. The meeting went well, he later told me, but he was taken aback when the president‑elect started asking him questions about a different cabinet position than the one he had been talking to Howard Lutnick and the transition team about.\nOne of the people this cabinet finalist had been sitting near in the Mar‑a‑Lago living room downstairs was a Fox News weekend anchor, whom he assumed was in town to conduct a television interview with Trump. Like the rest of the world, he was stunned to hear later that night that the president‑elect would be nominating that Fox News weekend anchor—Pete Hegseth—to serve as secretary of defense. In fact, the only person involved with the Trump transition team who had been seriously considering Hegseth as a candidate to run the Pentagon seemed to be Trump himself.\nHegseth had served honorably in the Army—including combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan—and he had degrees from both Princeton and Harvard, but for most of the past decade, he had been a pro‑Trump talking head on Fox News, most recently as the co‑anchor of one of Trump’s favorite programs, Fox & Friends Weekend. He hadn’t been considered by the transition team for any senior government position, let alone for defense secretary. For that role, Lutnick’s operation had compiled a list of candidates that included Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and US Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa, a former commander in the US Army Reserve with more than twenty years of service under her belt and a widely respected member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nInstead, Trump did what he so often does and went with his gut, selecting the guy he liked to watch on TV who would stand up to the military leaders Trump believed had undermined him in the final months of his first administration. The lack of any background check, however, created some serious complications for Trump and his team. Hegseth would eventually be confirmed by the Senate—barely, with Vice President JD Vance breaking a 50–50 tie—but not before a devastating string of allegations about his past came to light, almost all of them unknown by the Trump transition team.\nTwo days after Trump announced his intent to nominate Hegseth, Vanity Fair reported that the Trump transition team was scrambling to investigate a sexual assault allegation from several years earlier. Hegseth, who’d been married three times before turning forty years old, maintained the encounter was consensual, but local police who had investigated the incident at the time, and Hegseth’s own lawyer confirmed that Hegseth had paid the accuser a settlement as part of a nondisclosure agreement. Weeks later, The New Yorker published a story detailing Hegseth’s alleged financial mismanagement and struggles with alcohol while president of Concerned Veterans for America and as a host on Fox News.\nIn late November, The New York Times obtained an email that Hegseth’s own mother had sent him in 2018. “You are an abuser of women—that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,” it read. “On behalf of all the women (and I know it’s many) you have abused in some way, I say…get some help and take an honest look at yourself.”\nMrs. Hegseth told the Times that she had immediately followed up to apologize to her son, because she had fired off the original email “in anger, with emotion.”\nThe controversy surrounding Hegseth overshadowed another cabinet pick Trump had made earlier on the same day: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to be secretary of Homeland Security. Like Hegseth, Noem had not been on the transition team’s list of possible candidates and had not gone through vetting for the job. When a surprised Trump advisor asked the president‑elect why he had decided to nominate Noem to be secretary of Homeland Security, he had a simple answer.\n“I did it for Corey,” Trump said. “It’s the only thing Corey asked me for.”\nTrump was referring to Corey Lewandowski, the Republican operative who had served as his first of three campaign managers during his 2016 run for the White House. Lewandowski was not well-liked among Trump’s advisors, but his loyalty to Trump had never wavered—and he had developed a close personal relationship with Governor Noem.\nThat Trump would offer Noem a high‑profile job was no surprise. She had long been a defender of his, and in 2020 she had gifted him a model of Mount Rushmore with five faces etched into the side: George Washington’s, Thomas Jefferson’s, Teddy Roosevelt’s, Abraham Lincoln’s, and . . . Donald Trump’s. The former president kept it on display in his Mar‑a‑Lago office for years.\nBut secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is one of the most consequential positions in any presidential administration, and it would only take on even more importance in Trump’s, given the agenda he was planning to pursue. And the reviews of Noem’s tenure as governor of South Dakota were mixed at best, marked by ethics concerns and allegations she used taxpayer resources to boost her national political profile. She had so alienated South Dakota’s Native American leaders that all nine of the nationally recognized tribes banned her from their lands, effectively forbidding the governor from entering approximately 17 percent of the state. And then there was the controversy surrounding a book she published in 2024, in which she wrote about shooting her family’s fourteen‑month‑old dog Cricket because she was misbehaving and stated that she had met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (she later acknowledged no such meeting happened).\nWas Noem really qualified to run the sprawling agency that includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Secret Service? Even some of Trump’s closest allies were uncomfortable with putting her in charge of all that.\n“We still got the global war on terror,” an exasperated Steve Bannon told me two days after Trump made the announcement. “She runs the whole thing? She runs the fucking Secret Service? It’s all of it. It’s the global war on terror. It’s all that. What are you talking about? She’s never been in law enforcement!”\nBut Bannon didn’t put the blame on Trump for making what he considered a terrible choice. He blamed Lewandowski for convincing the president‑elect to do it.\n“This motherfucker asked for somebody who’s obviously unqualified—and it’s dangerous,” Bannon said. “This is dangerous. What are you doing?”\nPete Hegseth was far from the only Fox News personality to be angling for a job in the second Trump administration—and far from the only one to eventually make it into government. Sean Duffy, a former Republican member of Congress and Fox Business anchor, was interested in a role, and Trump enjoyed watching him on television. More importantly, Trump was a big fan of Duffy’s wife, Rachel Campos‑Duffy, who had been working alongside Hegseth as the co‑host of Fox & Friends Weekend.\nDuffy’s top choice for a cabinet role was US Ambassador to the United Nations. He had no foreign policy or diplomatic experience, but he found the job appealing for a completely unrelated, logistical reason: It was based in New York, due to the location of the UN headquarters. Not only would he not have to uproot his nine children and move to Washington, DC, but Rachel could continue anchoring Fox & Friends Weekend from the show’s studios in Manhattan.\nAlas, Trump had already decided to offer the United Nations job to Representative Elise Stefanik.\nReince Priebus, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, suggested that Trump make Duffy secretary of transportation instead. This was an odd recommendation. Duffy had a colorful biography—in addition to his Fox Business experience, he had been a reality TV star on MTV’s Real World, served four terms in the House of Representatives, won three lumberjack world championships, and worked as a local prosecutor in Wisconsin and a lobbyist in Washington— but he had no relevant experience for the job.\nWhen Trump asked a friend of Duffy’s if he knew anything about transportation, the friend answered, “Of course he does, he has nine kids!” Moving a family that large around, the friend joked, requires at least some transportation expertise.\nUnsurprisingly, Duffy’s name had not been on the transition’s list of possible transportation secretaries. Lutnick had recommended a former senior executive at Uber named Emil Michael for the role, and Elon Musk had seconded that suggestion, believing Michael’s experience at a big tech company that had revolutionized urban transportation would make him an ideal candidate to shake up the federal agency. Trump, however, had never heard of the guy—and that made him a nonstarter.\nWhen Lutnick found out Trump was leaning toward Duffy for the role, he tried to shut the idea down. Making a case against him on the lack of merits wasn’t working—sir, the man has no relevant experience—so Lutnick tried to appeal to the president‑elect’s ego instead, tasking his team with searching through Duffy’s hundreds of television appearances to find any criticism of Trump. It took a while, as Duffy and his wife, Rachel, were unabashed Trump enthusiasts and had been for years. Lutnick’s team had to go back nearly a decade—to the early days of the 2016 Republican presidential primary—to find anything Duffy had said that was remotely negative about Donald Trump.\nLutnick finally found a September 2015 interview in which the then‑congressman had said he didn’t believe Trump was a real conservative and didn’t think he would win the party’s nomination. But even back then, Duffy had praised Trump for “boldly speaking and saying things that the conservative wing wished that their leaders would say.”\nAs weak as Lutnick’s effort to dig up dirt turned out to be, that one stray comment from almost ten years earlier nearly cost Duffy the job. Trump, reconsidering the pick, called Duffy and his wife, Rachel, and they were able to convince the president‑elect that Sean had long since changed his views on Trump’s conservative bona fides. On November 18, Trump made his decision final: “The husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos‑Duffy, a STAR on Fox News, and the father of nine incredible children, Sean knows how important it is for families to be able to travel safely, and with peace of mind.”\nExcerpted from Retribution by Jonathan Karl.

For decades, it was represented by white Democratic Rep. Gene Green. In 2018, with Green retiring, the city’s Latino political class achieved a long-sought dream with the election of Sylvia Garcia, Green’s preferred successor, who became the first Hispanic person to represent a significant swath of Houston in Congress.\n\nGarcia has represented the district ever since, coasting to reelection in each successive cycle. But under the new map, she will be courting a new electorate with a much different demographic makeup, potentially confronting tensions among Democrats’ multiracial base. \n\nFor the last two election cycles, Hispanics have made up 63% of the eligible voting population in Garcia’s 29th District; under the new lines, they are just 43%. Meanwhile, the Black eligible voting population — citizens who are old enough to vote — grew from 18% under the previous map to 33% of the district.\n\nLatino Democrats in Houston are now grappling with the consequences of a Republican map that leaves the party with precious few opportunities. Strategists say the map has threatened Latino political power and potentially pits different parts of Democrats’ multiracial coalition against each other for a diminishing number of congressional seats — leaving Democrats of color in an awkward spot, even as Garcia and her primary opponents vow to build campaigns that resonate with voters across racial lines.\n\nGarcia, who is Mexican American, has already drawn two Black primary challengers, including former state Rep. Jarvis Johnson. And it comes at a time as the party nationally — and especially in Texas — is trying to win back the growing number of Latino voters who have pulled the lever for Republicans and President Donald Trump.\n\n“When you look at the new numbers, you have to realize that the largest voting bloc in the new 29, for the Democratic Party, is going to be the Black vote,” said Johnson. “And I think it’s important that my community has a voice.”\n\nGarcia has won citywide before, and strategists say she has high name identification and should expect to receive significant resources from Latino groups in Washington. For her part, she said she plans to campaign vigorously in her new territory to build a winning multiracial coalition, and rejects the notion that Black and brown voters will be factionalized.\n\nBut some Democrats worry about the potential for divisiveness, or about what happens after Garcia, 75, eventually retires. The only majority-Latino district left in Houston is the 9th Congressional District, where GOP map-drawers paired typically lower-turnout Latino precincts with higher-turnout white areas in Harris and Liberty counties to craft a Republican-leaning seat. No prominent Democrats have stepped forward to run yet; the top candidates in the Republican primary are state Rep. Briscoe Cain and former Harris County Judge candidate Alexandra del Moral Mealer, who is Latina.\n\n“There really is that fear that there will be no Latino representation from a Latino-[plurality] county that’s the third-largest county in America,” said Jaime Mercado, a Houston Democratic strategist.\n\nInside the new district\n\nThe new 29th District looks a lot like Houston, with an eligible voting population that is 43% Hispanic, 33% Black, 18% white and 4% Asian. Only one-third of voters in Garcia’s current district will still see her on the ballot come the March primary.\n\n“That’s truly a coalition district,” said Garcia, who has represented Houstonians as city controller, Harris County commissioner and state senator before her congressional career. \n“That’s what I put together to win a citywide campaign in the city of Houston, before we were even 20% of the Houston population. I’ve put coalitions together a number of times for different causes and campaigns, so this will just be another one.”\n\nIn upending the district’s demographics, Republicans moved the eastern part of Houston and Harris County — including heavily Latino cities like Galena Park and Jacinto City — out of the 29th District. To offset the population loss, the district took in over 200,000 voters from what is currently Congressional District 18, a bastion of Black political power. Historically Black neighborhoods like Acres Homes and Independence Heights have been added to District 29. (Voters in those neighborhoods can still vote in this year’s special election to fill out the remainder of former Rep. Sylvester Turner’s term representing Texas’ 18th District.) \n\nThe new 29th District retains Hispanic precincts in neighborhoods like Lindale Park, Melrose Park and Greenspoint. And it adds more affluent neighborhoods with lots of younger, more progressive voters, like Garden Oaks, Oak Forest and Shepherd Park Plaza.\n\nThough Latino voters are still the largest group, the raw numbers can be deceptive, particularly in Democratic primaries. Houston’s Latino population skews young, while voters who participate in primaries are typically older. Latino voters are also ideologically and culturally diverse. And Mercado said there’s less of a muscle memory with voting.\n\n“[For] African Americans, voting is something that’s completely different,” Mercado said. “It’s cultural. African Americans are a generation removed from the civil rights movement … It’s just different than any other cultures. And too often people look at Latinos and are like, ‘Well, why don’t you vote like the other people of color?’” \n\nIn Houston, like the rest of Texas, Democratic organizers have typically prioritized Black communities and voters because they turn out at much higher rates than Latinos and vote more reliably for Democrats. In the city of Houston, for example, VoteHub estimated that Vice President Kamala Harris won 89% of Black voters compared to about 61% of Hispanic voters in 2024.\n\nIn the new 29th Congressional District, strategists agreed with Johnson that in a low-turnout midterm election — in which the most engaged voters typically play an outsized role — Black voters are likely to outnumber Hispanic voters in the Democratic primary.\n\nJohnson said the new makeup of the district factored into his decision to run. He said he has no policy disagreements with Garcia, but believes he could better address Black voters’ concerns and turn out the district’s voters in a general election, when Democrats will need every vote they can get to win statewide races.\n\n“If we allow this type of bait and switch, and people focusing on the Black and Brown, we’ll miss it’s Republican versus Democrat,” Johnson said. \n\nBut he said the reality of the district’s demographics — and his familiarity with the neighborhoods added to the 29th District, which he has represented in the state legislature and on Houston City Council — means he is better positioned to turn voters out. \n\nUnder the new boundaries, Harris would have won the district by 31 percentage points. But Johnson said all Democrats should be wary of taking Black voters for granted — and that without that population’s participation, Democrats could be in for a surprise loss in November in District 29.\n\n“We have to be clear that the Latino votes have been leaking over the years to the Republican side,” he said. “We can’t count on Congresswoman Garcia being able to pull them back in, because it’s evident she was not able to do that in her old 29th, because the number of votes that she gets historically have been the lowest in the state, in terms of voter turnout.”\n\nOf the eight congressional districts that include parts of Harris County, Garcia’s, the only majority-Hispanic one, had the lowest voter turnout in 2024 — though her district also had the smallest citizen voting age population of any district in the state.\n\nThe primary will create a test for both candidates, and any future Democrat in the area — can they build a multiracial coalition that resonates with every voting bloc among the Democratic base? \n\nBoth candidates said doing so will require focusing on issues that matter to Black, Latino and white voters alike. Garcia said she plans to talk about the Trump administration’s health care cuts and how Republican policies have harmed the Houston economy, which affects everyone.\n\n“It’s also about reminding people that the tariffs are hurting people, the fear of deportation is hurting people, and that these costs will [rise] because of both of them,” she said. “When you’ve got construction workers not coming to work because they’re afraid to work, and then the cost of lumber, because it’s imported, with the tariff is going up — that means it’s going to be harder to build a home, which means the housing crisis continues to grow in Houston.”\n\nThose are issues, Garcia added, “that penetrate a coalition, not just one sector or one neighborhood.”\n\nDynamics of the race\n\nLatino organizers often say that disinvestment is a self-fulfilling prophecy — the more often the party ignores Latino voters in favor of higher-turnout populations, the more depressed Latino turnout becomes.\n\nDemocratic strategists said the new lines offer candidates the opportunity to build much-needed political infrastructure in underserviced neighborhoods. For Latino organizers, that could mean investing in areas now that will bear fruit once Garcia eventually leaves office, perhaps ensuring a Latino successor will follow her.\n\n“A good part of that district — hell, probably around 70% of it — really isn’t worked politically on a regular basis,” said Marc Campos, a Houston Democratic strategist. “Beyond the beltway, toward the end of the northern part of Harris County — Democrats usually don’t spend a whole lot of time doing a lot of political organizing up there.”\n\nCampos said Garcia, as a longtime Harris County elected official, is well-known among the electorate and that polling of Houston voters shows she is well-liked. She should have the resources to get her message out to the voters she did not previously represent, he said, adding that she will likely win heavily with Latinos and do well with high-propensity voters north of the loop. \n\n“There’s a good chunk of Latino precincts she’s represented,” he said. “Granted, they’re not our highest turnout precincts, but whoever turns out, she’ll win by overwhelming margins. She’ll kick ass in the white, progressive parts of what I would call zip code 77018 — Oak Forest, Garden Oaks.”\n\nJohnson, by contrast, says he is better positioned to understand the concerns of voters in the new district because he has already represented much of it in his past roles. And he worries that Black voters in the district — who are the most reliable Democratic voters of any group — will not turn out for a candidate they do not know, to the party’s peril.\n\n“You’re going to find a lot of people, [if] they don’t see a name that they know, they’re going to be confused and go, ‘Wait what?’” Johnson said. “And [they] may skip over or just simply [say] ‘Well, nothing’s there for me.’ And then we’ll again lose a sixth seat, because the issues that are facing this community are not being addressed.”\n\nLike Garcia, Johnson said he wants to build a multiracial coalition by addressing local issues that affect all residents: infrastructure, housing, education and business. And he said his existing familiarity with various neighborhoods means there is no learning curve for him.\n\n“She will have to spend a lot of time working and walking the miles upon miles of road to get to know: where are the areas that flood that we need to address?” Johnson said. “Where are the schools that are in need? Where are the communities that have the highest voting precincts? I don’t need to do any of that. I’ve already done it.” \n\nCampos and Mercado both think Garcia, with the support of national Latino groups, should have no trouble outraising Johnson and building out a well-organized campaign to win. But regardless of what happens in the primary, Democrats said the fact it is happening at all — and any subsequent racial divides unearthed from it — serves to benefit Republicans, who drew the map in the first place. \n\nBeyond Texas’ 29th District, the map has created the potential for another high-profile primary, with age being the lightning rod, in the neighboring 18th Congressional District. Voters under the old map will choose a representative to finish out Turner’s term in November; by March, whomever emerges among a cadre of younger Black candidates could face a primary under the new lines from Rep. Al Green, 78, who was drawn out of his current district.\n\n“I do think that took a lot of forethought from Republicans when they started cutting these districts, whether it be the only Latino having to be running in a district that has historically high African American turnout in primaries, and a potential young, dynamic, next generation leader being forced into a primary with a well-regarded, nationally-known figure in local African American politics,” Mercado said. “I think all that was very intentional.”","summary":"A primary challenge to Rep.

It’s from the Daily Mail. “Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argues for a race-based redistricting.” This was the Supreme Court. They had a hearing. Well, let me just read this. “Liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Wednesday”—that would have been about a week ago from when this podcast is up—“compared efforts to draw congressional districts along racial lines, compared it to the way disabled people were granted easier access to buildings after the Americans with Disabilities Act became law.” That’s quoting her.\n\n“‘The idea of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is that we are responding to current-day manifestations of past and present decisions that disadvantage minorities and make it so that they don’t have equal access to the voting system. Right?’ Jackson said as she questioned a lawyer representing Louisiana voters who argued that the court-ordered creation of a second majority-black district in the state violated the 14th Amendment by prioritizing racial composition in its boundaries. ‘They’re disabled,’ the justice said of minority voters in the state.”\n\nVictor, are blacks disabled? The Supreme Court justice thinks so. \n\nVictor Davis Hanson: Yeah, I don’t know what they mean, but I think a lot of people’s problem with DEI and affirmative action is there’s no time limit on it. And I guess that’s what Brown was trying to say, that once you state that blacks are permanently disabled, as if it’s a physical condition, then you’re going to have permanent set-asides. \n\nBut that was never the point. Even most of the Supreme Court justices who voted for affirmative action to be continued said they felt that in 20 years it would be no longer needed. When you look at undergraduates today and most of the elite universities, they’re proportionate, according to race. If you look at women, they graduate, I think, it’s about 54% of all [Bachelor of Arts] are women. And in law schools and medical schools now, there’s a majority of women students more than men. If you look at the Stanford website, I don’t know how accurate it is, as I said, but it was 9% white males. \n\nSo, as I said before, if you look at per capita income levels in the United States, I think so-called whites are No. 8 or 9 of people who identify, as … you know, [Zohran] Mamdani, Indian Americans areNo. 1. And then a group of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arab Americans, they are higher. \n\nSo, the whole idea of DEI is frozen in amber. It’s stale. It doesn’t adapt to change. There’s other problems with it, but it doesn’t show that class and race are no longer identical. And that you’ve got all these people who are claiming that they’re completely disabled or disadvantaged when … I was looking down at my phone because in the four biggest cities, I think in the United States: New York was Eric Adams was mayor—black. Los Angeles, Karen Bass—black; Chicago, Democratic Brandon Johnson—black; and then, Philadelphia, Cherelle Parker—black. And I could go down to San Diego, Dallas, you name it. And the majority of the biggest cities in the country are black mayors.\n\nAnd so, the point is, did they have racially gerrymandered? No, they didn’t. They didn’t have racially gerrymandered districts. As I understand, it was just a citywide vote. Why do we have them in the House at this late date in the civil rights movement? \n\nAnd, you know, it’s to the disadvantage of black Americans to have these racially created concentrations on the basis of race because when you have two or three black candidates running for Congress in these overwhelmingly black Democratic districts, you get kind of an auction or a competition to see who can be the most radical, the most authentic, the most black. \n\nAnd then when that happens and that person gets elected, that’s the end of their political career. That’s the end of it. Now, they may be speaker like Hakeem Jeffries or Jim Clyburn, third ranking in the party after a number of years. But they’re not going to be elected senator or national candidate. And the only way you can really be—black, white—a national candidate, you have to be a governor or a senator. \n\nKamala Harris ran as a senator. \n\nSo, what they’re doing is they’re taking black politicians and they’re putting them on record with a whole history of easily verifiable written and oral statements. And it’s going to be very hard for them in a state race where the blacks are only 10% or 15% or 20% of the population to have a so-called black radical or firebrand. \n\nThat’s why Barack Obama, the best thing that ever happened to him, he lost that congressional race. I think it was to Bobby Rush. He was not considered an authentic black radical like his opponent was in that congressional race, who was a former Black Panther. And that liberated Obama to go appeal, at least superficially, as a moderate. And he was elected to a statewide race. \n\nThat explains why there’s a larger percentage of blacks in the House than the Senate, because they have these specially carved out districts, which basically make it very hard for them to run for the Senate. So, I don’t know why Ketanji Brown, who I think—nothing to do with their race—but what she’s said and written, she is the weakest Supreme Court justice we’ve had in a generation. \n\nShe’s way out of her league. She was the one that in the confirmation could not define, remember, a male or female. And it’s sad, but she’s way out of her depth. And to say that blacks are disabled, it makes no sense. And so, if you’re just going to keep on saying that or assuming that, it was very revealing because I think she tried, she basically summed up a lot of the left-wing black leadership’s assumptions about blacks: that they are disabled. And I don’t think most people feel that’s true. \n\nBut in the reparations, I guess the California Legislature and Gavin Newsom does, because he just passed the second phase of reparations. We’re anywhere from $20 to $50 billion short on the budget each year. We’re going to have to make massive cuts.\n\nAnd he’s now basically saying to the state, “I want to take 5% of the resident population, and I want to give them money for something that happened, about eight to nine generations ago, somewhere else other than the California state, which was a state during the Civil War. But it was a free state that fought the Confederacy and was opposed to slavery and did not ever allow it within its confines. And I want to give money to African Americans, but I don’t know how to define them. I don’t know if you’re one-third or one-fourth or one-eighth or one-fifth or two-fifths or three-fifths, whether you qualify. \n\n“I do not know how long you have to have lived in California. Did you hear about reparations and moved from Utah and therefore you count? We have no idea how to define a long-standing African American. We don’t know who qualifies. Does Willie Brown, the former mayor? Does Kamala Harris, who’s half Indian?”\n\nIt’s when you get into that racial realm of privilege and bias and prejudice as the Old South determined, you endure a labyrinth because ultimately you have to have rules. \n\nAnd once you make the rules, they’re ridiculous. Even the Third Reich did not know how to define Jewish people. Was it one-quarter, one-fifth? And so, they had all of these secret little genealogists that were working with the Nazi hierarchy, because every once in a while, a top Nazi’s rival for power or influence with the Hitler inner circle, the accusation would go, “His grandmother was Jewish, his wife is half Jewish,” and then they would go hire a genealogist and go to [Hermann] Goring or somebody and try to get an exemption. \n\nBut it was a ridiculous situation. Why would you have to have a yellow star to identify a Jew if, according to your ideology, they were so inferior and different that you could spot them a mile away? You wouldn’t have to have. And the answer was they had to put a star because they looked just like us. And they talked just like us in Western Europe. \n\nAnd many of them were fully assimilated, were not observant Jews. \n\nFowler: They fought, died in World War I alongside us. \n\nHanson: Yes, that’s another story. The Iron Crosses at Auschwitz that were in a big box where people wore them, thinking that they would be given exemptions because they had been heroic German soldiers in World War I.

A Candidate Who Also Lost in 2024 Might Actually Have Some Answers.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFormer House Rep. Cori Bush thinks she knows why Democrats lost last year, and how they can win in 2028. Sure, the former Squad member also lost last year—she got primaried by another Democrat in August, after the American Israel Public Affairs Committee threw at least $12 million behind her opponent because she had been an outspoken critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza. But when I caught up with her recently, I started to think that maybe she was slightly ahead of her time when she got primaried, and that the national political moment has since changed in a way that favors candidates like her.\n\nLet’s take a trip back to August 2024: There was still plentiful optimism about the likelihood of a Kamala Harris win. Democrats were heartened by signs of economic recovery in the years after COVID had shut everything down—but while the fundamental indicators pointed to a healthy economy, the party seemed to sorely underestimate the discontent that inflation was sowing among the electorate.\n\nBack then, the threat of a second Donald Trump presidency remained for many a somewhat abstract possibility. Elon Musk hadn’t yet run through the federal government with a chain saw; we hadn’t yet experienced Trump’s tariffs; we hadn’t yet seen how Trump would demolish democratic norms left and right and deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities. Republicans hadn’t yet passed a bill that cuts Medicaid for 15 million Americans over the next decade and basically writes Immigration and Customs Enforcement a blank check to become a military force of its own.\n\nToday there appears to be more of an appetite among the Democratic base for someone who prioritizes fighting back over keeping the party establishment happy. Angry voters are showing up at town halls, demanding that Democrats show more of a spine. In an NBC News poll from March, only 27 percent of registered voters said they have a positive view of the Democratic Party, while 65 percent indicated they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions and sacrifice bipartisanship. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour seemed to strike a chord, bringing out upward of 30,000 attendees at each stop.\n\nBush might have lost by about 5 percentage points in 2024, but the political climate has since shifted in a way that’s more favorable to someone like her, who’s willing to go out on a limb for her beliefs. “We’ve heard it over and over again: People are looking for a fighter,” Bush told me as we sat in a busy Manhattan hotel lobby, on the heels of her comeback-bid announcement.\n\nAnd from the vantage point of late 2025, it’s clear that many of her positions—which were criticized at the time for being too extreme—have aged well.\n\nIn 2021, while just a freshman lawmaker, when the federal eviction moratorium was set to expire, Bush staged a sit-in on the steps of the Capitol to push the White House to extend it. Having experienced homelessness herself three times in the past, Bush knew how high the stakes were for her constituents. With days left until the moratorium would be lifted, she decided to set up camp outside the Capitol, with only a sleeping bag and a lawn chair, in protest, not knowing whether she’d be successful in compelling the Biden administration to intervene. “I just believed that I had to do something, and in order to do something,” Bush said, “I knew that we had to make enough noise to where people paid attention.”\n\nOver the course of three days, Bush’s protest galvanized her fellow progressive lawmakers and even pulled in former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all piling on to urge the administration to extend the moratorium via executive order. By Day 3, the White House relented, and the moratorium was extended—though the Supreme Court would later rule that it was unlawful. Nevertheless, Bush’s protest at least temporarily staved off hundreds of thousands of Americans from being removed from their homes.\n\nTwo years later, just weeks after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Bush was one of only a few legislators calling for a ceasefire. In a speech delivered on Oct. 16, she mourned the loss of life on both sides and decried the Israeli bombing of Gaza. “Let me be clear,” she said at the time. “The collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza is a war crime.” Bush’s stance drew the ire of AIPAC—and ultimately cost Bush her seat.\n\nBut two years after that, U.S. public opinion on Gaza has shifted in Bush’s direction. As Israeli forces bombed numerous hospitals, blocked aid deliveries, and killed a record number of journalists, the war became increasingly unpopular. A Gallup poll conducted in July 2025 found that only 32 percent of Americans approved of Israel’s actions in Gaza—a 10 percent drop from September 2024. Democrats in particular have changed their minds. In 2023, according to New York Times polling, 34 percent of Democrats sympathized with Israel and 31 percent with Palestinians. Two years later, only 13 percent said they sympathized with Israel, and 54 percent said they sided with Palestinians.\n\nWhile some of Bush’s boldest positions have aged well, many of the supposedly safe, focus group–tested, consultant-driven decisions that establishment Democrats made in 2024 have not. Nearly a full year after Trump beat Harris, the Democratic Party’s approval rating has hit alarming lows, and voters are fleeing the party. Democratic leaders have spent months casting around in the wilderness, grasping for a strategy to turn things around.\n\nOne narrative about why Democrats lost is that they swung too far left on certain issues that alienated the majority of voters. Many centrists have rallied around the argument that Democrats listened too much to identity-focused special interest groups.\n\nBush disagrees with this read of the situation: She says the party is ignoring groups that are actually in touch with local communities—the kinds she encountered as an activist during the 2014 Ferguson protests, organizations with a much deeper and clearer understanding of how voters are feeling and what issues they’re facing. “If they’re not a big enough named group or a well-funded group, then we don’t listen to those folks,” she said.\n\nIf Democrats had been more in touch with the right kinds of community groups in 2024, Bush suggests, they would have known to put more of an emphasis on economic issues. “Democrats have got to turn the focus and start to appreciate those that are all around this country, that are doing the nitty-gritty day-to-day work, that don’t have all the money,” Bush said. “The ones that the community trusts.”\n\nThat’s one place where Bush and the more consultant-driven members of her party can agree: The way forward for Democrats is to increasingly focus on the kitchen-table issues that affect voters’ quality of life. She said they need to be able to clearly convey to voters: “We care about making sure you have health care, not just coverage, but that we are lowering costs. We care that your Social Security is safe. We care that the price of groceries are going down. We care about what’s happening to you and your business.”\n\nBut although strategist-driven, poll-tested thinking might recommend robotically maintaining a focus on kitchen-table issues to the exclusion of everything else—some research firms, for instance, have advised Democrats not to talk about Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington—Bush stresses that Democrats need candidates who can engage voters on economic issues while also speaking out about their authentic beliefs.\n\nShe pointed to Zohran Mamdani as an example of someone who does both well. Mamdani, who pulled off a shocking upset in New York City’s mayoral primary, campaigned as a democratic socialist on policies like free buses, universal child care, and affordable housing. His positions garnered criticism for being extreme, but voters were drawn to his conviction. “One thing we’ve heard people say: ‘Oh, that’s a politician.’ They expect not to trust you. They expect that, ‘most likely, they’re going to stab me in the back or going to go in the next room and saying something different,’ ” Bush said. “People don’t believe that about Mamdani. People don’t believe he’s going to be someone else in a different room.”\n\nThis was a contrast to how voters received Harris, who took some further-left positions in 2016 and 2020 to help make herself stand out. During the 2020 Democratic primaries, for example, presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke proclaimed, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” In response, Harris said she supported a mandatory buyback program of military-style assault weapons. When she pivoted to more centrist positions in 2024, she struggled to explain the shift and what she really believed, coming off as inauthentic and scripted.\n\nTo breed a generation of more-authentic candidates, Bush proposes that the party find a way to support people who want to run for office without taking money from groups like AIPAC. In November 2023, when progressives went to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for support after AIPAC committed to spend $100 million to boost pro-Israel candidates and push out those who were insufficiently deferential to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they didn’t get much beyond lukewarm endorsements. “How do we support those that want to say, “Hey, I don’t want to take this money anymore”? What do you have set up for those folks? That’s something Democrats need to work on,” she said.\n\nWhile Democrats need stronger messaging, Bush notes, it’s ultimately not enough to pick carefully poll-tested words to placate voters. They need to be able to feel the impact of what Democrats are doing for them.\n\nIt will certainly be tough to make voters feel as if Democrats are responsible for making their lives better when the party lacks control of the House or Senate and currently has little leverage to push through legislation. But Bush stresses that that’s the kind of thing that stays with people.\n\nYears after the eviction moratorium, Bush says, strangers still approach her on the street and thank her for it. “I have people that will come up to me: ‘Are you Cori Bush?’ ” she said. “ ‘I am in my home because of what you did on the steps that time.’ ” One person who approached her said they were on the brink of losing their housing in 2021—and that they would have lost custody of their children along with it. “And they said, ‘I have my kids today because of what you did,’ ” Bush said. “Those are the kinds of stories that the Democrats need right now.”\n\nIn the months following her primary loss last year, Bush tells me, she was unsure what her next move would be. But in March, as she was back in Missouri, picking up a few things from a local gas station, she felt someone watching her. Confused, she looked over her shoulder and spotted a man in a motorized wheelchair circling the aisle she was standing in, over and over again. Eventually, he came up to her. “Are you Cori Bush?” he asked. Bush said yes, to which he responded, “You want to run again, right?”\n\nBush was honest, telling the man she was still figuring out what her future could look like. “You better run again, because this is some bull,” the man insisted.\n\nAfter that, Bush says, more and more of her old constituents stopped her in the streets to ask if she would be running for her old seat. Some even admitted they felt they had voted wrong last year, overly influenced by AIPAC’s negative ads about her. “It has been just a tremendous encouragement to have so many people saying, ‘We need you. We need you back. We need our fighter.’ ”","summary":"Some of her boldest positions have aged well.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/10/democrats-cori-bush-trump-mamdani-2026-2028.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/07a7fc88-7b13-4157-9b58-e288e7731ada.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 09:40:00","author":"Shirin Ali","authors":["Shirin Ali"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":371827350,"title":"Amid fundraising woes and rumors of a Democrat mutiny against him, John Fetterman slams Kamala Harris for calling Trump a ‘fascist’","text":"Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has argued that his party’s 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris “lost the plot” when she called President Donald Trump a “fascist” during last year’s race.\n\nSpeaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News on Wednesday, Fetterman accused his fellow Democrats of doubling down on a losing strategy by continuing to compare Trump to Adolf Hitler – as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker did last week – by asking: “What is going on? Why have they chosen that path when it did not succeed the first time?”\n\n“I don’t know why, and I have always refused to say that,” he said. “When Vice President Harris referred to President Trump as a ‘fascist’, I knew absolutely we lost the plot at that point. \n\n“If you call the president or someone like a fascist, you are effectively calling the people who are going to vote for him [the same thing] and then they must be fascist too… or they support fascism and those things. And that is just not true.\n\n“I happen to know and love a lot of people that voted for the president and they are not fascist, they are not Nazis, they’re not trying to destroy the Constitution and all those things. They just happen to have different priorities and they love our country in the same ways that Democrats do as well.”\n\nThe senator made a similar point to Manu Raju on CNN’s Inside Politics last month when he said of Trump: “You don’t ever compare anyone to Hitler. This is not an autocrat. This is a product of a democratic election.”\n\nIn his Hannity interview, Fetterman went on to argue that such inflammatory rhetoric leads to incidents like the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nHarris indeed answered at a CNN town hall event last year, when asked by moderator Anderson Cooper whether she considered Trump a “fascist”: “Yes, I do. Yes, I do.” Later at the same event, the Democrat said her rival “admires dictators” and “is a fascist.”\n\nHarris also cited comments made to The New York Times by the president’s own former chief of staff, retired U.S. Marine Corps general John F Kelly, who alleged that Trump had repeatedly complained that U.S. military leaders were not as loyal to him as Nazi generals had been to Hitler.\n\nThat said, Trump also called Harris a “fascist” during the campaign – on so many occasions, in fact, that CNN was able to compile them into a montage.\n\nDemocrats have reportedly grown increasingly concerned about Fetterman’s lean to the right, which has led him to seek common ground with the president’s MAGA movement by joining Truth Social, approving several of Trump’s more controversial cabinet nominees, and attending his inauguration.\n\nAxios reported last week that top Democrats are planning to primary Fetterman in 2028 to ensure they have someone more aligned with their priorities in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state every election year.\n\nReps. Brendan Boyle, Chris Deluzio, and former Rep. Conor Lamb were all named as possible challengers, with Fetterman responding angrily to the story by accusing its authors of pursuing “clickbait.”\n\nThe senator, who has reportedly had health issues, has yet to announce his re-election bid definitively, and he allegedly does not care for life in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe has also struggled to drum up campaign fundraising of late, reporting a haul of just under $330,000 in the third quarter of the year. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which he has spent more than he has raised, according to The Pennsylvania Capital-Star.\n\nThe total was the lowest amount Fetterman has brought in since February 2021, when he first announced his candidacy for office. This journey concluded with him beating TV medic Dr Mehmet Oz, who went on to become Trump’s administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released on October 1 showed Fetterman with an 8-point net job approval rating, an improvement from its January survey in which the senator was found to have a 3-point rating.\n\nHowever, his overall approval rating is higher among Republicans (41 points) than it is with Democrats (21 points). In January, he held a 70-point net approval rating with his own party and a 59-point rating with the opposition.","summary":"Pennsylvania Sen.

Josh Shapiro heading to Virginia to campaign for Spanberger","text":"Closing in on Election Day, a potential 2028 presidential candidate will be in Virginia to campaign for Democratic governor hopeful Abigail Spanberger. CBS News has learned that Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro will campaign with Spanberger in the Hampton Roads area on Sunday as the race to lead Virginia reaches its final days.Shapiro, who is running for re-election to his own office in 2026, has become nationally known for being able to win his tensely divided state. Shapiro and Spanberger — who during her time in Congress repeatedly won a competitive House district — both represent the more moderate part of the Democratic Party at a time when there are clear tensions between centrist-minded politicians and progressive figures on the left about the future. \"Here in Virginia we know the stakes of this election. and in fact, we know all the challenges coming at us, from Washington, from bad policies, but what we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,\" Spanberger said at a rally this week. While Shapiro was a potential running mate option for Vice Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, he is now among a group of Democratic governors emphasizing accomplishments and executive leadership at a time when Democrats are looking to the future amid fatigue with Washington-centric rhetoric. In the race to succeed Virginia's Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having an advantage over Virginia GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close, and Spanberger has struggled as of late to navigate the backlash to violent text messages, made public recently, that were sent several years ago by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race. Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, where he wrote in the past about a hypothetical shooting of a man who was a Virginia House Republican leader. But Jones has remained the Democratic candidate on the ballot in the Nov. 4 election, a reality that has helped unite Republicans messaging in Virginia after struggling to coalesce around a campaign approach for much of this year. Yet while the controversy could cost Jones the race for attorney general, Democrats remain hopeful about winning back the governor's office in Virginia. President Trump has lost Virginia in the last three presidential elections, and has also so far been unwilling to clearly endorse or campaign for Earle-Sears despite the lieutenant governor's conservative approach. At the same time, Spanberger is getting support from former Democratic President Barack Obama, who is set to campaign with her the Saturday before election day and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, another potential 2028 presidential candidate, who rallied with her in Charlottesville earlier this week. Earle-Sears however has not been getting the same kind of major help on the right. The president has not rallied for her so far this year, but her campaign did move on Monday to publicize comments where Mr. Trump said he thinks \"the Republican candidate is very good and I think she should win,\" before explaining he hasn't \"been too much involved in Virginia.\" The absence has been especially stark considering Mr. Trump has already given what he described as his \"complete and total endorsement\" on social media to the GOP candidates for New Jersey governor and Virginia attorney general who are also on this fall's Nov. 4 ballot. Mr. Trump offered a measure of support that could benefit Earle-Sears on Wednesday, writing on social media that voting Republican in Virginia or New Jersey— including in the race for governor — \"MEANS A DRASTIC DROP IN ENERGY PRICES AND ENERGY COSTS.\" Yet he didn't name Earle-Sears or explicitly endorse her.Talking to CBS News last week, Earle-Sears demurred on questions about Trump and his role, or lack thereof, in her race to that point. \"I'm not going to talk about when the President and I speak. I've spoken with the President, I've visited him in the Oval Office, which folks for me, as an immigrant to this great country, you just don't see yourself being in the Oval Office. You see it on television and you say to yourself 'my god what a great country that this is'\" Earle-Sears said.","summary":"Early voting is already underway in the Virginia governor's race where voters will pick a replacement for  Republican Gov.

Gavin Newsom said in a livestream with former President Obama on Wednesday. More than 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned as of Wednesday, with votes from Democrats outpacing ballots from Republicans and Californians registered as not having a party preference, according to a ballot tracker run by Democratic strategist Paul Mitchell. Mitchell is deeply involved in the Democratic effort, and drafted the proposed congressional districts on the Nov. 4 special election ballot. That's roughly the same number of ballots returned by this time in the White House contest between then-Vice President Kamala Harris and then-former President Trump in 2024, notable because turnout during presidential elections is higher than in other years. About a million more ballots had been turned in by this point in the unsuccessful 2021 attempt to recall Newsom, but that was during COVID. This year's turnout is also especially significant because Proposition 50 is about the esoteric topic of redistricting. Redrawing congressional districts is usually a once-a-decade process that takes place after the U.S. census to account for population shifts. California's 52 congressional districts currently are crafted by a voter-approved independent commission, but Newsom and other California Democrats decided to ask voters to allow a rare mid-decade partisan gerrymandering to blunt Trump's efforts in GOP-led states to boost his party's numbers in the House. Obama, who has endorsed Proposition 50 and stars in a television ad supporting the effort, on Wednesday said the ballot measure will affect the entire country. “There’s a broader principle at stake that has to do with whether or not our democracy can be manipulated by those who are already in power to entrench themselves further,” Obama said. “Or, whether we're going to have a system that allows the people to decide who's going to represent them.” About 51% of the ballots that have been returned to date are from registered Democrats, while 28% are from registered Republicans and 21% are from voters who do not express a party preference. It's unknown how these voters cast their ballots, but the Democratic advantage appears to give an edge to supporters of Proposition 50, which needs to be passed by a simple majority to be enacted. About 19.6 million ballots — roughly 85% of those mailed to California voters — are outstanding, though not all are expected to be returned. The current trend of returned ballots at this point shows Democrats having a small edge over Republicans compared with their share of the California electorate. According to the latest state voter registration report, Democrats account for 45% of California's registered voters, while Republicans total 25% and \"no party preference\" voters make up 23%. Californians belonging to other parties make up the remainder. Mitchell added that another interesting data point is that the mail ballots continue to flow in. \"Usually you see a lull after the first wave — if you don't mail in your ballot in the first week, it's going to be sitting on the counter for a while,\" Mitchell said. But ballots continue to arrive, possibly encouraged by the \"No Kings\" protests on Saturday, he said. A spokesperson for the pro-Proposition 50 campaign said they are taking nothing for granted. “With millions of ballots still to be cast, we will keep pushing to make sure every Californian understands what’s at stake and turns out to vote yes on Nov. 4th to stop Trump’s power grab,” said spokesperson Hannah Milgrom. Some Republican leaders have expressed concerns that the GOP early vote may be suppressed by Trump's past criticism about mail balloting, inaccuracies in the voter guide sent to the state's 23 million voters and conspiracy theories about the ballot envelope design. \"While ballot initiatives are nonpartisan, many Republicans tend to hold on to their ballots until in-person voting begins,\" said Ellie Hockenbury, an advisor to the \"No on Prop 50 — Stop Sacramento's Power Grab\" campaign committee. \"As this next phase starts — and with nearly two weeks until Election Day — we expect already high turnout to continue rising to defeat Proposition 50 and stop Gavin Newsom’s partisan power grab.\" Amy Thoma, a spokesperson for the two other major groups opposing the proposition, said the data show that the voters who have returned ballots so far are not representative of the California electorate. \"Special elections tend to be more partisan, older and whiter than general elections, which is one of the reasons we’ve been concerned about the speed with which the politicians pushed this through,\" she said.","summary":"Over 3 million mail ballots have been returned in the special election about redrawing congressional districts.

But Rogan consistently falls for fake images and videos online, even after they’ve been widely debunked. The latest example? Rogan fell for another fake tweet on Wednesday that was supposedly from President Donald Trump.\n\nRogan’s latest episode had guests Francis Foster and Konstantin Kisin, both conservative British political commentators, and the three men talked about the No Kings protests that happened Oct. 18. The demonstrations saw millions of people take to the streets in opposition to Trump, and Rogan tried to belittle the efforts, insisting that people were being paid to be there and those who weren’t being paid were just “geriatrics.”\n\nRogan also claimed that if the protests were being allowed to happen at all that must be evidence Trump couldn’t possibly be a king. And that’s when he promoted the fake tweet he saw—a post made to look like it was from the president on Truth Social.\n\n“No, he didn’t send the troops to stop the protests,” said Rogan. “In fact, he congratulated them on doing a great job and he said I’m still your president. Tweet’s fucking hilarious. It’s very funny.” One of Rogan’s guest chimed in to say, “yeah, I saw that,” with a laugh.\n\nRogan told his producer to pull up the tweet, though it seemed clear he was having trouble tracking it down. “Try Truth Social,” Rogan told his producer, who was just off-screen. “You can probably find an image of it since it was posted everywhere.”\n\nThe fake tweet Rogan seemed to be talking about reads, “A HUGE THANK YOU to all the ‘No Kings’ protesters yesterday! I was very concerned a king was trying to take my place, but thanks to your tireless efforts, I am STILL YOUR PRESIDENT! Great job all!!!” But there’s nothing about it that’s real.\n\nThe producer never did seem to find the post, probably because he didn’t want to tell Rogan it was fake. It’s not even a recent fake tweet. It first started circulating around the first No Kings day on June 14. The screenshot went viral back in June on platforms like X and Instagram. As the Daily Beast notes, the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. shared the fake tweet but acknowledged it was fake.\n\nFox Business host Maria Bartiromo shared the fake post in June as well, though she didn’t know it wasn’t real. The post seems to have circulated again over the weekend, though Gizmodo couldn’t find any example that went particularly viral of late.\n\nRogan droned on and on about the protests during his show and claimed they were identical to what happened with Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign. The podcast host insisted that the Harris campaign “filled up stadiums” with people who were paid to be there, a claim with no basis in fact. Rogan said that it “became a job” for the people at Harris rallies and that “should not be legal” because it’s “deception.”\n\nIncredibly, Trump’s actual commentary on the No Kings protests is somehow more aggressive than the fake version Rogan highlighted Wednesday. In reality, Trump shared an AI video on Truth Social showing himself flying a fighter jet and dumping literal shit on protesters.\n\nRogan is not a particularly bright man. But, again, he has an enormous audience in the millions. And he’s always falling for fake shit, whether it’s AI videos of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz or tweets about “Jewish tunnels,” sourced to fake accounts with characters like Dick Stroker.\n\nWe’re just not going to make it as a country, are we?","summary":"Rogan is not a bright man.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogan-fake-trump-truth-social-2000675786","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/joe-rogan-oct-22-2025-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 00:22:22","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":371708526,"title":"Jeff Daniels slams Trump's 'decency' after performing 'No Kings' song on MSNBC","text":"Actor Jeff Daniels performed a song inspired by the \"No Kings\" protests live on MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House\" Tuesday. \"When we interviewed Joan Baez for 'The Best People' podcast, we asked her what was different about the movements in the 60s,\" host Nicolle Wallace said. \"She said, ‘Well, lots of things.

And they’ll get tired of it, and they’ll vote for change.' \n\nOn Wallace's podcast in July, Daniels ripped the GOP and his home state of Michigan for voting for Trump. \n\nHe also called the president a 'snake oil salesman' and expressed his desire for Trump voters to lose their money.\n\nThe actor said that Kamala Harris would have been a better choice for president because she would have lead the country like Abraham Lincoln.","summary":"Jeff Daniels performed the cringeworthy ditty in support of Saturday's 'No Kings' protests across the country.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15216915/jeff-daniels-song-msnbc-nicolle-wallace-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/22/17/103221075-0-image-m-7_1761152257510.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 21:11:12","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":371708788,"title":"9 Most Ridiculous Displays Seen at the No Kings Protests","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters Signup \n\n BREITBARTThis Video Title Has Been Overridden By Editorial Staff And Should Be Used Instead Of The Original\n\n BREITBART\n\nGraham Platner\nNo Kings Protests\nGaza Peace Deal\nSchumer Shutdown\nICE Crackdowns\n\n9 Most Ridiculous Displays Seen at the No Kings Protests\n\n Matthew Perdie / Breitbart News\n\nHannah Knudsen22 Oct 2025 \n\nDonald Trump\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\n BREITBART \n This Video Title Has Been Overridden By Editorial Staff And Should Be Used Instead Of The Original \n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nTrump Administration Significantly Ups Sanctions on Russia\nReport: Trans Americans to Flee Country Due to 'Most Anti-LGBTQ+ President'\nMarlow: Trans Americans Threaten to Leave Trump Voters Say I Voted for This\nNFL Rejects Calls to Drop Bad Bunny from Super Bowl Halftime Show\nCurtis Sliwa Meltsdown on Radio Interview After Being Told He Will 'Lose'\nManchester Pride Begins Liquidation as Drag Queens and Artists Revolt\nPoll: 4 in 10 Say Illegal Immigrants Who Haven't Committed Crimes Should St\nMurphy: Trump White House Ballroom Construction 'Absolutely Illegal'\nJames Woods Roasts Hillary Clinton's White House Renovation Screed\nGavin Newsom Rocked by Poll Showing He's Losing to Kamala Harris\n\nFROM THE HOMEPAGE\n\nTrump Administration Significantly Ups Sanctions on Russia in Push for Ceasefire in Ukraine\nTrump’s War Against Narco-Terrorists at Sea Expands to Pacific Ocean\nBreitbart Business Digest: The Tariff Inflation Scare Is Dead\nHHS: Illegal Alien Child Rapist Received Thousands in Taxpayer-Funded Medicaid Benefits\nLate-Term Abortion Clinic Expected to Open in New Jersey\nCurtis Sliwa Melts Down on Radio Interview After Being Told He Will ‘Lose Badly’\nDHS Rebukes California Democrats’ Plan to Launch ‘ICE Tracker’ to Dox Immigration Agents\nGavin Newsom Rocked by Poll Showing Him Losing Dem.

Since the budgetary stalemate is creeping toward the record set under the last Donald Trump presidency, the Vermont independent was free to Monday morning quarterback nearly a year after Election Day.\n\nSanders shared his theories with conservative comedian, conspiracy theorist and podcaster Tim Dillon. The internet personality, who couches his right-wing leanings in layer upon layer of too-online irony, broached the subject of the 2024 election during a chat about Sanders’ book, “Fight Oligarchy.” Dillon wondered about a lack of “transparency” from the Democratic Party in selecting Harris to run.\n\n“Why is there no primary, a quick one even, after [Joe Biden] is judged unfit to run? Why is there no transparency there?” he said. “That’s a huge problem, and I think it delivered — I mean, I know people blame five podcasters, but I think that process helped deliver the country.”\n\nSanders didn’t follow Dillon’s reasoning, pointing out that Harris is an “incredibly focused, intelligent person” and touting his own support of her campaign.

Ingrassia is the latest. - USA Today","text":"President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, Paul Ingrassia, withdrew from his Senate confirmation fight following reports that he'd sent a series of racist and antisemitic texts.\n\nRepublican senators said they wouldn't back the 30-year-old lawyer, as attention over the reported texts reached fever pitch. But Ingrassia is far from alone in his experience, now joining a growing list of former Trump nominees who have bowed out of the running for various agency leadership roles. Several of these occurred after reports of offensive comments and behaviors cost them Republican support.\n\nThis year alone, 49 Trump nominees have had their nominations withdrawn, according to Library of Congress data.\n\nMultiple Republican senators said in recent days they wouldn't support Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an ethics division that protects federal workers from whistleblower retaliation. While the Republicans' move was a rare split with the president, it's not the first time GOP lawmakers have resisted one of Trump's nominees.\n\nThe first was former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, who withdrew his nomination to become Trump's attorney general before the president took office, amid allegations of sexual misconduct. In the eight days between Trump announcing Gaetz as his pick and the former representative's withdrawal in November 2024, Republicans spoke up, saying they would not be willing to support Gaetz's bid to become the country's top law enforcement official.\n\nAnother recent Trump nominee to back out was EJ Antoni, a conservative economist who was picked to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the president fired the agency's head and accused her without evidence of manipulating the bureau's figures. The Trump administration withdrew its nomination of Antoni Sep. 30 after losing Republican support.\n\nHe came under intense scrutiny over his qualifications, and also attracted Democratic condemnation after reports that he was at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riots and made derogatory comments on social media about former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn May, Trump announced he was pulling Ed Martin's nomination for U.S. attorney for Washington, DC, in the face of Republican opposition over his support for Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nA few months prior, in March, Trump withdrew his nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, David Weldon, who has a history of vaccine skepticism and has pushed a debunked link between the measles vaccine and autism. A source familiar with the discussions told USA TODAY that Trump pulled the nomination because Weldon did not have the votes to be confirmed.\n\nTrump abruptly reversed his pick for the next U.S. surgeon general on March 13, tapping a physician and wellness advocate who is close to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the role. He made the announcement just one day before the scheduled Senate confirmation hearing for his first pick, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat.\n\nSeveral nominees who have faced intense controversy have made it over the finish line. Most prominently is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed in January despite allegations of sexual assault, public drinking and intoxication and abusive treatment of women.\n\nThe Senate also confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee Health and Human Services despite Republican concerns over his stance on vaccinations.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

Hostin said that she once brought her son into the police station to ensure that they would not “harass” him if their neighbors reported him to authorities.\n\n“As a mother of black children, I know that black boys are not given the presumption of innocence and the presumption of youth,” Hostin said. “She’s calling the police and saying they’re trying to steal her car and they’re 11 years old, they don’t know how to drive. And so for me, what was interesting was I have had to be in the position where I have gone to my local police department because I know my son is going to be training for the Junior Olympics running around the neighborhood in an all white neighborhood.”\n\n“And I have brought him to the police and said, ‘he belongs to me. This is my son. Do not harass him. Do not stop him.’ So she was doing what so many black mothers do and she was killed for protecting her child,” Hostin continued. (RELATED: Sunny Hostin Complains About Being Called A Racist On Social Media)\n\nHostin has repeatedly accused Republicans of being racist against black and Hispanic people. In November 2021, Hostin asserted that white women voted for Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin so they could pretend slavery never happened.\n\nThe co-host also alleged that Republicans would never vote for Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott as the 2024 presidential nominee because the party has a “real racism problem.” She also accused former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley of hiding her Indian heritage by using her nickname, despite the fact that Hostin does not go by her real name, Asuncion.\n\nMore recently, Hostin falsely accused President Donald Trump’s administration in February of ignoring illegal immigration coming from the U.S.-Canadian border because they are not Hispanic. More than half of the migrants who illegally cross the northern border are from Latin American and East Asian countries.\n\nHostin also suggested that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election for being a mixed-race woman. She complained about being stuck in America, calling it a “racist” country.\n\nThe co-host discovered in February 2024 that she is a descendant of Spanish slave owners who resided in Puerto Rico during an episode of PBS’ “Finding Your Roots.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

With a straight face, the far left is trying to convince anyone who will listen that the president is a king — even in the midst of a government shutdown.\n\nIt’s so absurd we shouldn’t have to waste time on it, but these are the crazy times we live in. Hardworking taxpayers and God-fearing America loving families from coast to coast know that if President Trump were a king, the government would be open. These horrendous optics for Democrats and their Soros-funded marches are fitting for a dying movement that’s out of fresh ideas and innovative policies. (RELATED: ‘Negotiate With Us Now’: Democrats Demand GOP Bail Them Out Of Schumer-Caused Shutdown)\n\nIf nothing else, these counterproductive protests will galvanize support behind Trump’s America First agenda and the growing consensus that the left has gone too far. Let’s remember that “No Kings” is no different than the phony Occupy Wall Street sit-ins and Trump-hating Resistance efforts before it.\n\nIn fact, they’re all designed to do the same things: give the left’s professional protest industry something to do; keep angry, disillusioned people angry and disillusioned; and foment division among Americans. Make no mistake, this is an industry and a key component of the Democrat Party.\n\nOur 45th and 47th president is a citizen-politician and a once in a lifetime change agent who represents an existential threat to the failed status quo that the Democrat Party has been building methodically for the past century. Sadly, as long as the corrupt mainstream media chooses to remain an accomplice, the left’s modus operandi of cooking up false narratives like the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, and countless others will continue.\n\nLet’s get one thing straight, the federal government hasn’t been shut down for more than three weeks because President Trump is some all-powerful despot. The government is closed because a small group of career Democrat politicians in the U.S. Senate — led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — feel their power slipping away and are trying urgently to appease their agitated base. (RELATED: JORGE MARTINEZ: Democrats End Up Handing Trump Huge Gift With Their Shutdown Strategy)\n\nThe American people are well-versed on the facts; and the facts are that the government remains closed today because sixty votes are needed in the Senate to pass a funding bill, and there are only 53 Republicans.\n\nThe true tyrants in this shameful episode are the likes of Democrat Sens. Schumer, Dick Durbin, and Bernie Sanders — just to name a few — who’ve been in Congress a total of 120 years. Watching this unaccountable bunch try to falsely label Trump, a twice democratically elected president, a king is simply beyond the pale.\n\nAfterall, this is the same outfit that gleefully allowed former President Joe Biden to ignore the Supreme Court and illegally pay off billions in student loans with taxpayer dollars without congressional authorization. It’s also the same con artists who turned a blind eye to the Obama and Biden administration’s weaponization of our nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies against President Trump.\n\nAnd lest we forget, these are the same people who coronated Kamala Harris as their 2024 nominee for president even though she didn’t receive a single primary vote.\n\nSenate Democrats manufactured a crisis over Obamacare — former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation — to justify shutting the government down. In a truly despicable act, they’ve chosen to keep the people’s work hostage if Republicans won’t agree to tack on $1.5 trillion in additional spending for enhanced COVID-era Obamacare subsidies and health benefits for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe reason Obamacare needs a bail out is because it’s not working, like so many other government programs. The truth is that since its inception in 2010, Obamacare has been ineffective at keeping health care costs down and delivering quality care.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress are ready and willing to have an honest and transparent debate about reforming our health care system. However, this can only be accomplished if Senate Democrats finally vote to re-open the government. And any debate about the future of health care must be grounded in reality — that means acknowledging that we must stop spending at COVID-era levels four years after the China virus has ended.\n\nThe federal government spent $4.4 trillion in fiscal year 2019 and now we’re spending around $7 trillion annually. This is both reckless and unsustainable, but unfortunately only President Trump and the GOP are sounding the alarm.\n\nAmerica must return to pre-COVID spending right now or risk bankruptcy far sooner than anticipated. This starts by opening the government and holding a legitimate debate about rising health care costs and our catastrophic $37.9 trillion national debt.\n\nIf we want to fix our healthcare system while paying down the debt, it can’t be done by propping up a failed program just because it’s got Barack Obama’s name on it. Republicans must not cave to pressure from left-wing Democrats and the liberal media under any circumstances.\n\nThe GOP won’t win in 2026 and beyond by being Democrat-lite. Like President Ronald Reagan used to say — and President Trump lives by — it’s time for bold colors, not pale pastels.\n\nDemocrats are at their weakest point in recent memory; it’s time to break the back of those who exist to defend the failed status quo that’s destroying our country.\n\nThis is a fight worth having.\n\nDavid Bossie is the president of Citizens United and served as a senior adviser to the Trump-Pence 2020 campaign.

The headline? \"George Clooney: I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,\" Jean-Pierre wrote in in her book, Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.\n\n'I read it in disbelief.' \n\nIn the essay, Clooney wrote of a fundraiser he hosted with Biden: 'It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe \"big f***ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. \n\n'He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate. ' \n\nJean-Pierre said the actor's piece came as a 'gut punch' to her old boss, whom she maintained was still fit to lead the country.\n\n'Clooney was an A-list Hollywood celebrity and a self-professed proud Democrat. His opinion was a huge deal and would draw tremendous attention from the media and the public alike,' Jean-Pierre wrote.\n\nShe also criticized decisions made by the Democratic party before Biden bowed out of the race, framing her colleagues' effort to remove him as a betrayal.\n\nClooney's calls 'may not have been a calculated jab at the party’s campaign to push out the president, but the letter lent a renewed velocity to the effort,' she wrote.\n\n'After its publication, more and more party leaders said Biden had to go.' \n\n'Though his concerns weren't completely unjustified, his assessment didn't offer the full context.' \n\nJean-Pierre also described the fundraiser Clooney hosted with Biden, which she attended. \n\n'We went through nine time zones. I was tired, and I'm decades younger than Biden, so it was understandable that he might not have been sprinting across a ballroom or at his most electric when addressing the star-studded crowd,' she wrote. \n\nJean-Pierre claimed that she did not personally witness any signs of Biden's cognitive decline and that the Democratic party effectively forced him out. \n\nShe did recognize that something was off after Biden's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024.\n\n'He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick,' she wrote \n\nHigh-level Democrats already put off by Biden's odds then jumped at the chance to attack him, Jean-Pierre claimed.\n\n'Everything that I've been pushing back on - his age, is he fit - like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go,' she wrote. \n\nStill, she maintained that she saw no reason to doubt the president ability to serve. \n\nAside from Clooney, Jean-Pierre blamed high-ranking Democrats like Nancy Pelosi for the disunity and disloyalty within the party.\n\nThe book's title is a reference to how the former press secretary no longer identifies as a Democrat, but as an Independent. \n\nIt comes after months after Jake Tapper co-authored a book about Biden's decline. \n\nDozens of unnamed sources who spoke with the CNN star suggested members of the party for months attempted to cover-up the then-president's cognitive decline. \n\n'The President appeared severely diminished, as if he’d aged a decade since Clooney last saw him, in December, 2022,' Tapper and co-author Alex Thompson wrote. The book came out in May. \n\nKamala Harris, in her own memoir, wrote that it was 'reckless' for Biden to run for re-election in 2024 and that his handling of the race endangered her campaign.","summary":"Karine Jean-Pierre blasted actor George Clooney in for writing a high-profile essay telling Joe Biden to drop out of last year's presidential

President Kamala Harris’ failed 2024 election campaign — with at least $1.6 million paid out in September alone, according to the latest federal filings.\n\nThe Harris campaign shelled out $1.49 million alone for media production and consulting, $106,312 for data services and $21,762 to rent space at a Grand Rapids, Mich. community center for an October 2024 event alongside billionaire investor Mark Cuban touting the Democratic nominee as the “pro-business candidate.”\n\nLast month’s payouts push the total debt covered since Election Day to more than $20 million, according to Axios, which first reported on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings. \n\nIt’s unclear how much more debt remains to be settled.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama’s successful 2012 campaign incurred a similar level of debt that the DNC three years to fully pay off, with former chairwoman Donna Brazile claiming the 44th commander-in-chief’s “neglect had left the party in significant debt.”\n\nHarris made a “handshake deal” with the national party after Donald Trump defeated her this past November, under which the DNC agreed to cover $20.5 million in outstanding campaign bills, The New York Times reported in August.\n\nThose debts included costs of internal polling, consulting, flights and production companies — some of which helped put on star-studded concerts as well as campaign events that featured Harris with the likes of Beyonce and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nHarris spent a whopping $1.5 billion during her 107-day sprint to Election Day after President Biden suspended his re-election campaign July 21, 2024, only to lose all seven critical swing states to Trump.\n\nThe fundraising totals for the 2024 election nearly broke the all-time record from four years prior, with both campaigns raising a combined $2.5 billion.\n\nBut as of June, DNC officials were openly expressing concern that the party was so cash-strapped that it could have to borrow more money just to keep the lights on.\n\nSome megadonors — including billionaires such as media mogul Barry Diller and Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican mayor of New York City — were also slamming their pocketbooks shut.\n\n“There is just a broad consensus that the DNC is ineffectual and not where we should be giving money,” one longtime ex-donor told The Post in June.\n\nThe following month, FEC filings for the first half of 2025 showed the Republican National Committee had racked up $96,419,883 in contributions and registered $80,782,884 cash on hand, dominating the DNC’s $69,224,921 in donations and $15,220,609 war chest.\n\nThe DNC currently has $11,974,008 cash on hand, and has pumped at least $3.5 million into a closely watched gubernatorial race in New Jersey, a deep blue state where no Republican has won the governorship since 2013. \n\nReps for the DNC and Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Former President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign resulted

comments about JD Vance’s wife Usha: ‘Outright slander!’","text":"Fox News hosts and pundits are absolutely apoplectic over MSNBC star Jen Psaki’s recent remarks about Usha Vance, accusing the former Biden spokeswoman of “slander” for mocking Vance’s marriage to the vice president and joking that the Second Lady should send a sign for help.\n\n“She should apologize,” Fox & Friends host Lawrence Jones declared Wednesday morning while the other hosts described Psaki’s comments as “disturbing.”\n\nIn a recent appearance on the liberal podcast I’ve Had It, Psaki – a primetime host at MSNBC who once served as the White House press secretary in the Joe Biden administration – spoke at length about how she was more worried about JD Vance than Donald Trump.\n\nDuring her conversation with hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie “Pumps” Sullivan, Psaki noted that the veep “wants to be president more than anything else” while claiming both Vance’s youth and ambition make him “scarier in certain ways” than the 79-year-old president.\n\n“He’s willing to do anything to get there,” she declared, labeling the 41-year-old vice president a “little Manchurian candidate” who is “agile in the sense that he is a chameleon who makes himself into whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him.” \n\nDuring the back-and-forth over the vice president’s political future, Psaki brought up the second lady and snarked that she wonders if their marriage is in a good place. \n\n“I always wonder what’s going on in the mind of his wife,” Psaki quipped. “Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. Come over here – we’ll save you.”\n\nThat moment soon went viral in the conservative corners of social media, drawing predictable rage from prominent MAGA influencers and commentators. \n\n“Unhinged Jen Psaki is now smearing JD Vance, suggesting that his wife, Usha, wants to leave her husband and offers to ‘save’ her,” anti-trans social media account Libs of TikTok – which is run by Trump ally Chaiya Raichik – posted on X. “@MSNBC should be ashamed to pay her salary.”\n\nWith others fuming about Psaki’s “disgusting comments” while claiming they were “an insult to women who are in actual bad marriages,” Fox News commentator Joe Concha declared online that the ex-Biden flack was “not a good person” before taking his grievances to the airwaves.\n\n“This is a national primetime host and former White House press secretary. She is engaging in outright slander,” Concha exclaimed on Wednesday’s broadcast of Fox & Friends First, before invoking MAGA’s favorite insult for Psaki.\n\n“I mean, Peppermint Patty here is just making stuff up and has zero idea what she’s talking about,” the Fox News pundit huffed. “She can’t argue about policy, so she’s resorting to fabricated personal attacks.”\n\nMoments after derisively comparing the MSNBC host to a cartoon character, meanwhile, Concha lamented that it’s “such a toxic time right now” and how “we just have personal attacks and ad hominem stuff.” \n\nThe hosts of the president’s favorite morning show also took their turns slamming Psaki, with the Fox & Friends crew describing the remarks as “so nasty” and “disturbing” before Jones demanded an apology from the rival cable news host.\n\n“I would not hold your breath,” co-host Brian Kilmeade – who recently issued his own mea culpa over his inflammatory remarks about homeless people – reacted.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s telecast of America’s Newsroom, right-wing radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt – who is also a Fox News contributor – asserted that Psaki likely felt she was in a “safe space” to take shots at the Vances because she was on a podcast that appeals to the “far-left edge of the Democratic Party.”\n\nHewitt, who was previously a paid commentator for MSNBC, claimed that Psaki’s remarks indicated that the “left is out of ideas” as they have “no substance” and can only resort to “insults.” He further insisted that appearing on the I’ve Had It podcast was merely a way for Psaki to “engage clicks to let people know she is still” at MSNBC as it transitions to the upcoming MS NOW rebrand.\n\nAmid the right-wing media backlash over Psaki’s comments, the White House also made sure to add its voice to the mix. White House communications director Steven Cheung, who regularly replicates his boss’ bombastic “lib owning” tone, blasted Psaki’s comments while branding her his own Trumpian nickname.\n\n“Jen Psuki must be transferring her own personal issues onto others,” he Cheung wrote on X, adding that she is “a dumba** who has no comprehension of the truth and has to overcompensate for her lack of talent by saying untrue things. Circle back on that, moron.”\n\nMeanwhile, during Wednesday’s segments about Psaki, the network’s hosts suggested that conservatives and Fox News personalities largely avoid taking shots at political spouses or vice presidents.\n\n“I think another rule in general is don't go after the spouse. Why would you do that? It is not helpful,” anchor Dana Perino said during her conversation with Hewitt. \n\nAdditionally, towards the end of the Fox & Friends First discussion with Concha, co-host Todd Piro pondered the media reaction if Kayleigh McEnany – a former Trump spokesperson who now hosts multiple Fox News shows – would have “attacked Kamala Harris.”\n\nHowever, the conservative cable giant’s stars have long gone after the wives and families of Democratic presidents and elected officials. Michelle Obama, for instance, was a regular target of Fox News and the conservative media ecosystem throughout her husband’s presidency and in the years since.\n\nOn top of that, before John Fetterman became Fox News’ favorite Democrat, the network’s right-wing opinion hosts regularly took aim at his wife Giselle during Fetterman’s Senate run in 2022 – suggesting that she was pushing her husband to stay in the race following his stroke.\n\n“There was the effort to frame this as some brave and vulnerable act. Not anything that would be considered craven or a cruel political calculation by a stage wife and political nihilist,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham declared at the time, while her colleague Jesse Watters wondered if “the bisexual Brazilian immigrant [had] been vetted.”\n\nAs for McEnany, she has regularly lobbed attacks at Harris, saying just last month that the former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee refused to take accountability for her own “incompetence.”","summary":"‘I always wonder what’s going on in the mind of his wife,’ Jen Psaki snarked recently. ‘Like, are you OK?
