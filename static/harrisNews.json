After Admitting She was 'Concerned' About Their Skills","text":"Kamala Harris has revealed she had \"concerns\" with some of Joe Biden's campaign advisers when she first took over his doomed presidential run just months before the election, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nThe former vice president brought in her own staff after worrying about Biden's \"dog-and-pony bulls---.\"In her explosive new memoir recounting her rushed campaign, 107 Days, Harris admits there were questions during those early days over how the campaign \"needed to be reshaped.\" Namely, which staff members should stay and which should go.\n\nHarris writes that some of Biden's top advisers saw things differently than she did. \n\n\"I had my concerns,\" she writes. \"Some, like Mike Donilon, one of Joe's closest advisers, had moved from the West Wing to the campaign because he was an expert in channeling Joe; he knew Joe's every whim and inflection.\n\n\"It was unclear how that expertise could work for me. In fact, he left the campaign and returned to the West Wing less than two weeks later.\"'Fixing the Problem'Harris complained the campaign lacked a specific direction and was only interested in \"(fixing) the problem by throwing money at it.\"\n\nShe was also surprised by how gently Biden was treated.\n\nThe former candidate explains: \"For several months, the Biden-Harris campaign team had been holding meetings in what's called the 'tennis hut,' a pavilion on the grounds of the White House. These political briefings often made no sense to me. \n\n\"Mike Donilon would filter the data from the polls and present the numbers in soothing terms: that the razor-thin, within-the-margin-of-error results were no cause for hair on fire; that really there was nothing to see here.\" \n\nShe continues: \"My chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, turned to me as we left one of these meetings and said, 'If I ever organized that sort of dog-and-pony bulls--- for you, you'd have my head on a platter.\"Harris Tells-AllHarris packed her book with accusations and revelations about her former boss, detailing just how big a role former First Lady Jill Biden played in her husband's decision to run again.\n\n\"'It's Joe and Jill’s decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness?\" the 60-year-old writes.\n\n\"In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"Loyal Until the EndHarris argues that Biden was simply getting more tired with age, while refusing to refute published reports that he was suffering from severe cognitive decline.\n\n\"Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity. Here is the truth as I lived it. Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president,\" the former U.S. senator explains in the book.\n\n\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired. That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles,\" Harris claims.\n\n\"I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country,\" she declares.","summary":"The former vice president brought in her own staff in a mad rush to election day.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-cleaned-house-biden-advisers-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/fd6Uup-qg/0x0/kamala-harris-joe-biden-look-1758663915091.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:30:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":362955230,"title":"In Harris book, why the petty slurs and slights?","text":"The book, 107 Days, is not filled with attacks. It is filled with slights.\n\nIn one chapter, Harris goes through the notes she made of the reactions that some top Democrats had when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and almost instantly endorsed Harris. For example, Bill and Hillary Clinton quickly told Harris they supported her and would do anything she asked to help. The South Carolina congressman and powerbroker James Clyburn simply said, “Let’s go. I’m all in.”\n\nBut Harris says Gavin Newsom, the governor of Harris’s home state of California, responded with: “Hiking. Will call back.” (Harris follows that with a quick parenthetical: “He never did.”) In fact, Newsom endorsed Harris that very day, a few hours later, in what the Los Angeles Times called a “show of California unity.” Why nitpick about that at this late date, especially given Newsom’s rising status in the Democratic Party? \n\nHarris also notified Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, who Harris says responded with, “I believe you’ll win, but I need to let the dust settle, talk to my colleagues before I make a public statement.” There was certainly nothing wrong with that, and indeed Whitmer endorsed Harris the next day, but why publish her confidential communications with the suggestion of insufficient enthusiasm for her party’s ticket?\n\nThen there is Harris’s treatment of the Democratic governor of the most important swing state in the country, Pennsylvania. Harris does not really criticize Gov. Josh Shapiro, but she says just enough mildly negative things about him to make clear he could never make the cut to serve as her vice presidential running mate. \n\nHarris describes at some length the process she went through to interview Shapiro. Besides the two principals, a key player in the story was Storm Horncastle, a former Netflix executive whom Harris called her “indispensable social secretary” and manager of the vice presidential residence. Eager to keep Harris’s decision-making process a secret, Horncastle arranged to pick Shapiro up in a school parking lot. Harris suggests that Shapiro did not want things to be kept a secret, that he wanted to be seen being driven into the vice president’s compound. When Horncastle told Shapiro he had to sit in the back seat and duck, “she thought he seemed a little disappointed by that,” Harris writes.\n\nOnce in the house, there was a measuring-the-drapes moment when Shapiro “peppered [Horncastle] with questions about the house, from the number of bedrooms to how he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists’ work on loan from the Smithsonian,” Harris writes.\n\nAfter the meeting, still trying to keep the talks secret, Horncastle took Shapiro back to the original pickup spot and instructed his state trooper to take the governor on a route that did not pass in front of the vice president’s residence, so reporters would not see Pennsylvania state vehicles driving past. “[Horncastle] was disappointed, ten minutes later, to see those very cars on CNN, cruising right by the residence,” Harris writes. “That lack of discretion did not play well with her.” This leads the reader to question: Who is picking a vice president, Kamala Harris or Storm Horncastle?\n\nFinally, when Harris passed over Shapiro and chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, she tried to quickly call Shapiro with the news before he could learn it in the press. “[Former Biden White House counsel] Dana Remus later let me know that Josh had been trying to reach me earlier that morning,” Harris writes. “The only reason I could imagine for him calling was that he’d intuited he wouldn’t be the choice and wanted to withdraw first, so it would be seen as his decision.”\n\nSo what’s with all that? Let’s take it as a fact that Harris just doesn’t like Shapiro. Fine. What does she think will be accomplished by the quibbling and fault-finding? \n\nIn the bigger picture, if Harris does indeed harbor hope of being the Democratic nominee in 2028, she can probably forget it, but not for any of the reasons explored in 107 Days. The simple fact is that the party does not like to re-nominate past nominees who lost, and it seems unlikely to change now. And that is the key fact of 2024 for Kamala Harris: She had her chance, and she lost.","summary":"IN HARRIS BOOK, WHY THE PETTY SLURS AND SLIGHTS? There&#8217;s no law that says a politician has to write a book after a big election.

I went into Election Day thinking you were going to win.\" \"So did you,\" the co-host added. Harris replied, \"Yeah.

Harris chalked it up to the shortness of her campaign because she had to step in for former President Joe Biden less than four months before Election Day. Biden abandoned his re-election campaign in July 2024 following his dismal debate performance against Trump in June. Harris told the co-hosts it was an unprecedented situation in which to run a presidential campaign. \"And, you know, I mean, one of the reasons I wrote the book is this is unprecedented. Think about this, that there is a race for President of the United States. The current sitting president is running for re-election.

Bush and Al Gore was closer than Trump and Harris’ race, both in the Electoral College and popular vote. Trump won the Electoral College by 86 votes in 2024 and held a 1.6% margin over Harris in the popular vote.

It’s the idea the media is a watchdog over the other three estates which, in modern democracies, are parliament, the executive government and the judiciary.\n\nIn the US, Trump has had considerable success in weakening the other three.\n\nHis Republican Party controls both Houses of Congress, and they have shown no sign of wishing to restrain him.\n\nHe has stacked the executive government with cronies and ideological fellow travellers, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr (and his anti-vaccination agenda) as secretary of health, a brief stint by Elon Musk as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.\n\nHe has secured the support of the Republican Party to stack the Supreme Court with politically aligned judges who have routinely struck down lower court decisions against Trump, most notably in the matter of deporting migrants to countries other than their homelands.\n\nPulling funding, applying pressure\n\nThe fourth estate’s turn started in March, when Trump stripped federal funding from Voice of America, a public broadcasting service with a global reach, because it was “anti-Trump” and “radical”. \n\nThese cuts also hit two other projections of American soft power, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.\n\nIn July, he cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in a move that ended all federal support for National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting service and their member stations.\n\nNow he has turned to the private sector media. He does not have the power to cut their funding, so he is taking a different approach: financial shake-downs and threats to the foundations of their business.\n\nIn October 2024, even before he was elected, Trump sued the Paramount company for US$10 billion (about A$15 billion). He alleged an interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign had been “deceptively edited” by the CBS television network, a Paramount subsidiary. \n\nIn February 2025, after he had been sworn in as president, Trump upped the ante to US$20 billion (A$30 billion).\n\nThe case was considered by lawyers to have no legal merit, but at that time, Paramount was anxious to merge with Skydance Media, and this was subject to regulatory approval from the Trump administration.\n\nSo Paramount was vulnerable to, how shall we say? Blackmail? Extortion? Subornation?\n\nA busy, dangerous July\n\nOn July 2, Paramount settled with Trump for US$16 million (A$24 million), which ostensibly is to go towards funding his presidential library. \n\nOn July 17 Paramount’s CBS network announced its longtime Late Show would be cancelled from May 2026 after its presenter Stephen Colbert, an outspoken critic of Trump, condemned the corporate cave-in. The Trump administration approved the merger shortly after.\n\nSubsequently the House of Representatives Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees announced an investigation into whether the $16 million settlement constituted a bribe.\n\nAlso in July, Trump sued Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal for defamation arising from an article linking Trump to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. He claimed the now-familiar amount of US$10 billion (A$15 billion) in damages.\n\nLegal experts in the US say Trump has next to no chance of winning. In the US, public figures who sue for defamation have to prove that the publisher was motivated by malice, which means they published either knowing the material to be untrue, or not caring whether it was true or not. \n\nThis case is never likely to end up in court, nor is it likely that Trump will see a red cent of Murdoch’s money. The two men need each other too much. To borrow a phrase from the Cold War, they are in a MAD relationship: Mutually Assured Destruction.\n\nComing to heel, one by one\n\nRupert Murdoch was a guest at Windsor Castle at the recent banquet given for Trump by King Charles.\n\nConsidering Murdoch’s bitter history with the Royal Family, it is difficult to imagine Buckingham Palace inviting him without Trump’s urging. It may have been a sign of rapprochement between the two men.\n\nMeanwhile Trump has set his sights on The New York Times, suing it for defamation and claiming US$15 billion (A$27 billion). \n\nReferring to the Times’ endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, he said it had become a “mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democrat Party”.\n\nThis case faces the same difficulties as his suit against the Wall Street Journal. The question is whether the Times will stand its ground or whether, like Paramount, it caves.\n\nAmong the big three US newspapers, the Times is the only one so far not to have been intimidated by Trump. The other two, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, refused to endorse a candidate at the election on instructions from their owners, Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong respectively, both of whose wider business interests are vulnerable to Trumpian retribution.\n\n Read more:\n Two of the US's biggest newspapers have refused to endorse a presidential candidate. This is how democracy dies\n\nThe Post’s decision was condemned as “spineless” by its celebrated former editor Marty Baron.\n\nNow Disney is in the firing line. It owns another of the big four US television networks, ABC. On September 17, it pulled its late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live. \n\nKimmel had responded to White House accusations that leftists were responsible for the assassination of Charlie Kirk, saying: \n\nwe hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.\n\nIn what had all the hallmarks of a preemptive buckle, ABC and two of its affiliate networks took Kimmel off air indefinitely after Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission, said his agency might “take action” against the network because of Kimmel’s comments.\n\nKimmel is returning to TV, but the damage is already done.\n\n Read more:\n Jimmy Kimmel's cancellation is the latest sign we're witnessing the end of US democracy\n\nOver at cable network MSNBC, its senior political analyst Matthew Dowd was fired after he had uttered on air the blindingly obvious statement that Kirk’s own radical rhetoric may have contributed to the shooting that killed him. \n\nThis cable network is no longer part of the main NBC network, so it can’t be said that NBC itself has yet come to heel.\n\nWithin 24 hours of Brendan Carr’s veiled threat, Trump stripped the veil away and made the threat explicit. Trump said of the national networks: \n\nAll they do is hit Trump. They’re licensed, they’re not allowed to do that. They’re an arm of the Democrat party.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is reportedly eyeing a potential 2028 presidential run as the Democratic Party finds its footing following President Donald Trump's decisive win at the ballot box in 2024, according to a recent report. Ocasio-Cortez's team is preparing her to run for president or the U.S. Senate in 2028, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is up for re-election and Democrats can next run to reclaim the White House, Axios reported Friday, citing sources familiar. The New York congresswoman has not officially made a decision on a Senate or presidential run, but has hired former senior advisors from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' orbit as she navigates her political future, the outlet reported. She notably has joined Sanders on a national tour, called \"Fighting Oligarchy,\" in recent months that aims at combating Trump administration policies. Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment on the report she's teeing up a 2028 run for higher office but did not receive a reply. AOC USES HOUSE FLOOR SPEECH TO SMEAR CHARLIE KIRK: 'HIS RHETORIC AND BELIEFS WERE IGNORANT, UNEDUCATED' Fox News Digital spoke to Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Shasti Conrad Thursday, ahead of Axios' report on Ocasio-Cortez's alleged 2028 aspirations, to discuss former Vice President Kamala Harris' new book as well as top Democrats eyeing serving in higher offices. Conrad, who is also the chair of Washington State's Democratic Party, told Fox News Digital that the party needs \"hundreds of leaders,\" listing off names such as New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, to Ocasio-Cortez and former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. BERNIE SANDERS ADDRESSES WHETHER HE’LL RUN IN 2028 \"We need Mamdani to Pete to Kamala to (Minnesota Gov. Tim) Walz to (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom ... to (Kentucky Gov.) Andy Beshear to, you know, AOC,\" she said. \"We need messengers across this country talking about what Democrats stand for, what we will do when we get back in power, how we will make a difference in people's lives.\" She added that these leaders must also bring attention to \"what Trump is doing, calling that out every single day, holding the Republicans' feet to the fire,\" she added. 2028 LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE FOR DEMOCRATS — AND REPUBLICANS ARE POISED TO CAPITALIZE Conrad argued that Harris' book allows the former vice president to \"speak her truth\" on the 2024 campaign cycle, which included Harris reporting that she did not feel supported by the Biden team. The book argued the Biden team rarely defended her from negative press, and called Biden's decision to run for reelection at the age of 81 as an example of \"recklessness.\" DOUG SCHOEN: WHY AOC COULD TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 AND KAMALA HARRIS WON'T \"’It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,\" Harris wrote in the book, according to the excerpts. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\" The excerpts set off condemnation from former White House staffers who told Axios that Harris was allegedly trying to scapegoat Biden instead of owning up that she \"was simply not good at the job.\" Democrats are now jockeying to lead the party in the Trump era. Conrad said the book tees up Harris potentially running for president again in 2028, or a potential Buttigieg run, while also celebrating that other high-profile names could step up. \"This is the thing that happens when you don't have the White House, the presidency, is that there isn't one leader of the Democrats,\" she said. \"We need, you know, hundreds of leaders.\" The report of Ocasio-Cortez's potential comes as the Democratic Party maps out its future following Trump's November 2024 election win.

Released Tuesday, the book offers a day-by-day account of the weeks between Joe Biden’s abrupt withdrawal and Donald Trump’s victory on November 5 — a night Harris says was so devastating she and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, never discussed it until she began writing.\n\nThe former vice president worked with Pulitzer Prize–winning author Geraldine Brooks to shape the memoir, which Simon & Schuster CEO Jonathan Karp said reads “like a suspense novel.” Early reviews suggest an uneven result: some critics call it “very readable,” while others dismiss it as “a frustrating slog” that leaves both supporters and critics wanting more.\n\nA central thread of the memoir is Harris’ fraught relationship with Biden. She describes her feelings as grounded in “warmth and loyalty,” complicated by “hurt and disappointment,” and recounts how she was sidelined with what Emhoff called “impossible, sh*t jobs.” She labels Biden’s decision to seek re-election “recklessness” and says his staff operated with a “zero-sum mentality” that undercut her campaign.\n\nRevisiting key campaign moments and missteps, Harris concedes that her infamous “there is not a thing that comes to mind” remark on “The View” became a “hand grenade” for Trump’s team. She reveals that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her first choice for running mate (“an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man”) before advisers deemed the ticket too risky, a decision she says Buttigieg understood with “mutual sadness.” And when she sought a campaign endorsement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, his response, per her notes, was, “Hiking. Will call back.” She adds, “He never did.”\n\nHarris — who earned an estimated 86% of the LGBTQ+ vote according to exit polls — also writes that she shares “concerns” about trans-inclusive sports policies. Though she emphasizes her “deep connection” with the trans community, some passages echo conservative framings of youth sports and gender-affirming care. “I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,” she writes. “With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.”\n\nSeveral sports organizations already had policies in place to address these factors — often requiring trans athletes to complete years of hormone therapy — but many have since been rolled back or replaced with strict binary classifications based on “biological sex,” amid the broader conservative backlash.\n\nHarris declined to run for California governor next year, leaving open the possibility for a 2028 presidential bid. But when asked about her political future, she said, ‘That’s not my focus right now. It’s not my focus at all. I know — it really isn’t.”","summary":"The former VP’s campaign memoir, \"107 Days,\" draws mixed reviews as she re-enters the spotlight","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/23/kamala-harris-memoir-revisits-biden-tensions-2024-regrets/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Kamala-Harris-2212220032-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 19:42:20","author":"Angelina Mazza","authors":["Angelina Mazza"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":362913796,"title":"Kamala Waxes Poetic About 2024 Election On ‘The View’","text":"Former Vice President and failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris falsely claimed Tuesday on The View that the 2024 election between her and President Donald Trump was “the closest presidential race in the 21st Century in terms of the outcome,” prompting the audience to clap approvingly.

Harris responded at the time, “Not a thing comes to mind,” which appeared to cement the perception that she wasn’t a change candidate.”\n\nHostin pressed Harris again Tuesday, asking about her differences with Biden. The former VP admitted she knew her close ties to the president would become an issue.\n\n“In the moment, I knew,” Hostin told Harris, referencing her question posed to the former vice president. “The Trump campaign weaponized your answer against you, my question, and some, including James Carville and Jake Tapper, point to that answer as a turning point in your candidacy.”\n\nHostin asked Harris if she believed the moment tipped the election.\n\n“No, no,” Harris said as co-host Joy Behar chimed in, “Good, because Sunny doesn’t want to take the blame.”\n\nHarris said during the interview that she didn’t fully appreciate how significant an issue her closeness to Biden was during the election cycle. She believed during the campaign she often pointed out the differences between her and Biden without seeming disloyal.\n\nHostin added, “That President Biden was deeply unpopular, I did realize that.”\n\nHer response to Hostin’s question at the time went viral for the wrong reasons. It appeared in ads for President Donald Trump and was widely viewed as a damaging moment for her candidacy. \n\nThe former vice president also addressed the moment in her book and wrote she had no idea she “pulled the pin on a hand grenade” in her answer to Hostin’s question. \n\n“Stationed at various places around the set, my staff were beside themselves. Political operatives have an eye to see a moment, and I could kick myself for giving the other side that moment. During the commercial break, while I was having a bit of fun with some young students I’d noticed in the audience who were obviously playing hooky, offering to write notes to their teachers after the show, Opal [Vadhan] passed me a note from our team, telling me to return to that question and mention that a big difference would be that I would put a Republican in my cabinet,” she wrote. \n\nHowever, Harris acknowledged the damage had already been done.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her bungled answer from a 2024 interview on \"The View\" during Tuesday's edition of the ABC talk show about her new book, \"107 Days.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/23/us-news/kamala-harris-denies-claims-that-her-view-appearance-was-tipping-point-in-campaign/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111986370.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AjwMaqn0-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-23 19:05:58","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":362950156,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Inside Kamala Harris' Explosive Fight with Husband Doug Emhoff Just Two Weeks Before Facing Humiliating Election Loss to Trump... as Ex-Veep Admits 'Stress' Took Its Toll","text":"Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff got into an explosive fight that threatened their marriage just before the presidential election, RadarOnline.com can confirm.\n\nThe former vice president admits she was feeling the pressure of running a grueling campaign against eventual winner Donald Trump.Just 16 days before the November election, Harris celebrated her landmark 60th birthday.

It was the date of our wedding anniversary,\" she confesses. \"He'd obviously intended to give me both pieces on our anniversary, until it occurred to him that by repurposing one piece, he could kill two birds with one stone.\n\n\"He could practice thrift and also save himself the bother of shopping for a birthday gift.\"The Last StrawHarris decided to draw a bath for herself to calm down and relax, but when she was ready to get out of the tub, she noticed all the towels were hanging on the other side of the room. \n\nShe tried calling Emhoff for help, but he was preoccupied with the Dodgers vs. Mets playoff game. Desperate, she called his cell phone, which he finally picked up and answered nonchalantly, \"What's Up?\" \n\nThat was the last straw. \n\n\"And then we got into it,\" Harris revealed. \"The stress had finally gotten to both of us. It was one of those fights that every married couple has had. But we weren't every married couple.\"Peace OfferingEmhoff was the one who ended the battle. \n\n\"Doug stopped the argument cold. As soon as his words were out, the truth of them landed on me like a bucket of ice water. 'We can't turn on each other.'\"\n\nShe added: \"With the hits coming from every direction, we had to stay united. Back-to-back, swords raised against all outside attacks. We had to protect each other, be each other's pillar of strength, givers and receivers of patience and unconditional love.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Harris said Emhoff would leave a handwritten note on her pillow each night, telling her how much he loves her.","summary":"The former vice president admits she was feeling the pressure of running a grueling campaign.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-fight-husband-doug-emhoff-election-loss-donald-trump-stress-exclusive/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/EOldcyeOn/0x0/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-1758651931137.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 19:04:51","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":362941340,"title":"Kamala Harris reacts to 'grenade' “View” appearance that derailed campaign, maintains 'obvious' differences from Joe Biden","text":"While many believe that former Vice President Kamala Harris' October 2024 appearance on The View dealt a devastating blow to her election campaign against Donald Trump, the politician defended the moment — and partially absolved cohost Sunny Hostin for asking the question that conservatives used as fodder for attack ads.\n\n During the prior, highly publicized live pre-election discussion on the talk show, Harris responded to one of Hostin's questions about differentiating herself from then-President Joe Biden's policies, telling the legal expert that there was \"not a thing that comes to mind\" that she'd do differently than him.\n\n \"I didn't fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden,\" Harris admitted Tuesday during a return appearance on The View, in response to Hostin asking about the moment and pointing out that Biden was \"deeply unpopular\" heading into the election. \"I thought it was obvious. I didn't want to offer a difference in a way that would be received or suggested to be a criticism. In the campaign, full time, I was pointing out the differences.\"\n\n Hostin also read aloud a passage from Harris' new book, 107 Days, in which the former VP wrote that \"everything about my appearance on The View was going well until it wasn't,\" and compared it to pulling \"the pin on a hand grenade\" that led to an explosion of right-wing backlash.\n\n Responding to speculation that the moment was a tipping point leading to her downfall in the race, Harris said, \"No, no,\" to which panelist Joy Behar quipped, \"Good, because Sunny doesn't want to take the blame.\"\n\n The camera cut to Hostin as her facial expression leaned into Behar's bit.\n\n Still, Harris elaborated to the audience, maintaining that \"there were many things\" that led to her loss.\n\n \"I do believe one of the biggest deciders of the outcome of that election was that the American people were sick of things being so expensive and wanted prices to come down,\" observed Harris. \"This is part of why I wrote the book, which is, let's remember during those 107 Days [of my campaign] what Donald Trump talked about.\"\n\n She pointed to his priorities being attempts to \"bring down costs,\" and that she believed \"there are a lot of people who voted for him believing that's what he would do,\" though she has yet to see evidence of lower costs herself.\n\n Harris then said she felt there are \"certain promises he did keep, which is that he was going to weaponize the Department of Justice\" to \"fulfill whatever his fragile ego needed\" through the government.\n\n The interview ended with Behar asking about Harris' ties to Biden, with Harris telling her that they currently have a \"good relationship\" and that \"it's sincere\" on both ends.\n\n Harris' words came months after Biden, who stepped aside during the 2024 election after mounting pressure from Democrats over his fitness to hold office, told The View cohosts in May that he \"wasn't surprised\" Harris lost.\n\n \"Not because I didn't think the vice president was qualified to be president,\" explained Biden on the air. \"She is, she's qualified to be president of the United States of America. I was surprised because they went the sexist route, the whole route. 'This is a woman,' she's this, she's that, really, I've never seen as successful and consistent [of a] campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country — and a woman of mixed race.\"\n\n Harris' interview on The View also fell one day after the show's parent company, Disney, announced that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel would return to ABC on Tuesday following days of criticism and calls for company boycotts.

Although Biden’s presidential memoir fetched $10 million from Little, Brown and Company, few details have emerged about how much money Harris received from her publisher, Simon & Schuster.\n\nSimon & Schuster did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request about Harris’s book sales this week.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways from Harris’s book launch media blitz.\n\n1. Harris underestimated how much people wanted her to break from Biden \n\nThe former vice president returned to The View on Tuesday morning, and she addressed her infamous comments about how she would differ from a Biden administration, which she made on the show last year.\n\n“There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of [anything that she would have done differently from Biden],” Harris told the moderators in 2024.\n\nBut after losing the election, Harris sang a different tune. \n\n“I’m a loyal person, and I didn’t fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden,” Harris said on Tuesday. “I thought it was obvious, and I didn’t want to offer a difference in a way that would be received or suggested to be a criticism.”\n\nSunny Hostin, the host who had asked Harris about what she would have done differently from Biden, again pressed the former vice president over the incident. \n\n“Do you think that moment tipped the election?” Hostin said.\n\n“No,” Harris said. \n\n2. Harris claims she holds part of the blame for Biden running again \n\nHarris appeared on the Rachel Maddow Show on Monday evening, her first news interview since the 2024 election, and she took some responsibility for Biden’s decision to run for reelection despite trepidation from the public.\n\nIn her memoir, Harris wrote that “the stakes were simply too high” for Biden and former first lady Jill Biden to have decided on their own.\n\nMaddow asked Harris if she was partly responsible for not speaking up. \n\n“So when I write this, it’s because I realize that I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on,” Harris said. “And so when I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I’m talking about myself; there was so much, as we know, at stake.”\n\nHarris reiterated her comments on Good Morning America on Tuesday with host Michael Strahan.\n\n“Would it have mattered if you did?” Strahan asked Harris about speaking to Biden to stand down. \n\n“I don’t know,” she responded. “But I, I can only take responsibility for myself.” \n\nHARRIS CLAIMS SHE WAS PART OF ‘RECKLESSNESS’ THAT LED BIDEN TO SEEK REELECTION\n\n 3. Harris blasts Trump as an ’emperor’ and ‘tyrant’ \n\nWhile promoting the book, Harris has repeatedly slammed Trump’s tenure during his second administration, with a particular focus on his strong-arming of the media, public universities, and law firms. \n\n“Right now, we are dealing with, as I called him at my speech on the Ellipse, a tyrant. We used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators,” Harris said while talking with Maddow. \n\n“This individual who occupies our White House right now, the people’s house, has decided that he will be an emperor in his mind, who will demonstrate his power by demeaning and belittling and making people feel small,” Harris told The View moderators.\n\n“You can see in polling how his popularity is nose-diving. And I do believe that moving forward, we’re going to remember that the power, ultimately, is with the people,” she added.\n\nThe former vice president claimed Trump lied to the public during the campaign after he promised an American economic revival but instead is still facing a sluggish economy.\n\n“Look at where we are today. Inflation is up, the cost of food is up. Unemployment is up. He did not keep that promise to the American people,” Harris said on Good Morning America.\n\n 4. Harris still talks to Biden in post-presidency life\n\nExcerpts of 107 Days caused a stir among former White House staffers because Harris alleged that Biden’s inner team did not set her up for success as vice president.\n\nYet despite some outcry, Harris said she and Biden are on speaking terms. \n\n“I do speak to him,” she said on The View. “And it’s a good relationship and it’s a relationship that is based on mutual respect, having been in the trenches together.” \n\n“I want to be really clear, this book is not about Joe Biden,” she also said. “I love Joe Biden, and I also am very clear, and have made a point of making it clear, Joe Biden was a highly capable president who accomplished great things that history will talk about.”\n\n5. Harris repeatedly dodges on 2028 plans\n\nThe former vice president was asked on all three shows about whether she would seek the White House again in 2028. But she repeatedly claimed her focus was on selling her memoir. \n\n“That’s not my focus right now. It’s not my focus at all. It really isn’t,” Harris told Maddow. \n\n“That’s not in my immediate focus. I’m doing my book tour,” she again told The View.\n\n“I’m not focused on that right now. I’m really not. I’m really excited about my book tour,” she said on Good Morning America.\n\n“We’ll see if people will be supporting you if you announce you’re going to run in 2028,” Good Morning America’s Strahan later teased Harris.\n\n“Oh my goodness, just, just buy the book,” Harris laughed back. \n\nBUTTIGIEG SAYS VOTERS DESERVE ‘MORE CREDIT THAN THAT’ AFTER LEARNING ABOUT HARRIS VP SNUB\n\n6. Harris gives Zohran Mamdani a tepid endorsement\n\nHarris somewhat gave an endorsement of Zohran Mamdani, the socialist running to become the next New York City mayor, while speaking with Maddow.\n\n“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,” she said as some prominent Democrats have shied away from endorsing him. \n\n“I support the Democrat in the race, sure. But let me just say this: He’s not the only star,” Harris added. \n\n“There are people like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, Helena Moreno in New Orleans; they’re all running for mayor too, and they are stars,” Harris continued. “So I hope that we don’t so overindex on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country who are right now running for mayor and many other offices, governor, and so on. … We got a big tent, and we got a lot of stars.”\n\nMamdani has the support of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, but neither House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) nor Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has endorsed him.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris commenced the release of her book, 107 Days, on Tuesday and a 15-city book tour on Wednesday with a series of media appearances in which she addressed her chaotic and unsuccessful 2024 campaign against President Donald Trump.

I am for you'.\n\nShe appeared to acknowledge that her lack of a clear message on trans issues allowed Trump to define her however he wanted, even conceding that the ads he ran amounted to a 'winning message'.\n\nHer rhetorical pivot comes after many national Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, have said it is unfair for trans girls to play high school sports. \n\nHarris' approach was generally to signal that she was in favor of protecting trans rights without getting into the weeds of what that actually entailed.\n\nOn March 31, 2024, Harris made a social media post speaking directly to the community on Transgender Day of Visibility, an annual event meant to raise awareness about discrimination the group faces.\n\n'Every person in our nation must have the freedom to be their true self and to live free from hate,' she wrote on X. 'On Transgender Day of Visibility, I say to all trans and non-binary people: We see you. We love you. We will never stop fighting for you.'\n\nIn a contentious October 2024 interview with Bret Baier of Fox News, Harris defended her stance on giving gender reassignment surgeries to prisoners.\n\n'Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?' Baier asked.\n\n'I will follow the law. And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed,' Harris responded.\n\nThis was in reference to a Bureau of Prisons memo from 2018, where Trump administration officials acknowledged that they were legally obligated to provide hormone therapy and even sex reassignment surgeries to federal inmates if it was deemed medically necessary.\n\nThe New York Times reported that BOP officials during Trump's first term did provide gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, for a small group of inmates who requested it.\n\nBecause of that, Harris argued that the GOP's ad campaign was akin to 'throwing stones when you're living in a glass house'.\n\nBut on the debate about biological men competing in women's sports, Harris was notably silent. \n\nHowever, the Biden administration proposed an under-the-radar change in April 2023 to Title IX, the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any federally funded educational program.\n\nThe change would have have prohibited outright bans on transgender athletes but would have also allowed schools to restrict trans participation if they could prove it would harm the 'educational objectives' of other students.\n\n'The [Education] Department recognizes that prevention of sports-related injury is an important educational objective in recipients' athletic programs and that — as courts have long recognized in cases involving sex-separate athletic teams — fairness in competition may be particularly important for recipients,' stated a portion of the proposed regulation.\n\nThis rule change was withdrawn from the Federal Register on December 26, 2024. The Biden administration cited ongoing Title IX lawsuits and criticism that the regulation's language was too unclear as the reasons for its withdrawal.\n\nIn the aftermath of Harris' loss to Trump in the 2024 election, prominent Democrats pointed out that Biden officials, nor Biden himself, ever articulated this more nuanced position to the American people.\n\n'The White House could have said something in the election, they could have said Democrats want rules too,' said Lanae Erickson, the senior vice president for social policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank.\n\nErickson told Vox immediately after the election that his organization's 'number one' messaging advice was that 'Democrats want sports to be fair and athletes to be safe'.","summary":"The former vice president clearly stated in her new book, 107 Days', that she agrees with parents and athletes who are worried about transgender boys being allowed to compete in girls' sports.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15126127/kamala-harris-transgender-sports-concerns.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/23/17/102384373-0-image-a-30_1758645905348.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 18:09:16","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.133},{"id":362876848,"title":"Kamala Harris turns on Disney and blasts Jimmy Kimmel suspension despite cozy friendship with top boss: Live updates","text":"Seth Meyers said Jimmy Kimmel's comeback to late-night proves it is possible to stand up to 'bullying and censorship' from the Trump Administration.\n\n'It is possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship.

When Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska last month and showered him with subservient flattery, Putin saw it as a signal of weakness—and a green light to expand his drone and missile attacks on Ukraine and to extend his belligerence beyond Ukraine’s borders. This month, 19 unarmed Russian drones flew deep into Polish territory; Polish and European officials widely believe the brazen provocation was an intentional probe to test NATO’s air defenses and its willingness to respond should a member state be attacked. Afterward, the Kremlin ratcheted up its provocative rhetoric, with a spokesperson proclaiming that “NATO is at war with Russia.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, responded to the drone incident with a “disturbing display of nonchalance,” said Marc Champion in Bloomberg. “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones?” he pondered on social media before suggesting it may have been an accident. But last week, Trump provided a tiny sliver of hope by finally calling Russia “the aggressor” and laying out a plan “for pressuring Moscow to the negotiating table.” He said he’s ready to impose “major sanctions” on Russia, so long as the other 31 NATO member states do the same while banning all Russian oil imports. Given Beijing’s influence over Moscow, Trump also called on the alliance to collectively place 50% to 100% tariffs on China until the war in Ukraine ends. Trump has shown “tremendous weakness” in dealing with Putin, said The Washington Post in an editorial, but he “has a point.” Europeans greatly reduced their use of Russian oil and gas, but need to fully wean themselves off those purchases, which help fund Putin’s war effort.\nSince when did Trump become a multilateralist? asked Jim Geraghty in National Review. His insistence on NATO consensus looks like just another tactic to buy time for Putin. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who have a “much warmer and fuzzier view of Putin and Russia than the rest of NATO,” will either delay or reject Trump’s plan to boycott all Russian oil and slap huge tariffs on China, and Trump knows it. Putin is flying drones into NATO airspace and killing Ukrainian civilians by the hundreds, but for Trump, “there’s always some excuse, there’s always some delay, there’s always some reason to wait another two weeks.”\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

JD Vance, which ultimately left her disappointed. Harris writes in her new book, \"107 Days,\" that she needed the Minnesota governor to be the \"closer\" at the October 1, 2024, debate given that she was not going to have another opportunity to debate Trump. But during the debate, she turned to her husband in frustration. \"When Tim fell for it and started nodding and smiling at J.D.’s fake bipartisanship, I moaned to Doug, ‘What is happening?'\" Harris wrote, explaining how she believed Walz was duped by Vance’s \"mild-mannered aw-shucks\" attitude. \"I told the television screen: ‘You’re not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate.’\" HARRIS CALLS TRUMP A ‘TYRANT,’ LAMBASTS ‘FECKLESS’ CEOS FOR CAPITULATION Harris, who lamented that there was \"more riding on Tim’s debate than there should have been,\" said that being the \"closer\" and debating on such a large scale was \"not a comfortable role\" for Walz. \"He had fretted from the outset that he wasn’t a good debater,\" Harris wrote. \"I’d discounted his concerns. He was so quick and pithy in front of the crowds at our rallies, I thought he’d bring those qualities to the podium.\" Harris referred to Vance as a \"shape-shifter\" and said he \"complained petulantly,\" along with more critiques of Walz. \"Tim fell into a pattern of defending his record as a governor,\" Harris wrote. \"Then he fumbled his answer when the moderator, predictably, questioned why he had claimed to be in Hong Kong during the democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.\" KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE 'HAD NO IDEA' SHE 'PULLED THE PIN ON A HAND GRENADE' WITH 'THE VIEW' ANSWER ABOUT BIDEN \"Tim had been on his way to teach in China that summer but hadn’t yet left the United States on the date of the massacre. Instead of simply stating that he’d gotten his dates mixed up, but that being in China during a period of human rights oppression had profoundly influenced him, he talked about biking in Nebraska.\" Harris mentioned a Saturday Night Live skit after the debate that depicted Harris and her husband Doug watching the debate and spitting out wine in shock. Harris wrote that while she did not actually spit out wine while watching, \"it was otherwise uncanny in its portrait of our evening.\" \"Tim felt bad that he hadn’t done better,\" Harris wrote. \"I reassured him that the election would not be won or lost on account of that debate, and in fact it had a negligible effect on our polling. In choosing Tim, I thought that as a second-term governor and twelve-year congressman he would know what he was getting into. In hindsight, how could anyone?\" Harris wrote that she encouraged Walz to be \"resilient\" during the campaign and suggested that he struggled with the \"unfair\" attacks on his record and that it took a toll on his family.

And the higher you rise in the political food chain, the harder it gets. This is not a genteel profession. You must be ready to brawl.\" Harris also detailed in her book the decision process she used to ultimately choose Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Harris made a point of noting that her senior staff \"strongly favored Tim\" and that her godson, along with her sister and brother-in-law, also preferred Walz. \"Doug and I went back and forth,\" Harris wrote. \"He had known Josh longer and leaned that way. It was always going to have to be my decision. I told my staff and family that I didn’t want any more input, and I went to do something practical: I made a tasty rub and seasoned a pork roast.

The former vice president had given the matter “serious thought” in the six months since leaving office after losing the 2024 presidential election, but after “deep reflection” she had decided against it. Her heart wasn’t in it, her allies briefed reporters, and anyway, they whispered, she still saw a national role for herself.\n\nNow Harris is back touring the television studios to promote 107 Days, her new book about that ill-fated presidential campaign, and it is clear she is still contemplating another run. Appearing on the Rachel Maddow Show on 22 September in her first television interview since the election, she was asked whether she would consider running again in 2028. “That’s not my focus right now, that’s not my focus at all,” Harris replied, which is politician-speak for yes, she is indeed considering it, or at the very least, she is not prepared to rule it out.\n\nMaddow tried again. “When you said you were not going to run for governor of California, were you saying you were never going to run for anything ever again, or were you just saying you were not going to run for that office right now?” Harris demurred. “That was the decision before me, and I made the decision not to run for governor of California,” she said. The exchange made clear that no, Harris is not saying that she does not plan to run for office again, and yes, unfortunately for the Democrats, this is exactly what a second Kamala Harris campaign would look like.\n\nHarris is a highly accomplished woman, who was a historic vice president, and would undoubtedly have been a perfectly competent president. Unlike the current holder of that office, there is no indication she would have ordered politically motivated investigations of her opponents, sent the military into American cities, tried to seize control of the federal reserve, attempted to silence comedians, or launched a trade war against numerous US allies. But merely not being Donald Trump was not enough to win the White House in 2024, and neither is it a realistic strategy for the Democrats to regain the presidency in 2028.\n\nFor better or worse, American elections are not won on qualifications and evidence of competence or character, but on the ability to mount a compelling argument and lead a movement. By contrast, Harris still seems unable to give a clear answer to basic questions about why she lost and how her party should take the fight to Trump. Her instinct is to equivocate, and circle back to her talking points, rather than risk saying what she really thinks.\n\nWhen asked whether she endorsed the rising Democratic star Zohran Mamdani in his race to become mayor of New York City, for instance, Harris declined to mention his name. “Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee and he should be supported,” she said, deploying a bizarrely passive formulation. Pressed directly as to whether she endorsed his candidacy, she replied, “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” before pivoting to talk about other “stars” in the Democratic Party. Perhaps she was worried about the video clip of her endorsing the democratic socialist candidate coming back to haunt her in a future presidential campaign, which is exactly the sort of calculated obfuscation that helped to doom her campaign.\n\nThen there was her response to Maddow’s question about her decision to select Tim Walz as her running mate, instead of Pete Buttigieg, who Harris describes as her personal first choice in her book. Maddow, who is gay, said it was “hard to hear” the former vice president say that Buttigieg “couldn’t be on the ticket because he was gay”. “That’s not what I said,” insisted Harris, who then went on to make clear that it was, in fact, exactly what she had meant. As a black woman running for the presidency, with such a short campaign, and such high stakes, she explained, the idea of choosing a gay man as her running mate was “a real risk”.\n\nThroughout her new book, and the accompanying television interviews, Harris stresses the unprecedentedly compressed nature of her 2024 campaign. She seems to be convinced that, if only she had more time, she could have prevailed over Trump and made history. The clear inference is that, with enough time, in another campaign, she could yet succeed. But even as she was defending her loss, she was making clear why she could not win.\n\n“Maybe I was being too cautious,” Harris conceded of Buttigieg. That much, at least, was true. Harris’ reflexive caution and her apparently endless capacity for equivocation hampered her candidacy from the start. She still does not seem to be able to give a compelling answer as to what went wrong then, and what she would do differently next time, which should be disqualifying for the Democrats if they are serious about recapturing the White House in 2028.","summary":"On the Rachel Maddow Show, the former vice president obfuscated and equivocated","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2025/09/why-kamala-harris-lost","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/09/23/GettyImages-2176530267.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 17:26:59","author":"Katie Stallard","authors":["Katie Stallard"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":362897712,"title":"Key Seats Virginia GOP Hopes to Flip to Take Back State House","text":"As the 45-day early voting period has recently begun in Virginia—the second longest after the 46 days of Minnesota and South Dakota—I was reminded of a quote that former Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli shared with me from an election official about the strain it puts on them: “Someone forgot that election officials need to do laundry.” It is a heavy burden on everyone who wants to make sure that every valid voter casts his one valid vote.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was the impetus for these new “election seasons” replacing “Election Day.” In hindsight, the pandemic rules on social distancing and “stopping the spread” seemed discordant to many. We were told state employees had to be protected from possible COVID-19 spread at polling places and that the six-foot distancing requirements were going to overcrowd the polling places, so we needed mail-in voting and at least a month and half to vote to make sure everyone got counted.\n\n>>> Sign up for our Virginia email newsletter\n\nYet Virginia ABC employees received no such consideration, as they were to remain open to sell alcohol and even expand their hours—but no one noticed the disparity.\n\nSo, for 45 days starting in 2020, Virginians could turn up long before Election Day and cast a ballot. Moreover, they could request one by mail and drop it off in a drop box and never have to see, or presumably pass the coronavirus to, another soul.\n\nFive years later, we have in many ways “moved on” from COVID-19, though there are still a few souls seen walking on the sidewalk with a cloth mask on and vaccines are still in the news—mainly because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are moving away from mandates for anyone besides the very old or those with co-morbidities.\n\nHowever, Virginia’s 45-day-long voting season remains.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the American voting system had been a secret ballot cast in public. The casting of the secret ballot dates back to ancient Greece, and the “in public view” was a secondary policy to try to guarantee that the voter was not under any coercion.\n\nArticle 2, Section 3 of Virginia’s Constitution says, “Secrecy in casting votes shall be maintained, except as provision may be made for assistance to handicapped voters, but the ballot box or voting machine shall be kept in public view and shall not be opened, nor the ballots canvassed nor the votes counted, in secret.”\n\nSo, as Virginians head to the polls (early voting started Sept. 19), many wonder if the commonwealth will ever go back to an actual “Election Day.” I’m told by those in the halls of the General Assembly that best case scenario is a one-week early voting period. But even the suggestion of that brings cries of “Jim Crow!” and “Voter suppression!” and even “Poll tax!” from those who relish a system where as many as 50% of the votes will be cast outside of the community view through mail-in ballots.\n\nHow do we change this?\n\nThere needs to be a General Assembly willing to pass such legislation amending the 45-day voting period and a governor willing to sign it.\n\nMany of the 2025 campaigns for Virginia governor and House of Delegates have steered away from a debate on the issue because the Senate will remain in the control of the “pro-45-day early voting period” party for at least two more years.\n\nBut wresting a GOP majority in the current Democrat-run House could be seen as a first step. Here are the key House races that GOP insiders tell me they are hoping to flip:\n\nVirginia’s 97th House District that covers part of Virginia Beach: Democrat Del. Michael Feggans is finishing his first term in the House representing a district he won 51% to 46%. His opponent is former Republican Del. Tim Anderson, who was redistricted out of his district in 2023.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris outperformed Feggans in 2024, taking 56% of the district, but President Donald Trump also outperformed him, receiving 6,000 more votes than Feggans did, so Anderson’s job is to get all those voters back to the polls. This is also a district that Glenn Youngkin carried in 2021.\n\nVirginia’s 21st House District, covering part of Prince William County: Democrat Del. Josh Thomas is also finishing his freshman stint in Virginia’s House after winning the seat in 2023 51% to 48%. In 2024, Harris also had similar results, 51.5% to 45.9%. Thomas is facing off against Republican Greg Gorham, whose biggest challenge is fundraising.\n\nGorham currently trails the money race $740,000 to $20,000, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, but this is also a precinct that Youngkin, a Republican, won. And if the 19,000 district residents who voted for Trump come out for Gorham, it would be 5,000 more votes than Thomas received in 2023.\n\nVirginian’s 65th House District, covering Fredericksburg, Stafford and Spotsylvania: Democrat Josh Cole is not a newcomer, though there is a gap between his first term from 2020-2022 and this term in the House. He’s facing a challenge from Republican Sean Steinway, who has been “holding his own” in terms of fundraising, only trailing $668,000 to $402,000, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nThis is another of the districts that Youngkin carried (51% to 48%) in 2021 but that has been a Democrat seat in all the races since. In 2024, it went 53% to 44% for Harris, but the 19,000 votes Trump received is 3500 more than Cole received in 2023.\n\nVirginian’s 84th House District, covering west of Norfolk to Franklin: Democrat Del. Nadarius Clark is facing his first re-election test in the seat he won in 2023 53% to 46%. His opponent is Republican Felisha Storm, and the district went even more heavily for Harris in 2024, 54% to 40%. Trump received 20,000 votes in 2024 in the district while Clark received 15,000 in 2023.\n\nThe numbers show that for Republicans, this is all about getting their voters to turn out for an off-year election. And the Youngkin model seems to be to drive turnout. If the 32,000 ballots cast statewide just on Friday alone are any indication, someone is turning out.\n\nThe GOP hopes that its voters—who have taken a while to become comfortable with early voting but have seen how it helps their candidates’ campaigns with better resource and time management—come out in larger numbers and give them a chance to win back the House majority as well as the Governor’s Mansion for another four years. Perhaps then with their renewed authority, they can shorten that early voting window again.","summary":"As the 45-day early voting period has recently begun in Virginia—the second longest after the 46 days of Minnesota and South Dakota—I was reminded of...

Speaking with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, Harris was asked what she thought of Mamdani’s candidacy—and why so many top Democrats have been slow to back him after he beat disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the primary.\n\n“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee and he should be supported,” Harris said.\n\nMaddow pressed her: “Do you endorse his candidacy?”\n\n“I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” Harris replied, not mentioning Mamdani’s name. She quickly pivoted, saying, “He’s not the only star” running for office. Harris highlighted candidates like Barbara Drummond, who is running for mayor of Mobile, Alabama, as also worthy of major attention.\n\nHarris’ remarks stood out because other top Democrats—including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who would both be Mamdani’s constituents if he wins—have either kept their distance or opposed him outright. Even as Mamdani dominates recent polls, moderate Democrats worry his democratic-socialist label will give Republicans ammo to paint the entire party as too far left and hurt them in next year’s midterm elections. \n\nProgressives, however, have rallied around Mamdani. He has secured endorsements from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Harris’ nod should give him a boost heading into November.\n\nHarris’ interview made headlines for more than just the mayor’s race, though. Maddow also asked whether Harris was considering a 2028 presidential run.\n\n“That’s not my focus right now,” Harris said. “That’s not my focus at all. It really isn’t.”\n\nWhen Maddow pressed, asking whether Harris’s decision not to run for governor of California in 2026 meant she would never run for office again, Harris sidestepped the question again.\n\n“That was the decision before me, and I made the decision not to run for governor of California,” she said. \n\nOn the governor’s race, she added, “By the way, there are a lot of great candidates running, and I love my state. We want somebody to definitely follow in the footsteps of [current Gov.] Gavin [Newsom], in terms of standing up and understanding the power that California has to stand up to what we’re seeing in D.C.”\n\nHarris also weighed in on ABC’s decision to bring Jimmy Kimmel back on the air after public backlash to the company’s suspension of his show.\n\n“Talk about the power being with the people and the people making that clear with their checkbooks as it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel,” she said. “We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes. And it moved a decision in the right direction.”\n\nShe did not hold back when talking about Trump. Calling him a “tyrant,” Harris accused the president of “abusing the power that the people vested him with,” blasting corporations like Disney for giving in to FCC pressure when they pulled Kimmel’s show.\n\n“I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions,” Harris said. “And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been … feckless. It’s not like they’re going to lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons.”\n\nMaddow also pressed her on her relationship with Biden. Harris writes in “107 Days” that Biden’s decision to seek reelection was driven by “recklessness”—and she told Maddow she takes some responsibility.\n\n“So when I write this, it’s because I realize that I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on,” she said. “And so when I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I’m talking about myself.”\n\nHarris doesn’t shy away from drama in the book. She reveals that her top choice for vice president wasn’t Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz but was instead then-Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg—and that she ultimately passed on him because she feared Americans wouldn’t accept a ticket with both a Black woman and a gay man.\n\n“We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,” Harris wrote. Attaching a gay man to the ticket “was too big a risk,” she added.\n\nExpect more headlines as Harris continues her book tour. “107 Days” is already causing a stir—and Harris seems in no mood to stay quiet.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris waded into New York City politics Monday night, endorsing Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani for mayor and giving the democratic socialist candidate his biggest boost yet from the party establishment.\n\n\n\nThe endorsement came during Harris’ first major TV interview since losing the 2024 election to President Donald Trump, and it was timed to promote her new book, “107 Days,” a memoir about last year’s campaign.

And what was going through my head to not bring it up was that it would come off as being very self-serving, and therefore maybe lack the credibility that it deserved. But I do think about it. I do think about it,\" she said.\n\n\"And I also say, though, and I speak extensively about this, my concern about him running for reelection was completely separate from my admiration and knowledge about his capacity to serve as president United States, which was consistent and never wavered,\" Harris added.\n\nOn \"The View\" later Tuesday morning, Harris reflected on her loss, saying she experienced her deepest grief since her mother died of cancer in 2009.\n\n\"I've always on election night done family and friends and dinner. But that night, I grieved in a way that I have not since my mother died,\" Harris said, eliciting deep gasps from the audience. \"It was not at all about losing a race. I knew what it was gonna mean for the for the country.\"\n\n\"And all I could say over and over again is, 'My God, my God, my God,'\" Harris later added.\n\nShe was asked about her interview on the program during the 2024 campaign in which it took her nearly 30 minutes to answer what differentiated her with Biden, saying then, \"There is not a thing that comes to mind.\"\n\n\"That day in that interview, for me, really was symbolic of the issue. It was not -- it did not create the issue, but it was symbolic of the issue, which is that I am a loyal person, and I didn't fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden,\" Harris said. \"I thought it was obvious, and I didn't want to offer a difference in a way that would be received or suggested to be a criticism.\"\n\nHarris said she thought talking about her policy proposals on the campaign trail was enough.\n\n\"I thought I was making the point and I realize now that I didn't fully appreciate that how much of an issue it was yet that President Biden was deeply unpopular,\" Harris said. \"I did realize that.\"\n\nAsked by co-host Sunny Hostin -- who asked about differences with Biden last year -- if she thought her answer \"tipped the election,\" Harris said, \"No.\"\n\nCo-host Joy Behar joked, \"Good, because Sunny doesn't want to take the blame.\"\n\nBehar told Harris she thinks race and sex were factors in the former vice president’s loss and asked her if America would elect a woman in Behar’s lifetime.\n\n“I believe that we will,” Harris, who largely avoided talking about her race or sex during the 2024 campaign, told Behar.\n\n“Every office I've held, I've been the first, usually the first woman, and then often the first woman and the first person of color,” Harris goes on to say. “The only time, actually I was the second, when I was the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate in its hundreds of years history. So I'm not, I'm not naive -- race and gender do play a factor in some people's minds about how they vote. But my history tells me, because I have been the first in all of those that people ultimately want to know that this is the best person to do the job, and that's their focus, and that's how I've always run. I've never run as a woman or as a person of color because I believe I'm the best to do the job.”\n\nLooking ahead, Harris said the Democratic Party needs to focus on Americans’ immediate needs rather than longer-term projects like infrastructure, taking aim at the Biden administration’s messaging.\n\n“I think there's some work to be done, which includes one of the things that I think the '24 election made very clear, is the American people want their immediate needs met,” Harris said. “And you know, we paid a lot of good attention and time on issues like the infrastructure bill. If we had done it differently, and I think we should have considered doing it differently, we would have instead, in the Build Back Better bill, put the family plan before we did that. And so we would have done affordable child care and paid leave and address some of the more immediate needs of people.”\n\n“So going forward, I think that has to be an imperative. We will have the plan for what needs to happen in the long term, because those are the most intractable issues, but we need to meet the immediate needs of people,” Harris added.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on \"Good Morning America,\" said she does regret not challenging former President Biden's decision to run for reelection.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-admits-reckless-challenging-bidens-decision-run-reelection/story?id=125845609","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8aedbcb9-f111-4962-aad8-948083495081/kamala-harris-01-abc-jef-250923_1758629975640_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 16:47:00","author":"Fritz Farrow","authors":["Fritz Farrow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":362868632,"title":"Kamala Harris addresses her infamous interview foul-up on 'The View'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nMedia September 23, 2025 01:33 \n\n Kamala Harris addresses her infamous interview foul-up on 'The View' \n Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she didn't view her answer on \"The View\" in 2024 that didn't distance herself from President Joe Biden as an election turning point.\n Tags MEDIAV-VIDEO","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she didn&apos;t view her answer on &quot;The View&quot; in 2024 that didn&apos;t distance herself from President Joe Biden as an election turning point.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379993198112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/1a9c5e58-1ee0-4c51-9087-923d2066107e/4f44a18a-62cd-4fc1-9f36-2d6034fd0c58/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 16:39:25","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":362858370,"title":"Kamala Harris Addresses Doug Emhoff's Affair During His First Marriage","text":"Mom Shyamala Gopalan & Dad Donald J.

The National Association of Broadcasters, a trade association representing TV groups, released a conciliatory statement this week that simultaneously defended the editorial freedom of TV stations while pushing back against “veiled threats” of government interference.\n\nFor Nexstar, the favor of the Trump administration is particularly crucial.

Buttigieg, who went up against Biden and Harris for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 race for the White House election, was her “first choice.”\n\nHowever, it was “too big a risk”, she decided and plumped for Minnesota governor Tim Walz instead.\n\n “We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,” she said.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show, Harris was grilled by the gay host about the wording in the book where she said it was “hard to hear” that the then secretary of transportation couldn’t be her running mate “because he was gay.”\n\nHarris replied: “My point is, as I write in the book, in one of the most hotly contested elections… against someone like Donald Trump, who knows no floor, to be a Black woman running for president of United States and [have] a vice-presidential running mate [who is] a gay man, with the stakes being so high, it made me very sad but I realised it would be a real risk.”\n\nShe insisted that the decision not to go with Buttigieg, whom she described as “a phenomenal public servant,” wasn’t about prejudice, although she admitted: “Maybe I was being too cautious.”\n\nAmerica was ready for a gay leader, she added, and praised the man, still sometimes called Mayor Pete, for his ability to win over conservative voters.\n\nSpeaking to Politico last week, Buttigieg responded to the former vice-president’s comments, saying: “My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories.\n\n“You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them. Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things.”\n\nA poll in July made Buttigieg, who is raising two mixed-race children with his husband, the favourite to be the Democrats’ nominee ahead of the 2028 presidential election. \n\n107 Days is available now.\n\nShare your thoughts!

The move comes as other top Democrats have shied away from Mamdani, despite his landslide win in the Democratic primary in June.\n\n\"Look as far as I'm concerned he's the Democratic nominee and he should be supported,\" Harris said during an appearance Monday on MSNBC, but she also appeared to downplay his national significance. \"He's not the only star,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris's backing is notable as many Democratic Party leaders have so far declined to back Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party who has been critical of Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas's deadly terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023. \n\nSpeaking this month with the New York Times, Mamdani said he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on international war crime charges if the Israeli leader entered New York City.\n\n\"This is something that I intend to fulfill,\" Mr. Mamdani told the Times. This month, an international UN commission concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, an accusation Israeli officials reject.\n\nSome Democratic leaders have also distanced themselves from Mamdani because of his progressive stance on economic policies, including a call for a rent freeze, free childcare, and higher taxes for the wealthy and corporations.\n\n\"Socialism does not work and his proposed plans would make New York a less competitive city and state,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, a moderate Democratic congressman from Long Island who announced he won't back Mamdani.\n\nNew York's Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani in an editorial in the New York Times earlier this month, describing him as \"a leader who is focused on making New York City affordable — a goal I enthusiastically support.\"\n\nMamdani has also won strong backing from progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, and Sen.

She has been outspoken about her mother’s profound impact on her own life and career. \n\nThe former California Senator explained that the pain “was not at all about losing a race — I knew what it was going to mean for the country.”\n\nAs to why she lost the race, Harris acknowledged: “There are many factors... I think probably one of the biggest in my mind is that we didn't have enough time.”\n\nWhen co-host Joy Behar noted that she and many other people believe racism and sexism played a large part in why she lost, Harris disagreed. \n\n“I beg to differ, I believe that we will [elect a woman president]. Every office I’ve held, I’ve been the first,” she said. “My history tells me because I have been the first, that people ultimately want to know that this is the best person to do the job.”\n\nTurning her attention to Trump’s second-term presidency, she claimed: “He lied. Meanwhile, there are certain promises he did keep,” she said, listing “weaponizing the DOJ, silence critics against him, fulfill whatever his fragile ego needed through the tool of our federal government.”\n\n“It’s important as we move forward to realize that they did what they said they were going to do,” she continued. “This did not just happen overnight. He has been a useful tool for an agenda that is much broader than the individual.”\n\nThis is “not what a president does,” she added. “That individual ... decided he will be an emperor in his mind who will demonstrate his power by demeaning and belitling and making people feel small.”\n\nClarifying her reason for writing the memoir, she said: “It was important to me that history is written, that my voice be present.\n\n“This book is not about Joe Biden,” she insisted. “I love Joe Biden. I also am very clear and have made a point of making it clear — Joe Biden was a highly capable president who accomplished great things that history will talk about, and did in so many ways a lot of very hard and deep work.”\n\n107 Days is out now.","summary":"Harris opened up about painful loss of 2024 presidential election during Tuesday’s episode of ‘The View’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/kamala-harris-the-view-election-mother-death-b2832115.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/15/28/Kamala-Harris.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ikgy7la9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:45:31","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.087},{"id":362880278,"title":"Kamala on her presidential campaign: it wasn't her fault","text":"The title of this memoir refers to the 107 days Kamala Harris had to run a presidential election campaign.\n\nSo, in the very name there’s an implicit rebuke to the man who put her in this position: Joe Biden, who hung on for an indecently long while. 107 days is a rebuke but also a justification – there was, she keeps saying, just too little time to put her goods on show. There was also, it seems, too little time to hold anything so time-consuming as a primary, an opportunity for other Democrats to offer themselves. Nancy Pelosi declared that the process shouldn’t be an “anointment” but Kamala had other plans. She got in touch with all the party bigwigs for their support; the reply from Gavin Newsom, who probably fancied his chances, was, “Hiking. Will call back. (He didn’t).\n\nBernie Sanders, the best candidate the Democrats never ran (is it too late?) got straight to the point: “I supported Joe because he was the strongest voice for the working class. Please focus on the working class, not just on abortion.” That was prescient; her very favourite theme in the campaign was “reproductive rights”, though she never shows the smallest understanding of the other side’s position.\n\nThe 107 days also structures the book: it’s written as a countdown to the election, with flashbacks. And though we all know how the story ends, the accounts of the rave receptions, the endorsements from umpteen groups like White Dudes for Kamala, the enthusiastic youth gatherings, the benediction from Baptist congregations, all go to shore up the mindset that she was on a roll, that there was only one outcome.\n\nOne of the pleasures of this sort of memoir is the chance for score-settling, and Harris doesn’t pass up on this human impulse. So she puts the boot into Sleepy Joe at various points: not only did he not resign early enough (when he calls to announce he won’t be running she doesn’t even pretend to be sorry), but he did his best to mess up her chances. The old fool called her just before her debate with Trump, when she absolutely had to be at her best, to distract her with inane recollections; worse, he responded to a Trumpian calling Puerto Rico “garbage” by saying the only garbage was the Trump supporters, a remark Harris equates with Hillary Clinton’s disastrous “deplorables”.\n\nAnd she and husband Doug take it badly when, before he steps down, Jill asks her if she was supporting Joe. Doug’s response is: “They hide you away for four years, give you impossible, shit jobs [presumably sorting out the Mexican border situation] … never fight back when you’re attacked, never praise your accomplishments…and still they have to ask if we’re loyal?” That sounds like Kamala’s view of her four years in office.\n\nSee also: Kamala Harris's 'big blended family' – an It girl stepdaughter and the ex wife who is her 'great friend'\n\nShe also puts the boot into Josh Shapiro, who was one of her potential vice-presidential candidates, for pretty well measuring up the Vice-President’s apartment for curtains before she even interviewed him. (Interestingly she got her Norwegian aide, Storm, to drive the candidates to interview, which was their first vetting; Josh failed.) Her preferred candidate was Pete Buttigieg, but she sorrowfully admits that a gay vice-presidential candidate as running mate for a woman of colour married to a Jewish man would be too much for many voters. Mark Kelly, an actual astronaut, wasn’t pro-union enough, not rough enough. So she went for Tim Walz on the basis that he would pose no threat to her; he didn’t.\n\nWhere she’s genuinely eloquent is on issues like gun control, and her description of a school shooting during the campaign by a teenager with a semi-automatic weapon is righteously angry. She’s less convincing on Gaza (protests about Palestine pepper her campaign), though she was, admittedly, holding a difficult balance between the powerful Israeli lobby and the Palestinian activists.\n\nThere are some nice vignettes: in her meeting with Angela Merkel, the then German chancellor recalled how hurt she was when her opponents went for her appearance. “Don’t let them make you cry,” she advises. Doug features as a marital prop, though there’s payback for him too: he forgot her 60th birthday and tried to pass off as a present some jewellery he originally bought for their anniversary; the eagle-eyed Kamala spots the date and lets him have it. Her staff make the mistake of putting a big 60 on her celebration balloon when they know she’s stopped counting birthdays; rather brilliantly, she puts a stiletto heel right through it. Her aide, Storm, doesn’t let Doug off with more marital-missteps; she gives him notes to fill in for when they’re apart; a couple are reproduced with a scribbled heart.\n\nDonald Trump is given no quarter here, though it’s interesting when they actually talk, he’s almost fulsome. But her contempt for him made it impossible for her to envisage the possibility of failure: “We had plans for all kinds of contingencies…except the actual result”. So when she finally had to accept the unthinkable, the aides scraped the Madam President icing off the celebration cupcakes and brought them round as comfort food. \n\nThis is a vindication of her candidacy and it leaves open the possibility that she might try again. Plainly, she hates being unemployed. But she fails also to recognise that one reason people didn’t vote for her wasn’t the shortness of the campaign; it was that they didn’t like her.\n\nMelanie McDonagh is a columnist at The London Standard","summary":"For Kamala Harris, 107 days was too short... but maybe people just didn’t like her","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/books/kamala-harris-107-days-memoirs-review-b1249236.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/23/15/16/SEI267239045.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6p7avTv0-MzYL9J7h.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:45:08","author":"Melanie McDonagh","authors":["Melanie McDonagh"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":362852766,"title":"The case against Jerome Powell’s ‘reign of error’","text":"Special to WorldTribune.com\n\n By Stephen Moore, September 23, 2025\n\nIt’s hard to believe that a couple years ago Time magazine considered naming Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell as their Person of the Year. He may well have won, if it hadn’t been for someone named Taylor Swift.\n\nPowell has been idolized by the Left for one reason: He’s been a thorn in the side of President Donald Trump for years.\n\nIf Trump says “ying,” Powell says “yang.”\n\nLast week Powell finally lowered the federal funds rate, and better late than never. But his speech to the media was a tirade against Trumponomics.\n\nHe was filled with doom and gloom in his statement, telling global investors that the economy is growing at only 1.6% so far this year and is expected to grow 1.6% next year.\n\nWhat country was he talking about? Afghanistan?\n\nHere are the facts: In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. economy grew by 3.3%, and with a few weeks to go in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting 3% growth — twice Powell’s cracked crystal ball.\n\nPowell also never mentioned that real household incomes are up $1,100 for the first seven months of 2025. He never mentioned that capital investment — the seed corn of a growing economy — has been ramped up, with hundreds of billions pledged next year.\n\nHe attacks Trump’s tariffs and more restrictive immigration policies as restricting growth — and he has a point that those have slightly slowed growth. But he never mentioned the Trump tax cuts, the immediate expensing for capital purchases (which has spurred an investment boom), the deregulations that could save up to $1 trillion this year, or that Trump’s pro-energy policies have increased U.S. production of oil and gas to record highs, or that the area where job growth is way down is in government employment — which is GOOD for the economy.\n\nThere’s also something almost comical about a Fed chair who let inflation soar by 21% during former President Joe Biden’s four years in office — the highest rates in nearly 40 years, dating back to Jimmy Carter’s stagflation. He promised inflation was “transitory” — oops. Tell that to people whose grocery bills rose by one-third in four years.\n\nHe accommodated the disastrous lockdowns of the economy with nary a word of objection by shoveling trillions of dollars into the economy in 2020 and ’21.\n\nThe result: Americans saw a three-year crash in their after-inflation incomes. It was right and proper that Americans chased Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris out the door, but here we are nine months later, and Powell is still around.\n\nPowell is attacked by Trump as “Too Late Jerome.” But the reality is, he’s “Too Wrong Powell.”\n\nHis job, as former World Bank president David Malpass notes, should be “to defend the dollar and keep it stable in value.” Steve Forbes adds that Powell has followed the wrongheaded creed of the 300 PhD economists over at the Fed’s temple that growth causes inflation.\n\nHe has a bully pulpit that can and should be used to attack the dangerous levels of government debt and deficit spending. He rarely does.\n\nPowell’s defenders counter any criticism of the Fed by reflexively arguing that the central bank should be independent. Yes.\n\nBut it should also be competent and accountable. Under Powell’s reign of error, the central bank has been neither. He makes up monetary policy as he goes along, and that has increased the instability of the U.S. economy and financial markets.\n\nHe has been a walking billboard for a rules-based monetary policy — perhaps a gold or commodity standard.\n\nPowell should admit he’s in over his head and exit stage left now before he does more harm. But he lives in a media-created delusion that he’s the last line of defense against Trump. The good news is, at least he will be gone in seven months. Hopefully the next Fed chairman will learn from his series of blunders.\n\nStephen Moore is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a senior economic advisor to Donald Trump.

Copyright © 2025 by the author and reprinted with permission of Mariner Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\n“That I should be an American-born Chinese was accidental,” Bruce Lee once mused, “or it might have been by my father’s arrangement.”\n\nLee, cinema’s greatest martial artist and the most famous Asian American of all time, was born in San Francisco’s Chinatown on Nov. 27, 1940, in the segregated Chinese Hospital. His parents, Li (also anglicized as “Lee” in the U.S.) Hoi Chuen and Grace Ho, had come from Hong Kong a year earlier, sailing across the Pacific to perform Cantonese opera for Chinese American audiences across the United States.\n\nThey left behind three small children in the care of Hoi Chuen’s mother and landed in a country where Chinese were still unfree, alien, and unwelcome. They were here on temporary work visas. But even if they had migrated here wanting to become citizens, they could not. The Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned all immigration of Chinese with few exceptions, was very much still in effect.\n\nHad he been born today, Bruce Lee might have been called—in the divisive language we now use to describe immigration—an “anchor baby.” The derogatory term conjures the dubious notion that many migrant families are conspiring across generations to secure U.S. citizenship, and using their own infants to achieve that goal.\n\nBut the story of Lee’s family reveals the absurdity of that idea. Migration is always so much simpler and so much more complex.\n\n Slate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n Thank you for your support.\n\nIn 1939, with bombs falling near Hong Kong, the opera collapsed and jobs vanished. Hoi Chuen, born in the Pearl River Delta, had risen from poverty to become one of Cantonese opera’s great chou sang, or comic masters. Grace Ho, born into Shanghai privilege but disinherited after eloping with him, had experienced the steep drop from colonial wealth to uncertainty.\n\nTogether they gambled on a tour of America through the Mandarin Theatre in San Francisco. They calculated that, even with war raging across the border in southern China, leaving behind their children to secure work and necessary funds would aid their chances of survival should war come to Hong Kong.\n\nHad they come hoping to settle permanently in the U.S.? It’s highly unlikely.\n\nTheir first experiences entering the country reminded them of the second-class treatment that Asians in America faced. At the San Francisco docks the Lis were segregated from citizen passengers, then ferried to the Angel Island immigration station in San Francisco Bay, where, for three decades, most Chinese migrants had been detained.\n\nThere, the Lis dropped their luggage and proceeded to an administrative building, where they were separated from white migrants, then from each other. In a stuffy room, Hoi Chuen and a dozen other Asian men were stripped and inspected by medics for hookworm. They were led to a crowded men’s quarters, full of bunks already mostly occupied by hundreds of other Chinese migrants. Many had been waiting for a month or more to hear about their cases.\n\nCarved into the barracks’ walls were hundreds of poems, a graffiti feed in Chinese characters of throttled hope. One captive named Chan had cut these words into the wood:\n\n America has power but not justice.In prison, we were victimized as if we were guilty.Given no opportunity to explain, it was really brutal.I bow my head in reflection, there is nothing I can do.\n\nKnowing what was awaiting them on these shores, the Lis had already carefully prepared papers for their arrival. Hoi Chuen’s non-immigrant visa listed his purpose for visiting as “theatrical work only.” Grace’s papers described her as an “actress (wardrobe woman).”\n\nThe Mandarin Theatre staff had received approval from the Department of Labor to admit them. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service required that they secure a bond of $1,000 each (more than $22,000 in today’s dollars) that ensured they were “over 16 years of age,” remained “in possession of proper visas” and “free [of] contagious disease,” and would not become “public charges”—bureaucratese for “recipients of government funds or services.”\n\nAfter being cleared, the Lis were ferried back to San Francisco, shadowed by an immigration official. They were met at the pier by a theater representative, who produced more papers for yet another official. Once cleared, they headed directly to Chinatown to take their residence in the Mandarin’s quarters in a blind alley at 18 Trenton St., a block from the Chinese Hospital.\n\nThat day, Hoi Chuen later told his children, he had come to understand how unfree the Chinese were in America.\n\nChinese exclusion had produced new language—words needed to be invented for novel functions like “deportation”—and a new regime of papers. All Chinese Americans were required to carry “certificates of residence” and “certificates of identity” that verified their status as legal immigrants. They would be issued only after the applicant was vouched for by at least one white witness. Anyone without these papers became, in the historian Erika Lee’s words, “America’s first undocumented immigrants.” When migrants began crossing the Canadian and Mexican borders, Congress formed the precursor of today’s Border Patrol and ICE raid goons, gangs of white deputies who called themselves “Chinese catchers.”\n\nWhile his wife stayed in San Francisco, Hoi Chuen set out to tour the U.S. But he would only see the country through its Chinatowns, neighborhoods where racial segregation was enforced by laws, housing covenants, and custom. The cross-country trip to New York was particularly tense and taxing. “They weren’t allowed to get off the train whatsoever,” said Robert Lee, Hoi Chuen and Grace’s youngest son. “The only time they could get off was when they arrived at the station in New York.” In each tour city, immigration officials tailed them until they got back on the train.\n\nIt is hard to believe that Hoi Chuen and Grace would have wanted to subject any of their children to such treatment.\n\nBecause Bruce had been born in San Francisco, and though there is nothing in his papers to suggest whether it had been by “accident” or “arrangement,” he was a U.S. citizen. His birth would link him forever to the noble history behind the idea of birthright citizenship.\n\nSpeaking in 1867, just after the Civil War, as the United States was struggling to shape its future, the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass said of the Chinese, “They will cross the mountains, cross the plains, descend our rivers, penetrate to the heart of the country, and fix their homes with us forever.” Douglass and the Black freedom movement had pushed the country to grant citizenship to all born on its soil, an idea called “birthright citizenship.” He said, “I want a home here not only for the negro, the mulatto, and the Latin races, but I want the Asiatic to find a home here in the United States, and feel at home here, both for his sake and for ours. Right wrongs no man.”\n\nDouglass’ expansive vision for America did not prevail then. Between 1890 and 1919, as 16 million people immigrated from Europe, only 315,000 were accepted from South Asia and East Asia.\n\nBut birthright citizenship had been sealed in the 14th Amendment in 1868. To the exclusionists who wished to preserve a white settler nation, Asians born in the States—the “American-born Chinese,” the first “second generation” of Asian Americans—represented a vexing new problem.\n\nWhen Wong Kim Ark, a cook born a generation later in San Francisco, returned from a trip to China, he was barred reentry on the grounds that the Exclusion Act stripped him of citizenship. But Wong fought all the way to the Supreme Court and won in 1898. The court affirmed that the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to all born on U.S. soil, regardless of parents’ nationality.\n\nWong moved to Texas for a new start. But he was jailed there for four months by immigration officials who refused to believe he was a citizen. He continued to visit China, but on every return was required to fill out a form entitled “Application of Alleged U.S. Citizen for Reentry into the United States,” and subjected to what historian Erika Lee called “a barrage of humiliating interrogations.” When his sons applied for entry to the country, they were detained at Angel Island. Two of them were rejected because officials refused to believe his children were his own. One won his appeal. The other submitted himself to deportation. Still holding his certificate of identity, Wong Kim Ark booked a final ship passage to Toisan. Like his son, he gave up on America. In today’s dehumanizing language, he “self-deported.”\n\nIn 1941, with Hoi Chuen’s work complete, the Lis prepared to return to Hong Kong and filed papers to verify Bruce’s U.S. citizenship status. Hoi Chuen and Grace had worked with the Mandarin Theatre staff to hire an immigration law firm—somehow named White & White—to help them fill out Form 430, the application for a Citizen’s Return Certificate, on behalf of their son, whom they listed as “Lee Jun Fon (Bruce Lee).”\n\nBaby Bruce appears in a picture attached to the application, dated March 31, 1941, showing infant and mother. He is dressed in a knit sweater. His eyebrows are raised, cheeks puffed, lips pursed as if drawing an expectant breath, alert and ready for anything.\n\nDuring their interrogations, the “alleged father” and “alleged mother,” as they were called, were asked to corroborate their ages, places of birth, address in San Francisco, marriage date, the names of their sons, alive and dead, and their daughters. Hoi Chuen was asked, “Has Lee Jun Fon any other name?” He joked, “The doctor gave him an American name, but I can’t pronounce it.” Grace was asked, “Do you intend to have Lee Jun Fon remain with you until he grows to manhood?” She said, “When he is able to go to school, I intend to have him come back here and attend school.” Both were advised, “If Lee Jun Fon remains abroad for more than six months, he may be obliged to submit definite proof that he has not expatriated himself, if he should wish to reenter the United States.” Did they understand? Each of them answered through their translator—yes. In the section of Form 430 asking the reason for Bruce’s departure, the lawyers typed: a temporary visit abroad.\n\nBruce returned to the U.S. 18 years later. Forced to live in segregated communities, he found common cause with Black Americans, Japanese Americans, Filipino Americans, Latinos, poor whites, and other outcasts who taught him what it really meant to be a racialized minority, a true underdog.\n\nUpon assuming office this year, one of President Trump’s first executive orders sought to revoke birthright citizenship from any child of parents here under temporary visas or who are not lawful permanent residents. Trump’s intention is to overturn over a century of settled law. If the order—which has been halted until the Supreme Court rules on its doubtful constitutional merits—had been in place when Bruce was born, he would have certainly been subject to deportation. In this, his fate would have been no different than that of Vivek Ramaswamy, Kamala Harris, or Nikki Haley, all American citizens born to migrant parents in the U.S.\n\nWhile polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe refugees and migrants deserve the chance to belong and thrive in this country, the politics of migration eight months into the Trump administration has swung far beyond the reactionary. The America of today—in which anti-alien land laws have returned, in which the history of nonwhite communities are being erased from school curricula, in which migrants are indiscriminately seized, held, and deported, regardless of probable cause—is unrecognizable to many, even Trump voters, who have called this country home. In that light, it may be a small—yet real and necessary—comfort to remember that many of our greatest Americans, like Bruce Lee, became that way despite the ideologies and laws that were stacked against them.","summary":"How the story of Bruce Lee explains birthright citizenship and the stakes of immigration.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/09/trump-immigration-birthright-citizenship-bruce-lee-anchor-baby-history.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/31781f3f-59ea-41bb-bda2-cbfa018ef487.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:30:00","author":"Jeff Chang","authors":["Jeff Chang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.191},{"id":362868606,"title":"Will Cain reveals why Kamala Harris isn't a 'serious candidate' for 2028","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nAmericas Newsroom September 23, 2025 05:53 \n\n Will Cain reveals why Kamala Harris isn't a 'serious candidate' for 2028 \n Fox News' Will Cain joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Kamala Harris television interview and the latest on the fallout from Jimmy Kimmel's insensitive Charlie Kirk comments.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRAMERICA'S NEWSROOMPERSONALITIESV-VIDEOPOLITICSKAMALA HARRIS","summary":"Fox News&apos; Will Cain joined &apos;America&apos;s Newsroom&apos; to discuss his take on Kamala Harris television interview and the latest on the fallout from Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s insensitive Charlie Kirk comments.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379990733112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/f1f094c1-df89-4913-94e2-1ba3e07f6913/e765fcd8-141a-4c51-993d-0a537872f382/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:19:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.174},{"id":362890730,"title":"Trump’s Suffers Another Teleprompter Fail During His UN Speech and Immediately Threatens the Operator | Video","text":"President Trump was subject to some technical difficulties on Tuesday morning while giving a speech at the UN, saying his teleprompter wasn’t working.

But after the tense meeting they left with their jobs. \n\nA DHS spokesperson dismissed the article as a piece of 'gossip' that 'reads like a preteen rage-scrolling.'\n\n'It's not just lazy—it's libelous—peddling anonymous gossip as fact while ignoring our exhaustive, on-the-record rebuttals that destroy their narrative,' Tricia McLaughlin told the Daily Mail when reached for comment about the report. 'New York Magazine has sunk to new depths of journalistic cowardice, force-feeding the American public lies less digestible than Kibble dog food.'\n\nThe damning report published on Monday claims that Noem was upset with Homan for going on television frequently because she felt he had 'gotten out front' of her on certain immigration issues.\n\nAn administration official said, according to the report, that Noem 'tried to put a comms blackout on him.'\n\n'No truth to that,' McLaughlin said when presented with this detail of the lengthy piece.\n\nHoman and Noem hold senior positions within Trump's administration but do not have a direct subordinate-boss relationship. Noem is a Cabinet official running DHS, which oversees agencies like ICE and CBP; while Homan was appointed by Trump to operate border enforcement out of the White House.\n\nThe NY Mag article claims that Noem tried to tell Homan that he worked for her.\n\nBut Homan maintained that he worked for the White House and did not directly fall under DHS authority. This was confirmed by McLaughlin, who said: 'Homan works at the White House.'\n\n'The President's entire team – including Border Czar Tom Homan and Secretary Noem – are all in lockstep,' White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Daily Mail.\n\nShe added: 'They are implementing the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results securing the border and deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.'\n\n'Border czar' is a new position that has roots in the previous administration when former President Joe Biden named Vice President Kamala Harris to address root causes of the mass migration crisis.\n\nTrump made the role official with appointing Homan as 'border czar' in his second term.\n\nNY Mag details how anonymous sources detailed how bad the relationship between Homan and Noem got earlier this year when Trump asked his border czar if he needed to interview.\n\n'No, sir, we can work this out,' Homan responded, according to the article.\n\nIt's true that Homan has gone on television for media interviews at a higher rate than Noem since the start of Trump's second term on January 20, 2025.\n\nA conservative count shows Homan appearing in at least 38 televised interviews or segments from the start of the new administration through present day. This averages at 6 appearances per month, according to a C-SPAN catalog search that includes interviews on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CBS and ABC.\n\nIt's possible that not all appearances are included in the catalog.\n\nThe same search down for Noem shows she engaged in about 14 interviews in the same time, averaging about 3 per month or on every 17 days.\n\nAn administration official claimed in the NY Mag article that Noem 'ordered that [Homan] not go on TV; she ordered that basically no one go on TV in the entire Homeland lane.'\n\nHomeland's spokeswoman told the Daily Mail: 'Border Czar Homan, Acting Director Todd Lyons and Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, as well as CBP officials like Chief Greg Bovino and others are frequently on TV.","summary":"A feud appears to be brewing among Donald Trump's top immigration enforcement officials.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15125487/Kristi-Noem-border-czar-Tom-Homan-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/23/14/102376609-0-image-m-14_1758632494968.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:16:50","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":362876436,"title":"Kamala Harris reveals the real reason she avoided a gay running mate: 'It would be a real risk'","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris lamented the fact that she passed up on Pete Buttigieg as her running mate in the 2024 election, citing concerns that having a gay man on the ticket would have sunk her candidacy. \n\nIn a rare interview following her historic loss in November, Harris reflected on the choices she made during the 2024 campaign that may have led to her downfall.

Trump attacked UN members for immigration policies\n\nDuring his speech, Trump was highly critical of Biden's immigration policies, saying, \"We were the laughing stock all over the world.\" But he also attacked UN members for their immigration policies and declared, \"Immigration is destroying your country, and you have to do something about it…. Your countries are being ruined…. The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them…. Europe is in serious trouble.

The U.S. president told UN officials, \"Join us in adopting the exact same measures…. Europe has to step it up…. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia…. Cease all energy purchases from Russia.\"\n\n6.

Many European countries are on the brink of destruction because of the green agenda…. This is a disaster.\" \n\nTrump praised \"clean, beautiful coal\" and denied the reality of climate change, claiming, \"It's the greatest con job every perpetrated on the world, in my opinion….

Canada 2020 describes itself as \"Canada's leading independent, progressive think-tank\" and has notable alumni, including former advisory board chair Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nTo that end, cabinet ministers, staffers and former high-profile Liberals filled a ballroom at the Westin Ottawa to hear former Canadian cabinet minister Seamus O'Regan's fireside chat with Buttigieg. \n\n\"I did not imagine we would find ourselves in a moment like this,\" said Buttigieg, describing the current state of U.S.-Canada relations, inflamed by tariffs and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated assertions that Canada would be a good 51st state. \n\n\"The first thing I want to say is: 'I get it. And most of us get it.'\"\n\nHe said his goal is to \"puncture\" the idea that the current president and current government's \"outrages\" speak to the will of all Americans.\n\nHis comments are in stark contrast to those made by U.S. ambassador Pete Hoekstra, who said last week he was \"disappointed\" with anti-American sentiment in Canada.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that I came to Canada — a Canada that it is very, very difficult to find Canadians who are passionate about the American-Canadian relationship,\" Hoekstra said at an event hosted by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIt comes at a time where Canadians are taking a big step back from the United States.\n\nButtigieg, an avowed critic of Trump who frequently appears on right-leaning Fox News television shows, said the president has caused a strain between both countries — but he believes the relationship will endure.\n\n\"What's happening between us is a storm that's been provoked by what one government is doing, rather than something that calls into question the fundamentals of our relationship, which is between peoples, not only governments.\" \n\nHe said that Carney's \"Elbows up\" election campaign in the spring election, which focused heavily on asserting Canada's sovereignty in the face of Trump's trade threats, resonated with progressive Americans.\n\n\"In a way, that did not make us feel alienated from Canada,\" he said. \"To us, [it] did not signal a further step in the direction of rupture, but rather the kind of difficult realignment that happens with actual friends.\" \n\nHinting at a presidential run \n\nButtigieg ran in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and served as transportation secretary under then president Joe Biden. He had previously served as a naval officer and as mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Ind. \n\nHe came out as gay in 2015 and regularly talks about his husband and two children.\n\nHe is rumoured to be mulling a run for president again in 2028.\n\nDuring the fireside chat, O'Regan referenced 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's recent book, in which she reveals that she considered Buttigieg as a running mate, but had concerns that the ticket — which would feature a Black woman married to a Jew — would be taking on a \"big risk\" by adding a gay man. \n\n\"She felt it was more than the country could handle. And I wanted you to respond to that,\" said O'Regan to Buttigieg.\n\n\"There's only one way to find out what the country can handle,\" Buttigieg said, prompting applause in the room.","summary":"Potential U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says he did not imagine a “moment like this” between Canada and the United States and \"outrages\" directed at Canada and the Canadian government do not reflect the will of the American people.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/buttigieg-canada-us-relations-1.7640989?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7640992.1758638361!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/us-election-2026-redistricting-indiana.jpg?im=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 15:06:48","author":"Kate McKenna","authors":["Kate McKenna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.103}]}
