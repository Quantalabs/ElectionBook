He also earned a law degree from the Northern California private university.\n\nA lawsuit filed in January in U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia on behalf of Paul Brundage, who says he was injured by a COVID-19 vaccine, alleges Becerra failed to include the vaccine in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which provides financial compensation to individuals who are found to have been injured by a qualified vaccine.\n\nSome of the big-name Democrats running to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom include former Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), former state Sen. Toni Atkins, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state public schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond, former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former State Controller Betty Yee, and former deputy secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency Michael Younger.\n\nPublic speculation has also swirled around a possible run by former Vice President Kamala Harris, though she has not made a formal statement about entering the race.","summary":"Xavier Becerra joins a growing field of top-tier candidates vying to replace Gov.

That’s it.

Gavin Newsom.\n\nHarris is expected to make a final decision on her next move by the end of the summer, Politico reported last month. \n\nIn contrast to Becerra, Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep.

They walked out. Chants of “Take a walk!” echoed under the gold dome of the state Capitol from dozens of House Democrats who said they're exhausted by a blizzard of bills attacking transgender people.

The bill at hand, Senate Bill 185, would ban state prison spending on “sex reassignment surgeries,” hormone replacement therapy, or other surgeries “intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics.” The 100-2 vote, which sent the measure to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto, was a chance for Republicans to embarrass Democrats on an issue that the GOP believes is unpopular with voters.

After Donald Trump hammered Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on her support for transgender people, including those in prison, during the campaign he has issued a series of executive orders trying to reverse President Joe Biden's support for transgender rights. The walkout reflected a broader frustration at other measures. Until this year, Georgia had moved cautiously on measures against transgender people, even as other Republican-led states pushed much farther. Georgia lawmakers in 2022 passed a law that allowed the state high school athletic federation to rule out participation by transgender girls in high school sports. But top Republicans including House Speaker Jon Burns and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones made it a priority this year to outlaw such participation in high school sports and add a prohibition on participation by trans women in college sports. That measure, Senate Bill 1, has received final passage. In 2023, Georgia Republicans passed a law that banned gender confirming surgeries for those younger than 18. But unlike other states, they allowed youths already on hormone therapy to continue, and allowed puberty blocking drugs for those younger than 18. This year, Senate Republicans have pushed to outlaw hormone therapies and puberty blockers for those younger than 18. House members have watered down Senate Bill 30 to still allow access to drugs if two physicians approve. Its fate remains unclear with the session scheduled to end Friday. Georgia would move toward the forefront of anti-transgender legislation with a bill to outlaw state employee health insurance plans and the Medicaid health plan from paying for gender-affirming care. That measure is being pushed by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican and possible candidate for statewide office in 2026. It's also awaiting final action. The Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ rights group, counts as many as 14 other states that ban transgender benefits in public employee health insurance. It also says there are as many as 10 states where Medicaid excludes transgender-related care. In Georgia, lawsuits by employees, Medicaid recipients and prisoners led the state to settle lawsuits and grant transgender care benefits to each group. Opponents say the measures violate protections of the US Constitution and legally binding agreements made when the state settled the suits. Republicans claim rewriting state law will let the state annul those settlements. House Democratic Caucus Chair Tanya Miller of Atlanta attacked Republicans before the walkout over the prison care bill, noting testimony showed maybe five state inmates were seeking gender affirming care. “What is going on with my colleagues that they have become obsessed with what is happening in transgender citizens' pants and their underwear and their bedroom and their medical robes, when they talk to their doctors, when they deal with their families?\" Miller asked. House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration, a Republican from Mulberry, said the Democratic walkout equals \"support for taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for state prisoners.” “To see members flee the chamber because they are unwilling to actually represent their constituency, put the vote on the board and let it be known to all Georgians where they stand is incredibly disappointing,” Efstration said. The drama in Georgia came as transgender issues are debated in other states. In California on Tuesday, a committee blocked bills meant to limit transgender athlete participatio n even after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he believed allowing trans athletes to compete in sports matching their gender identity was unfair. Nevada saw its high school athletic federation vote to limit students to sports aligning with their birth sex. Colorado is considering a bill that would define it as discrimination to refer to a transgender person by their gender or name from before they transitioned. House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, dismissed Georgia Republicans' actions as “political theater.” “People sent us here to do great work,” she said. “They did not send us here to bully people, to ostracize people, to discriminate against people.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

His self-deprecating humor legitimately spans cultures and connects with audiences around the globe in a way that no one else really can.\n\nOne of O’Brien’s attributes is his ability to not go far-left in his political commentary. It’s strange to call that an attribute, but every single late-night host or comedian of his stature seems to have caught a debilitating case of Trump derangement syndrome—he’s the exception.\n\nO’Brien was rightfully honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor this year At the Kennedy Center—and his acceptance speech pushed the boundaries of his nonpolitical nature, sounding more like a pseudo-intellectual NPR lecture on the dangers of President Donald Trump rather than his typical fun-loving humor.\n\nHere’s one excerpt, and I would encourage you to either watch or read his entire speech for context:\n\nTwain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money-obsessed mania of the Gilded Age, and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance. Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He loved America but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.”\n\nThis statement was met with a round of loud applause from the Kennedy Center’s leftist audience—and was the perfect dog whistle to them.\n\nIn the first sentence, O’Brien claims that Mark Twain wouldn’t like Trump, capitalism, or nationalism. He casts a broad net to capture the hearts of an audience angry that Kamala Harris lost the presidential election just five short months ago. \n\nTranslated, he was saying, “Do you hate Trump’s populism as well as America’s free market economy, strength, and love for itself? Then you’re just like Mark Twain … and that makes you a patriot.”\n\nO’Brien then added the famous Twain quote that basically calls for everyone in the audience to protest their government: “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.”\n\nIt’s to be expected that his speech and the entire event would be anti-Trump, so I’m not personally angered by it—I’m just exhausted by the whole thing.\n\nI’ve reached my Laura Ingraham “shut up and dribble” moment.\n\nWe get it. You don’t like Trump—basically no one in Hollywood does. I, like more than half of this country, would just like to be entertained without a political lecture for once.\n\nAnd yes, I understand your belief that you must, “speak truth to power,” but when literally everyone else is doing it, that base is covered.\n\nHave you ever boarded a flight and seemingly everyone is in the “special” Group 1 when they board? If everyone is in Group 1, no one is special.\n\nIf everyone in entertainment is speaking “truth to power,” then it just becomes part of the modus operandi of entertainment—and even more people tune out.\n\nI’m not trying to control what Conan O’Brien says or does, nor should anyone—but this speech made me sigh and roll my eyes. \n\nThe 2024 election proved that a majority of Americans are tired of liberalism—and even more so, the failing film and entertainment industry. This should be a lesson to those who hold the microphone: Just be entertaining and give the same, tired political lectures a rest.","summary":"Conan O’Brien is one of our generation’s greatest comedians.

Yes, the “administration can flag certain words and phrases essential to the antiracist project. It can eliminate them from official executive branch pronouncements.” But “professional antiracists in faculties and bureaucracies won’t cede power without a fight.” “Uprooting the diversity ideology constitutes an existential threat.” “After this first round of executive orders and funding decisions, the Trump administration will have to get even more creative in combating a poisonous worldview. The battle is just beginning.”\n\nLibertarian: NIH Cuts Won’t Kill Bioscience\n\nCritics’ claims that Trump-proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health indirect funds “will annihilate biomedical scientific research” just “don’t stand up under scrutiny,” explains Zachary R. Caverley at Reason. “In the era before the NIH was spreading federal money,” US biomedical-science “was not hurting for private support”; “the public sector’s role” in research achievements “is often overstated.” Notably, the “chief innovator” of mRNA vaccine tech, Katalin Karikó, “was roadblocked for years in academia” before creating the Pfizer vaccine “in the private sector.” Public funding plainly “is not necessarily the crucial factor for scientific advancement and innovation.” “In practice, the private sector drives new technologies,” since it does “have motivation to invest in basic research.”\n\nNY/NJ beat: Pols’ Frivolous-Lawsuit Addiction\n\n“Lawsuits targeting industries such as energy, agriculture and manufacturing have become en vogue for populist politicians — and billionaire donors,” lament Alex Daniel & Tom Stebbins at USA Today. Yet these officials are “racking up a string of losses” at taxpayers’ expense. They blame energy companies for global emissions, though “emissions don’t come from energy production” but from “energy use.” That’s why judges have rejected several such suits. Similar ones notably from New York and New Jersey, have fared badly. These include New York Attorney General Letitia James’ suit against a meatpacker over its environmental impact. “When will these politicians learn from their repeated failures?” Gov. Hochul is adding judges to address a court backlog; better if pols just “stop filing bad cases.”\n\nAstroturf alert: Democrats Paid for ‘Brat’ Cred\n\nKamala Harris’ brat status last summer was “quietly funded by an elusive group of Democratic billionaires,” RealClearInvestigations’ Lee Fang reports. “Way to Win, one of the major donor groups behind the effort, spent more than $9.1 million on social media influencers during the 2024 presidential election.” Much of the cash went to Gen-Z friendly influencers, like comedian Illana Glazer, who “received Way to Win funding for a series of election videos called ‘Microdosing Democracy,’ in which she half-heartedly endorsed Harris as she lighted a spliff.” “While television or radio ads require disclaimers showing the groups responsible for paying for the advertisements, there are no equivalent mandates for TikTok stars or Instagram personalities.” To put it mildly, that “tidal wave of enthusiasm” for Harris “was not entirely genuine.”\n\nEye on Africa: Somalia Falling\n\n“For decades, the U.S. and African Union have sought to keep the government of Somalia afloat, but time is running out,” warn Jonathan Sweet & Mark Toth at The Hill. Muslim terror group Al-Shabaab is moving “to capture Mogadishu and establish a Sunni caliphate in East Africa.” Al-Shabaab could be Iran’s new proxy now that “Hamas and Hezbollah have been significantly degraded.” Tehran aspires “to shut down the Red Sea, and l-Shabaab could be the missing ingredient.” ISIS-Somalia, al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab are major threats “to the government of Somalia, international shipping lanes and U.S. forces in the region.” The Trump administration must address al-Shahaab’s enablers — namely, “the Houthi rebels, Iran and Russia.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Amid the Trump anti-DEI push, notes City Journal’s Heather Mac Donald, “private and public entities are also calibrating their language to preserve as much of the pre-Trump status quo as possible.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/opinion/anti-dei-fight-just-beginning-nih-cuts-wont-kill-bioscience-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/uopnl.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 22:30:59","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":307033964,"title":"Michelle Obama drops embarrassing relationship detail as she takes brutal swipe at Barack","text":"Michelle Obama made fun of Barack Obama being 'not financially sound' when she met him after months of rumors regarding their relationship.\n\nThe Obamas met in 1988 when the future president took a job at a law firm in Chicago for the summer where Michelle was already working. \n\nThe former first lady, speaking on the podcast she now hosts with her brother Craig, spent much of their most recent episode discussing having a partner with financial stability.\n\nTalking with Jay Shetty - a British author, life coach and, ex-monk who regularly interviews A-list celebrities on his podcast - Craig eventually put the question directly to his famous sister.\n\n'Would you be attracted to a guy who's not financially sound when you meet him?'\n\nMichelle immediately replied: 'Uh, I married one.'\n\nRobinson, a former college basketball coach, laughed and admitted to his sister that he'd set her up.\n\n'Don't you like that alley-oop I just threw you? In basketball, you just point, you don't even have to say it.'\n\nShe then became serious and admitted that her new love had given her the ability to take a chance on herself. \n\n'I left my corporate firm when I met Barack. I had somebody who was like, 'I got your back. The risks you think you're taking, they aren't that crazy, and I'm here to help you.''\n\nObama admitted: 'That's when I said, 'I would rather have that in a partner than a higher income. I would rather have somebody who is ready to do some hard things with me.' But that meant I had to be ready to do some hard things with him.'\n\nRobinson noted as Michelle answered that a lot of women are not as stable as she was at the age - about 25 years old - when she met Barack. \n\nMichelle spoke about the experiences of her friends, who she said 'dinged a guy' because he didn't have a college degree or other status symbols. \n\n'There are a lot of people who aren't looking deep enough, they aren't looking broadly enough about what makes for a good partner and instead we all just look at the superficial things,' she said.\n\nThe couple – who met as young lawyers working for the same Chicago firm in 1989 – celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary in October and delighted their army of social media fans by sharing a photo of them hugging each other at a museum in New York. \n\n‘I couldn’t have asked for a better partner and friend to go through life with,’ said President Obama in a message accompanying the photo. \n\nShe echoed the sentiment, saying: ‘32 action-packed years with my honey! Through it all, thank you for always having my back, being by my side, and finding ways to make me smile. I love you, @Barack Obama.’\n\nHowever, there have been rumors about the former First Couple's relationship in recent months.\n\nUnfounded rumors even romantically linked the former POTUS to actress Jennifer Aniston.\n\nHowever, the presidential couple have not been together in public since the Democratic National Convention in August when they each gave impassioned speeches in support of then Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Obamas have attempted to quash speculation about their marriage by posting a romantic selfie smiling and embracing on Instagram for Valentine's Day.\n\n'Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day, Michelle Obama!' the Democrat wrote in a social media caption.\n\nIt was unclear when the image was taken, but Michelle shared the same selfie on her own account.\n\nShe wrote: 'If there's one person I can always count on, it's you, Barack Obama. You're my rock. Always have been. Always will be. Happy Valentine's Day, honey!'\n\nThe Obamas have been spending an increasing amount of time in California since 2021 when eldest daughter Malia relocated to LA after graduating from Harvard to pursue a career in screen writing and film production.\n\nFamously, the Golden State was their first stop after leaving the White House in 2016 with the former First Couple treating their family to a vacation in a secluded Palm Springs mansion.\n\nSince then, their love of the famously Liberal state has only grown with younger daughter Sasha transferring to the University of Southern California from the University of Michigan in 2022.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in sociology, Sasha has shown interest in following her sister into the entertainment business.","summary":"Michelle Obama made fun of her husband and former President Barack Obama during an episode of the podcast that she hosts with her brother.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14565169/michelle-obama-relationship-swipe-barack-divorce-rumors.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/02/23/96852463-0-image-a-9_1743631522202.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 22:24:51","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

elections — Democrats are still in trouble","text":"Break out the big blue hype machine: Democrats and their media allies are swooning over Tuesday’s special election results in Wisconsin and in Florida.\n\nThey’re saying this is the start of the turnaround, a sign that people are rebelling against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nA party badly in need of a jolt got one, and best of all they got it the old-fashioned way: By beating up on the big bad orange man.\n\nIt’s a great story. \n\nThere’s only one problem: It isn’t true.\n\nOh, it’s true that Republican candidates ran well behind Trump in the key races. \n\nFlorida’s two new GOP congressmen, Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine, won by 14 and 15 percentage points in districts that Trump carried by 37 and 30 points, respectively.\n\nBrad Schimel, the GOP-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court, also trailed Trump by double digits. \n\nTrump carried the Badger State by about a point in 2024, while Schimel lost by 10.\n\nThe problem with the Democrats’ tale is that they’ve willfully misunderstood why these outcomes occurred.\n\nThe Democratic coalition has shifted a lot in the Trump era. \n\nThe party used to represent less-educated voters who were less engaged in politics, while Republicans tilted to the elites.\n\nNow that’s reversed: Democrats do best with highly educated voters who are highly engaged with politics, the people who vote all the time.\n\nToday, it’s the GOP coalition that’s tilted toward voters who only come out for general elections.\n\nThe lower the turnout, the more likely it is that Democrats will overperform compared to their presidential result.\n\nThe Florida seats are proof of this. \n\nThe composition of the electorates for the two specials was between five and 10 points less Republican than it was last November.\n\nAdjusting for that reality substantially reduces the degree of Democratic overperformance.\n\nTuesday’s electorates likely tilted even further away from the GOP when we consider registered independents. \n\nThese voters lean toward one party, but are much less engaged with politics — and tend to avoid special elections.\n\nRepublican-leaning registered independents may be even less likely than Democratic-leaning indies to vote in special elections. \n\nIf so, that would explain even more of the Democrats’ supposed overperformance.\n\nThe electorate for Wisconsin’s April election has long tilted left. \n\nLiberal areas, especially ultra-progressive Madison (Dane County) and its suburbs, accounted for a significantly higher share of the electorate in 2023’s April court election than in either the 2022 or 2024 general elections.\n\nThat happened again Tuesday: NBC’s Steve Kornacki reported that turnout as a share of the 2024 presidential vote was 11 points higher in Dane County than in Wisconsin’s largely rural, pro-Trump areas.\n\nThat shift alone likely accounts for a substantial amount of Democrat-backed Susan Crawford’s improvement over Kamala Harris’ result — an advantage that will evaporate next fall when less engaged, pro-Trump voters habitually turn out.\n\nThere’s a great example of how this works from 2022, when an August special election for New York’s 19th congressional district saw Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro on a low turnout of only 129,000 voters.\n\nMolinaro ran for a similar congressional seat (the old one had been redistricted) that November. \n\nThis time he won, doing notably better in the four counties included in both districts.\n\nIn Sullivan County, the Republican’s margin improved from 15 to 20 points as turnout more than doubled.\n\nMolinaro’s Delaware County margin jumped from 17 to 24 points, and he carried Greene County by a point more than he had in August.\n\nMolinaro even improved in Columbia County, a Democratic bastion he lost by 15 points in the summer but by only 10 in the fall.\n\nThere’s absolutely no reason to think that pattern won’t repeat in this cycle.\n\nMidterm elections are largely presaged not by special election results, but by the incumbent president’s job approval rating.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Democrats won 94% of the vote among those who approved of Joe Biden’s job performance — and only 12% among those who did not.\n\nThose figures would produce a good night for Republicans if the midterms were held today, with Trump’s 48% job approval in the RealClear Politics average (50% disapprove).\n\nIf those figures hold in November 2026 and the GOP does as well as Democrats did in 2022, Republicans will get 51% of the House vote — and likely retain their slim majority.\n\nThat would be an historic outcome, and Trump’s job approval rating may well decline over the next year and a half.\n\nBut presidential approval is the number we should be looking at, not special election results.\n\nKool-Aid is a tasty drink. You should have some if you want to quench your thirst on a hot summer’s day.\n\nDowning it is a bad idea, though, if you’re a political analyst or a party strategist.\n\nRepublicans should resist the temptation to drink the Kool-Aid of electoral despair Democrats are pressing on them — and focus instead on keeping the promises that won them the White House.\n\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.","summary":"Democrats giddy at results in Wisconsin and Florida have willfully misunderstood the reality of their shifting coalition.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/opinion/democrats-still-in-trouble-despite-special-election-hype/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/dkdkdkd.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 21:40:33","author":"Henry Olsen","authors":["Henry Olsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":307027120,"title":"Three states’ elections show early indication of voter sentiment","text":"A trio of spring elections offered early warning signs to Republicans and President Donald Trump, as Democrats rallied against his efforts to slash the federal government and the outsize role being played by billionaire Elon Musk in the early days of his new administration.\n\nIn the marquee race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat Tuesday, the conservative judge endorsed by Trump and backed by Musk and his groups to the tune of $21 million lost by 10 percentage points in a state Trump won in November. And while Florida Republicans held two of the most pro-Trump House districts in the country, both candidates underperformed Trump’s November margins.\n\nThe elections — the first major contests since Trump’s return to power — were seen as an early measure of voter sentiment as Trump works with unprecedented speed to dramatically upend the federal government, clashing with the courts and seeking revenge as he tests the bounds of presidential power.\n\nThe party that loses the presidency in November typically picks up seats in the next midterm elections, and Tuesday’s results provided hope for Democrats — who have faced a barrage of internal and external criticism about their response to Trump — that they can follow that trend.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the conservative activist and podcaster whose group worked alongside Musk to boost conservative Brad Schimel in Wisconsin, argued Tuesday’s Supreme Court loss underscored a fundamental challenge for Republicans, particularly in races where Trump is not on the ballot.\n\n“We did a lot in Wisconsin, but we fell short. We must realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now,” he said in an X post, referring to low-propensity voters who don’t regularly cast ballots. “The party has been remade. Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy.”\n\nMajor shifts in Wisconsin\n\nTrump narrowly won Wisconsin in November by fewer than 30,000 votes. In the first major test since he took office in January, the perennial battleground state shifted significantly to the left.\n\nSauk County, northwest of the state capital of Madison, is a state bellwether. Trump won it in November by 626 votes. Sauk shifted 16 percentage points in the direction of Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal backed by national Democrats and billionaire donors like George Soros.\n\nBesides strong turnout in Democratic-heavy areas, Crawford did measurably better in the suburban Milwaukee counties that Republicans rely on to run up their margins statewide.\n\nCrawford won Kenosha and Racine counties, both of which went for Trump over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. She won by about 10 percentage points there.\n\nIn interviews with dozens of voters across the state, including more than 20 in Waunakee, a politically mixed town north of Madison, many Democrats suggested without prompting that their vote was as much if not more of a repudiation of Trump’s first months in office than a decision on the direction of the state high court.\n\n“This is our chance to say no,” said Linda Grassl, a retired OB-GYN registered nurse, after voting at the Waunakee Public Library corridor Tuesday.\n\n“We have to fight, and this is where the fight is today,” agreed Theresa Peer, a 49-year-old business-owner born and raised in Milwaukee. She said she hoped a Crawford win would serve as a “symbol of opposition” to the Trump administration, particularly on the issues of women’s reproductive rights and slashed education spending.\n\nOthers disliked the richest man in the world playing such a prominent role. Musk was not only the race’s biggest donor, but he campaigned in Green Bay on Sunday.\n\n“I don’t like Elon Musk spending money for an election he should have no involvement in,” said Antonio Gray, a 38-year-old Milwaukee security guard. “They should let the voters vote for who they want to vote for instead of inserting themselves like they have.”\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a floor speech Wednesday, called the results “a political warning shot from the American people” and a sign that “Democrats’ message is resonating.”\n\n“Just 70 days into Trump 2.0, Americans are tired of the chaos. They are tired of Elon Musk attacking Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare,” he said.\n\nRepublicans warn against drawing national conclusions\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said that part of the challenge for Republicans had been “trying to connect the dots” to turn the state Supreme Court race into one about Trump — a difficult task in a state judicial race. He wondered if the outcome would have been different had Trump paid a visit instead of hosting a telephone town hall.\n\n“If you’re somebody who showed up for Trump because you feel forgotten, you don’t typically show up to vote in” these kinds of elections, he said, imagining voters asking themselves: “What does this have to do with Trump?”\n\nStill, Walker cautioned against reading the tea leaves too closely.\n\n“I’d be a little bit careful about reading too much into what happens nationally,” he said.\n\nTrump had better luck in Florida, where Republican Randy Fine won his special election in the 6th District to replace Mike Waltz, who stepped down to serve as Trump’s national security adviser. But Fine beat his Democratic challenger, Josh Weil, by 14 percentage points less than five months after Waltz won the district by 33.\n\n“This is the functional equivalent of Republicans running a competitive race in the district that is represented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries beforehand, invoking a liberal favorite whom Trump often denigrates. “Kamala Harris won that district by 30 points. Do you think a Republican would even be competitive in that district in New York, currently held by Alex? Of course, not.”\n\nJimmy Patronis, the state’s chief financial officer, fended off a challenge from Democrat Gay Valimont to win the northwest Florida seat vacated by Matt Gaetz but also underperformed Gaetz’s last margin of victory.\n\nPatronis carried the 1st Congressional District by a 14-percentage-point margin, according to preliminary results. In many districts, that would be seen as a landslide. But that’s less than half of Trump’s November margin of victory. And in a stunning development, Democrats were able to turn Escambia County blue, flipping the county that’s home to Pensacola in the ruby red Florida Panhandle.\n\nSally Dutcher, a 77-year-old retired search and rescue worker in Pensacola, said the time of “complacency” among conservatives accustomed to blowout victories in northwest Florida has to come to an end.\n\n“We’re overconfident,” she said. “And we need to not be.”\n\nStill, the pair of wins gave Republicans a 220-213 margin in the House of Representatives, where concerns about a thin GOP majority led Trump to pull the nomination of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to be United Nations ambassador.\n\nFor voters in both districts, the clear draw was Trump.\n\nTeresa Horton, 72, didn’t know much at all about Tuesday’s election -- but said she didn’t need to.\n\n“I don’t even know these people that are on there,” she said of her ballot. “I just went with my ticket.”\n\nBrenda Ray, 75, a retired nurse, said she didn’t know a lot about Patronis, either, but cast her ballot for him because she believes he’ll “vote with our president.”\n\n“That’s all we’re looking for,” she said.\n\n—By JILL COLVIN and MAYA SWEEDLER Associated Press\n\nColvin reported from New York, Sweedler from Washington.

Under President @realdonaldtrump, the border is CLOSED, with border crossings down 94% from last March,” said Emmer.\n\nRep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX), whose district is on the Texas-Mexico border, cheered on the achievement.\n\n“March recorded the lowest southwest border crossings in history – averaging just 230 per day,” De La Cruz wrote in a post to X. “This is the result of President Trump enforcing immigration law, repealing Biden’s disastrous open border policies, and allowing Border Patrol Agents to do their job.

The law firm Paul Weiss reached an agreement on 21 March to have an executive order against it rescinded. The decision to settle has roiled lawyers at the firms, some of whom have quit in protest. Other lawyers have said that the settlements only embolden Trump to continue to go after other firms.\n\nThere is a deep divide in the legal community about how to respond to Trump’s efforts to punish lawyers. Three firms – Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale – have all sued and successfully gotten court orders to at least partially block the executive orders. Covington and Burling, another major firm targeted by Trump because of its legal assistance to Jack Smith, has not taken any public action.\n\nBut many of the country’s most prominent law firms have declined to speak out against the orders. Trump himself has bragged about how easy it has been to get firms to acquiesce.\n\n“They’re all bending and saying: ‘Sir, thank you very much.’ Nobody can believe it,” Trump said last month. “Law firms are just saying: ‘Where do I sign? Where do I sign?’”","summary":"Settlements, one with Doug Emhoff’s firm, come as many fear Trumps’s effort to target firms affiliated with his rivals\n\nTwo more legal firms have reached agreements with Donald Trump to avoid executive orders that could significantly harm their business.\n\nThe settlements come as many have expressed deep alarm at the US president’s effort to target law firms affiliated with his political rivals and see the actions as a thinly-veiled anti-democratic effort to intimidate lawyers from taking cases hostile to the administration.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dedcaa6985964a99724b9b29893cd8f7d86f0e85/0_506_8192_4916/master/8192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 20:18:24","author":"Sam Levine","authors":["Sam Levine"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":307052860,"title":"You might be following Second Lady Usha Vance on Instagram now","text":"Starting Wednesday, Meta says it will begin combining the Instagram accounts of the Second Lady of the United States, Usha Vance, and the former Second Gentleman of the United States, Doug Emhoff.\n\nAs a result, the 1.2 million people who were previously following the Instagram account of Kamala Harris’s husband, @secondgentleman46archive (recently archived by the government), will now be following J.

As of the time of writing, her account has less than 66,000 followers.\n\n“Following the White House creating an account for the Second Lady, we are transitioning the Second Gentleman account to @SLOTUS,” said a Meta spokesperson in a statement to TechCrunch. “This is consistent with our process for presidential transitions and with the process we followed for the President, VP, FLOTUS, and The White House accounts earlier this year.”\n\nWhen Trump took office in January, a lot of users were confused as to why they were suddenly following President Trump on Facebook and Instagram when they hadn’t explicitly requested to do so. At the time, Meta explained this was part of a regular process in which White House social media accounts, including their followers, are handed over to the new administration when a new president takes office.\n\nUsha Vance is obtaining the former Second Gentleman’s Instagram followers now because the White House only recently created her @SLOTUS account, according to Meta. The first post on the Second Lady’s Instagram account is dated March 10, and Meta says she does not have an official Facebook account at this time.\n\nBe aware that if you try to unfollow @SLOTUS on Instagram, your request may not immediately go through. \n\nMeta says it may “take some time” to process follow and unfollow requests around the @SLOTUS account during this transition. It seems likely that users flood Meta with a barrage of follow and unfollow requests in these account transitions, which slows things down.\n\nMeta insists it never forces users to “auto-follow” accounts without a user’s consent. In this case, Meta says the White House itself controls these official accounts, and it’s simply assisting them in the presidential transition.\n\nWhile these White House social media accounts change hands every four years, they tend to create widespread confusion every time. Many users forget they ever followed an official White House account in the first place, especially if they had done so four years ago when the previous administration took office.\n\nHowever, it becomes much more evident which White House accounts you’re following when the new administration, which may not be the party you voted for, takes over.","summary":"Starting Wednesday, Meta says it will begin combining the Instagram accounts of the Second Lady of the United States, Usha Vance, and the former Second Gentleman of the United States, Doug Emhoff.

Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said in a statement.\n\n“I support the president’s agenda to put America first and start on a new path of American prosperity. I hope this brings our trade partners across the world to the table for more fair and equitable treatment for Americans.”\n\nBut others, including Democrats and adamantly anti-tax Republicans, came out sharply criticizing the tariffs.\n\n“They are a tax on families,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. “[Republicans] don’t like taxes? This is one of the worst taxes they could put in.”\n\nHe added that Democrats will “fight these tariffs tooth and nail.”\n\nSchumer was joined by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who has introduced a resolution to undo the fentanyl emergency declaration that Trump has used to levy tariffs on Canada.\n\nTrump has made sure to warn a group of tariff-skeptic Republicans not to sign on to the resolution.\n\n“Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats’ wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale … of fentanyl,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nPaul has called tariffs an “economic fallacy,” and Collins spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday in favor of Kaine’s resolution.\n\nKaine spoke of his resolution at the Wednesday press conference.\n\n“This is not about fentanyl. It’s about tariffs. It’s about a national sales tax on American families,” he said, echoing the often-repeated “sales tax” line of the 2024 Kamala Harris presidential campaign.\n\nNotably, however, when questioned by reporters, Schumer did not categorically reject the idea of tariffs as a matter of principle.\n\n“Are there certain tariffs that make some sense in a specific area where we were being treated unfairly? Yes,” the New York Democrat said. “The kind of meat-axe, blunderbuss approach that they use across the board on everything … is typical of this administration. They don’t think things through.”\n\nNevertheless, “liberation day” was greeted with enthusiasm by many legislators aligned with Trump’s policies.\n\nRep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., who has introduced legislation to increase the president’s tariff power, said in a statement, “We’ll force foreign competitors to the negotiating table, lower trade barriers, and ultimately create real free and fair trade across the board. I’m confident this move will boost our domestic manufacturing industry and fuel demand for American products across the globe.”\n\nRep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., called it the “[art] of the deal” upon seeing Ontario’s premier offer to drop tariffs in response to “liberation day.”\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said of the tariffs, “American products win every time. If foreign countries want access to us, it’s going to be on fair terms.”","summary":"Ahead of President Donald Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs on Wednesday, members of Congress offered sharply contrasting views of the benefits and drawbacks of applying tariffs...

He broke the record for the longest Senate filibuster ever, surpassing the late South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond's speech opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1957.Booker's speech resonated with many Democratic voters, who have been yearning for stronger opposition to Trump from their party's elected official, potentially giving him a chance to become a lead messenger for the party as they seek to carve out their strategy for opposing Trump. It has also led to some social media chatter about whether Booker could become a front-runner in the 2028 presidential primary.What To KnowBooker, who ran for president in 2020, hasn't officially said he's interested in taking another shot at the Oval Office. But some view the speech as a way for him to reintroduce himself to Democratic voters ahead of what is likely to be a crowded primary.Early polls suggest Democrats are divided about who should lead the party into 2028. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in November, appears to be an early favorite if she chooses to run again, but the election is still years away, and there's plenty of time for other candidates to break through.A Morning Consult poll conducted among Democratic voters from March 14 to March 16, 2025, showed that just 3 percent planned to vote for Booker in the 2028 primary if he runs for president.That places him behind Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, California Governor Gavin Newsom, businessman Mark Cuban and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.An Echelon Insights poll conducted among 1,007 likely voters from March 10 to March 13 showed Booker's support at only 2 percent.Kevin Hagan, a Democratic strategist from New Jersey with Princeton Public Affairs Group, told Newsweek he hopes Booker is interested in running for president. He called the senator's speech an \"impressive and important show of defiance\" that put him \"front and center\" with voters.Hagan said Booker represents a \"new generation of Democrats\" needed in the White House and congressional leadership.\"As Democrats prepare for the next presidential election, it's never too early,\" he said. \"And Senator Booker has the leadership ability to touch voters both intellectually and emotionally, and has a proven track record to stand up on issues for New Jersey and the country as a whole.\"Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek on Wednesday that Booker's speech raised his national profile and allowed him to fill a messaging gap within the Democratic Party. However, it's too soon to tell whether his speech will translate into a viable presidential bid.\"It remains to be seen whether his speech is anything more than a symbolic achievement, but it certainly raises his own personal national profile in a way that could be helpful for him to seek higher office as president in 2028,\" Panagopoulos said. \"But it is one of many considerations that will have to be taken into account that will influence how far he would go in the presidential process.\"Booker's reputation as one of the more liberal senators may cause some Democratic voters to question his electability for a general election, Panagopoulos said. The primary is also likely to be a crowded field, and his viability will, in part, depend on the strengths other candidates bring to the field.Still, he would be an \"energetic\" candidate who could mobilize the Democratic base, which Panagopoulos said is increasingly important in nominating contests.Anne Danehy, a professor at Boston University's College of Communications, told Newsweek that while Booker's speech \"absolutely could\" boost any presidential ambitions, a key question he faces is how to sustain this momentum over the next three years.\"It's quite a long time, and voters have a very short memory,\" she said. \"So what they love today, something else might pop up that's more interesting to them. So it depends on how the landscape unfolds.\"Danehy said it's \"unrealistic\" to expect Booker to keep up the same energy level over the next few years and that he would need to develop a strategy to build momentum, which would include staying engaged, frequent media appearances and building a strong brand.Dan Cassino, professor of Government and Politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told Newsweek Booker has made himself \"the face of congressional resistance\" against Trump.If Booker plans to run, voters will start seeing him campaigning with like-minded candidates nationwide in 2026 and using his leadership PAC to fund them.\"I imagine some of those trips would take him to some early primary states—purely by coincidence, of course—where he'd have a chance to meet with donors and activists,\" Cassino said.He said Booker's personal story is a strength, but that one question he will face is whether his \"relentless focus on positivity is a good match for the moment when voters might want confrontation.\"Of course, before 2028, Booker faces reelection in New Jersey, a state that shifted toward Republicans in 2024. While former President Joe Biden carried the state by about 16 points, Harris won it by less than six points.Panagopoulos said Booker will have to address whether his more liberal voting record is still in line with the state during his reelection. Booker hasn't said he plans to run yet, but election forecaster Cook Political Report classifies the Senate race as \"Solid Democrat,\" meaning it's not considered competitive.Booker ran in the 2020 presidential primary but struggled to break through the crowded field of candidates. He ended his campaign in January 2020 after failing to qualify for a debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses.Danehy said Booker struggled to connect with some voters because his message was more focused on working with Republicans, which locked in the \"power and anger\" voters sought at the time.His Senate speech is more emblematic of a message Democratic primary voters want to hear, she said. However, to avoid a repeat of 2020, Booker will need to develop a message that is more than opposing Trump and can focus on how he could turn the economy around.\"Cory Booker, he can't just talk about being anti-Trump for three and a half years,\" she said. \"He has to have his own message about what he has done and why he is a good alternative because there is going to be a lot of Democrats coming out and running.\"What People Are SayingRoss K. Baker, distinguished professor emeritus of Political Science at Rutgers University, told Newsweek: \"Thoughts of the presidency are never far from Senator Booker's mind, but I do think that his talkathon was more of a morale-booster for the sagging spirits of Democrats than a prelude to a presidential announcement.\"GOP Pollster Frank Luntz told NewsNation: \"He struck the kind of tone that grassroots Democrats are looking for. He gave them a reason to fight. He gave them a reason to stand up and say, 'This is my country too.' Of course, every Republican watching will say, 'This is nonsense.' But he's not speaking just to Republicans. He's speaking to Americans.\"What I saw over the last 25 hours absolutely blew me away. And just as you sometimes make projections or predictions, I'm going to do one right here. That speech puts Cory Booker as one of the leaders in the Democratic Party 2028.\"What Happens NextSeveral other Democratic politicians are viewed as potential front-runners. Harris hasn't said what she plans to do and is considered a possible candidate for California's governor race next year. Gavin Newsom, the state's current governor, is speculated to be a potential presidential candidate, as is Buttigieg, who has declined to seek office in Michigan next year.Most candidates will likely start announcing runs after the 2026 midterms, though some could announce earlier.","summary":"Booker's 25-hour Senate speech stirred presidential speculation—but experts say it's too soon to say if he'll be a viable candidate.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/cory-booker-senate-speech-2028-president-2054404","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2619674/senator-cory-booker-2028-presidential-speculation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 19:25:28","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":307000230,"title":"Brad Schimel Jeered By Supporters After Conceding To Susan Crawford","text":"Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate for a Wisconsin state Supreme Court seat, was jeered by his supporters after he told them he conceded the judicial race to his Democratic-backed opponent, Susan Crawford.Why It MattersCrawford sailed to victory in the hotly contested election on Tuesday evening, cementing the 4-3 liberal majority on the state's highest court.

Trump also threw his support behind Schimel.What To Know\"You put all your heart into it, and I can't thank you enough for everything you did to try to make this a success, but it just didn't work,\" Schimel said during his concession speech on Tuesday, drawing a sympathetic \"aw\" from someone in the crowd.\"Yeah, I've called Judge Crawford and conceded,\" Schimel said.His supporters immediately erupted, with several people shouting, \"No!\"\"Satanists,\" someone else was heard saying.\"We've got to accept the results,\" Schimel said as his supporters continued shouting and jeering.\"Cheaters!\" one woman in the crowd shouted. \"Cheaters!\"Another person was heard saying that it was only 9:30 p.m., local time, which was half an hour after polls in the state closed.\"I'm not up here to make any trouble,\" Schimel said over continued protests from his supporters. \"This is—the numbers aren't going to turn around.

Biden’s friend had calmed her down. “No problem,” he told the president. “You don’t have to thank me.” Biden paused and then said, “What do you think?”\nHis friend couldn’t resist this softball.\n“About what?” he said.\nBiden cracked up again. The president laughed for four or five seconds. And then, “in a very strong voice filled with timbre,” his friend recalled, “he said, ‘Hey man, that’s why I love you. You’re a fucking wise guy.’ And as he said it, I thought to myself, ‘Where did that voice go? Where did that guy with that voice go? What the fuck happened to this guy?’”\nWhat the fuck happened to Joe Biden during the final days of his presidency is a subject of increasingly contentious debate. Angered by his last-minute abdication from the race, Democrats have blamed the president for putting Kamala Harris in a no-win situation, with too short a runway to mount a successful campaign against Trump. Biden’s advisers, it is said, engaged in a cover-up of his deteriorating mental condition, which was dramatically and publicly exposed during the debate. In this version of events, Biden’s inner circle knew the president was non compos mentis and hid this fact from the American public.\nIn fact, it was stranger--and in a way, more troubling--than that. A cover-up, as we’ve understood the term to mean since Watergate, involves deliberately hiding something you know to be true. Biden’s closest advisers, however, were operating in a fog of delusion and denial; they refused to believe what they could see with their own eyes. Despite the president’s obvious cognitive decline, they had convinced themselves that he was fine. Their failure to recognize, up close, what everyone else could see from afar—that Biden was too feeble to run for reelection at the age of 82—led to a political disaster. And a relatively unproven national candidate, his vice president, was thrown into the race at the eleventh-hour against an emboldened Donald Trump. Biden had stepped aside on July 21—eight days after the GOP nominee had survived an assassination attempt.\nAnyone who’s ever had to persuade an octogenarian grandfather to give up the car keys knew that it was time for the president to step aside. (Seventy-seven percent of Americans and 69 percent of Democrats opposed Biden running for a second term. A goodly share didn’t want Trump either.) But in the summer of 2024, Joe Biden was having none of it. And neither were many of his family, friends, and advisers. Despite months of public opinion polling that showed Biden potentially losing to Trump in critical battleground states, they were all-in on his bid for reelection.\nTheir reasons were both understandable--and delusional. Biden’s naysayers, some of his advisers reasoned, had been wrong in 2020 when they’d pronounced him politically dead after he placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Biden had gone on to win the nomination and beat Trump in the general election by seven million votes. Come 2024, Bidenworld believed the doubters were wrong again.\nBut as George Clooney wrote in a blunt New York Times op-ed piece in the summer of 2024, Biden could not win the battle against time. His advisers should have known this but refused to face the fact, head on. Bill Daley watched this spectacle unfold in disbelief. Scion of the legendary Chicago Democratic family, Daley, who served as Barack Obama’s second White House chief of staff, says there’s a kind of myopia that comes with proximity to the president.\n“You’re in the bubble,” he told me. “You’ve crossed the Rubicon.” Something in the air of the West Wing clouds the vision of those who work there, particularly those who’ve been with the president for decades. “Everybody bought into it,” said Daley of the notion that Biden should run for reelection. “And once they crossed the Rubicon, they bullshitted everybody to stay out of the race.” Jack Watson, chief of staff in Jimmy Carter’s White House, compares working there to being in a magnetic force field. The gravitational pull to protect the president--at almost any cost--is immense.\nI had my own reasons for wondering if Biden’s White House staff was hiding him. As far back as September of 2022, when I asked for an interview with the president for my book on the first two years of his administration, The Fight of His Life, it was granted on one condition: I would send my questions by email and Biden would answer them in writing. It was clear, in hindsight, that the commander-in-chief’s aides didn’t want to risk having him interact in real time with a reporter. When I complained about getting emailed answers, I was told, “If it’s any consolation, we’re not even doing this for [Bob] Woodward.”\nAnd yet Joe Biden was no Woodrow Wilson. In 1919, the 28th president suffered a serious stroke; a cover-up ensued; and Wilson’s second wife, Edith, allegedly performed many of her incapacitated husband’s presidential duties. By contrast, whatever you may think of his policies, Biden governed competently behind closed doors. Visitors can attest that during meetings, he commanded every detail and nuance of Middle East policy. On the morning he stepped aside, when senior staffers arrived to hammer out the announcement of his abdication, the president was on the phone, parsing the details of a complex, multi-nation prisoner swap. Mike Donilon, Biden’s senior adviser and confidant, who was with him more than almost anyone, swears he never saw the president mentally diminished. So unless someone produces a failed neurological exam--or a deep-sixed Parkinson’s diagnosis--this was not a classic cover-up but a case of collective denial among Biden, first lady Jill Biden, and the president’s closest aides. Out of a desire to cling to power or just wishful thinking, they believed what they wanted to believe.\nStill, Biden’s team knew it had a problem: the president was a shadow of himself on the stump. That’s one of the reasons why, in 2020, they effectively arranged for Biden to run his campaign from his basement. In March 2024, a veteran Democratic operative interviewed for a top campaign job with Biden and his aides in the Oval Office. The job interview took a surprisingly candid turn. “Part of their discussion on the strategy of the [reelection] campaign,” she told me, “was ‘Hey, in 2020 we had this great excuse of the basement, of COVID, to keep him out of the public eye. We no longer have that excuse. What do we do?’”\nOver Saint Patrick’s Day weekend 2024, at a small White House party, Biden spoke to guests using a teleprompter. Daley (who, on a dozen visits to the White House, was never invited to drop in on Biden) couldn’t believe it. If the president needed a script for a small gathering of Irish guys, how would he survive the rigors of a campaign? “How are they letting this thing go on?” he thought. “This is crazy.”\nDaley ran into his friend Tom Donilon, a long-time national security expert and brother of Biden’s adviser Mike. Why hadn’t anyone spoken to the president about stepping aside and giving someone else a chance to beat Trump? “How are they letting this fucking thing go on?” Daley asked him. Donilon shook his head. “I don’t believe there’s anyone who’s had the conversation with him about not running, including my brother,” he said. If Mike Donilon, Biden’s alter ego, hadn’t spoken to the president about his age, it was almost certain that no one had.\nNor did Democrats dare talk about Biden’s age—at least in public. “Everyone ignored it,” said Daley. Challenging the incumbent president could be a political death wish. “Every politician, every big shot, they all bought into the attitude that if you run against him and he gets softened up and loses to Trump, you’ll be blamed and your career is over. Every freaking one of them had no balls.”\nWhen Daley heard that Biden’s aides were considering a June debate, he was aghast. It was pure hubris. “They were so cocky,” he said. “They got CNN, they got the moderators, they got the rules—no audience. They were telling[people]: ‘We got everything we wanted.’” Daley foresaw disaster. He called up Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients. “Jeff, I know you’re debating whether to debate,” he told him. “Do not do this. I’m telling you, don’t do it. I’m just telling you, come up with something, but do not do it.”\nOn Friday, June 21, 2024, Joe Biden arrived at Camp David to prepare for the debate. Just six days away, it might well decide the outcome of the 2024 election.\nThe president’s wobbly state should have been a flashing warning light. At his first meeting with Biden, Ron Klain, his former White House chief of staff, who was in charge of debate prep, was startled. He’d never seen Biden so exhausted and out of it. He seemed unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. The president appeared obsessed with foreign policy and uninterested in his second-term plans. During one prep session in Aspen Lodge, the presidential cabin, Biden suddenly got up, walked out to the pool, collapsed on a lounge chair, and fell sound asleep. Yet his advisers were undaunted. With unintended irony, one of them explained their strategy to me: “An early debate would quiet fears that the president was infirm.”\nThat evening, Biden met again with Klain, Donilon, senior adviser Steve Ricchetti, and deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed. “We sat around the table,” said Klain. “He had answers on cards and I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with NATO leaders.”\nThe first of two mock debates was scheduled to last 90 minutes but Klain called it off after 45. The president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the general subjects that might come up during the debate. “All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs,” said Klain. Biden had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term. Klain prodded him: “Look, sir, you’re not really telling people what you’re going to do if they reelect you.”\n“I’m not going to make more promises,” the president snapped. “I made too many promises in 2020 and I delivered on most of them, and all people remember are the things I didn’t deliver on.”\nKlain retorted: “Well, you have to make some promises to get reelected, sir.”\nIn hopes of piquing his interest in a forward-thinking agenda, Klain arranged a phone call with Melinda French Gates, a persuasive childcare advocate. Biden perked up briefly but soon lost interest again. At one point, Biden had an idea. If he looked perplexed when Trump talked, voters would understand that Trump was the one whose answers were batty or half-baked.. Klain replied: “Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you’re perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.”\nTwenty-five minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. “I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,” he said. “I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.” He went off to bed.\nKlain tried to remind himself that Biden had always been a game-day player. Maybe the president would rise to the occasion as he had often done before.\nTwelve minutes later came disaster. Asked about the deficit, Biden froze, his expression vacant; he seemed unaware of where he was. Some observers wondered if he was having a ministroke. Then he said: “We finally beat Medicare.”\nFrom behind the stage, in a green room, Trump’s campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita looked at his colleague Susie Wiles and Tony Fabrizio, their pollster, and said: “He’s dead. He’s not going to stay.”\nAs Biden continued to flail, Trump recognized what was happening and let his opponent self-destruct. After an incomprehensible jumble of words from Biden, Trump parried: “I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence and I don’t think he knows what he said, either.”\nKlain, Donilon, Ricchetti, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and other Biden staffers were watching the debacle from a room below the CNN stage. On a Zoom monitor they could see O’Malley Dillon at a separate location, monitoring “dial groups”—focus groups of voters who turned a dial up or down to register their approval or disapproval in real time. The Biden dials were headed south. It was possibly the most disastrous performance ever delivered in a presidential debate—and a fatal blow to Biden’s hopes for reelection. Any objective viewer could see that the president was incapable of waging an effective campaign against Trump.\nBut Biden’s team didn’t see it that way. Ricchetti contended that he thought the president had just had a bad night—like Barack Obama’s lackluster first debate against Mitt Romney in 2012. Dunn argued that the president had actually won the faceoff with the undecided voters who mattered. Like O’Malley Dillon, she’d been watching voter dial groups during the debate and noted that as it wore on, they’d disliked Trump even more than Biden. “It’s a good illustration of the difference between voters and elites,” she said. “Voters experience this differently. They hated Donald Trump. We actually picked up a few votes in the group.” Even the normally clear-eyed O’Malley Dillon grasped for a silver lining. Her first thought wasn’t “How can we talk to the president about stepping aside?” It was: not that many people had actually seen the debate. (Yet an estimated 51 million people were watching.)\nBiden’s key advisers were among the best and the brightest, adept at managing policy, politics, and public relations at the presidential level. But now they were the blind leading the blind. Some had spent decades rallying around Biden whenever he came under attack; their instinct was to adopt a defensive crouch.\nNearly four months later, when I spoke with Reed and Ricchetti at the White House, they were still trapped in that force field of denial. The problem, they insisted, wasn’t Biden’s condition, it was three weeks of Democratic infighting and the media’s obsession with his debate performance.\nAs Joe Biden convalesced with a case of COVID at his house in Rehoboth Beach, Maryland, the cries for him to give up his reelection campaign grew louder.\nOn Friday, July 19, Klain called the president. They talked about the growing pressure on him to withdraw. Klain urged Biden to resist it. “That’s my intention,” he replied.\nFor the next 48 hours, there was radio silence. Other than Biden’s Secret Service detail, the only people at the Rehoboth house were Jill Biden and his “body people,” deputy White House chief of staff Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, the first lady’s senior adviser. No one knew if Biden was considering throwing in the towel—but back at the White House, one aide thought the president’s silence was telling. “He’s somebody who checks in pretty frequently and wants to know what’s going on and wants to talk things through,” he said. “When things went quiet, I think we knew he was seriously thinking about it.”\nOn Saturday morning, July 20, Donilon and Ricchetti arrived at the president’s beach house. With more than 60 years of service to Biden between them, they’d been at his side through innumerable political and personal crises. But the president’s men had never faced a situation with such grave stakes for the country and the world.\nRicchetti, bearing polling data, went first. He told the president that while he was down by a few points nationally, and more in the battleground states, he was within the historical margin to come back and win. Public opinion wasn’t the obstacle; the party was. Most of its leaders were against him. “There’s a path for you to win the nomination and the presidency,” Ricchetti told the president, “but it will be brutal, and you will have to wage a fierce, lonely fight against your own party. This could hurt your reputation for being a unifying commander-in-chief that is core to you.” But if Biden wanted to run again, Ricchetti was all-in.\nIn fact, the path to a Biden victory was almost nonexistent; Trump’s polling lead in the battleground states was essentially insurmountable. But even at this late hour Ricchetti and Donilon were soft-pedaling this hard reality. What the president’s aides could not sugarcoat was the fact that the party’s leaders were about to lower the boom on him. “They knew the honeymoon was over that weekend,” a source close to the leadership told me. “Pelosi, Schumer, and Jeffries would have all been publicly calling for him to get out.”\nAs the walls closed in, Biden felt abandoned. It was his perceived betrayal by Barack Obama that stung most of all. What hurt was that Obama hadn’t picked up the phone and called him. “The one thing that still gnaws at him,” one of Biden’s close friends told me, “is the fact that Obama never called him to have misgivings about his candidacy—to say, ‘You know, Jeez, Joe, are you sure you’re up to it?’”\nBiden wasn’t even sure his White House staff had his back. “He was like ‘What happened here?’” said a confidant. “‘Why was there no one on my side?’ And he got very focused on whether or not people were being loyal to him inside the building. I think he lost confidence in the people right around him.”\nBut Biden’s major players were still with him; Donilon, Ricchetti, and Klain were committed to his reelection; they would have died on that hill. The president turned to Donilon, his longtime wordsmith “If I were to drop out,” he said, “what would it look like and sound like?”\nDonilon said he’d knock out a draft of a withdrawal statement. Biden told him, “I want to sleep on it.”\nAt about noon the next day, Sunday, Jeff Zients was in his West Wing office when his phone lit up. “I’ve decided not to run,” Biden told his White House chief of staff. Zients tried to engage him. “That lasted about a minute,” Zients recalled, “because he said, ‘What I really want to talk about is how do we have as productive a six-month period—that’s how much time was left—as we’ve had in the first three and a half years.’”\nWho, if anyone, should Biden endorse as his successor? It was a momentous question. Indeed, everything was riding on Biden’s successor—not only the outcome of the 2024 presidential election but the fate of Biden’s agenda, his historical legacy, and the future of the party.\nThe decision was Biden’s alone to make.\nJust after he spoke to Zients, Biden called Kamala Harris.\nWithin 48 hours, working the phones with her staff from her dining room at the Naval Observatory, Harris had all but clinched the nomination against all potential Democratic challengers.\nBut there were only 107 days until the election. The runway was short to mount an effective campaign against the Trump juggernaut.\nDemocrats had been saddled with the last-minute candidacy of an untested nominee. And for one reason: No one in Biden’s inner circle had leveled with the president about the folly of running at his advanced age and uncertain state. History will likely judge harshly the men and women who served him. Leon Panetta, 86, Bill Clinton’s former White House chief of staff and Obama’s CIA director and defense secretary, was blunt. “I think they were living in an isolated world,” he told me. “Everybody was marching to the same tune. And there was nobody there to say, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ They just never had a grown-up in the room who could look Joe Biden in the eye and say, ‘What the fuck are you doing?’”\nIn February 2025, more than three months after Harris’s defeat, Mike Donilon appeared at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at Harvard’s Institute of Politics. Biden’s confidant was more convinced than ever, he told the audience, that the Democrats had made a terrible mistake by forcing the president to leave the ticket. Just four years earlier, the man had won 81 million votes. “I thought it was crazy they would walk away from the single greatest vote-getter in American history,” Donilon said. “I thought it was insane. I think the party lost its mind.”\nBiden’s old friend—the one he calls a wise guy, who’d talked his sister Valerie off the ledge after that horrible debate—had a different view. Joe Biden, he told me, has yet to accept the way his presidency ended. “Depending on what day of the week it is, depending on whether he sees Trump on a video replay at night, he’ll say, ‘I could have beat that fucking guy.’ But he couldn’t have. I don’t know if in his lifetime he’ll ever really come to that conclusion. But that debate was it for him. You cannot erase that image in the minds of millions of voters.”\n\nFrom the forthcoming book Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History by Chris Whipple.

Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat.\n\nDuring his four years at HHS, Becerra drew criticism from within the Biden White House for his handling of both the COVID-19 pandemic response and the monkeypox outbreak, as well as for losing track of thousands of illegal immigrant children, many of them unaccompanied minors.\n\nBecerra—whose name Joe Biden famously mispronounced when the then-president-elect nominated him to the HHS post—previously served as California’s attorney general and before that as a 12-term member of Congress.\n\nBecerra joins a Democrat gubernatorial primary field that includes former Congresswoman Katie Porter and may yet include former Vice President Kamala Harris, who preceded him as the state’s AG.\n\nBecerra received no shortage of criticism during his tenure at HHS, including from members of his own party. As the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was being implemented during the first year of the Biden administration, White House officials criticized Becerra for apparent messaging flubs. Experts cited by The Washington Post said he had failed his primary job of marshaling Biden’s policy response to the coronavirus outbreak. \n\nEric Topol, the director of the La Jolla, Calif.-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which specializes in research aimed at individualizing health care by leveraging human genomics and combining it digital technologies, wrote that Becerra had “shirked other responsibilities.” He said those responsibilities included mandating collection of data and mediating fighting among the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhen the monkeypox outbreak occurred in 2022, Becerra was again blamed for a slow and insufficient response. The HHS secretary had recommended that states take a primary role in combating the disease, telling reporters, “We don’t control public health in the 50 states, in the territories, and in the tribal jurisdictions.”\n\nThe comments were reported to have caused a rift between the Biden administration and state health officials, who felt they were being set up to fail. In a Politico piece, one senior Biden administration official went so far as to describe Becerra as being “out of his depth.”\n\nLess than a year later, Becerra was again on the hot seat, this time over losing track of thousands of illegal immigrant children in the United States, some of whom were being put to work in violation of child labor laws or at risk of being sex-trafficked.

Laura Kelly, and Reps. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) and Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.) initially receiving donations.\n\nBetween September 2022 and November 2024, ActBlue racked up 1,900 fraudulent transactions in total, but House Republicans who published the company’s internal documents in a report claim the suspicious donations are far more “widespread.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether all the donations that were detected were returned, though internal records show that gifts discovered by the fraud prevention team were often rejected.\n\n“ActBlue acknowledges that serious gaps in its fraud prevention systems remain,” the interim report from the House Oversight and Administration Committees stated. “Internal communications explain that ‘if someone could coordinate a big attack where each individual donation fell below the [fraud review] threshold, they would go through.'”\n\n“Altogether, ActBlue’s internal documents and communications paint a damning picture: despite repeated instances of fraudulent donations to Democrat campaigns and causes from domestic and foreign sources, ActBlue is not demonstrating a serious effort to deter fraud on its platform,” the 478-page report declared.\n\n“At best, ActBlue’s conduct displays a profound disrespect for the principle that only Americans should decide American elections. At worst, it may violate the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which states that persons who “knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person” may face criminal liability.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) fired off a letter to ActBlue CEO Regina Wallace-Jones, demanding more documentation and details on the “internal turmoil” leading to resignations.\n\nSeven senior ActBlue officials have resigned from their posts as of late February, the New York Times reported, and the “last remaining lawyer in the ActBlue general counsel’s office” went on leave after alleging he was retaliated against.\n\nLast month, lawmakers requested Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from the Treasury Department about the lefty fundraising platform.\n\nThe Post obtained a GOP memo in October that claimed “hundreds” of the SARs possibly implicating ActBlue had already been flagged by former President Joe Biden’s Treasury Department.\n\nActBlue funneled nearly $2 billion in the 2024 election cycle to Democratic candidates and causes — with $46.7 million channeled directly to Harris’ campaign within hours of her succeeding President Biden as the party’s White House nominee.\n\nIn total, the fundraising platform helped raise more than $16 billion for Democratic groups since 2004.\n\nReps for ActBlue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"By December 2024, an ActBlue sheet tallying just the \"known instances of fraud\" revealed hundreds of donations -- including from Brazil, Colombia, India, Iraq, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia, among others -- were caught going toward Dem campaigns and causes.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/us-news/dem-fundraiser-actblue-made-donations-standards-more-lenient-received-foreign-contributions-during-2024-election-internal-docs/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/101559146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NGa8d0TJ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-02 18:13:28","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":306978064,"title":"How Strong Democratic Turnout Helped Susan Crawford Secure Victory in Wisconsin","text":"The decisive victory by Democratic-aligned Susan Crawford in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election is proof that the political engagement of the “resistance” remains sky-high in Donald Trump’s second term. And it simply overwhelms Republicans in a lower-wattage contest like this.\n\nCrawford’s 10-point win over Republican-backed Brad Schimel is a landslide compared to the last three presidential races in Wisconsin, all of which were decided by less than 1 point. The mismatch in intensity between the two parties is the reason why.\n\nTurnout for Tuesday’s court race stands at just more than 2.3 million. That’s a massive figure for an early spring, off-year race, but it’s still a far cry from the more than 3.4 million who voted in the 2024 presidential race in Wisconsin. And that falloff came disproportionately from the pro-Trump side. \n\nThe “resistance” enthusiasm comes from a particular segment of the Democratic base: voters with college degrees, higher incomes and vehemently anti-Trump views. They are predominantly, but not exclusively, white and are most concentrated in metro areas and college towns. They are plugged into heavily political, progressive-flavored media and have come to serve as a limitless source of online-fueled fundraising for Democratic candidates. And they are extremely motivated to vote, no matter the office, seemingly viewing any and every election as an opportunity to oppose the Trump-led GOP.\n\nNo place in Wisconsin embodies these demographics like Dane County; for that matter, few places in America do. Home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dane is almost 80% white and is the most highly educated county in the state. In the county, 56% of the white adult population has at least a bachelor’s degree, and more than a fifth of all adults have an advanced degree. It’s far more affluent than most of the state. All of this has led to it becoming a vote bank for Democrats. \n\nIn Tuesday’s election, Crawford won Dane by 64 points, and voter turnout in the county was 78% of what it was in November. And the voters who turned out were, somehow, even more Democratic-friendly than in November: Crawford’s vote share in Dane was 8 points higher than that of former Vice President Kamala Harris. In other words, Wisconsin’s biggest blue bastion got even bluer. \n\nCompare this to the other end of the political spectrum. The political base that powered Trump to victory in the Badger State couldn’t be more demographically opposite. Trump drew overwhelming support from white voters without college degrees who are found primarily in exurban, small-town and rural Wisconsin. In 2024, Trump also folded in new support from nonwhite voters, many of them younger, male and first-time participants, who are more clustered in and around Milwaukee.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was significant slack in this coalition. Two places tell the story.\n\nFirst, there’s the so-called “Driftless Area,” a mostly rural and small-town swath of counties along and inland from the Mississippi River. It was here in particular that Trump struck gold with blue-collar white voters when he first ran in 2016, and in 2024 he carried the area again by double digits. But in Tuesday’s election, there was far more drop-off in the Driftless Area than in Dane, with turnout running at 67% of November’s level. Tellingly, Crawford actually won the Driftless Area by 6 points, testament to just how disproportionate that drop-off was.\n\nThen there’s the Milwaukee area, where much of the state’s relatively small nonwhite population resides. Trump held Harris to a 44-point margin in Milwaukee’s majority Hispanic precincts last year, an impressive achievement for a Republican compared to the past. But in those same precincts Tuesday, turnout plummeted to just 49% of November’s level and the Democratic margin expanded back to 66 points.\n\nThis is all an inversion from the not-so-distant past, when the Republican coalition tilted toward the suburbs and was seen as more politically engaged. Back then, it was Democrats who had to contend more with the challenge of motivating infrequent voters for elections like this. Now, it’s a problem for the Trump side. \n\nThe president has assembled a unique coalition that, when fully activated, can win the popular vote in a national election. The question for the next two years is whether Republicans can rely on that coalition in an election that doesn’t feature Trump’s name on the ballot.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe decisive victory by Democratic-aligned Susan Crawford in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How Strong Democratic Turnout Helped Susan Crawford Secure Victory in Wisconsin first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-strong-democratic-turnout-helped-susan-crawford-secure-victory-in-wisconsin/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-How-Democratic-voter-intensity-powered-Susan-Crawford.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 18:12:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.092},{"id":306975648,"title":"Pelosi secretly tried to prevent Biden from ‘lowering himself’ by debating Trump in 2024: new book","text":"The authors of a new book on the 2024 election described House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., secretly urging President Biden not to debate then-candidate Donald Trump last year.\n\nReporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes spoke to former Politico reporter Tara Palmeri on Monday about several insights from their book “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.”\n\nThey described a secret conflict between Biden’s team and members of the Democratic Party in the lead-up to him dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nOne such person was Pelosi, who reportedly lobbied Biden not to participate in the infamous debate against Trump.\n\nBiden’s dismal, halting showing caused a crisis of confidence among fellow Democrats and ultimately led to his exit from the race.\n\n“Joe Biden wanted to debate really badly,” Allen said. “He wanted this fight. He relished it. You’ve heard Biden before say things like ‘I want to meet him out behind the schoolyard.’ He really wanted to debate.”\n\nHe continued, “Pelosi went to him and tried to play to his ego, saying, ‘You shouldn’t lower yourself, you shouldn’t lower the presidency to Donald Trump.’ Even in her mind, she would say to him, ‘Don’t roll around in the mud.’ Remember, she hates Donald Trump…She kind of lays it on thick with Biden and says, ‘This is going to lower you’ because she knows that might appeal to him.”\n\nAllen suggested Pelosi likely didn’t think Biden could manage a debate against Trump.\n\n“If she thought Biden was going to beat Donald Trump in a debate, she would have been telling him to debate,” Allen said.\n\nParnes added there were other people behind the scenes who encouraged Biden not to debate, such as former advisor Anita Dunn.\n\nHowever, Parnes said the campaign was “stuck between a rock and a hard place” after his poll numbers fell.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Pelosi’s office for a comment, but did not immediately hear back. Fox News Digital also reached out to representatives of Biden about the claims, but didn’t immediately hear back. \n\nOne month before Biden debated Trump in June, Pelosi revealed that she would “never recommend” debating Trump but thought the set-up was “a good one.”\n\nPelosi was a key figure in pushing Biden out of the race after feeling convinced from the debate that he couldn’t beat Trump.\n\n“The key figure in getting Biden to change his mind was Pelosi, who drew on their forty-year friendship. At first, she thought Biden could survive what he described as his ‘bad night.’ But Pelosi is an institutionalist; she loves the House, and her nightmare of not regaining control of that chamber (when Democrats were so close to winning it back) seemed to be coming true,” author Jonathan Alter wrote in his book “American Reckoning: Inside Trump’s Trial—and My Own.”\n\nBiden dropped out in July and the party quickly coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee. She went on to lose the general election to Trump in November.","summary":"The authors of a new book on the 2024 election described House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., secretly urging President Joe Biden not to debate then-candidate Donald Trump last year.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/us-news/pelosi-secretly-tried-to-prevent-biden-from-lowering-himself-by-debating-trump-in-2024-new-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-agd7hf4du-1743615541731.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743601190&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NGa8d0TJ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-02 18:04:06","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":306975660,"title":"Trump clinches deal with high-powered law firm that hired Doug Emhoff","text":"President Trump on Tuesday revealed he reached a deal with the high-powered law firm that hired former second gentleman Doug Emhoff — his latest agreement since targeting left-leaning white-shoe firms with executive orders.\n\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher — which hired former Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband in January — agreed to $100 million worth of pro bono work for causes supported by Trump, like assisting veterans and combating antisemitism, according to a post on Truth Social from the president.\n\nThe law firm also agreed not to engage in any diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices. \n\nWillkie affirmed its commitment “to give Fair and Equal consideration to Job Candidates, irrespective of their political beliefs, including Candidates who have served in the Trump administration,” Trump wrote in the post.\n\n“Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration,” the White House said in a statement. “The President is delivering on his promises of eradicating Partisan Lawfare in America, and restoring Liberty and Justice FOR ALL.”\n\nAlong with its ties to Emhoff, the law firm employs a top investigator from the congressional committee that probed the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nWillkie also represented Georgia election workers who sued former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani for defamation.

Bradbury is almost entirely comprised of gated sub communities and homeowners associations, SFGate reported.\n\nIf you don't already have a friend that lives there, it's not wise to go up to someone's house looking to make some. That's because the town has an ordinance banning people from walking up to front doors and knocking without permission.\n\nAnd since its founding in 1957, a time when the suburbs were expanding in Southern California, Bradbury and the residents who live there have said they don't even want cars passing by to stop for even the briefest moment, urging them to keep driving.\n\nThe town is so locked down that most of the public roads that abut its borders are dead ends or run straight into tall, guarded gates with signs that read 'Royal Oaks' and 'Bradbury Estates.'\n\nThe landscaping also does quite a bit to send the message that outsiders aren't welcome, with most homes being shrouded by towering hedgerows and bushy trees.\n\nBradbury’s 91008 ZIP code, which it shares with the nearby city of Duarte, has the 11th highest average income in California, beating out the likes of Santa Monica, Encino and the coveted 90210 of Beverly Hills.\n\nBeyond the security checkpoints and the foliage lie giant mansions with beautiful pools and neatly manicured lawns. And since they're on private roads, Google street-view stalking isn't an option to get a glimpse.\n\nSo, ordinary folks have to resort to luxury real estate listings if they want to get a better idea of Bradbury.\n\nTake for example the former home of real estate tycoon Don Abbey, one he had built for himself initially before he listed it in 2012 for $78.8 million.\n\nThe 35,000-square-foot property - across its main house and pool house - is a glimmering white masterpiece that sits on a hill, giving it breathtaking ocean views, according to an old listing.\n\nIt isn't a normal mansion, as it has a 2,000-bottle wine cellar, a poker room, and 10 car garage. It also has a massive pool shaped like a cross and a shooting range that Lucy Liu used to frequent, Forbes reported.\n\nWith all those perks and more, it sold for $22.5 million in December 2022, according to the Los Angeles County Assessor.\n\nSlightly to the west is the home of Hieu Tai Tran, the owner of the Shun Fat Supermarket chain, which has stores in California, Texas, Nevada and Oregon.\n\nThe property has four waterfalls, a tennis court, and a water slide the empties into a pool out on the front lawn.\n\nThe most notable recent resident of Bradbury was Lynsi Synder, the owner of In-N-Out. He lived in a 19,000-square-foot home for years before he sold it in 2022. \n\nThough there are plenty of mega-mansions, there are also more modest properties that appeal still to high-net-worth individuals but not billionaires. The median listing price for a home in Bradbury is $3.5 million. \n\nThe townsfolk have such deep pockets that former Vice President Kamala Harris visited a mansion in Bradbury to fundraise for Joe Biden ahead of his disaster of a debate with Donald Trump.\n\nShe did so for good reason. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 to win Bradbury, getting a majority of the vote there in 2020. \n\nThe town also has a myriad of other draconian ordinances meant to curb any sort of behavior that could be a bother to the residents.\n\nA section on 'peddlers and solicitors' that states that 'no person shall go upon any private premises within the City for the purpose of selling any goods, wares, merchandise, services or other thing of value.'\n\nThe city code also says 'no person shall be in any private house or on any private premises in the City in a state of drunkenness or intoxication to the annoyance of any other person.'\n\nEven profane language is not allowed on any public streets or businesses open to the public.\n\nTo cut down even more on possible commotion, teens under 18 cannot be out in public during a school day unless they're with a parent, have a note from the school or are on their way to a job.\n\nBut for the most part, Bradbury keeps its unique form of social cohesion intact by letting as few people in as possible.","summary":"One of the richest cities in America is shrouded in secrecy at the behest of its residents, some of whom are billionaires.

Gavin Newsom in 2028, joining seven other Democrats and one Republican — a flush field that could be upended should former Vice President Kamala Harris decide to run.\n\nBecerra officially declared his candidacy Wednesday in a video posted to his social media accounts following months of speculation among political insiders. The Sacramento native left his post in January as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden — a role now held by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also had previously served as a congressional representative for a Los Angeles area district for 24 years.\n\nIn his announcement, Becerra said he was running for governor to tackle the state’s affordability issues and restore the “California Dream” achieved by people like his working-class parents. His mother immigrated from Mexico, and Becerra said he was the first in his family to graduate from a four-year college. He rose to become the first Latino to serve as U.S. Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2021.\n\n“Can we do that today, with this affordability crisis?” he said in his announcement video. “We can do that, but you need a leader who can be tough.”\n\nCalifornia Democrats have broadly pledged to make the state more affordable after the November election, when state Republicans made modest gains and support for President Donald Trump surged even in deep-blue locales like lower-income Bay Area cities, fueled in part by discontent with inflation and relatively high costs for staples like energy, gasoline and housing. Newsom quickly reoriented his rhetoric to focus more on economic issues after the election, and Democrats leading the California Legislature declared that affordability is their focus during the two-year legislative session.\n\nIn his announcement, Becerra touted his track record of standing up to Trump during his tenure as California’s attorney general from 2017 to 2021. Becerra sued the Trump administration more than 120 times. That litigation cost the state $42 million, according to Newsom’s office, and netted victories. In one case, California and New York successfully sued the U.S. Department of Energy in 2017 to allow energy efficiency standards to go into effect nationally, which were expected to save consumers $8.4 billion and prevent nearly 100 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Another victory won California $60 million in federal public safety grants, according to the governor’s office.\n\nBecerra then led the massive U.S. Health and Human Services agency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pundits have speculated that could be a political liability with some voters, who may associate Becerra with California’s stringent lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.\n\nAlso as health secretary, Becerra said he helped negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors on Medicare. Biden’s signature climate bill, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, set a limit on out-of-pocket drug costs for people on Medicare and also capped the cost of covered insulin at $35 per month.\n\nBecerra’s announcement comes just weeks after former Southern California Democratic Rep.

The report – released by Alliance for Consumers (AFC) – highlights the deep Democratic ties of eight major consumer protection law firms - Morgan & Morgan, Lieff Cabraser, Motley Rice, Baron & Budd, Grant & Eisenhofer, Berger Montague, Cohen Milstein and Simmons Hanly - which it dubs the \"shady eight.\" According to AFC, these firms hold profitable public contracts across the country and contributed around $25 million in political donations from 2017 through 2024. In 2024 alone, the firms collectively donated $4 million to political campaigns, 99% of which were for Democrat candidates or Democrat-allied committees. EXCLUSIVE: GOP FIREBRAND DARES DEMS TO CONDEMN ATTACKS ON ELON MUSK'S TESLA During the 2024 presidential election, the firms contributed $1.4 million to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. The shady eight also prioritized midterm Senate races, the report found, with Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and former Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Bob Casey, D – Penn., and Jon Tester, D – Mont. receiving the largest contributions next to Harris. Five of the firms — Lieff Cabraser, Motley Rice, Grant & Eisenhofer, Simmons Hanly, and Baron & Budd – showed a 100% commitment to Democrats and their allies, generating more than $2.5 million in federal donations in 2024. \"The consumer should never be on the losing side of a left-wing political money game like what is on display in the Shady Trial Lawyer Pipeline,\" AFC says in its report. \"This partisan political giving is supported by money from public contracts signed by politicians and public officials; money that belongs to the taxpayers and consumers.\" TESLA HYPOCRISY: DEMS CONTINUE INVESTING IN ELON MUSK COMPANY DESPITE PAINTING HIM AS VILLAIN AFC said \"the ‘Shady Eight’ are stark examples—although far from the only ones—of how the Shady Trial Lawyer Pipeline works, with politicians feeding sweetheart contracts to trial lawyers who give 99% of their political donations to liberals and will happily turn around and pump millions of dollars into left-leaning candidates, committees, and allied organizations.\" O.H.

While satire and brand humor are common tactics used to generate buzz, fake headlines—especially those involving high-profile individuals and large dollar figures—can sow temporary chaos and undermine trust in legitimate reporting.This incident also highlights the evolving role of media literacy. As companies and publications use increasingly sophisticated humor to attract attention, readers must distinguish between fact and fiction, especially on platforms where context is often stripped away.The other context is that Buffett used to openly support the Democrats, hosting fundraisers for President Barack Obama and backing Hillary Clinton at a 2016 rally. However, he did not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris or anyone else last year.What To KnowTesla shareholder Eva McMillan, who has in her bio on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter, that she is the First Tesla S Plaid owner in Florida, was one of the many who posted about the prank.She seemed to fall for it as she posted a screengrab of the headline with the caption: \"BREAKING: Warren Buffet buys Tesla $TSLA stock for $1 Trillion in cash. Finally Telsa.\" But she also posted underneath it: \"This could be April fools day news.\"The post had more than 50,000 views and 143 shares.Not everyone who spoke about the story was fooled, with many users commenting on the post that it was a joke. One account, @ISpoLies, said: \"Nothing to be taken serious today.\"DOGE News, a fan page for the Musk-headed Department of Government Efficiency, posted: \"Anyone fall for an April Fool's joke today or were they all too over the top to fall for?\"User Renee, @PierretteDe2, said: \"I know someone who fell for the Warren Buffet buying Tesla Hoax.\"User @CaoChangqing, a conservative who often posts political commentary, also posted about the article in Chinese.\"While Tesla cars were destroyed and Musk was attacked by the left-wing media, Buffett, known as the 'stock god', announced today that he would use $1 trillion in cash to buy Tesla! The media said that this was a huge deal that had never been seen in business history,\" @CaoChangqing wrote, according to a translation given by X.The post received more than 123,000 views and was shared at least 300 times.There has been no public response from Buffett or Musk. Newsweek has contacted Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance via email for comment.April Fools' Day has become a favorite opportunity for companies to grab attention through outlandish or humorous announcements. This year, brands launched campaigns ranging from fake sweat-stained workout gear by Set Active to a fictitious five-year global cruise with Duolingo. Guido Campello, co-CEO of lingerie brand Journelle, said the day offers \"a unique opportunity for brands...to engage customers with a playful twist,\" per USA Today.Not all pranks go over well. Yahoo's Buffett-Tesla gag follows a long line of corporate April 1 misfires. Google had to apologize in 2016 after a prank Gmail feature sent users unintended \"mic drop\" GIFs. Musk himself once joked that Tesla had gone \"completely and totally bankrupt\" in 2018—right after a significant drop in the company's stock price, a move that rattled investors.What People Are SayingX user @CaoChangqing: \"It seems that (Buffett) knows better that Musk is 'doing big things' and helping President Trump save our country.\"The stock god used to lean to the left, but now he has begun to sober up. If someone this old can sober up, young people under 90 years old are still not clear, they are harming themselves.\"Musk posted last year on X that Buffett \"should take a position in Tesla. It's an obvious move.\"What Happens NextWhile the Tesla acquisition hoax may not carry lasting consequences, its spread serves as a reminder of how easily satire can be misinterpreted in a digital environment.In an age of viral news and AI-generated content, even jokes come with reputational risks.","summary":"April Fools' Day prank sparked confusion online after an article falsely claimed Buffett had acquired Tesla for $1 trillion.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/april-fools-day-tesla-warren-buffett-2054178","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2619590/warren-buffett.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 16:14:15","author":"Jordan King","authors":["Jordan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":306936478,"title":"Ex-Biden aide Ron Klain was alarmed by ‘out of it’ prez ahead of disaster debate, book says","text":"WASHINGTON — Ron Klain, a longtime aide to former President Joe Biden known for his intense loyalty, is insisting he “never doubted” Biden’s mental fitness — as a new book describes Klain’s distress ahead of Biden’s dismal June 2024 debate against Donald Trump.\n\nIn “Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,” author Chris Whipple writes that Klain viewed Biden, then 81, as “out of it” and even “half-seriously” worried that Biden thought he was “president of NATO.”\n\n“I never doubted the president’s mental acuity,” Klain told The Post Wednesday after a report on Whipple’s book was published by The Guardian.\n\n“He had become singularly focused on foreign policy and detached from Democratic allies in the pursuit of GOP support on Ukraine and Israel,” Klain said of his impressions of the 46th president.\n\n“He thought that being a great foreign policy president was enough.”\n\nBiden shocked a worldwide audience with his performance in the debate, appearing vacuous and struggling to make coherent points — even saying at one point that he “finally beat Medicare.”\n\nAlthough Biden and his allies blamed illness for the weak performance, fellow Democrats forced him to end his campaign for re-election weeks later over concern about his perceived cognitive decline — setting the stage for then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ unsuccessful substitute candidacy.\n\nWhipple writes that Klain, Biden’s White House chief of staff from 2021 to 2023, was “startled” when he arrived at Camp David to help with debate prep.\n\n“He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it,” the author relates.\n\n“We sat around the table,” Klain told Whipple, who is an authority on White House dynamics and best known for his 2017 book “Gatekeepers” about the role of the chief of staff.\n\n“[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted,” Klain said.\n\n“And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was.

And we won,” she told cheering supporters on Tuesday night.\n\nThe result is politically significant because the court is due to issue abortion rulings while also deciding on electoral redistricting questions which now have the potential to help Democrats in future elections in a state where contests are traditionally close.\n\nDemocrats have sought to exploit Musk’s growing unpopularity to tar Trump and the Republican generally. Recent polls show a majority of voters have a negative view of Musk, who was once popular with the US public.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, said it was now on Republicans to separate themselves from Musk.\n\n“Time for them to walk away from this unelected, unpopular, unhinged and un-American billionaire puppet master,” he told MSNBC. “He tried to spend his unlimited resources to buy a state supreme court seat in Wisconsin, and it failed spectacularly.”\n\nChuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the Senate, said the result “sent a decisive message to Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Doge… our democracy is not for sale.”\n\nOther party figures were blunter. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris’s running mate for the Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, was succinct on Musk’s social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Wisconsin beat the billionaire,” he posted.\n\nJasmine Crockett, a Democrat House member from Texas, posted: “Well well well, I guess Wisconsin agreed on the message for old Elon: “F’ off!,” she wrote.\n\nEric Swalwell, a California representative, called the result an “ass-kicking” for Republicans, adding: “Where else does Elon want to try and buy an election.”\n\nJB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois and himself a billionaire, wrote: “Elon Musk is not good at this.”\n\nSuspicions that Musk’s profile and conspicuous wealth have become an electoral turnoff also appeared to infect Republicans.\n\nPam Van Handel, a Republican party chair in Wisconsin’s Outagamie county, told Politico: “I thought [Musk] was gonna be an asset for this race. People love Trump, but maybe they don’t love everybody he supports.”\n\nThe site quoted Rohn Bishop, the Republican mayor of the Wisconsin city of Waupun, as saying: “I thought maybe Elon coming could turn these people to go out and vote, [but] I think… he may have turned out more voters against [Schimel].”\n\nCharlie Kirk, a pro-Trump social media influencer and activist, implied – without mentioning Musk by name – that his wealth and profile might have played a role.\n\n“We did a lot in Wisconsin but we fell short,” he wrote. “We must realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now. We are the party of welders, waiters and plumbers. We are the party of people who work with their hands, who shower before and after work.”\n\nNeither Musk nor Trump mentioned the supreme court result in its immediate aftermath, trumpeting instead another Wisconsin ballot result that amended the state constitution to require photo ID as a condition for voting.\n\nThen on Wednesday afternoon, Politico and ABC News reported that Trump told his inner circle, including some Cabinet secretaries, that Musk will soon leave his role as a top adviser to the president, overseeing federal government job cuts. The reports cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans won victories on Tuesday in two special House elections in Florida caused by the resignations from the US Congress of Matt Gaetz, Trump’s original attorney general designee but who later withdrew amid sexual misconduct allegations, and Mike Waltz, now the national security adviser.\n\nBut the elections were won by margins of around half of what Trump achieved last November.

It’s not polite to note such an impairment, but in the case of Katzenberg, it’s too fitting a metaphor to let slip by.\n\n After decades toggling between top studio and production jobs, the peripatetic 72-year-old billionaire has been on a cold streak of late. In the wake of the catastrophe that was Quibi, the shortform video platform he founded with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman that burned through $1.75 billion in startup funding before shuttering in less than two years, Katzenberg took a business sabbatical to focus on politics and cement his reputation as a go-to political power broker in the mold of Lew Wasserman. In 2023, he co-chaired Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. That project, of course, crashed even harder than Quibi did.\n\n As part of Biden’s inner circle, Katzenberg has been blamed for (at best) failing to recognize the president’s decline or (at worst) covering up for it. There’s a reason Katzenberg ran point for as long as he did. Few could match his energy and relentless drive, but when Kamala Harris assumed the nomination, Katzenberg played a minimal role in her fundraising efforts, and he has yet to publicly address what he really knew of Biden’s health. (He declined to comment for this story.)\n\n For Katzenberg’s critics, of which there are many, it’s a well-deserved comeuppance for a mogul whom many L.A.-based Democrats partially blame for the mess they find themselves in. “Getting Biden re-elected was going to be Jeffrey’s great redemption,” says an L.A.-based political consultant with ties to the entertainment industry. “Instead, it all fell to pieces. We don’t have the White House. We don’t have the Senate, and we don’t have the House. And donors feel like they got conned.”\n\n Two and a half months into Donald Trump‘s second term, the mood inside the industry’s political class veers between bewilderment and submission. Gone is the urgency and energy that marked the days and weeks following Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, which saw worldwide protests including the Women’s March, where hundreds of thousands of protesters stormed downtown L.A. MAGA is in ascent. The Democrats — and by extension Hollywood liberals — are in a political wilderness, and all signs suggest that Katzenberg’s tenure as Hollywood’s chief political operator is nearing its end. A vacuum has opened, prompting two existential questions within an industry that’s grasping for a way forward:\n\n Can anyone replace Katzenberg as the political face of the town? And perhaps more importantly: Given the political climate, should anyone replace him?\n\n The Trump administration’s retributive style complicates those questions. Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair, appears intent on keeping media corporations in ideological line, which means that heavy-hitter liberals like Disney’s Bob Iger and Dana Walden (a close Harris friend), Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, Marvel’s Kevin Feige and Comcast’s Donna Langley are likely neutered. As fiduciaries, they’ve got shareholders’ interests to prioritize.\n\n There was a moment when such industry stalwarts as producer J.J. Abrams or management mogul and L.A. Olympics czar Casey Wasserman, both prolific Democratic bundlers, seemed poised to assume the perch vacated by Katzenberg, but neither has yet met the challenge. The former’s fundraising has waned of late, and any electoral efforts the latter might now pursue would complicate his work on the 2028 Summer Games. Interviews with a variety of political consultants and donor advisers suggest that few others are likely to step into the breach. Some argue that the ascendance of Silicon Valley and the trend of tech companies taking over Hollywood should broaden the search. The proposed merger between Skydance and Paramount has elevated the profile of Oracle fortune heir David Ellison, 42, who gave almost $1 million to Biden’s re-election campaign. However, his father and financial backer, Larry Ellison, is a high-profile Trump supporter. Another name that has emerged is billionaire Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, 34, who recently launched the Department of Angels to aid in the rebuilding of the communities impacted by the Eaton and Palisades wildfires. But a consultant who has worked with Spiegel says he prefers being seen as a philanthropist and has little interest in stepping into the political sphere.\n\n All of which leads to the conclusion offered by L.A.-based political consultant Mike Murphy: “The era of the self-appointed mega political [figure] is over. That’s because no one — especially after Katzenberg — trusts these self-appointed kings anymore.”\n\n Among industry donors, there’s a general sense that they’re not quite ready to open their pocketbooks to Democrats rolling through town with hat in hand. “Tell me your message and explain what we’re going to do before you ask us for a blind check,” says a top industry donor who’s been active for decades. This donor was referring to a fundraiser held in March for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ Victory Fund, which hands out money to the DCCC and others. Tickets to the fundraiser, at which Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) were also present, went for $10,000 to $100,000. “I think when it comes time for the midterms and there are active campaigns going, the checks will start flowing again. But that election is way off, and right now asking for a donation to the party seems like — well, when you get your act together, we can talk about it.”\n\n Hollywood’s current political reckoning isn’t just about distrust and fear of Trump. The entertainment industry is fractured and is no longer the cultural or financial force it was even a decade ago. Furthermore, arguably the industry’s biggest assets — celebrities — have been cast as political liabilities in the wake of Trump’s victory. Everyone from George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey to Taylor Swift and Beyoncé supported Harris, yet despite those endorsements, fewer working-class voters came out for Harris than did for Biden in 2020. “The old Hollywood model, in terms of the ways that we used to support the [Democratic] party, is dead. And it should be, because it doesn’t work,” says screenwriter Billy Ray, who for the past several national election cycles has worked with Democrats on their messaging.\n\n Ray notes that when Democrats suffered defeats in the past, there usually was an acknowledgment and commitment to adjust and change; Obama did it in 2010 after the midterms, as did Hillary Clinton in 1994. But at least so far, the absence of introspection shown by the Democrats in the face of their November defeat has shocked him. “We just dropped $6.7 billion on an election cycle. And yet if you stopped almost any American on the street and asked them, ‘What does the Democratic party stand for?’ They probably can’t tell you. That’s a problem.”\n\n As one producer with political contacts observes, “You go to these dinners since the election and people are paralyzed. They’re just repeating what they’re hearing from Rachel Maddow. They don’t know what to do. The richest ones are hanging back, figuring they’ll make money right now [on Trump’s tax policies] and sort it out later.” This source adds, “There’s a chill now — an arctic chill. It doesn’t matter what a well-intentioned Jeffrey Katzenberg or Rob Reiner do or don’t do when someone at the Jeff Bezos level is immediately capitulating, dumping $40 million on that Melania documentary.”\n\n Murphy concurs. “I don’t think Hollywood influence is gone, but it’s much more fragmented now.”\n\n Comedian Adam Conover, a prominent leftist voice in the industry who serves on the board of the WGA West, contends that Hollywood, after a rabble-rousing rebellion during Trump’s first term, is likely to be far more accommodating in his second — especially after an election that ratified the notion of its diminished power as a political force. “Hollywood goes where the wind blows,” he says. “The election was a rightward turn. We’re living in a different world. The media can and will get conservative again. Everybody watched 24 in George W. Bush’s America, including liberals.”\n\n There’s another element at play in the political power vacuum that now exists in Hollywood: its gerontocracy crisis. Katzenberg built his clout, contacts and pocketbook in the 1980s as a 30-something studio chief at Paramount and Disney. At the time, his age was in line with the rest of the presidents of production of the majors. These days, those influential posts are mostly still held by boomers. Next-gen execs, reflecting updated worldviews, haven’t been elevated to positions that would allow them to become kingmakers.\n\n In the lead-up to the 2018 midterms, a younger, more diverse class of political players from the worlds of TV and film started to emerge. There was an unprecedented level of political activism, much of it at the grass-roots level. Christy Callahan, a former motion picture creative executive who now serves as a senior adviser to the national gun violence prevention group Brady, hosted dozens of fundraisers, the majority of which were low-dollar events that brought in anywhere from $50,000 to the low six figures. Her concern, after seeing some of the richest men in the world attend Trump’s inauguration, including Bezos, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, is that the “small-dollar events won’t matter anymore.”\n\n After the election, Ray spent two days in political mourning. But his resolve is back. When colleagues and peers from the entertainment industry ask him what they should be doing nowadays, Ray tells them: “I’m going to be bringing you a string of candidates who can win in the heartland, and they may not agree with you fully on guns and may not agree fully on pronouns, but you’ve got to support them anyway because they are the future of the party, and it’s either that or we don’t have a future.\n\n “People who tell stories for a living or people who take them to market know Nov. 5 was a massive swing and a miss,” he continues. “It’s incumbent on us to tell the people in the party just how far off the target they’ve been. If anybody in the world understands what it’s like to be rejected by the marketplace, it’s people in Hollywood.”\n\n With the industry feeling politically rudderless, perhaps it’s time for a casting call: “Seeking well-connected, energetic power broker with a keen sense of narrative.”","summary":"The decline of Jeffrey Katzenberg, long the town’s chief political power broker, has left the industry’s Democratic elite without a leader, a plan or the clout they once wielded — just as Trump retakes Washington with vengeance on his mind.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/hollywood-political-revival-trump-1236177834/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1465828173-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 16:00:00","author":"Gary Baum,Lexy Perez,Peter Kiefer","authors":["Gary Baum","Lexy Perez","Peter Kiefer"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":306933226,"title":"Wisconsin And Florida Elections Signal Warning Signs For Trump And Republicans As Democrats Gain Momentum","text":"In a trio of elections on Tuesday, early warning signs emerged for Republicans and President Donald Trump at the outset of his ambitious term.

The loss came in a state Trump won in November, marking a significant shift in voter sentiment.\nMeanwhile, in Florida, Republicans managed to retain two of the most pro-Trump House districts. However, both Republican candidates underperformed compared to Trump’s margins in the state’s presidential election, raising concerns about the party’s strength in down-ballot races.\nA Test of Voter Sentiment in the Trump Era\nThese elections—marking the first major contests since Trump returned to power—were widely viewed as an early gauge of public opinion. Trump has moved with unprecedented speed to reshape the federal government, often clashing with the courts and seeking political retribution. Tuesday’s results offered a glimmer of hope for Democrats, who have faced internal and external criticism over their response to Trump’s governance.\nHistorically, the party that loses the presidency in November tends to gain ground in the following midterm elections. Tuesday’s outcomes suggest that Democrats may be able to capitalize on this trend.\nMajor Political Shifts in Wisconsin\nTrump won Wisconsin in November by a narrow margin of 0.8 percentage points—fewer than 30,000 votes. However, in the first significant election since he took office, the state, known for its swing-state status, saw a notable shift toward Democrats.\nCrawford’s success extended beyond Democratic strongholds. She made notable gains in the suburban Milwaukee counties, which Republicans typically rely on to bolster their statewide margins. Additionally, she secured victories in Kenosha and Racine counties—both of which Trump won over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November—defeating Schimel by approximately 10 percentage points.\nAlso Read: Tesla Reports 13% Drop in Q1 Sales Amid Factory Upgrades and Political Backlash","summary":"Early election results signal trouble for Trump and the GOP, as Democrats notch key victories in Wisconsin and outperform expectations elsewhere.

Gavin Newsom","text":"By MICHAEL R. BLOOD | Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — Former Biden administration Health Secretary Xavier Becerra on Wednesday became the latest Democrat to join the crowded field seeking to become California’s next governor, a contest that could be dramatically reshaped if former Vice President Kamala Harris becomes a candidate.\n\nThe Stanford Law School graduate enters the race with a lengthy resume of government service, including stints as California attorney general, a U.S. House member and a state legislator. In December 2020, then-President-elect Joe Biden picked Becerra to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a defender of the Affordable Care Act in a leading role to oversee his administration’s coronavirus response.\n\nIn a heavily Democratic state with punishing housing and grocery prices and some of the nation’s highest gas and utility costs, Becerra said working families are facing an affordability crisis.\n\n“The California Dream is slipping away,” he said in a statement announcing his run.\n\nThe contest to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom already has lured a large scrum of announced and likely candidates that would be reordered if Harris decides to seek the state’s top office. Harris, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator, has not ruled out seeking the governorship since she left Washington in January after a failed presidential bid.\n\nDemocrats are expected to hold the seat in a state where they outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2 to 1. Republicans have not won a statewide election in California in nearly two decades.\n\nIn a statement, Becerra did not directly mention any of his Democratic rivals, who include former U.S. House member Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, among others.\n\nOn the GOP side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco in February became the first major Republican to announce a bid to replace Newsom, whose term runs through early January 2027. Bianco blamed Democrats for the ongoing homeless crisis and runaway housing prices.\n\nThe low-key Becerra said he was ready to “take on bullies who get in our way,” an obvious reference to President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen Becerra was serving as California attorney general during Trump’s first term, he developed a reputation for suing the Republican administration more than anyone else on issues from health care to environmental policy.\n\nWhile Becerra led the federal health agency during the pandemic, California instituted long lockdowns that have been faulted for disrupting education and the economy. That could make him a target for conservatives.\n\nBecerra frequently cites his working-class parents as inspiration.

I’ve Always Tried to Avoid My Mom’s Bigoted Beliefs. Now I’m Afraid She’s Gone Too Far.","text":"Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence, \n\nAs a regular reader of your advice, I’ve seen so many excellent answers about what to do within a family when there are significant political differences. And Prudence, I think I’m pretty good at doing it all! For context, I’m a leftist in a left-leaning city and my mom is a right winger in my right-leaning hometown. Part of what helps me keep things in check is that we live relatively far apart so I can manage our interactions. I follow the common advice about keeping politics out of discussions and don’t have a problem with it. My mom is surrounded by people who echo her beliefs. So even if I did want to talk politics with her, I know my impact would be negligible and my voice would be drowned out by her closer circle. I just don’t think that my trying to change her would do anything but make our relationship more challenging. When we’re together, I call her out when she says something homophobic or racist, for example, but otherwise don’t talk about politics. And this INCLUDES when she insists on bringing up her politics. I’m great at changing the subject, shrugging, or giving so little back in the conversation that it ends.\n\nBut here’s my dilemma: I’m genderfluid. I’ve known for a long time but only in the last year have felt comfortable enough to start outwardly expressing it, including switching to they/them pronouns in most instances. I did not tell my mom this as I suspected it would be an issue but I also didn’t exactly hide it (my pronouns were public on my social media).\n\nWell, drunk in the middle of the night she sent me a long email about how she couldn’t follow my social media account anymore because of what I post about gender (I’m an artist and a lot of my art supports gender diverse and trans-rights issues) and asked me to understand that she thinks, “God made only male and female.” Obviously, this resulted in me explaining to her that I am genderfluid and therefore it was beyond just my art she is against. There were months of back-and-forth where she came no closer to understanding and dug her heels in that there are only two genders and I was prey to “gender ideology.” Ultimately, I did what I usually do and stopped talking politics to try and have some tiny bit of a relationship with her.\n\nBut finally, I hit my limit and I asked her, in a level and calm way, exactly what she thinks about the LGBTQIA+ community (my community). It was all the worst things you could imagine. Yes, it’s a “sin.” Apparently, you can choose to live an “ex-gay” or “ex-trans” life to follow God. “God would cure people if they really wanted it.” “God doesn’t create gay or trans people, Satan does—oh, and he creates pedophiles, too,” she wanted me to know. Gender affirming care for youth is “child abuse” that she’s vehemently against because they should not be performing “sex changes” on minors. All very gross beliefs.\n\nI’m torn. My whole adult life, avoiding talking politics with my mom is how I’ve managed to maintain a relationship with her as I’ve moved farther left and she’s moved farther right on the political spectrum. I’ve put in a lot of effort to tolerate her loud and problematic beliefs (including being around her when she refused to get vaccinated during COVID-19) and she’s never extended me the same grace. But we maintained a relationship because of my efforts. But this feels like … too much. Do I want a relationship with her? Is it worth it, knowing how hateful she is toward my identity and community, to keep the small talk and occasional visits? What should I do, Prudence? (Other than get a therapist because I have one already!)\n\n—Politics Just Got Personal\n\nDear Politics Just Got Personal,\n\nIt drives me nuts that bigots have convinced so many people that putting a hateful belief under the category “politics” means the belief deserves tons of patience and sensitivity and shouldn’t lead anyone to dislike the person who holds it. Bullshit! Just erase the word “politics” from your vocabulary for a minute and look at the facts. Your mom unfollowed you on social media and told you that you and people like you are created by Satan, both without an ounce of care for your feelings. Your mom is mean to you! She doesn’t care about your happiness.\n\nIf she’d limited contact and railed against you because you were a labradoodle owner or you two liked rival basketball teams would it be easier to see? It really doesn’t make a difference that her views line up with a creepy obsession of the political right. She is more into them than she is into having a relationship with her actual child.\n\nI can’t tell you how much to allow her into your life. That’s for you to really consider and come to a decision about on your own. But I hope I can help you clarify that what would make the relationship feel better isn’t some mysterious, highly nuanced approach to “significant political differences.” It’s for her to be kind to you and respect you. You should tell her that. It’s really not too much for you to ask.\n\nDear Prudence, \n\nMy girlfriend had to have gallbladder surgery several months ago and enjoys showing off her scar to just about anyone she discusses her operation with and it makes me feel a bit weirded out. Is this appropriate?\n\n—Tell Without the Show\n\nDear Tell Without the Show,\n\nI just checked out some anatomy drawings to locate the gallbladder. It seems to me like your girlfriend is only showing, depending on the length of her torso, about 4 inches of flesh more than is exposed by the average crop top. Her demonstrations fall short of exposing a private part. I don’t think anyone will be too scandalized.\n\nSure, if she wrote to me I would encourage her to ask, “Would you like to see the scar?” before surprising people with more naked ribcage than they are probably used to seeing in public, but she didn’t ask me (or you). So you won’t get far, and may actually do damage to your relationship, by chastising her for being “inappropriate” or telling her you’re weirded out.\n\nIf you must say something, you could focus instead on the scar observers and the reactions you notice. For example: “Remember how our neighbor said ‘Oh no, I’ll avert my eyes!’ when you lifted up your shirt in the building lobby? And remember when the cashier at Trader Joe’s turned kind of reddish purple and seemed really embarrassed? It’s your body but as someone looking in from the outside, I think some people may feel uncomfortable with the amount of clothing you have to remove to show your scar. Maybe we could take a picture of it that you could show without disrobing?” If you don’t have anything to point to in terms of how people have responded, you don’t have anything to worry about.\n\nPrudie Wants to Hear From You!\n\nReaders often have great suggestions for our letter writers, occasionally disagree with a point Prudie makes, or simply want to provide some additional advice. Each week, Prudie will be replying to some of these comments and suggestions from readers, which will be featured on the site for Slate Plus members. Write to us!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI resent one of my very closest friends for not voting in the 2024 presidential election. He said he did it because he never changed his address so his ID and actual address wouldn’t match. Same city, and the same zip code, but where we live, if he would have voted, maybe he would have broken the law. But on a night out, he mentioned concerns about the obvious genocide in Gaza and the lack of intervention by the Democrats. I got the sense that withholding a vote was slightly punitive.\n\nI truly wish I held respect for this value-based position, but truth be told, I resent him for not voting. Yes, I believe what’s happening in Gaza is genocide. I think the two-party system sucks, and leaves a lot of people not feeling truly represented. And yes, I know that because of the way the electoral college works, this whole qualm of mine makes no sense, which is why I need another perspective.\n\nBut I just don’t believe anyone in America gets out without some blood on their hands if we choose to look really closely at where our food comes from, how our clothes are made, and what goes into making technology. It feels like a false moral superiority. Trump was never going to be a better friend to the Palestinians than Kamala Harris. My friend’s lack of voting did not change the outcome of the race. The electoral college still would have been a landslide in Trump’s favor. So what should I do to squelch my resentment? When he complains about Trump, I think I just want to have a different reaction than, “Well, you could have voted.”\n\n—Probably Just Looking for Someone to Blame\n\nDear Probably Just Looking for Someone to Blame,\n\nYou’ve already talked some sense into yourself. As your sign-off suggests, you’re aware that you have a lot of bad feelings about what’s happening in this country, that those bad feelings needed a place to land, and that your non-voting friend was right there, a much larger presence in your life than the many legitimately awful people who actively cheer for cruelty.\n\nBut, of course, awareness isn’t enough to stop feeling the way you feel. This is sort of like having an unwanted crush. In both cases, trying to suppress the feeling, being ashamed of it, or beating yourself up for it ends up fueling it. So instead, forgive yourself for reacting to your friend’s nonvoting in a way that is disproportionate to the harm it caused. Stop wishing the feeling away. Instead, lean into it, own it, and air it out. Yes, tell him what’s on your mind.\n\nNot by saying, “Well, maybe you should have voted!” Instead try something like, “Can I talk to you about something? I’m really devastated and angry about what this administration is doing, and I know you are too. But whenever we talk about it I start thinking about how you didn’t vote and becoming resentful. I obviously know the outcome isn’t your fault, whether you chose not to vote because of the ID issue or because of Gaza. It’s not fair but I still can’t help feeling the way I do. I just wanted to tell you what I’m wrestling with in case you get a weird feeling from me when we’re discussing politics.”\n\nIt might be worth steering the conversation toward what you agree on—such as genocide being bad. You two, while you may have different ideas about how to get there, both want to see less injustice and suffering in the world. If he did withhold his vote punitively, maybe hearing him defend that choice will remind you of how urgently he wanted policy change and how much you admire the intensity of his compassion for others. And on the other hand, if he really is as smug as you think he might be about his choice and seems more concerned with having made a point than with the bad things that are currently happening to people around the world, then maybe that’s a personality issue and you don’t like him as much as you thought you did. Regardless, by the end of the talk, you’ll have released the thoughts currently stuck in your head, perhaps surrounded them with some context, and hopefully be less overwhelmed by them.\n\nIn addition, you should think about identifying an alternate villain. Someone in or out of the White House who has really, intentionally worked to hurt others. Make it a point to spread the word about how awful that person is, or to organize for political outcomes that they would absolutely hate. Find a target who inspires the same gut-level “This is your fault, I can’t stand the kind of person you are, and I’ll never get over it” reaction that you’re experiencing now. Sadly, you have a lot of options.\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI am a librarian in a small, mostly white and middle/lower middle-class town. I am also white.

The special election, held to fill seats vacated by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, drew national attention, with the Democratic National Committee chair flying in to rally in support for Democrat Josh Weil in the 6th District, and the Trump White House backing Republican Randy Fine online. Fine was ultimately victorious in the 6th District election, succeeding Waltz, who has recently come under scrutiny following an apparent national security breach in a Signal group chat. Meanwhile, Republican Jimmy Patronis defeated Democratic challenger Gay Valimont and secured GOP control of the 1st District seat vacated by Gaetz. Patronis' win was also by slimmer margins than what Republicans won in November's contest. Here are three takeaways from the Florida special election that observers consider a bellwether for Republicans ahead of midterms, which typically sees the party that lost the presidency pick up congressional seats. LIBERAL WINS FIRST MAJOR 2025 STATEWIDE BATTLEGROUND ELECTION IN RACE TURNED INTO TRUMP-MUSK REFERENDUM 1. Republican House majority expands to a 220-213 margin The pair of special election victories in Florida means the Republican Party maintains control of the House of Representatives by a 220-213 margin. Trump was concerned over the slim margin in the House when he pulled the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for the U.S. ambassadorship to the United Nations. Stefanik was the third highest-ranking House Republican and campaigned heavily for Trump during the last election cycle. Stefanik, who previously served as the House Republican Conference chair, recognized the \"historically slim House majority\" when it stood at 218-213 last week and agreed to step up in Congress to deliver on Trump's America First agenda. Trump championed the Florida victories in a Truth Social post on Tuesday night. \"BOTH FLORIDA HOUSE SEATS HAVE BEEN WON, BIG, BY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, AS ALWAYS, PROVED FAR GREATER THAN THE DEMOCRATS FORCES OF EVIL. CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICA!!!\" he wrote. 2. Both districts shifted more toward Democrats Fine won the 6th District special election over Weil by 14 points – a significantly tighter margin than Waltz's 33-point victory five months ago. According to the Florida Division of Elections, Fine received nearly 57% of the vote, while Weil received nearly 43%. Patronis, meanwhile, received nearly 57% of the vote in the 1st District, while Valimont received nearly 43% of the vote. The 14-point win enjoyed by Patronis comes after Gaetz won re-election in the heavily red district by 32 points last November. FORMER DESANTIS OFFICIAL DEFEATS DEM FOR MATT GAETZ'S HOUSE SEAT \"This is the functional equivalent of Republicans running a competitive race in the district that is represented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\" said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before Tuesday's contest, according to the Associated Press. \"Kamala Harris won that district by 30 points. Do you think a Republican would even be competitive in that district in New York, currently held by Alex? Of course, not.\" Republican voter turnout remains a challenge for the party in races when Trump is not on the ballot – an issue raised by conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk when discussing another significant contest for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. Back in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he expected that any GOP underperformance in the 6th District, which he once represented, would be \"a reflection of the candidate,\" the Orlando Sentinel reported. Fine, a casino millionaire who served eight years in the state House and then a shorter time in the state Senate, has long garnered controversy in Florida politics. Patronis, meanwhile, served as Florida's chief financial officer under DeSantis. 3. Patronis and Fine won despite being badly outraised by their Democratic challengers Michael Whatley, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Democrats \"dumped more than $10 million to try and buy\" the 6th District seat picked up by Fine, \"but voters decisively rejected them.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The American people sent a clear message tonight: they want elected officials who will advance President Trump’s America First agenda, and their votes can’t be bought by national Democrats,\" he said in a statement.
