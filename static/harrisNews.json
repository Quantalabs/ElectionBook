And so unnecessary.\" A video of the former president donning a Trump 2024 hat went viral in September 2024. A video of Biden at the Shanksville Fire Station in Pennsylvania showed the president taking the Trump 2024 campaign hat from a Trump supporter and putting it on top of his own hat, in what the White House said at the time was a friendly gesture of unity. According to the book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" that was the last time Harris would do a public event with Biden prior to the election. BIDEN UNDERMINES HARRIS CLAIM THAT RON DESANTIS IS POLITICIZING HURRICANE RESPONSE: 'DOING A GREAT JOB' \"But it was not the last time that Biden did something unhelpful,\" the authors wrote. The former president also called Trump supporters \"garbage\" during a campaign call for Harris. \"Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community,\" Biden said. \"Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.

While some attributed challenges to poor lighting in the gym, the book said that others identified Biden as the real problem.

Plus, Trump’s FAA chaos spooks voters","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nHow Trump beat Harris\n\nA major new report provides fresh insights into the 2024 presidential electorate that enabled Donald Trump to defeat Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nAfter every even-year election, the Democratic data firm Catalist releases an in-depth analysis of the electorate—integrating voter files, census data, polling, and modeling—to better understand who turned out, who changed their votes, and where they shifted.\n\nIn its latest report, Catalist finds that Harris lost about 2 percentage points of support compared with Joe Biden in the 2020 election. And for the first time in the firm’s data, less than 50% of new voters—a group that typically is younger and more diverse—supported the Democratic nominee.\n\nHere’s how that played out on the ground.\n\nThe 2024 electorate was 3 points less white than it was in 2012, and voters ages 18 to 29 accounted for 15% of the 2024 electorate, 1 point less than in 2020. However, those younger voters also didn’t assist Democrats the way they once did, because that coalition is now more receptive to Republicans.\n\nMen of color, for example, swung hard toward Trump. Harris underperformed Biden by 6 points among men overall, but the decline was even sharper among Latino men (-12) and Black men (-8). While women provided Harris with similar margins compared with Biden, she lost ground with Asian women (-3) and young Latino voters (-12). Meanwhile, Harris failed to improve on Biden’s national numbers with Black women, a critical Democratic bloc.\n\nThe 2024 electorate also had a greater share of habitual voters than in either of the previous two presidential elections. And while less frequent voters comprised a smaller share of the electorate last year, they broke for Trump, with Harris underperforming Biden among those who had voted in just one to three of the past four elections (2022, 2020, 2018, and 2016).\n\nAll of these issues—and more—are why we find ourselves embroiled in Trump’s chaos yet again.\n\nFAA chaos fuels public fears\n\nFlying gets a bad rap these days—and honestly, it’s not hard to see why. \n\nSince January’s deadly crash near Washington, D.C., the Trump administration has dodged accountability for aviation issues, and while it may be trying to staff up on air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration is also shedding staff.\n\nThe result is a growing sense among voters that flying isn’t safe anymore. According to the latest Civiqs poll for Daily Kos, 71% of registered voters believe air travel is less safe now than it was five years ago. That includes a striking 85% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans, suggesting this is a rare area of bipartisan unease.\n\nAnd while voters may feel flying is riskier now, they’re not aligned on who to blame. When asked who’s more responsible for recent issues regarding air traffic control, 35% blame the former Biden administration, while a slightly larger group (39%) blame the Trump administration. Unsurprisingly, there is a partisan split: Democrats are more likely to point a finger at Trump, while Republicans pile on Biden.\n\nBut here’s the thing: In most regards, flying is about as safe as it’s ever been, at least so far.\n\nDespite high-profile crashes, the number of monthly accidents in the U.S. among private and commercial airline flights is in line with recent norms, according to data from the National Transportation Safety Board. For instance, the data for last month is preliminary, but if it holds, it would be the second-safest April since 2000. And the safest April came in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were far fewer flights than usual.\n\nWhat’s driving the misperception of the safety of air travel? Media coverage might be a big part of it. (We at Daily Kos have covered our fair share of flying fiascos.) And the sheer visibility of accidents makes them feel more common than they are. \n\nBut that doesn’t let Trump off the hook. He’s done little to instill public confidence in air travel, repeatedly refusing to take responsibility for accidents. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, his close ally Elon Musk reportedly pushed to fire air traffic controllers amid what was already a shortage—because who needs oversight at 600 miles per hour?\n\nThe bottom line: The Trump administration seems determined to flirt with disaster at a time when voters are already scared.\n\nLosing the policy war\n\nTrump’s second term has been marked by a flurry of unpopular executive actions, but new data shows just how unpopular Trump’s agenda is.\n\nYouGov recently released public opinion data on 250 policies proposed, endorsed, or implemented by the Trump administration. The data is pulled from polls conducted since Trump took office, and they didn’t mention him or other political figures by name. The survey questions were stripped down and plain, with Americans asked “Would you support or oppose the following?” \n\nAnd the results are brutal for Trump\n\nIn averages across nearly every policy area, Trump is underwater. Immigration (-6), the economy (-8), education (-14), foreign policy (-25), and health care (-31)—all are net negative, meaning more people oppose them than support them on average. Only one policy area shows Trump with more average support than opposition: LGBTQ+ rights. There, 48% of Americans have backed his approach, while 38% have opposed it, on average.\n\nWhy the outlier? It’s likely because Trump’s LGBTQ+ policies are really about attacking transgender people. For instance, rather than loudly going after same-sex marriage, which a strong majority of Americans want to remain legal, Trump is targeting a vulnerable minority. And unfortunately, discomfort with transgender people remains widespread, even among Democrats. As grim as that is, it explains why a lot of voters support Trump here.\n\nBreaking down YouGov’s data by political party also reveals where Trump’s agenda plays—and where it flops. Take his executive order barring schools from using diversity, equity, and inclusion principles to evaluate discipline: Republicans love it (net +56 support), but independents (-4) and Democrats (-44) reject it, according to a poll YouGov conducted recently.\n\nOr his federal hiring freeze: Democrats hate it (net -44 support), and even independents are split, with a -12 net disapproval overall for this bloc, but Republicans still widely back it (+55). \n\nThat shows how Trump’s policies often provoke major backlash, even when they poll abovewater with his base.\n\nOverall, the numbers paint a clear picture: Most of Trump’s agenda just isn’t popular. \n\nAny updates?\n\n Congressional Republicans are pushing deep cuts to Medicaid, the health program that covers millions of low-income and disabled Americans, but Americans aren’t on board: Just 12% support cutting funding for or eliminating Medicaid, according to a new YouGov poll. Only 17% back cuts to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal food assistance program. A new Civiqs poll for Daily Kos backs this up: 67% of registered voters oppose reducing funding for Medicaid, while only 28% support it.\n\n Trump’s antics on social media are well documented—and widely reviled. According to YouGov, 42% of Americans have a negative view of content posted to Trump’s and the White House’s social media accounts, while only 27% view it positively. Unsurprisingly, Republicans are the most receptive. But when the White House is out here posting dystopian ASMR videos of immigrants getting deported, what kind of reaction do you expect?\n\nDemocrats don’t win points by playing nice with Republicans. Just ask California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nLately, Newsom has cozied up to some of the worst that the right has to offer. He invited infamous bigot Charlie Kirk onto his podcast, where the two agreed that Democrats went too far by being nice to transgender athletes. He has also criticized gender-inclusive language, questioning why Democrats use the term “Latinx.”\n\nBut chasing the middle doesn’t help. It just makes you appear weak and inauthentic. And voters agree. According to Civiqs, 54% of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Newsom, up from 51% right before the Kirk interview. And his “favorable” number plummeted from 32% to just 26%.\n\nDemocrats are the most unforgiving. Only 53% of them now view him favorably, down from 67% before the Kirk interview. \n\nNewsom may have his eyes on the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, but if this is his strategy, he’s already off track. While he’s busy chasing voters who will never support him, he’s losing the ones who might have.\n\nAndrew Mangan contributed research.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Chauvin was found guilty on all charges in the case and sentenced to more than 20 years in prison; three other officers who were also on the scene and failed to get Floyd help as he struggled to breathe were found guilty of federal civil rights violations and sentenced from 30 to 42 months in prison. But a new report from the New York Times, coupled with recent actions from the Trump administration, suggests that whatever progress appeared to come in the wake of Floyd’s murder was not lasting.\n\nA New York Times analysis published Saturday, based on data from the Washington Post and the database Mapping Police Violence, found that the number of police killings nationwide has risen every year since 2020—with Black people constituting a disproportionate number of the victims. Last year, for example, there were a total of 1,226 people killed by police, an 18 percent increase from 2019, the Times found. While most of the victims killed by police reportedly were armed, some, like Floyd, were not. Last year, 53 unarmed people were killed by police, compared to 95 in 2020, according to the Times analysis. Over the past decade, Black people have been killed by police at more than two times the rate of white people. (Native Americans were the racial group with the highest rate of police killings, according to the Times data.)\n\nThe rates of police killings were higher—and have increased since 2020—in the redder states that President Donald Trump won in the last election; the bluer states that former Vice President Kamala Harris won, on the other hand, saw stabilized rates of police killings since 2020.\n\nThe actions of the Trump administration do not inspire confidence that those numbers will decrease anytime soon. This week, the Department of Justice announced it was dismissing lawsuits and consent decrees against police departments in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, and in Louisville, Kentucky, where police killed Breonna Taylor in March 2020. (Officials in Minneapolis and Louisville said they would continue working to implement police reforms.) The DOJ also announced it was ending Biden-era investigations into a half dozen other police departments that the prior administration accused of constitutional violations. Civil rights groups said those moves would likely worsen police violence; the ACLU said Trump’s DOJ was sending “a message that the government is willing to look away from harm being inflicted on our communities—even when the harm is plain as day.”\n\nThose shifts come as the Trump administration has also prioritized the abolishment of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, or DEI, across the federal government and beyond.\n\nThe current political climate may help explain why more than 70 percent of adults recently surveyed by the Pew Research Center said they do not believe the increased focus on race following Floyd’s murder made Black Americans’ lives better. And the amount of Americans who say they support the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped 15 points since 2020, though a majority—52 percent—still say they are in favor of it, according to Pew.\n\nOn Sunday, various Democratic lawmakers commemorated Floyd’s passing on social media, including Minnesotans Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, along with Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rep. Monica McIver (D-N.J.), Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). Crockett, Omar, and McIver called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill first introduced in 2021 that would increase accountability for law enforcement. Its measures include creating a national registry to track police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants and chokeholds, and requiring training on implicit bias and racial profiling for law enforcement officers. The bill was most recently reintroduced in the House last year by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas), but it failed to get a vote.\n\nMother Jones video correspondent Garrison Hayes sees reasons for hope, despite the limits to the progress of the past five years:\n\nIf 2020 was The Awakening, and the last four years have been The Retrenchment, then 2025 may mark the beginning of a new phase: The Reevaluation.\n\nI think the 2020 BLM protests were about bolstering Black social and political power, and despite all of the attacks that effort has endured, Black people aren’t giving up on it any time soon.\n\nIn Louisiana, Black voters helped defeat a constitutional amendment that would have made it easier to try children as adults — a move that many viewed as a veiled attempt to deepen mass incarceration.\n\nWe’re seeing it in economic protest too, with Black consumers leading boycotts of major corporations like Target, disrupting profit margins and forcing boardroom conversations.\n\nAnd we’re seeing it in grassroots organizing. Activists like Angela Rye and journalist Joy Reid are crisscrossing the country on the State of the People Power Tour, mobilizing and educating Black communities on how to build lasting political power from the ground up.\n\nSo, five years later, when we ask what’s changed, maybe the most honest answer is that we changed; and that might be the most powerful change of all.","summary":"Five years ago today, George Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed Black man, was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in Minneapolis.

At the kick-off show of his newly rechristened Land of Hope and Dreams Tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen framed his criticism of Donald Trump in patriotism: “The America that I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people. And we will survive this moment.” \n\n As discussed in the latest episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, Springsteen’s multiple onstage speeches, punctuated with on-message songs (“Land of Hope and Dreams,” Bob Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom”) were arguably a masterclass in opposition messaging. His insistence on the existence of another, better version of the country should be instructive to many floundering Democrats — especially considering the extent to which his words captured Donald Trump’s attention. To hear the whole episode, which breaks down the Trump/Springsteen war of words and much more, go here for the podcast provider of your choice, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above. \n\n Two days after Springsteen’s remarks, Trump took to Truth Social to call his critic a “dried out prune of a rocker” whose “skin is all atrophied” and warned him to “KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” with the ominous addendum, “then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” The threats escalated at 1:34 a.m. May 19, the night before his scheduled call with Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” he wrote. “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter.” \n\n Trump also demanded investigations into Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and somehow even Bono — who, as Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene points out in the new episode, “played no role in the election whatsoever.” As discussed in the episode, Trump had it backwards: campaigns are actually required to pay fair market value for production costs to avoid undisclosed contributions. (When Rolling Stone asked the White House about the baseless threats this week, a spokesperson shot back, “accountability for a class of people who act as if they’re above the law may be uncomfortable for Rolling Stone, but it’s refreshing to the American people.”)\n\n Of course, it wasn’t just Springsteen’s eloquent framing of his opposition that irritated Trump — as his inclusion of Swift, Beyoncé, and Winfrey in his threats suggests, he is a creature of fame and showbiz who is exquisitely sensitive to the power of celebrity. He’s won two elections, but still faces the irksome reality that pop culture is far from still fully MAGA-fied.\n\n The episode also ponders why musicians have been relatively quiet about the Trump Administration since January, suggesting a combination of an atmosphere of fear, a sense that 2017-style Resistance messaging failed, and the fact that it’s still more socially acceptable for younger acts to criticize Democrats from the left than to mention Trump. Still, artists including Neil Young and Eddie Vedder have offered support for Springsteen’s remarks, and MJ Lenderman covered “Darkness on the Edge of Town” in an apparent show of solidarity.\n\n Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone‘s weekly podcast, Rolling Stone Music Now, hosted by Brian Hiatt, on Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever you get your podcasts).

More Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Americans cast their ballots today in the presidential race between Republican nominee former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as multiple state elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives passed the GOP “One, Big Beautiful” budget bill which included a provision for Trump Accounts.\n\nPreviously called “MAGA Accounts Contribution Pilot Program,” in which MAGA stood for Money Account for Growth and Advancement, this provision is similar to the $5,000 Baby Bond suggested by Senator Hillary Clinton when she was running for President.\n\nWhat is a Trump Account?\n\nThe Trump Account is a tax-deferred investment account that the Treasury Department would set up automatically for each eligible child born in 2025 through 2028. They call it a savings account but it will act more like a brokerage account.\n\nThe child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, have a Social Security Number, and be born to parents who both have Social Security Numbers.\n\nParents can also contribute up to $5,000 per year into this account for their children.\n\nThe assets in a Trump Account would grow tax free but would be taxed at long term capital gains rates when withdrawn if they are used for qualifying expenses. Qualifying expenses include education, first time home, and even capital for starting a business.\n\nHalf of the funds can be withdrawn once the child turns 18. If the funds are not used for a qualifying expense, it would be taxed as income. After 30, all the funds can be withdrawn for any purpose.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nChange Your PIN Code Now If It’s On This List\n\nApple Makes New Offer To iPhone 16 Buyers\n\nGoogle’s Gmail Upgrade—Why You Need This New Email Address\n\nHow Does This Compare with a 529 Plan?\n\nIt’s natural to compare this with another tax advantaged account often used for education. 529 Plans are, in many ways, far superior though it does lack one beneficial feature of the Trump Account - the Treasury sending a child $1,000 just for being born.\n\nIf you use 529 funds for qualified educational expenses, you pay no tax. While long term capital gains rates are quite favorable, they’re not nearly as favorable as zero percent.\n\n529 Plans also have the nice new feature in which you can transfer funds into a Roth IRA subject to certain limits and conditions. This means that if you contribute too much to a 529 plan, there’s a buffer amount you can always transfer into a Roth IRA.

Here, they discuss the week’s political events with Star-Ledger editor Enrique Lavín.\n\nQ: President Trump‘s “Big, Beautiful Bill” — to extend tax cuts for the rich and slash Americans’ social safety net — passed by a single vote in the House. How do you see it playing out in the Senate? \n\nJulie: The Senate will eventually fall in line after Trump threatens a few senators with primaries. I expect them to tinker with it a little, which means the House will have to vote on the senate’s version and go through this again, but to be clear: tens of millions of Americans will lose their healthcare, tens of millions of Americans will go hungry and tens of millions of Americans will be paying more while Trump, Elon Musk and their billionaire friends get a huge tax break. Is this what you voted for, America?\n\nMike: These are the same Democratic talking points that get used every time there is a tax cut. Yet, somehow, America moves forward without mass carnage in the streets. The problem with the Democratic and media messaging is that maybe it will be true this time. But all the terrible things that Democrats said about George W. Bush and John McCain and Mitt Romney weren’t true. So, now no one believes your same talking points anymore. The Democratic Party is the boy who cried wolf, and now the wolf is really here, and no one believes you.\n\nJulie: You don’t have to believe me and you can feel good about owning the libs — until people lose their healthcare, state budgets go bankrupt because they have to pick up the slack and tens of millions of people lose access to food. The proof will be in the mass suffering this will cause for the constituents of the very people who voted for this legislation. \n\nMike: My point is the libs have owned themselves. They have brought all this on themselves by running bad candidates, having the same comms issues over and over again, and simply losing repeatedly to someone who is doing exactly what he said he would do, whether you or I like it or not. \n\nQ: Any other aspects of this Trump victory to watch for?\n\nJulie: The only thing to note is that the legislative branch has abdicated its constitutional duty to act as a check on the executive – again. \n\nMike: That’s a bit of an overstatement. The bill changed several times to win the votes of many of the holdout GOP members. If Democrats had won the House, they would be the ones getting concessions from the White House. But Democrats lost because of their own incompetence. And elections have consequences. \n\nJulie: They sure do — which is why Republicans are in for a bloodbath in 2026 if we actually have free and fair elections. \n\nMike: Please don’t pull a Trump and start sowing doubt in elections. The elections were fair when Trump won in 2016, when he lost in 2020, and when he won in 2024. Elections are decentralized and run by counties all over the country. The election workers deserve our trust, not more skepticism from both sides.\n\nQ: A New York Times analysis shows the Republican administration has cut research grants in half (80% to STEM education). These cuts affect nearly all scientific fields, which economists say will result in a major recession. Help us make sense of this.\n\nJulie: This is what authoritarians do. They come for academia. Then they come for the press. Then they come for the people. This is the same playbook and we are running out of time to stop it. \n\nMike: These cuts are not in the long-term interest of the U.S. The problem is these programs have yet to find a political constituency outside of academia who will fight for them in Washington. They need that. \n\nQ: Considering he pardoned the January 6 mob that attacked and injured U.S. Capitol police, what are the chances President Trump pardons New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver if she’s convicted for allegedly “shoving” ICE agents, as he put it?\n\nJulie: You’re funny. LaMonica McIver is a Black woman who votes against Trump. If she were a white woman who stormed the Capitol, she would be getting an official apology and maybe a settlement at taxpayer expense. To be clear: Rep. McIver did absolutely nothing wrong. If she had, ICE would not have escorted her for a tour of Delaney Hall after this alleged incident. This whole thing is a political setup and it’s offensive to anyone who actually remembers when the U.S. Attorney’s office was not a prop for cable news fodder.\n\nMike: Several things can be true at the same time. Rep. McIver should not have physically interfered with U.S. law enforcement agents. It is not OK for anyone to put their hands on police officers. That said, all the MAGA folks who were excusing January 6th rioters beating cops with flagpoles and spraying them with bear spray should withhold any comparison with that riot to this minor shoving match. I am hopeful charges will be dropped, and cooler heads will prevail. McIver had every right to be there and inspect the facility, so I hope the DOJ will drop any charges in the name of consistency. But we should not tolerate anyone getting physical with police; it is not justified simply because you disagree with the administration’s policies. \n\nJulie: I see no evidence that McIver “put her hands” on anyone. I see her being pushed and shoved and trying to defend herself. \n\nQ: Speaking of trying to jail his opponents: Trump says he’s launching an investigation into American cultural institutions Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey for campaign finance violations after they endorsed Kamala Harris. What ramifications do you see? \n\nJulie: The bottom line is that this is a direct assault on the First Amendment and yet the most powerful people in entertainment – the ones who can reach billions of people around the world – are not getting together to say so plainly. At the risk of dating myself, we need a Live Aid for the First Amendment. Where’s Bob Geldof to organize it? (I wrote a whole article about this, which you can read here.)\n\nMIke: Conservatives should not be OK with legal intimidation and cost done purposely to infringe on one’s First Amendment rights. If Kid Rock and Ted Nugent actually influenced any voters, they could be next! While I don’t often agree with entertainers and athletes as they take political stands, I respect that they use their platforms to try to make social change. They are taking personal and commercial risk to make their points, and their First Amendment rights should be protected. \n\nQ: In the final Republican debate before the June 10 primary, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, who is polling in low single digits, contended Democrats are afraid of him the most because he would be the toughest to beat. Any truth to that?\n\nJulie: Bramnick definitely has crossover appeal and yes, he would likely be the strongest candidate in November – assuming the Republican base came out for him, which is a big assumption. \n\nMike: One of Bill Spadea’s top supporters even said Jon Bramnick would be the strongest general election candidate. Bramnick wins repeatedly in a district Trump lost by 12% a year ago. Bramnick consistently gets votes from Republicans, independents and Democrats. But Jack Ciattarelli has Trump’s endorsement, which is something primary voters care more about than one’s track record of winning tough races. \n\nQ: Similarly, some Republicans hope Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is the Democratic nominee because they see him as easier to defeat in November than a moderate candidate, like Mikie Sherrill, the apparent frontrunner. \n\nJulie: I don’t agree with that. Baraka has the ability to inspire low-propensity voters, the kind who stayed home last November. Each of the Democratic nominees has a base that is unique to them, which they can turn out. The question is whether the eventual nominee can unify the party enough to get them all to work for him or her after June 10. \n\nMike: Be careful picking your opponent. Any candidate who wins a primary with six legitimate candidates in the field, will be battle-tested with a proven ability to win a tough race. Mayor Baraka has impressed many since day one of his race. Be careful thinking anyone in this field would be easy to beat in the state with nearly a million more Democrats than Republicans. This will be a close race to the finish. \n\nQuick thoughts on:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said at an economic forum his father has transformed the Republican Party into the America First Party or the MAGA Party. \n\nJulie: Where’s the lie? Rational Republicans like my friend Mike here have been pushed out of a party that is now a Trump cult. \n\nMike: No disagreement here. Trump has taken over the party.\n\nAt the same forum in Qatar, Trump junior was asked if he’d run for president in 2028. Recent polling shows JD Vance as heir apparent with Marco Rubio finding marginal support.\n\nJulie: I’m not sure that Donald Trump’s magic is transferable to anyone else. I also don’t believe we will have a free and fair election in 2028. \n\nMike: Julie’s right, though Americans like political brands, as do New Jerseyans — the Kennedys, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Keans. But Junior acts like a spoiled rich kid as opposed to the others who approach public service out of a sense of obligation.\n\nElon Musk has indicated he’s pulling away from the Trump admin to focus on Tesla. And yet, the South African native was singled out among the attendees by Trump during his bizarre meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. \n\nJulie: Musk is saying this because Tesla stock is in the toilet. The reality is that DOGE is his handiwork and that is still going. So is the ridiculous Afrikaner immigration policy and even Trump’s treatment of President Ramaphosa. Rate this as a blatant lie. \n\nMike: American politics is so fun. All the lefties hate the guy who did more for electric cars than anyone. And all the right-wingers come to the defense of the guy who enriches himself more from public subsidies than anyone in history. And it’s the same guy. America is great indeed. \n\nA note to readers: Can Americans still have a sensible and friendly political discussion across the partisan divide? The answer is yes, and we prove it every week with this “Friendly Fire” conversation. \n\nMike and Julie are deeply engaged in politics and commercial advocacy in New Jersey, so both have connections to many players discussed in this column. DuHaime, the founder of MAD Global Strategy, has worked for Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and George W. Bush.

Political insiders' intriguing warning to Kamala Harris as she prepares for comeback","text":"When former President Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, congratulations winged their way from Montecito.\n\n'I'm so excited to see that kind of representation,' the Duchess of Sussex said in an interview from her Southern California garden. 'You know, for me, being biracial, growing up, whether it was a doll or a person in office, you need to see someone who looks like you in some capacity.'\n\nWeeks earlier, Harris had reposted a video of Meghan Markle urging young people to get out and vote, thanking the Duchess for her 'powerful statement.'\n\nAt the time, it seemed like the beginning of a long-term alliance between the two women, even sparking speculation that Meghan will eventually embark on a political career of her own (a suggestion she recently denied).\n\nBut fast forward five years and, as Harris reportedly considers running for Governor of California, there is silence from camp Sussex.\n\nAnd it may be in the former vice president's best interest, as it seems any public endorsement from Meghan may now be regarded as a political albatross.\n\n'It would reinforce the stereotype of Kamala Harris being an out-of-touch elitist who is more interested in royalty than the struggles of Californians,' one Golden State political insider told the Daily Mail.\n\nAnother said: 'In California, the wokest of states, there's an exhaustion with celebrity, and an exhaustion with wokeness.' \n\nHarris is reportedly mulling a gubernatorial run in 2026 to replace Gavin Newsom, who is coming to the end of his second term.\n\nDespite her November presidential election humiliation, some aides of Harris are said to believe her universal name recognition could yet still clear the field if she enters the race. After all, a recent Emerson College poll measuring favorability gave her a 23 percent lead over her nearest rival.\n\nThose loyal aides believe becoming governor of the most populous state, and the world's fourth-largest economy, would provide Harris a base from which to attack President Donald Trump.\n\nBut, if she does intend to run for yet another public office - the former VP also served as senator of California, attorney general for the state and district attorney of San Francisco - experts have warned her not to make the same missteps as her failed bid for president.\n\nJoining the race with just 107 days before the election, Harris garnered a parade of celebrity endorsements in 2024 from the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nYet, the pomp and circumstance of her short-lived campaign was seemingly for naught - she lost the election with 226 electoral college votes to Trump's victorious 312.\n\nAnd on Monday, those high-profile endorsements became the subject of controversy.\n\nIt emerged that the Harris campaign paid $1 million to Winfrey's company Harpo Productions for 'event production,' and another $165,000 went to Beyoncé's production company after the star appeared on stage at a Harris rally in Houston, Texas.\n\nWhile both Winfrey and Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles - who runs her daughter's production company - said they did not take any personal fees, Trump has called for an investigation, alleging that Harris paid for endorsements 'under the guise of paying for entertainment,' he claimed on Truth Social.\n\nA spokeswoman for Harris said at the time the money was for 'ancillary costs' relating to production.\n\nShe said: 'We do not pay. We have never paid any artist and performer. We have never paid a fee to that person. There are laws that have to be followed that we have followed religiously on this campaign.'\n\nAll of which has shed light on the waning power of celebrity endorsement - once considered the silver bullet of any political campaign.\n\n'Harris’s presidential campaign proved that voters are more concerned about how a candidate will govern rather than who they pay to say nice things about them,' Matt Shupe, spokesman for the California Republican Party, told the Daily Mail.\n\n'The vibe shift in California is real and Californians are ready for real change in the trajectory of our state.'\n\nAs for Meghan Markle's place in all this, Tab Berg - a Republican political strategist based in California - is among those saying loudly that Harris would be wise to avoid wheeling out the Duchess, one of the state's most famous residents, for any splashy future endorsement. \n\n'In general, celebrity endorsements are now a net negative,' he said. 'It's not a working formula. There's a tiny number of voters that look for what celebrities say.'\n\nHe added, 'I don't think any of the serious players [in California] would take [Meghan] seriously.'\n\nIn fact, backing from Meghan could hurt Harris, Berg claimed, while an endorsement from Prince Harry would have 'zero' impact on her chances of victory. \n\nMeghan's approval rating in the UK hit a record low of 20 percent according to a recent poll, while in the US, she sits higher at 41 percent approval.\n\n'If Kamala runs I'm 100 percent sure she would hop on a Meghan Markle endorsement,' Berg alleged. 'But my advice would be to downplay it, don't do a public event, use it to raise money. Voters have no interest. It's a net negative.","summary":"When former President Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, congratulations winged their way from Montecito.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14736945/Meghan-Markle-Kamala-Harris-warning.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/19/96723313-0-Sources_have_also_revealed_that_Harry_is_lonelier_than_ever_in_M-a-25_1748025761178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 11:59:46","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":324705478,"title":"Original Sin: how Team Biden wished away his decline until it was too late","text":"Joe Biden mistook his victory in 2020 for a sweeping, FDR-like mandate. Officially, that was before age and decay caught up. Horrifically, for Democrats, in June 2024 a debacle of a debate against Donald Trump confirmed what Washington insiders had only dared whisper but what most voters had known: Biden should not have sought re-election.\n\nLess than a month later, he was out, replaced as Democratic nominee by his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Now, Trump runs wild and Biden’s legacy is buried beneath a heap of unkind reporting – and bouquets of sympathy, after news of his cancer.\n\n“It was an abomination,” one prominent Democratic strategist is quoted as saying by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. “He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”\n\nTapper and Thompson concur. Over 350 engrossing pages, they deliver a stinging judgment, trenchantly written and well-sourced.\n\nThe two reporters spoke to about 200 people, including members of Congress, White House staffers and campaign insiders. Some reportedly sounded the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and desperate efforts by aides to hide his deterioration. The alarm was not heeded.\n\nTapper is CNN’s lead DC anchor and chief Washington correspondent. Thompson is a national political correspondent for Axios and a CNN contributor. His speech at the recent White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was one for the ages.\n\n“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”\n\nOriginal Sin begins with a bang. Its first chapter is titled “He Fucked Us”, from an on-record quote by David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris campaign, before that manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 winning effort. “We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” Plouffe says. Harris was a “great soldier”, but the race was “a fucking nightmare. …\n\n“And it’s all Biden … He totally fucked us.” Try putting that toothpaste back in the tube. On the other hand, Plouffe doesn’t reveal what Harris knew about Biden’s fitness and when she knew it.\n\nBiden loyalists return the favor, too, the authors write: “Many … felt that Harris didn’t put in the work and was also just not a very nice person. Some quietly expressed buyer’s remorse: They should have picked [Gretchen] Whitmer,” the Democratic governor of Michigan.\n\nTapper and Thompson report cold political facts. In 2020, identity politics played an outsize role in Biden’s VP pick. “It boils down to whether he has a Hispanic woman or a Black woman,” Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, said then.\n\nTapper and Thompson lay bare a sense of betrayal.\n\n“The presidency requires someone who can perform at 2am during an emergency,” they write. “Cabinet secretaries in [Biden’s] own administration told us that by 2024, he could not be relied upon for this.”\n\nYet, Biden and his minions made sure to clear the field. The representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Biden’s only challenger among elected officials, never had a prayer. Governors stayed on the sidelines.\n\nTapper and Thompson tell us one senior White House aide left because he or she didn’t think Biden should run again. Biden had been walled off from staff to shield his decline.\n\n“I love Joe Biden,” the unnamed aide continues. “When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”\n\nThat ranks as an understatement. The cover of Original Sin shows Biden with hands covering his eyes. The former president, his family and his closest advisers – known as the “politburo” here – dwelt in a world of alternative facts.\n\n“The Bidens’ greatest strength is living in their own reality,” a source tells Tapper and Thompson. “And Biden himself is gifted at creating it: Beau isn’t going to die. Hunter’s sobriety is stable … Joe always tells the truth. Joe cares more about his family than his own ambition … They stick to the narrative and repeat it.”\n\nTo quote Lewis Carroll: “I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.”\n\nBiden’s decline was not sudden, according to Tapper and Thompson. The signs were there years ago: “During an eight-day, grueling bus tour in Iowa in December 2019, Biden gave his aides pause. While doing prep, he struggled to remember the name of longtime aide Mike Donilon. ‘You know, you know,’ he said, groping for it.”\n\nDonilon had worked with Biden for nearly 40 years. It should have been time to start worrying. Cover-up and denial are foundational to the Biden saga.\n\nThis week brought Biden’s bad diagnosis.\n\n“He did not develop [metastatic prostate cancer] in the last 100, 200 days,” Zeke Emanuel, a doctor, told MSNBC on Monday. “He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021 … I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.”\n\nEmanuel’s brother, Rahm, was Biden’s ambassador to Japan, and before that chief of staff to Obama.\n\nDemocrats must address such self-inflicted wounds. Disapproval of Trump may be all they need to retake the House next year. But reckoning and redirection will be needed to recapture the White House. The party’s brand circles the drain.\n\nFor now, Trump is the exception that proves the rule: America is no country for old presidents.\n\n Original Sin is published in the US by Penguin Random House","summary":"Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson issue a stinging verdict on a cover-up that may have cost Democrats the 2024 election\n\nJoe Biden mistook his victory in 2020 for a sweeping, FDR-like mandate.

On Tuesday it bubbled up in the California governor’s race, when one candidate, Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles, accused two other Democrats eyeing the governor’s mansion — former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra — of participating in a “cover-up” of Mr. Biden’s fading fitness in office.\n\n“Voters deserve to know the truth. What did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out?” Mr. Villaraigosa fumed in a statement, spurred by tidbits from the new book “Original Sin,” which chronicles the efforts of Mr. Biden’s inner circle to conceal his mental and physical decline. Mr. Villaraigosa called on Ms. Harris and Mr. Becerra to “apologize to the American people.”\n\nIs Mr. Villaraigosa, who is 72 himself, exploiting the orgy of Biden recriminations for political ends? Probably. Does he have a point? Absolutely. Team Biden deserves much abuse for its sins. That said, last week also reminded us that the Democrats’ flirtation with gerontocracy is not confined to a single office or branch of government when, on Wednesday, the House was shaken by the death of Representative Gerry Connolly.\n\nMr. Connolly, a 75-year-old lawmaker from Northern Virginia, had been in poor health. On Nov. 7 last year, two days after his re-election to a ninth term, he announced he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would undergo treatments. Even so, in December he won a high-profile contest against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee. The race was seen as a struggle over the future of the seniority system that has long shaped how Democrats pick committee leaders. Despite concerns about his health, seniority carried the day. On April 28, he announced that his cancer had returned and that he would not seek re-election next year. Less than a month later, he was gone.","summary":"Democrats need to figure out how to elevate new voices.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/opinion/biden-democrats-age.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cottle1-hjmz/25cottle1-hjmz-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 10:00:18","author":"Michelle Cottle","authors":["Michelle Cottle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":324674702,"title":"Democrats – and the media – betrayed public trust regarding Biden’s condition: Ted Diadiun","text":"Three things happened over the last few days regarding former President Joe Biden that should give voters, and especially Democrats, pause when considering how they have based their votes, whom they can trust, and how they should approach decisions in the future:\n\n*The publication Tuesday of the book “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” by Jake Tapper, CNN chief Washington correspondent, and Alex Thompson, a national correspondent for Axios.\n\n*The full audio release last Friday of Special Counsel Robert K. Hur’s interview with Biden on Oct. 8-9, 2023, investigating Biden’s handling of classified documents. \n\n*The announcement last Sunday that Biden has been diagnosed with an ominous form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones.\n\nFirst, the book – which chronicled the aggressive efforts undertaken by Biden, his wife Jill, his campaign staff, and Democrats across the land, abetted by an incurious national media, to keep the nation at large from learning just how out of it their president really was.\n\nIt is impossible for me to read about this without thinking of that famous scene from the movie “Casablanca,” where Captain Renaut alleges to be “shocked … shocked, to find that gambling is going on in here” – just before the croupier comes up to hand him his winnings.\n\nYes, it’s a well-worn cliché, but how do you avoid it after listening to Tapper tell Terry Gross six times on her NPR interview show last week that he and others were “shocked” (yes, shocked. Also alarmed) when they saw Biden’s deterioration at his June 27, 2024, debate with Donald Trump?\n\nThe president’s halting speech and gait were obvious long before, to anyone with eyes to see – but dismissed as a congenital stutter and getting older by Biden sycophants who then attacked anyone who mentioned it as “ageist” and other insults. \n\nTapper himself had excoriated Lara Trump in a 2020 interview for mocking Biden’s “stutter” when she tried to address the cognitive issues. He has since apologized, he told Gross.\n\nRecall that Biden and his handlers took advantage of the pandemic lockdowns by remaining out of public sight as much as possible during that presidential campaign.\n\nEven hidden away as he was, it became clear that something was amiss, as he fumbled his way through the campaign, misstating the Declaration of Independence in Texas, telling a South Carolina crowd that he was running for the Senate, and stating in an Iowa appearance that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”\n\nDan Quayle never lived down misspelling “potato,” and the media has stapled Donald Trump’s comment about “good people on both sides” to him for years, but the “poor kids” gaffe disappeared from view almost as soon as Biden said it.\n\nThree weeks before the 2024 debate with Trump, Wall Street Journal reporters Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes highlighted his mental issues under the headline, “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,” only to be roundly accused of a partisan hatchet job, kicked off by a CNN analysis disparaging the reporters’ work as akin to Fox News and stating that the Journal “owed its readers – and the public – better.”\n\nThe irony in that statement cries out for ridicule: It was the rest of the national media that owed the public better, so afraid of giving people information that might help Trump that they abdicated their responsibility and hid the truth. \n\nAdding to the burgeoning evidence of the massive cover-up regarding Biden’s condition was the public access to the Hur interview, which the former president’s allies had tried to prevent.\n\nA transcript of the interview was released last year, but listening to Biden’s feeble attempts to remember details and complete his thoughts cast a different light and made obvious why his administration tried desperately to keep it from the public before and even after he ended his 2024 campaign.\n\nFollowing the interview, Hur ruled that Biden had “willfully” kept the documents, but said, devastatingly, that any jury would find him a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” and no charges were ultimately filed.\n\nFollowing that, Democrats venomously attacked Hur as a result, calling his comments a politically motivated cheap shot. Kamala Harris, among many others, rushed to Biden’s defense, casting Hur’s description as “gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.”\n\nTo the contrary, it is painful to listen to the interview posted by Axios Saturday, as Biden, responding to Hur’s respectful prodding, pathetically tries to remember when he left office as vice president and even when his beloved son Beau died, wandering off on tangents that had nothing to do with the questions being asked.\n\nThen Sunday came the announcement of Biden’s cancer diagnosis, which should generate only care and concern for his well-being.\n\nThis must be said, however: Even though Biden is now a private citizen, he was president until just four months ago.\n\nA president’s health is of national concern, and it is troubling that Biden, with access to the best health care in the country, should have a cancer as advanced as his that is just now being diagnosed, especially since he had been given repeated clean bills of health. \n\nIt’s reported that he hadn’t had a PSA screening, which can catch prostate cancer in its early stages, since 2014. While prevailing medical practice holds that PSA tests can be stopped after the age of 70, with a president, it would seem prudent to be more persistent than normal with testing for all sorts of health issues.\n\nThe bottom line to all the above is that Americans were woefully – and deliberately – uninformed and misinformed about the mental and physical capabilities of the man who was running for four more years as president until just four months shy of the election.\n\nThe truth is finally being spoken out loud – long after the fact.\n\nBut the question Democratic voters should be asking themselves is this: How can they ever again trust their leadership, and its media accomplices, to tell them the truth?\n\nAnd why should they? \n\nTed Diadiun is a member of the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer.\n\nTo reach Ted Diadiun: tdiadiun@cleveland.com\n\nHave something to say about this topic?\n\n* Send a letter to the editor, which will be considered for print publication.\n\n* Email general questions, comments or corrections regarding this opinion article to Elizabeth Sullivan, director of opinion, at esullivan@cleveland.com.","summary":"The bottom line is that Americans were woefully – and deliberately – uninformed and misinformed about the mental and physical capabilities of the man who was running for four more years as president until just four months shy of the election.

But Dr. Mikhail Varshavski remembers watching his father, a physician from Russia, tackle medical school and residency all over again in America. \"My father decided to pursue medical education, yet again, in a new country, in a new language for the second time in his life, bless his heart,\" Varshavski told Fox News Digital. \"I fell in love with the field, and I realized this is the only thing I want to do for the rest of my life.\" Being labeled \"sexiest doctor alive\" wasn't part of that plan, but Varshavski has leveraged the superficial attention into a way to provide health information to millions. TOP TRUMP ADMIN HEALTH OFFICIALS SHARE VISION FOR HHS TO 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' Varshavski's family immigrated to the United States from Russia when he was six years old, seeking a better life. The transition came with challenges, though. \"We had to restart our lives completely from scratch,\" he said. His mother, a Ph.D. math professor, swept floors to pay the bills while his father, who had been a physician in their home country, repeated the arduous process to become a doctor again. Varshavski followed in his father's footsteps, completing an accelerated, seven-year combined program for a bachelor’s degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree at the New York Institute of Technology. He was also building a following on Instagram before he started his residency in 2014. Then came the \"15 minutes of fame,\" Varshavski said. Buzzfeed published an article in August 2015 titled \"Um, You Really Need To See This Hot Doctor And His Dog,\" a compilation of Instagram photos of Varshavski and his husky. People Magazine dubbed Varshavski the \"sexiest doctor alive\" in November 2015. The superficial spotlight took Varshavski aback. At first. \"This isn't the attention I'm trying to get,\" he recalled thinking at the time. \"I would like to educate people. I want to celebrate healthcare.

If the \"gatekeepers\" wouldn't let him talk about the topics he cared about — vaccines, nutrition, physical activity — he would have to do it himself, he said. He launched his YouTube channel, \"Doctor Mike,\" inspired by a recurring theme he noticed in his day job. \"Patients were being misled by something they read online or saw on television, usually in the form of a late-night infomercial,\" he said. This not only distracted patients from \"putting in work like improving their diet, getting seven to nine hours of sleep, exercising [and] maintaining a healthy mental state,\" but it also spurred some to take \"questionable medications and supplements,\" Varshavski said. He realized he could reach more than just the 30-40 patients he saw each day in person. He now boasts about 14 million subscribers on YouTube. \"At a time where patients' first instinct … is to look at their phones, I wanted to be there for them,\" he said. \"Just like family doctors are there for our patients when they're in the hospital, when they are in the nursing home, when they can't leave their home, and they're bed-bound, we're there.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to his videos talking about everything from high blood pressure to nutrition labels, and reacting to popular medical dramas or TikTok videos, Varshavski has also interviewed celebrities, medical professionals, and political guests, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Vice President Kamala Harris and current FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary. The New Jersey-based doctor still balances his online fame with his job seeing patients, most of whom don't recognize him as a celebrity, Varshavski said. \"The ones that do recognize me are very excited,\" he said. \"I can't tell you how much joy it brings me to have a child who's nervous to go the doctor face light up because it's the doctor that they saw on YouTube.\" Varshavski will be on \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday, May 27.","summary":"From immigrant roots to online celebrity, Dr. Mikhail Varshavski shared how he uses his platform to educate millions on healthcare while still balancing patient care.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sexiest-doctor-alive-transformed-viral-fame-health-education-millions","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/‘sexiest-doctor_v2.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 09:30:31","author":"Elizabeth Heckman","authors":["Elizabeth Heckman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":324694618,"title":"Tax cuts always reveal the differences between the parties","text":"The differences between the two major American political parties are always revealed over the issue of tax cuts. There isn’t a better example than the spending plan that just passed the House of Representatives.\n\nThe one “big, beautiful bill,” as President Trump likes to call it, does an awful lot to improve the lives of all Americans. It unleashes domestic energy production, secures our border and cuts government spending by more than $1.5 trillion, but the tax cuts included will get much of the attention. It all passed without a single Democratic vote.\n\nHouse Republicans made good on Mr. Trump’s promises to restore economic prosperity, provide new tax relief to hardworking Americans and continue the Trump tax cuts of 2017 that spurred the economy to great heights. Democrats, however, are headed in exactly the opposite direction. If they had the power to do so, they would raise taxes dramatically tomorrow and spend the money on leftist priorities.\n\nElections have consequences, as President Obama said, and Mr. Trump won the last one handily. So, instead of Democratic tax increases, we have fantastic news for every American who pays taxes.\n\nThis bill doesn’t just tinker around the edges of our broken system; it bangs it into shape to put American workers first. After years of Democratic policies prioritizing bureaucracy and bloat over hardworking citizens, it’s a long-overdue course correction.\n\nAt its core, the bill continues Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, stopping a looming tax increase that would have hit working-class families hard. Still, it offers a lot more.\n\nThe bill eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, two key Trump campaign promises. This means millions of Americans in hospitality, food service and hourly work will finally keep what they earn. These are the hard-earned dollars of waitresses, bartenders, construction workers and nurses pulling double shifts to support their families.\n\nThis change is transformative for the estimated 4 million American workers who rely on tips and the 80 million hourly employees in the U.S. It’s not just tax relief; it’s respect for labor.\n\nThe bill doesn’t stop there. It slashes taxes on Social Security benefits and allows the full deduction of auto loan interest on American-made vehicles. This incentive rewards patriotism and practical financial planning all at once. The bill also permanently doubles the child tax credit and closes loopholes that let illegal aliens claim that benefit.\n\nThe legislation cuts taxes for companies that manufacture and hire in the U.S., boosting American competitiveness. It will encourage investment in new factories, high-quality jobs and long-term domestic growth. It will prevent the loss of more than 6 million jobs, including 1.1 million manufacturing jobs, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. That’s not just policy; that’s economic patriotism.\n\nFamilies will feel it where it matters most: the paycheck. The bill is projected to raise real annual wages by $2,100 to $3,300 per worker. For a median-income household with two children, that means an increase of $4,000 to $5,000 in take-home pay. That’s money for groceries, school supplies, gas and rent.\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say that this is the most worker-centered tax proposal in a generation.\n\nContrast that with what the Democrats offer.\n\nThey think Americans aren’t taxed enough, and they compound that error by wanting to give illegal aliens access to benefits funded by the tax dollars that are collected. For example, Democrats are squawking over the provision in the one “big, beautiful bill” that blocks 1.4 million illegal aliens from obtaining Medicaid benefits.\n\nThis is the same federal program that Democrats believe should fund sex change surgeries for minors, which the bill also bans. You can’t ever tell Democrats that Americans pay too much in taxes. They need that money for the illegal aliens. And the sex changes.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that one of the policy positions that doomed Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign for president last year was her support for taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for illegal aliens and prison inmates.\n\nIt was shocking, and voters rejected it, but just six months later, it somehow became part of mainstream Democratic thought.\n\nThat’s the perfect illustration of the differences between the parties right now.\n\nRepublicans want to cut taxes and trust that Americans know best how to spend their money to help themselves and their families.\n\nDemocrats want to raise taxes and spend your money on illegal aliens and sex change operations for children. That was revealed on the presidential campaign trail last year, and now it’s playing out in Congress.\n\nThe House has acted, and now it’s the Senate’s turn. The country voted for this, and it’s up to Congress to send the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature.\n\n• Tim Murtaugh is a Washington Times columnist and founder of Line Drive Public Affairs.

In fact, much of the narrative was about how, as a woman of color, she might modernize the royal family.At the time of the couple's wedding, this was celebrated in newspapers as having the potential for radical social change.The Wall Street Journal suggested that her arrival might \"mark a giant step in the modernization of the British monarchy,\" while historian Ted Powell, quoted in The Guardian, said: \"It is difficult to overstate how important it is to have a member of the royal family ... who is mixed race and embracing her heritage and stating that is very much part of her.\"It was not just race, though. Meghan has over the years repeatedly leveraged that as a child she wrote to Proctor & Gamble to oppose an ad that suggested \"women are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory Clear.\"She was also described not only as a feminist but as an \"activist,\" dating to before she met Prince Harry.And before they even married, she told royal fans in Cardiff, Wales, that Prince Harry was \"a feminist too.\"The 'Duke And Duchess Of Woke'But, as with many digital age political movements, they eventually encountered backlash from the conservative media, initially in Britain and later in America too.In 2019, Meghan was mocked for writing inspiring messages on the side of bananas that were being given to sex workers and also because of an edition of U.K. Vogue magazine she guest edited.Piers Morgan wrote in the Daily Mail: \"Me-Me-Meghan Markle's shamelessly hypocritical super-woke Vogue stunt proves she cares more about promoting herself than the Royal Family or Britain.\"Here is Meghan being about as political as any royal has ever been. She's chosen 15 female 'trailblazers' and 'changemakers' for the special 'Forces for Change' issue, all picked because they promote 'equality, kindness and open-mindedness.'\"The women she's selected represent the greatest hits of virtue-signalling—with a nod to everything from 'body positivity,' female empowerment, mental health, disability and race to transgender rights, climate change, diversity and privilege.\"The last one made me laugh out loud. I'm sure the one thing we all need most in the world right now is a fabulously rich and entitled Princess lecturing us on privilege from her servant-laden royal quarters.\"Meanwhile, neo-conservative U.K. political commentator and author Douglas Murray gave her a nickname that would stick in an article for Unherd: \"Meghan and Harry are playing a dangerous game—The Duke and Duchess of Woke shouldn't raise the subject of 'unearned privilege.'\"Prince Harry And Meghan As Culture War BattlefieldInitially, the debate about Harry and Meghan's politically conscious world view was a battle the progressive side fought with vigor.Meghan and Harry's 2021 Oprah Winfrey interview was perhaps the most impactful of their social justice interventions, starting a global debate about racism, colonialism and the monarchy.The duchess said her son Prince Archie was not going to be treated like other royal family members: \"So we have in tandem the conversation of 'He won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title' and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born.\"Meghan's words were still resonating when Prince William and Princess Kate visited the Caribbean in March 2022 for what would become known as their \"disaster tour.\"Bert Samuels, a Jamaican attorney and reparations advocate, at the time told Newsweek: \"Jamaicans were very torn up to hear about Harry and Meghan's issue, and Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey, and that has torn us.\"That's William's brother, that's his nephew, and for Harry to have been treated the way he was, and worse yet Meghan.\"The Jamaicans are very hurt by the treatment of an African American woman in that family. William needs to speak to that when he comes and as it were, he should come here with an apology, not only for slavery but for the treatment of a black woman who had to run out of the palace with her husband. That's a strong issue and that's a fresh wound.\"Harry and Meghan's Progressive Status Is ComplicatedHowever, Prince Harry appeared to downgrade the force of Meghan's allegations during interviews around the release of his book, Spare.The duke said: \"The British press said that, right? Did Meghan ever mention 'they're racists?'\"In the same interview, he also backed Lady Susan Hussey, Queen Elizabeth II's former lady-in-waiting, who quit the palace over a racially charged exchange in which she repeatedly asked a Black charity boss where she was from, despite having been told she was British.\"I'm very happy for Ngozi Fulani to be invited into the Palace to sit down with Lady Susan Hussey, and to reconcile, because Meghan and I love Susan Hussey,\" Harry said. \"She thinks she's great.\"The comment was jarring because many of the very progressive voices who had publicly supported Meghan's comments on race after Oprah were the same ones condemning Lady Susan Hussey at the time.According to the 2023 biography Endgame, by Omid Scobie, Charles wrote to Meghan following Oprah to say that the motivation for the comment about Archie's skin tone had been benign curiosity rather than concern.Shortly after Spare, Harry and Meghan's team indicated they were wrapping up look-back projects focusing on their royal strife and pivoting to look forward at their futures.Harry and Meghan still pursue projects with a social purpose, but even these have at times been fraught, such as Meghan's investment in fashion brand Cesta Collective.The company makes much of the wages it pays to its Rwandan bag makers but has also been slammed for \"poverty porn\" over awkward publicity images with some criticism of past comments by the Italian founders.Meghan has, however, reinvented herself in the image of Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow with her cooking show With Love, Meghan and her Goop-style online shop, As Ever.Some compared her to \"trad wife\" influencers on social media. Whether that is fair or not, the move was certainly a long way from the early-career Meghan who raged against the homely image of women in the kitchen of the Ivory Clear commercial.Harry, Meghan And The 2024 Presidential ElectionPerhaps the final decisive moment when the Sussexes had to choose which version of themselves to step into came with the recent U.S. presidential election.In 2020, they spoke out in veiled terms against Donald Trump, with Meghan calling for the \"change we all need and deserve.\"They earned a clapback from Trump that September, when he said he was \"not a fan\" of Meghan, while a Republican politician wrote to the British Embassy in Washington calling for Queen Elizabeth II to strip them of their titles.By 2024, Trump was attempting to win back the White House by beating Kamala Harris, whom Meghan praised in 2020 on the basis of what she could achieve for women of color: \"I'm so excited to see that kind of representation,\" the duchess said at the time.In 2024, though, Harry was facing the potential threat of Trump revoking his U.S. visa over comments in his book about taking drugs.Ultimately, the couple stayed quiet during the election, taking a back seat as Harris lost despite endorsements from the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.The decision may have been the correct one, after all polling for Newsweek showed an endorsement by them would have dissuaded as many people as it persuaded.Early Trump policies will have proved difficult for the couple to watch, such as the rollback of diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and cuts to USAID, a funding source that some of Harry's charities have accessed in the past.Jack Royston is chief royal correspondent for Newsweek, based in London.

No, it’s a sign of strength to have some level of curiosity and concern and care about the wellbeing of others.”\n\nMusk, the chief executive of Tesla, criticised Harris’s Democratic administration and its attitude to immigrants in an interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan released in March.\n\n“The fundamental weakness of western civilisation is empathy, the empathy exploit,” Musk said. “They’re exploiting a bug in western civilisation, which is the empathy response.”\n\nIntroduced by McGrath as “one of the most successful women in history” with “her best work ahead of her”, Harris joked: “I am unemployed right now.” She walked on and off the stage to a standing ovation and the strains of Beyoncé’s Halo.\n\nHarris spoke about her upbringing and career. She shared anecdotes from her time as California attorney general negotiating with the JP Morgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon.\n\nShe did not mention by name Donald Trump, or JD Vance, or her narrow defeat at November’s US presidential election.\n\nHarris concluded with thinly veiled remarks about the new US administration’s foreign and trade policies.\n\n“I do worry, frankly, about what’s happening right now in the world,” she said.\n\n“I do worry that it is important that we remember history. It’s important that we remember the 1930s. It’s important that we remember that history has taught us that isolation does not equal insulation\n\n“It is important that we understand and remember history, which taught us the interdependence and interconnection between nations.\n\n“History that has taught us the importance of relationships of trust, of the importance of friendships, integrity, honesty.”\n\nShe tried to turn personal anecdotes – many taken from her 2019 book – into life lessons for those attending the conference.\n\nHarris said she had often become the first woman in a job – despite discouragement.\n\n“I don’t hear no. I eat no for breakfast. I don’t hear no until maybe the tenth time. I can’t begin to tell you the number of times it has been explicitly or implicitly said to me – it’s not your time. You’re not ready, they’re not ready.\n\n“Don’t you listen. And this is again what I mean about applauding ambition.”\n\nShe said Americans distrusted AI because it threatened jobs and risked spreading misinformation.\n\n“It is important to celebrate innovation but, again this may be just the prosecutor in me, one must ask also: are there vulnerable people and are we doing what we can to ensure they’re safe?”\n\nOther speakers at the conference included the British entrepreneur and podcaster Steven Bartlett and the Sydney real estate agent David Walker.\n\nAREC is being held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.

I think I am quite good at spotting a bargain. At least this is what I tell myself. But selling? I am either too late or far too early. I still haven’t sold Boeing. I sit on my shares in the hope the paper losses will miraculously go away. Worse. I bought more as the skid continued. And I sold Netflix after I had made a profit of 60% within a week, right into the COVID lockdown. My own success scared me. But I could have made 600% if I had held on to it until today. The crux is: if you don’t need the money, where do you want to put it next? So if I consider selling Amazon today it is not to bag a gain of 113.5% accumulated over the last few years, or because I knew that the company has erred in its ways so disastrously that a recovery was not in sight. I think about selling because the world has changed since January 20 and I sit on far too many dollar investments, and selling Boeing with a 70% loss would be too painful to contemplate. This incapacity of mine is called loss aversion, and is apparently a flaw I share with most humans. Amazon, which started as an online book seller in 1997 is now the world’s biggest online shop, selling $400 billion worth of consumer goods per year as a retailer and as a platform for third-party vendors. It also sells subscriptions for premium deliveries, film streaming (117 million subscribers – almost as much as Disney with 157 million) and ad space on its websites. Half of Amazon’s profits are made with cloud services, its most profitable business. A large share of logistics is handled by Amazon itself, operating production processes, warehouses, planes and trucks. Amazon’s newest business venture is Kuiper, a satellite-based, broadband internet service challenging Musk’s Starlink network. Jeff Bezos, the founder and largest shareholder of Amazon, is also the owner of a traditionally left-leaning newspaper, The Washington Post. Like most US billionaires, Bezos has tried very hard to be on good terms with President Donald Trump. Bezos had donated a million dollars to Trump’s election campaign, then rubbed shoulders with the high and mighty at Trump’s inauguration party. The Amazon founder also instructed his opinion editor David Shipley at the Post to focus opinion pieces on “personal liberties” and “free markets”. Opposing opinions “should write elsewhere”. Shipley, a journalist with an illustrious career in the NYT, at Bloomberg and The New Republic, understood this as a pro-Trump gagging order; not quite unfounded. Only a few months earlier, Bezos had given instructions not to endorse the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Note to self: when we sanctioned Russian oligarchs for not opposing Putin in his belligerence, what did we really expect from them? To walk up to the henchman and demand a stop to the craze? Or to abandon all business and to run away? Well, not a single billionaire, with the exception of George Soros, who knows a thing or two about fascism, stood up to Trump. And none of them was at risk of falling from a balcony or exploding in a plane, or disappearing in a Gulag. At least not yet. Well, all the bows and prostrations didn’t save Bezos from Trump’s tariff onslaught. Other than Apple, which is for the time being given a tariff dispense for its China-manufactured iPhones, Amazon is very unlikely to be given leniency. Its business model is like Apple’s also based on China-arbitrage. But its wares are not just a single item like the iPhone, but everything the world has on offer, every type of consumer goods one could think of. It is Walmart online. If Trump exempted Amazon, he might as well drop all tariffs on China. According to ECDB, 70% of all items sold by Amazon (proprietary business and third party vendors) hail from China. And half of Amazon’s consumer business is with the US, which is threatened with exorbitant tariffs, for 90 days “reduced” to 35%. What hurts is that third-party vendors pay 20% for the privilege to trade on Amazon, whose own margins are only in the single digits. Those traders will wither away now. At first, Amazon had a plan to price the tariffs for every purchase on their website separately, to make clear that the total was not driven by greed, but dictated by law. Airlines or car rental companies do the same when they price their offers. They show taxes as distinct from their revenue, like airport fees. Of course, this would have been unacceptable to the MAGA propagandists, who claim that tariffs are not taxes paid by the US consumer, but levies on foreign exporters to be borne by them. After great outrage by the White House spokespeople and an angry call from Trump, the project was abandoned. It would have been good tutoring for the electorate. Amazon has always ferociously reinvested profits in its business, building warehouses, data centres, logistic hubs and new ventures like Kuiper. It is highly profitable, but refuses to pay dividends. Many analysts therefore demanded that now that the business has matured, it should start sharing profits with its shareholders. But it will need the money now. It has to expand its international operations. The more money it can make abroad, the less painful will be its US shrinkage. Its cloud business is not affected by trade frictions yet. The picture may alter when Europe retaliates with service tariffs or tech taxes. Its wait and see. Amazon’s low-margin consumer business can regionalise, like it did when the UK went for Brexit. Amazon has the capacity to juggle different markets and thus smoothen the fallout of the tariff massacre. What becomes too expensive for the US will be shipped to other markets. The flow of goods can be adapted flexibly to any tariff changes. And there will be many until 2029. It is a crisis for Amazon, but not a mortal threat. I still make orders on Amazon without much ado. I still watch films on Amazon Prime. Even the Post still reads more principled than its owner. To own Amazon shares is not as toxic as being invested in Tesla. Perhaps I better stay put.

Swift appeared to have a glass of white wine while Kelce reportedly enjoyed a cocktail.\n\nUnlike last off-season, when Kelce and Swift celebrated his Super Bowl victory by galivanting around Europe amid her Eras Tour, the two have maintained a lower profile in 2025. Whether that’s because of Kansas City’s loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LIX or a genuine desire for more privacy is hard to say.\n\nWhat is clear is that Kelce is in better shape this offseason than he was in 2024, when he appeared far heavier than his listed weight of 250 pounds. Earlier this month, Kelce told the crowd at an MGM Studios event he was down 25 pounds, as reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nKelce and Swift did not appear to cross paths with anyone from the Mar-a-Lago universe, as Trump spent a rare weekend away from his Palm Beach club to speak at West Point’s graduation. Trump has been critical of Swift since she supported his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe couple was actually first spotted by MMA fighter Jose Andres Cortes, who shared a photo of Kelce and Swift on social media.\n\nPhotos emerged earlier this month of Taylor and Travis on a family day out in Philadelphia as they broke their cover after months without being seen.\n\nThey were joined by multiple members of the Kelce family for a Mother’s Day meal, including Travis’ brother Jason and his wife Kylie, as well as their mom Donna.\n\nSwift has mainly been in the headlines of late after being dragged into the bitter legal war between her old pal Lively and her It Ends With Us co-star Baldoni.\n\nA bombshell legal letter earlier this month revealed the explosive alleged ‘threats’ that are believed to have shattered Blake and Taylor’s 10-year friendship.\n\nThe court letter, submitted by Baldoni’s legal team amid his dispute with Lively, claimed the actress tried to coerce Swift into siding with her publicly by threatening to leak years’ worth of their private text messages.\n\nThe songstress fought back after she was dramatically subpoenaed in the case by Baldoni’s legal team, only for that summoning to be withdrawn this week.\n\nAs for Kelce, he sparked a stir earlier this week when photos emerged of his extremely hairy back after a workout in Miami.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs legend is currently working hard in the offseason to prepare for what could be his last year in the NFL.\n\nEarlier in the week he took part in a rigorous Miami workout, and photographers caught the moment he changed his shirt at the end of the session.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, a half-naked Kelce sent the internet into meltdown… and mainly for one reason: the carpet of hair covering his back and chest.\n\nThe man himself has regularly referenced his hairy body – which has even gained him the nickname ‘The Big Yeti’ – but fans were quick to mention his love life.\n\n‘Taylor Swift is okay with that?’ one wrote on X, while another added: ‘Travis Kelce is hairy as s***. I like a hairy man but sir.’\n\nUp next for Kelce are three sets of offseason workouts, starting May 27. He’s not technically required to attend those practices but will be on hand for mandatory minicamp on June 17, 18 and 19.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift are exploring familiar territory linked to President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Taylor Swift and a fit Travis Kelce seen enjoying a low-key evening out together first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/taylor-swift-and-a-fit-travis-kelce-seen-enjoying-a-low-key-evening-out-together/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taylor-Swift-and-trim-Travis-Kelce-spotted-on-quiet-date.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 04:08:36","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.138},{"id":324594774,"title":"Kamala Harris Cursed Out CNN Journalist After Biden Debate Grilling: Book","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly used an expletive to describe CNN anchor Anderson Cooper after a tense interview following former President Joe Biden's widely criticised debate performance against Donald Trump in 2024, a new book claims.In Original Sin, authored by CNN's Jake Tapper and political journalist Alex Thompson, Harris is quoted as calling Cooper a \"mother******\" in private conversations with colleagues after he questioned her about Biden's cognitive health during a CNN appearance.\"This mother****** doesn't treat me like the damn vice president of the United States,\" Harris reportedly said after the interview, according to the book. \"I thought we were better than that.\"The interview aired after Biden's debate performance sparked concern within the Democratic Party, with critics highlighting his halting delivery and visible confusion during the 90-minute exchange with Trump. Cooper had referenced growing panic among Democrats and asked whether Biden should consider stepping aside.Harris defended the president, saying he had a \"slow start\" but finished \"strong,\" and emphasised his three-and-a-half years of work in office over a single debate. However, the book notes she was visibly angry after the interview and took Cooper's questions personally.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Original Sin, released on May 20, also offers an inside look at Biden's debate preparation, describing how the then-82-year-old president struggled during mock sessions, sometimes napping through key prep days and often requiring cough drops due to a raspy voice. His advisers, the book says, noticed his delivery was inconsistent and his answers were difficult to follow.The authors claim White House aides made efforts to limit Biden's public appearances and control his messaging, sometimes shortening planned video remarks and using edited footage to avoid noticeable mistakes.Biden later attributed his debate performance to a cold. He eventually withdrew from the 2024 race, making him the first sitting US president in more than 50 years to do so. In a recent development, Biden revealed that he has been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer that has metastasised to his bones.","summary":"\"This mother****** doesn't treat me like the damn vice president of the United States,\" Harris reportedly said after the interview.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-cursed-out-cnns-anderson-cooper-after-biden-debate-grilling-book-8501245","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4sb4k218_kamala-harris_625x300_07_November_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 03:51:56","author":"Anjali Thakur","authors":["Anjali Thakur"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":324576304,"title":"Watch Taylor Swift FINALLY break cover on date night with Travis Kelce... and he looks transformed","text":"Watch Taylor Swift FINALLY break cover on date night with Travis Kelce... and he looks transformed\n\nREAD MORE: Seething Kelce slams Trump over comments about Swift's looks \n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 03:45 BST, 25 May 2025 | Updated: 03:45 BST, 25 May 2025\n\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift are swimming in President Donald Trump’s waters as the Kansas City Chiefs star enjoys his offseason on Florida’s Atlantic coast.\n\nThe couple was spotted leaving Harry’s restaurant in West Palm on Friday - a few days after Kelce and father Ed were seen enjoying themselves in Boca Raton.\n\nAs reported by TMZ, the couple left Harry’s hand in hand around 10pm with security flaking them on both sides. Swift appeared to have a glass of white wine while Kelce is said to have sipped on a cocktail.\n\nUnlike last off-season, when Kelce and Swift celebrated his Super Bowl victory by galivanting around Europe amid her Eras Tour, the two have maintained a lower profile in 2025. Whether that’s because of Kansas City’s loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LIX or a genuine desire for more privacy is hard to say.\n\nWhat is clear is that Kelce is in better shape this offseason than he was in 2024, when he appeared far heavier than his listed weight of 250 pounds. Earlier this month, Kelce told the crowd at an MGM Studios event he was down 25 pounds, as reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nKelce and Swift did not appear to cross paths with anyone from the Mar-a-Lago universe, as Trump spent a rare weekend away from his Palm Beach club to speak at West Point’s graduation. Trump has been critical of Swift since she supported his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce spotted on a late-night date at Harry's in West Palm Beach\n\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift were seen enjoying a romantic meal in Florida on Friday night\n\nThe couple was flanked by security on the way out of Harry's around 10pm on Friday night\n\nThe couple was actually first spotted by MMA fighter Jose Andres Cortes, who shared a photo of Kelce and Swift on social media.\n\nPhotos emerged earlier this month of Taylor and Travis on a family day out in Philadelphia as they broke their cover after months without being seen.\n\nThey were joined by multiple members of the Kelce family for a Mother's Day meal, including Travis' brother Jason and his wife Kylie, as well as their mom Donna.\n\nSwift has mainly been in the headlines of late after being dragged into the bitter legal war between her old pal Lively and her It Ends With Us co-star Baldoni.\n\nA bombshell legal letter earlier this month revealed the explosive alleged 'threats' that are believed to have shattered Blake and Taylor's 10-year friendship.\n\nThe court letter, submitted by Baldoni's legal team amid his dispute with Lively, claimed the actress tried to coerce Swift into siding with her publicly by threatening to leak years' worth of their private text messages.\n\nThe songstress fought back after she was dramatically subpoenaed in the case by Baldoni's legal team, only for that summoning to be withdrawn this week.\n\nKelce and his girlfriend have generally been keeping a low profile during the NFL offseason\n\nKelce (left) is seen with Swift as well as Patrick and Brittany Mahomes at the 2024 US Open \n\nKelce was believed to be heavier during the 2024 offseason, as seen in this September photo\n\nTravis Kelce is seen on May 12 in New York at one of several red-carpet events he's attended\n\nAs for Kelce, he sparked a stir earlier this week when photos emerged of his extremely hairy back after a workout in Miami.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs legend is currently working hard in the offseason to prepare for what could be his last year in the NFL.\n\nEarlier in the week he took part in a rigorous Miami workout, and photographers caught the moment he changed his shirt at the end of the session.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, a half-naked Kelce sent the internet into meltdown... and mainly for one reason: the carpet of hair covering his back and chest.\n\nThe man himself has regularly referenced his hairy body - which has even gained him the nickname 'The Big Yeti' - but fans were quick to mention his love life.\n\n'Taylor Swift is okay with that?' one wrote on X, while another added: 'Travis Kelce is hairy as s***. I like a hairy man but sir.'\n\nUp next for Kelce are three sets of offseason workouts, starting May 27. He’s not technically required to attend those practices but will be on hand for mandatory minicamp on June 17, 18 and 19.\n\nKansas City ChiefsFloridaTravis Kelce\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWatch Taylor Swift FINALLY break cover on date night with Travis Kelce... and he looks transformed\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are swimming in President Donald Trump's waters as the Kansas City Chiefs star enjoys his offseason on Florida's Atlantic coast ahead of next week's OTAs.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14746679/Watch-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-date.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/25/00/98725009-0-image-a-31_1748129778196.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/19/1676159368951017537/1024x576_MP4_1676159368951017537.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-25 02:45:57","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.238},{"id":324569864,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Surprising Outburst About Anderson Cooper Following Heated Interview","text":"Kamala Harris branded CNN’s Anderson Cooper a ‘motherf***er’ after a tense interview, a new book has revealed.\n\nThe former vice president had been grilled by the anchor over Joe Biden’s debate performance against Donald Trump last year.\n\nCooper had questioned her over whether the then president should step aside over his horrific showing and questioned his cognitive abilities.\n\nDirectly afterwards, Harris told her aides: ‘This motherf***er doesn’t treat me like the damn Vice President of the United States.’\n\nThat’s according to Anderson’s CNN colleague Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson in their new book ‘Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.’\n\nHarris went on the defense for Biden in the interview with Cooper, who had spoke of Democrats feeling a sense of panic over Biden’s ‘train wreck’ of a performance.\n\nShe shot back at him, saying: ‘Donald Trump lied over and over again as he is want to do’, describing Biden as having a slow start to the debate.\n\nCooper said: ‘You debated against then Vice President Biden four years ago, and he was a very different person four years – that’s certainly true is it not?’\n\nAfter a deep sigh, Harris added: ‘Anderson the point has to be performance in terms of what a president does.\n\n‘I got the point you are making about a one and a half hour debate tonight, I’m talking about three and a half years of performance that has been historic.’\n\nAccording to Tapper’s book some in Biden’s circle cheered on Harris’s defense of the president, and that she was clearly angry following the sit down with Cooper. \n\nThe book has also shown a light on Biden’s prep for the debate, claiming he was ‘rusty’ in the lead up to it. \n\nIt also said that Biden had napped the entire first day of his prep, after specifically setting time aside to practice at Camp David last June. \n\nOf the mock debates at the Maryland retreat, Tapper and Thompson said: ‘Biden’s performance ranged from bad to passable. \n\n‘His voice was hard to hear, his delivery was halting, and his answers were all over the place.\n\n‘Advisers also told him his mouth was agape when he wasn’t speaking and urged him to close it.\n\n‘His voice got raspier as the week went on, to the point that aides couldn’t hear him during mock sessions. Biden kept asking for more cough drops.’ \n\nPresident Biden eventually stood down his reelection campaign following the debate performance after intense backlash. \n\nTapper has been on the end of sharp criticism for the contents of the new book, critics argue that he himself was involved in the cover-up he now is dissecting.\n\nIn an interview with Megyn Kelly, Tapper accepted that he missed the mark during Biden’s term, but has offered a glimpse into his horror while moderating the debate.\n\n‘That front row seat was really disturbing,’ he said, later describing Biden’s performance as an act of ‘self-immolation.’\n\nTapper revealed he and fellow moderator Dana Bash had iPads which they used to communicate with their production team throughout the debate.\n\nEarly on, Tapper sent a message to his crew backstage. He didn’t know which staff were working, so he ‘tried to keep it clean.’\n\n‘I wrote “holy smokes,”‘ he told Kelly. ‘I wanted to write “holy f**k.”‘\n\nAround the same time, Bash slid him a piece of paper, with her own message on it.\n\nIt read: ‘He just lost the election’, Tapper added: ‘It was – I don’t think this is hyperbole at all – the worst debate in the history of presidential debates going back to 1960.’\n\nBiden revealed this month he has been diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, sparking a wave of new concerns about his health in the White House.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris branded CNN&#8217;s Anderson Cooper a &#8216;motherf***er&#8217; after a tense interview,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; Surprising Outburst About Anderson Cooper Following Heated Interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/kamala-harris-surprising-outburst-about-anderson-cooper-following-heated-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-shocking-rant-about-Anderson-Cooper.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 01:52:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":324648698,"title":"The raw truth about Biden dying of cancer","text":"There are only a few possible explanations for the announcement we heard days ago about Joe Biden having aggressive Stage 4 prostate cancer. \n\nAll of them are bad.\n\nFirst, let me say how sad, tragic and devastating it is to hear anyone has cancer. No one understands that better than me – my wonderful parents, David and Stella Root, died 28 days apart of cancer in 1992. They died on different floors of the same hospital. You have no idea of the pain of seeing both your parents dying a terrible, painful death at the same time. \n\nSo, to this day, I feel great pain whenever I hear the word “cancer.” I don’t wish this tragic disease upon anyone. \n\nLet’s now examine the raw truth about this whole sordid story.\n\nFirst, when did Joe and Jill Biden, and everyone around them, know Joe had cancer? And why wasn’t it disclosed to the American people? When did his doctors know? When did the media know? Who ordered the cover-up?\n\nVirtually every medical expert agrees prostate cancer moves very slowly. They say this didn’t change from normal prostate cancer to aggressive, spread-to-the-bones, Stage 4 cancer overnight.\n\nWhat this means is Joe Biden has had it for a while – probably a long while. How long? During the entire four years of his presidency? Did he have cancer while campaigning for president in 2020?\n\nWas this an elaborate scam to hide both dementia AND cancer from the voters from Day 1?\n\nIf Biden had prostate cancer for a long period, why wasn’t he treated with aggressive cancer treatments such as surgery, chemo or radiation? If he was, none of this was ever disclosed.\n\nIs it possible Biden was never treated because he was never told?\n\nWas this a cold, cynical, calculating decision to forgo treatment for Biden so he could stay propped up in power? In other words, was Biden told how sick he was? Or did Jill Biden and his closest aides keep Biden in the dark?\n\nWas the objective to keep Biden in office long enough, while he had dementia AND was dying of aggressive cancer, to finish his first term or to win again for a second term, and then after being sworn in, announce the cancer and hand the presidency to Kamala Harris without her ever having to run?\n\nBecause if that’s the case, you could make the argument Jill Biden and Biden’s closest aides committed abuse of power and elder abuse.\n\nNext, we come to the question of, “Why now?” Was the announcement suddenly released to serve as a distraction, to cover up the many scandals of the Biden presidency now spilling out of the closet? \n\nWas this news released to cover up “the autopen scandal” at the exact moment everyone is asking who signed trillions of dollars of bills, executive actions and pardons for a dementia-addled president?\n\nWas it released to cover up the “Kamala paying for celebrity endorsements scandal?”\n\nWas it released to cover up the scandal of former FBI Director James Comey urging the assassination of President Trump?\n\nOr did Democrats release this news now to make us feel sympathy for a dying Biden to cover up the embarrassment of Biden being interviewed by special prosecutor Robert Hur and sounding like an old man with dementia. \n\nBut wait – there’s more!\n\nWhat no one is mentioning is, in addition to all those scandals above …\n\nWas the COVID vaccine responsible for Biden’s aggressive Stage 4 cancer?\n\nBiden’s own closest aides have disclosed he had a severe reaction to the first COVID vaccine in late December 2020. They say he went downhill dramatically from that day forward. He was never the same.\n\nWe all know – and I have hundreds of studies from around the world to prove it – the COVID jab has caused not only neurological issues such as dementia and Alzheimer’s but also the current dramatic increase in cancer around the world, and most importantly, a new category of cancer called “turbo cancer,” meaning cancer that grows and spreads faster than doctors have ever seen before.\n\nSo, maybe Biden was covering up prostate cancer for several years, but it may not have been Stage 4 aggressive cancer until he took a series of COVID jabs and boosters. And then a normal slow growing cancer exploded into “turbo cancer.”\n\nWhich brings up a series of additional questions. How many COVID vaccines did Biden receive? On what dates? When did his cancer become aggressive Stage 4? I’m betting right after his most recent booster. \n\nLastly, I will state my opinion about Joe Biden. It’s not pretty.\n\nThis man was a disaster for America. This man was evil. His socialist policies badly damaged the economy and almost wiped out the great American middle class. \n\nHis policies killed jobs and created the worst inflation of our lifetimes. Then his administration gaslighted us with lies about millions of jobs that never existed. That was Soviet-level propaganda.\n\nBiden opened the borders and welcomed in a foreign invasion. Among the millions who came in were criminals, rapists, murderers, terrorists and gangbangers from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua. Americans were robbed, raped and murdered. Biden didn’t care.\n\nBiden ordered a mandate to force millions of Americans to take an experimental, emergency-use-only vaccine, or lose their jobs. The latest studies report 500,000 to 600,000 Americans died from the vaccine – more than World War I, World War II and Vietnam combined. Millions of others were injured, crippled and disabled. Biden didn’t care. \n\nThen Biden ordered massive censorship and silencing of conservatives and anyone who asked questions about the COVID vaccine deaths.\n\nAnd of course, we all know Biden stole the 2020 election – the worst theft and fraud in world history.\n\nI always feel sad for anyone dying of stage 4 cancer. But … this man should be dying of cancer in a prison hospital.","summary":"'It may not have been Stage 4 ... until he took a series of COVID jabs'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/05/the-raw-truth-about-biden-dying-of-cancer/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/joe-biden-vaccines-covid.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 01:23:48","author":"Wayne Allyn Root","authors":["Wayne Allyn Root"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":324648700,"title":"The astonishing chutzpah of CNN’s Jake Tapper","text":"Dear Jake Tapper, \n\nYou co-wrote a new book in which you brazenly accuse the Biden administration of orchestrating a “cover-up” to conceal the former president’s cognitive decline. But you were complicit. You played a major role.\n\nWhy did Democrats and media co-conspirators, like you, keep quiet, downplay and viciously attack those pointing out former President Joe Biden’s obvious cognitive decline – even though his deterioration was an accepted fact behind Democrat closed doors? \n\nUntil and unless Biden agreed to step aside, Democrats/media who publicly ratted out Biden’s decline would have given Democrat-generated opposition material and attack lines to his Republican challenger – likely the hated Donald Trump. And you/Dems/media arrogantly considered Trump too “fascist/racist/sexist/maniacal” to win – even against a feeble, stumbling, incoherent Biden. \n\nIf Biden insisted on running, as he did until the debate, and lost – an outcome you, Dems and the rest of the Trump-hating media thought extremely unlikely – the Democrat/media “traitors” who sounded the alarm would’ve been blamed, their careers jeopardized if not ruined. \n\nSo, you stayed silent and denounced Republicans, like Lara Trump, who called attention to Biden’s condition on your show. You willingly and eagerly participated in the charade.\n\nRemember your October 2020 exchange with Lara Trump?\n\nTapper: You made this comment earlier in the campaign about Joe Biden. Let’s take a listen to that. \n\nVideo clip of Lara Trump: Every time he comes on stage, and they turn to him, I’m like, Joe, can you get it out? Let’s get the words out, Joe. You kind of feel bad for him.\n\nTapper: How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that? \n\nL. Trump: First and foremost, I had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter. I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. … That’s what I’m referring to. It makes me uncomfortable to watch somebody on stage search for questions. …\n\nTapper: Yes, I think you were mocking his stutter.\n\nL. Trump: Of course I wasn’t, Jake. Wow.\n\nTapper: And I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline, especially …\n\nL. Trump: I’m not diagnosing. I’m saying that we see the Joe Biden of today is not the Joe Biden of five years ago, of 10 years ago.\n\nTapper: I would think that somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar. Plenty of people have diagnosed your father from afar. And I’m sure it offends you – your father-in-law from afar. I’m sure it offends you. You don’t have any standing to say …\n\nL. Trump: I’m not diagnosing him. What I’m saying, Jake …\n\nTapper: You just talked about a cognitive decline. \n\nL. Trump: … is that we can clearly see that Joe Biden is struggling …\n\nNow that Kamala Harris, who was ushered in after the debate, got Trumped, it’s C-Y-A time. “Reporters” like you have the nerve to pin the loss on – and write a book about – a “Biden White House cover-up.” \n\nI’ll say this about a gaslighting “journalist” like you, Jake the Ripper – you’ve got industrial-size cashews. \n\nEven after the debate, the eyes-wide-shut nonsense continued. First lady Dr. Jill Biden praised Biden’s performance. “He answered every question,” she gushed.\n\nThere was one exception: Barack Obama. But Obama used campaign strategist and adviser David Axelrod to voice Obama’s alarm because he lacked the guts to do it himself. \n\nObama never thought much of Biden. During their 2008 campaign, Sen. Obama reportedly said about his running mate, “How many times is Joe Biden going to say something stupid?” Obama talked Biden out of running in 2016, and unsuccessfully tried to talk him out of running in 2020.\n\nIn November 2023, Axelrod tweeted: “Only Joe Biden can make this decision. If he continues to run, he will be the nominee. … What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it’s in HIS best interest or the country’s.” \n\nWhen Biden turned down an opportunity to address the nation during the 2024 Super Bowl, Axelrod called it “a major sign of trouble.”\n\nBottom line: Your hands are as dirty as anyone in the Biden-is-as-sharp-as-a-tack masquerade.

Their plight could give the President Trump-appointed broadcast regulators at the Federal Communications Commission yet another reason to nix the Skydance deal given the administration’s desire to protect local broadcast news.\n\nUnless, of course, CBS backs off, something it has so far been loath to do given the pressures on its bottom line, sources said.\n\nMost Americans don’t appreciate the complex business dealings that go into watching a football game or a sitcom on their local affiliate. Here’s a 30,000-foot explanation. Cable companies pay local broadcasters like Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray Media and Cox Media for their signal so they can run their lines into the homes of millions of Americans.\n\nYes, it’s a shrinking number of viewers and a demo that skews older but it’s still substantial. There’s money to be made reaching this audience in terms of fees and advertising. That’s why local broadcasters become “affiliates” of major news networks and pay for their programming.\n\nThe entire arrangement is under stress, however. Cord cutting has pulled viewers away from network programming and cable fees are under pressure because there are fewer viewers. Ad rates are falling. Networks are moving programming to their streaming services, most of which aren’t profitable.\n\nTake it or leave it\n\nThe affiliates say they are caught in the crossfire, particularly when it comes to CBS as the network is seeking to squeeze every last dime out of a dying business model. CBS, they say, is negotiating dozens of contracts and — according to people repping some of the affiliates in the scuffle — demanding much higher fees on a take-it-or-leave it basis.\n\nThe fees are said to be so draconian that the affiliate business model is in existential danger at some point and maybe soon, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nA Paramount spokesman had no comment but people at the company directed me to a recent earnings call where its co-CEO, George Cheeks, addressed the affiliate issue and the cost pressures on the company.\n\n“We’re investing heavily in must-have live sports and the most watched prime-time entertainment schedule. Now if this dynamic were to change, it would be difficult for us to continue to foot that bill. And in that case, the affiliates and local viewers, they would be harmed.”\n\nHere’s where things could get interesting, and force CBS to back down. Just as CBS is moving forward with these price hikes, Shari Redstone, the media heiress who controls Paramount and its CBS subsidiary wants to sell the -company to independent studio Skydance.\n\nThe sale is significant for her. She and her family will walk away with $2 billion if the deal is approved by the FCC. It’s a modicum of the wealth left to her by her late father, Sumner Redstone, who built Paramount into a colossus before its value was decimated with the rest of traditional broadcast. But it’s more than enough to live on.\n\nFairness issues\n\nThat’s only if the Trump FCC approves the deal, which it’s delaying as it investigates fairness issues at CBS News. As I have written, Redstone is so desperate to get the deal approved that she is willing to settle a separate $20 billion lawsuit with Trump himself, who sued CBS’s “60 Minutes” for the same reason the FCC is holding up the deal. Both involve claims that “60 Minutes” doctored an interview with Trump’s 2024 opponent Kamala Harris to make the Democrat sound more presidential during the height of the campaign.\n\nYeah, it’s a real mess. And it could get messier because the Trumpers actually like local broadcasters as opposed to the “fake news” big guys. They believe local news is largely devoid of left-wing agitprop found at the networks, and it’s still an important source of information for small-town America.\n\nThat’s why they want the affiliate model to survive since Middle America is ground zero of the MAGA base, and much of it watches stuff the old-fashioned way, on television supplied by the affiliates.\n\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr, Trump’s point man on this, has his hands full regulating a changing media landscape and ensuring that broadcasters play by the rules, which under the law demands news-fairness guidelines for the privilege of using public airwaves as opposed to cable.\n\nHe has also made clear his support for local broadcasters, or in his words: “We don’t want local broadcasters to ultimately go the way of newspapers, and when you look at the current dynamic, I’m not sure it’s entirely healthy . . . We want local broadcasters to feel empowered to actually serve the interests of their local communities and not simply become a pass-through for nationwide content coming principally from Hollywood and New York.”\n\nLooks like Shari has another reason to worry about the Skydance deal.","summary":"The obstacles impeding Paramount’s $8 billion sale to Skydance keep piling up, and much of it involves CBS, the so-called Tiffany Network, and whether it has shed its rep for disseminating honest news.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/business/ugly-behind-the-scenes-battle-between-cbs-and-its-affiliates-adds-another-wrinkle-in-paramount-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/25.Gasparino.WEB_.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 23:43:29","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":324558978,"title":"Trump’s Address to West Point Graduates Blends Praise, Politics, and Complaints","text":"WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) President Donald Trump used the first service academy commencement address of his second term Saturday to laud graduating West Point cadets for their accomplishments and career choice while also veering sharply into a campaign-style recitation of political boasts and long-held grievances.\n\n“In a few moments, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Trump said at the ceremony at Michie Stadium. “And you will become officers of the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military. And we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.”\n\nWearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, the Republican president told the 1,002 members of the class of 2025 at the U.S. Military Academy that the United States is the “hottest country in the world” and underscored an “America First” ethos for the military.\n\n“We’re getting rid of distractions and we’re focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America’s adversaries, killing America’s enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before,” Trump said. He later said that “the job of the U.S. armed forces is not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures,” a reference to drag shows on military bases that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration halted after Republican criticism.\n\nTrump said the cadets were graduating at a “defining moment” in Army history as he accused political leaders in the past of sending soldiers into “nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us.” He said he was clearing the military of transgender ideas, “critical race theory” and types of training he called divisive and political. \n\nPast administrations, he said, “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars.”\n\nAt times, his remarks were indistinguishable from those heard in a political speech, from his assessment of the country when he left office in January 2021 to his review of last November’s victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, arguing that voters gave him a “great mandate” and “it gives us the right to do what we want to do.”\n\nFrequently turning the focus on himself, he reprised some of his campaign rally one-liners, including the claim that he has faced more investigations than mobster Al Capone.\n\nAt one point the crowd listened as Trump, known for his off-message digressions, referred to “trophy wives” and yachts during an anecdote about the late real estate developer William Levitt, a billionaire friend who Trump said lost momentum.\n\nBut the president also took time to acknowledge the achievements of individual graduates.\n\nHe summoned Chris Verdugo to the stage and noted that he completed an 18.5-mile march on a freezing night in January in just two hours and 30 minutes.

Biden kept asking for more cough drops.' \n\nPresident Biden eventually stood down his reelection campaign following the debate performance after intense backlash. \n\nTapper has been on the end of sharp criticism for the contents of the new book, critics argue that he himself was involved in the cover-up he now is dissecting.\n\nIn an interview with Megyn Kelly, Tapper accepted that he missed the mark during Biden's term, but has offered a glimpse into his horror while moderating the debate.\n\n'That front row seat was really disturbing,' he said, later describing Biden's performance as an act of 'self-immolation.'\n\nTapper revealed he and fellow moderator Dana Bash had iPads which they used to communicate with their production team throughout the debate.\n\nEarly on, Tapper sent a message to his crew backstage. He didn't know which staff were working, so he 'tried to keep it clean.'\n\n'I wrote \"holy smokes,\"' he told Kelly. 'I wanted to write \"holy f**k.\"'\n\nAround the same time, Bash slid him a piece of paper, with her own message on it.\n\nIt read: 'He just lost the election', Tapper added: 'It was - I don't think this is hyperbole at all - the worst debate in the history of presidential debates going back to 1960.'\n\nBiden revealed this month he has been diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, sparking a wave of new concerns about his health in the White House.","summary":"Harris had been grilled by Cooper over former President Joe Biden 's debate performance against Donald Trump last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14746579/Kamala-Harris-Anderson-Cooper-rant-interview.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/24/22/98724425-0-image-m-13_1748123628748.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/28/6350662337496500963/1024x576_MP4_6350662337496500963.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 22:46:05","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":324535464,"title":"Liberal NYU Professor Claims Biden’s Narcissism Damaged the Country but Positively","text":"Unintended consequences are unintended. The Biden family arguably inflicted significant damage on the Democratic Party by keeping the aged Joe Biden in office beyond his prime; the Democratic Party further harmed itself by 1) appointing Kamala “Queen of Word Salads” Harris as the successor without consulting a single primary voter about their opinion. Despite these missteps, this may ultimately benefit the country.\n\nNew York University professor and leftist podcaster Scott Galloway, in a recent episode of his podcast “Pivot,” recognized the initial issue accurately. The follow-up analysis? Not as much.\n\nHarsh language follows:\n\nIn a recent episode of his “Pivot” podcast co-hosted with journalist Kara Swisher, Galloway contended that former President Biden’s mishandling of the 2024 election for the Democratic Party will define his “legacy.”\nSpeaking of how Biden ensured former Vice President Kamala Harris would be his replacement on the campaign trail last year, he said, “The reality is she was not a strong candidate and President Biden and his family’s narcissism have severely (expletive deleted) this country. Severely. And that is his legacy.”\n\nSo far he’s right. And he even had a notion as to how they should have proceeded after old Joe’s shockingly bad debate performance.\n\nGalloway added that Harris was “not a great candidate,” though he praised her efforts in trying to replace her boss. “I think she did a good job given the hand she was dealt with, but this is a candidate who didn’t make it to Iowa four years earlier, which says to me America didn’t think of her as a great candidate.”\n\nAnd that’s where he goes wrong. \n\nKamala Harris didn’t do a good job. She did a perfectly awful job. She picked the worst possible running mate in Tim “Great Walz of China.” She is an execrable public speaker. In their one debate, Donald Trump absolutely defenestrated her. Her campaign staff was the worst; recent reports indicate they didn’t even tell her how bad their internal polling numbers really were.

She made the remarks Friday night while discussing Original Sin, a new book about Biden’s decline by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson. In the exposé, Tapper and Thompson claim that only a small group of aides had regular access to Biden and the First Lady.\n\n“Six or seven? That was the number that had the close-up access? And I say this because in some ways, I think it’s exonerating of much of the Democratic Party,” McEnany said Friday night on Fox News’s Jesse Watters Primetime.\n\nMcEnany said it’s common for only an exclusive group of people to have access to the president.\n\n“I worked at the RNC, didn't have much access to President Trump,” she said. “Worked on the campaign. Didn't have much access to President Trump at the time. It really was a small cadre in the West Wing.”\n\nThe book, which hit the shelves this week just days after Biden revealed his cancer diagnosis, details the then-president’s failed reelection bid and the alleged cover-up of his decline, physically and mentally. The book made several shocking claims, including that Biden’s aides wanted to put him in a wheelchair.\n\n“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” Tapper and Thompson wrote.\n\nTapper and Thompson also detailed an alleged interaction between Biden and George Clooney, in which the president failed to recognize the A-list actor.\n\n“It was like watching someone who was not alive,” an unnamed “Hollywood VIP” who witnessed the interaction told the authors. “It was startling. And we all looked at each other. It was so awful.”\n\nThe book also covers Biden’s decision to drop out, and the subsequent reaction from Democrats. David Plouffe, who worked on Kamala Harris's campaign, told Tapper and Thompson that Biden “totally f***ed us” by not stepping down sooner.\n\nPlouffe characterized the campaign as “a f***ing nightmare,” which he said was “all Biden.”\n\nIn response to the book’s release, Biden spokesperson Chris Meagher previously said his team is “still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.”\n\n“In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president,” he said.","summary":"Kayleigh McEnany served as Donald Trump’s press secretary during the final months of his first term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-kayleigh-mcenany-biden-decline-book-b2757305.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/09/24/09/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 19:59:12","author":"Joe Miles,Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Joe Miles","Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.471},{"id":324523750,"title":"Trump’s Address to West Point Graduates Combines Commendation, Politics, and Complaints","text":"President Donald Trump delivered a speech at West Point on Saturday, marking the first service academy commencement address of his second term.

Jasmine Crockett of Texas as \"the type of leader\" their struggling political party needs during a Friday appearance on The Breakfast Club radio show.The endorsement comes as Hogg faces potential removal from his leadership position following a credentials committee vote this month that challenged his February election due to procedural errors.Newsweek reached out to Hogg and Crockett via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersThis endorsement highlights the ongoing identity crisis within the Democratic Party following comprehensive losses in the 2024 election cycle. Democrats lost the White House, Senate, and House, creating uncertainty about the party's future direction and leadership. The public backing of Crockett, known for controversial statements and confrontational tactics, signals a potential shift toward more combative political messaging.Recent polling shows former Vice President Kamala Harris currently leading potential 2028 presidential candidates, followed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowHogg praised the Dallas congresswoman's confrontational political style, describing her as someone who \"fights and calls out the bulls***\" and possesses the authenticity Democrats seek in leadership.Crockett, 44, has established herself as one of President Donald Trump's most vocal critics since his 2024 election victory. She has referred to the president as a \"dictator\" and \"enemy to the United States,\" calling him \"the person that allegedly got elected.\" In March, she suggested uncertainty about whether the U.S. \"will have elections\" in 2028.During interview, Hogg elaborated on why he views Crockett as ideal Democratic leadership material. \"I think Jasmine is, frankly, the type of leader that we're really looking to support in some senses, right?\" he told host Charlamagne Tha God. \"Somebody who is out there that frankly doesn't give a damn what the other side — at least the elected Republicans in Congress — say.\"Hogg described Crockett as having the \"authenticity\" Democrats seek in a standard-bearer, noting that \"people want to see somebody who fights and calls out the bulls*** ultimately.\"The congresswoman has made several controversial statements beyond her Trump criticism. She described a deported alleged MS-13 gang member as \"a lot less criminal\" than Trump and argued in a December Vanity Fair interview that Hispanic Trump voters had a \"slave mentality.\" In March, she mocked Texas Governor Greg Abbott's wheelchair use, dubbing him \"Governor Hot Wheels,\" prompting Abbott to suggest she has \"nothing to sell but hate.\"Crockett is also positioning herself for greater party leadership roles. Earlier this month, she announced her intention to compete for the top Democratic position on the House Oversight Committee following Rep. Gerry Connolly's decision to step down due to his cancer battle. As the committee's current vice ranking member, Crockett told Politico she is \"ready to shine a light on the very dark things taking place in our country under this administration.\"The lawmaker faces potential competition from Ocasio-Cortez, who previously lost the ranking member position to Connolly in December by a 131-84 vote, reportedly with backing from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The oversight committee leadership race could serve as another test of progressive influence within the Democratic caucus.Hogg, 25, became a national figure following the 2018 Parkland school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where he was a senior. Since his DNC election, he has drawn criticism for plans to spend $20 million challenging long-serving Democratic House members in primaries, creating friction with party leadership.What People Are SayingDavid Hogg on The Breakfast Club: \"I love her. She is amazing. I think that people want to see somebody who fights and calls out the bulls*** ultimately. I think that's what Jasmine does.\"President Donald Trump on Meet the Press earlier this month: \"I can't name one Democrat, I mean, I look at the Democrats. They're in total disarray. They have a new person named Crockett. I watched her speak the other day. She's definitely a low IQ person. And they said she's the future of the party.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris praised Crockett and other politicians during a speech April 30 posted by PBS News Hour: \"And I will tell you the courage of all these Americans inspires me. And I have been inspired. By movements like the one in Wisconsin that put Susan Crawford on the Supreme Court. By the State of the People Power Tour that is aiming to ignite a grassroots movement to lift up voices and advance freedom and justices. And ty leaders across the spectrum including Congressional Leaders like Corey Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Cross, AOC, and Bernie Sanders. All who in different ways have been speaking with moral clarity about this moment.\"What Happens NextThe full DNC will vote in June on whether to remove Hogg from his vice chair position and conduct a new election.Meanwhile, Crockett's rising profile within progressive circles, combined with Hogg's endorsement, positions her as a potential voice in shaping the party's approach to Republican opposition.","summary":"The embattled DNC vice chair endorsed Rep.

Severely. And that is his legacy.”\n\nGalloway began his point by stating that the party should have had a primary following Biden’s withdrawal from the race so that the best possible candidate could have beaten then-GOP candidate Donald Trump.\n\n“I was Saturday afternoon quarterbacking,” he said. “I said have a mini ‘Shark Tank ’- like primary with the best eight candidates – go from two debates with eight, then to four, then to two. It would have dominated the media cycle.”\n\nGalloway added that Harris was “not a great candidate,” though he praised her efforts in trying to replace her boss. “I think she did a good job given the hand she was dealt with, but this is a candidate who didn’t make it to Iowa four years earlier, which says to me America didn’t think of her as a great candidate.”\n\nIn 2024, Galloway recorded a video for Democrats voting from abroad. In January 2025, he posted an article on Medium with the title “How to Survive the Next Four Years.” \n\nThe former president has been criticized by his own party in the months following the election for not dropping out of the race soon enough and leaving room for a Democratic primary. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., argued days after the election that “had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race.” She added, “The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, there would be an open primary.” \n\nFormer Harris surrogate and DNC fundraiser, Lindy Li, also grilled Biden for endorsing Harris immediately after dropping out, saying the move headed off a primary.\n\n“I actually think President Biden, you know, the whole endorsing her thirty minutes after he dropped out, I think that was a big f-you to the party,” she said several days after Trump’s victory. \n\nOther Democratic figures have said Biden compounded this problem by demanding that Harris stay in lockstep with his presidential agenda. According to a recent book written by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, the former president “would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: Let there be no daylight between us.”\n\nDuring the podcast, Galloway added that Biden’s insistence on Harris running, and her subsequent loss, will be how he’s remembered.\n\n“I will get s— for this because people are correctly feeling empathy for him, but his legacy, in my view, has been ruined by this,” he said. \n\nReps for Biden did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","summary":"NYU professor and liberal podcast host Scott Galloway criticized the Biden family this week, saying its \"narcissism\" has hurt the country.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/media/biden-familys-narcissism-severely-f-the-country-says-liberal-nyu-professor-scott-galloway/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/2024-former-us-president-joe-105248767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/22oNtWhC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 18:01:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":324500198,"title":"Brett Favre suggests Netflix documentary targets him for Trump support","text":"Brett Favre appears to believe Netflix is out to get him due to his support of President Donald Trump.

She is pictured alongside Emhoff on the iconic aircraft in August 2024\n\nHarris was dressed in black on both sightings but traded her heels for a $1350 pair of white Celine sneakers at the domestic terminal. \n\nWhen former first couple Barack and Michelle Obama patronised the heritage-listed Balmoral venue in March, 2023 the menu items included Coral Trout, WA Marron, Handmade Fettucine and Sydney Rock Oysters.\n\nLed by executive chef Aaron Ward, the beachside restaurant features a 350-strong wine list with seasonal mains in 2025 ranging from a $49 roasted eggplant to a $65 Rangers Valley wagyu. \n\nHarris' visit was a more low-key stop-in than that of the Obama's ahead of which a crowd of about 200 revellers watched on as the couple made for the venue's private 'Good Room' for lunch. \n\nIt was a rare public sighting of Harris who has kept a relatively low profile since she and her would be VP Tim Walz were resoundingly wiped out by returning Republican president Donald Trump in November. \n\nTrump secured wins in all seven swing states, improving on his 2016 victory over former Democrat nominee Hilary Clinton making him the second president in US history to serve non-consecutive terms following Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. \n\nThough Harris has been tight-lipped on her plans for the future, rumour has abounded she may run as governor of California in a bid to oust the term-limited Gavin Newsom. \n\nBranded as Harris' first speaking engagement in Australia, promotional material for the Gold Coast event described her as a 'trailblazer through her entire career, committed in her vision for ensuring all Americans can climb the ladder of economic opportunity.'\n\nHarris pictured with her dining party on Friday night before flying to the Gold Coast\n\nHarris is pictured arriving at Sydney's domestic airport on Saturday ahead of a scheduled speaking engagement at a real estate conference on the Gold Coast\n\nExact moment of Kamala Harris' blistering split with Joe Biden revealed in bombshell new book\n\nMany of Kamala Harris´ supporters and detractors alike think she'd have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.\n\nNo other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: 'I´ll see you out there. I´m not going anywhere.'\n\nTo make another run for president, Harris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party´s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last year. \n\nShe's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump´s agenda in Washington.\n\nDoug EmhoffCaliforniaKamala Harris\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWhy ex-US Vice President Kamala Harris was dining at Sydney restaurant seven months on from her defeat at the hands of Donald Trump\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The former Democrat presidential nominee was pictured dining alongside her husband Doug Emhoff in a rare public appearance since her historic defeat in November.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14745737/Former-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris-dining-Sydney-restaurant-Donald-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/24/16/98715289-0-image-m-94_1748102272862.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/24/2806239797124877634/1024x576_MP4_2806239797124877634.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 15:58:08","author":"Editor,Nick Wilson","authors":["Editor","Nick Wilson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.281},{"id":324480236,"title":"Jon Stewart, Obama speechwriter rip Harris, others over Biden’s mental acuity: ‘Lied to the American people’","text":"The hosts of “Pod Save America” and Jon Stewart are questioning former President Joe Biden’s mental acuity following the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, “Original Sin.”\n\n“So everybody goes on television and goes, ‘You don’t understand,” Jon Stewart said during a Thursday episode of his podcast, “The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart,” discussing how people would try to frame concerns about Biden’s health. “I sit with this guy. He’s the smartest one in the room. I can’t keep up with him. I’m exhausted. I went to a meeting, and he was using words I didn’t even know were words! They were fantastic! I had to look them up. He’s the smartest man in the world.'” \n\nOn Tuesday, “Original Sin,” which looks in part at the efforts made by top Biden aides and allies to hide the truth about Biden’s mental and physical health, providing a depiction of a president who was routinely confused and disorientated during his term, was released.\n\nDuring his podcast Thursday, Stewart talked about how he thinks those in Biden’s circle tried to control what the public saw. \n\n“You know, Kamala Harris comes out, ‘I sit with this man. You don’t understand,’” Stewart said. “You don’t see it.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, has anyone filmed that? Because you should show that.’ Because it was a very simple case to puncture. People are saying, ‘I’m a little concerned about his stamina and cognitive ability. Here’s how we can dispel that.’ Just put him out there and let him show us how f—ing smart – and they wouldn’t do it. Because they knew they couldn’t.”\n\nJon Favreau, former President Barack Obama’s head speechwriter from 2005-2013, said that the people closest to Biden were not honest about his decline. \n\n“Throughout Biden’s term, you had it with the age issue, you also had it with inflation, right,” Favreau said.\n\n“In the Biden administration, a lot of elected Democrats were like, ‘Oh, look at all the statistics and the numbers,’” he added. “And then poll after poll and focus group after focus group would have people be like, ‘No, prices are high and it’s really bothering me.’ And we’d just be like, ‘That’s just the media.’ Or ‘That’s just Republicans.’ And I think the same thing happened around Joe Biden’s age. The closer you got to Joe Biden, the closer the adviser or the family member, the more I think they were not just lying to the American people, but lying to themselves.”\n\nFavreau also said that he thinks Democrats struggle with accepting and telling the truth. \n\n “I think a big problem with the Democratic Party over the last several years, decade maybe, maybe even back to the Iraq war, we have a hard time hearing hard truths and admitting hard truths to ourselves,” Favreau said. “And then we have a hard time telling hard truths to the voters.”\n\nFavreau is featured in “Original Sin” in an anecdote where he and his “Pod Save America” co-hosts Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett met with Biden at the White House on April 26, 2024. The book described them as “deeply disturbed” after their discussions with Biden that night, with the authors describing the president as rambling and “incoherent.”\n\nHowever, in a Feb. 13, 2024 episode of “Pod Save America,” Favreau seemed to downplay concerns about Biden’s health.\n\n“The number one concern that people have had about Joe Biden is his age. Those concerns have predated Robert Hur, they have predated anything Trump has said … it is not just about people who see like out of context clips or that the Republicans put out, or crazy TikToks or whatever else,” he said.\n\nThis discussion with his “Pod Save America” hosts came days after Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report was released on Feb 5, 2024, looking at the former president’s handling of classified documents. \n\n “If you watch Joe Biden speak, often times he sounds frail, and he sounds more frail than he used to even in 2019 and 2020,” Favreau said. “Now that may, and I think it doesn’t have anything to do with how sharp he is mentally, but the voice sounds frail and he shuffles more because of the arthritis in his back so for most people in the country who are just watching him be president what do they see when they turn on the television? They see him shuffle and they hear him and he is swallowing a lot more of his words now – obviously he’s had a stutter but it doesn’t sound like the stutter did even in 2020 – he’s just soft-spoken and quiet.” \n\nCo-host Tommy Vietor, who worked for Obama for almost a decade, appeared to agree with Favreau’s dismissiveness. \n\n “All the commentary about the age and Biden’s memory which seemed unfair or ad hominem at worst, and then second there is a debate about Biden’s age and fitness for office that was already happening. This just kicked it up and focused the media’s attention on it in a very damaging way via this DOJ report,” Vietor said during the February 2024 episode. \n\nOn Sunday, Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis was announced, with his spokesperson telling Fox News days later that the last time he received a blood test that screens for prostate cancer was in 2014.","summary":"The hosts of \"Pod Save America\" and Jon Stewart are questioning former President Joe Biden’s mental acuity following the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, \"Original Sin.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/24/us-news/jon-stewart-podcast-hosts-question-bidens-health-following-original-sin/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105232535.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/22oNtWhC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-24 15:46:58","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":324500200,"title":"Biden family's narcissism 'severely f-----' the country, says liberal NYU professor","text":"NYU professor and liberal podcast host Scott Galloway criticized the Biden family this week, saying its \"narcissism\" has hurt the country.

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nWith House Republicans narrowly passing President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which is designed to blow up the national debt, cut taxes for the rich, and partially pay for that by gutting programs for the poor and working class—you’d think MAGA conservatives would be cheering. But many of them aren’t.\n\nLet’s back up.\n\nTrump defied historic voting patterns in 2024 by winning voters making under $50,000 a year, 50% to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ 48%. He tied her among voters making over $50,000, at 49%. And when the threshold was raised to $100,000, the income divide got starker: Trump won the under-$100K crowd, 51% to 47%, while Harris won the over-$100K vote, 51% to 47%.\n\nThat flipped the old partisan narrative. In general, Republicans were the party of the working class, and Democrats the party of those with more money.\n\nWhile culture-war hysteria around transgender people and immigrants drove much of Trump’s support, his promise to lower prices “on Day 1” clearly resonated with economically desperate voters. Exit polls back this up. He won 76% of those who had faced “severe hardship” from inflation in the previous year, and 52% of those who’d faced “moderate hardship.” Meanwhile, Harris dominated among those who said they’d faced “no hardship,” winning 78% of them.\n\nAs former Daily Kos reporter Kerry Eleveld once said in our old podcast, “Democrats are the party of voters who don’t have to look at prices when grocery shopping.” \n\nThat’s why we see so many variations of “this isn’t what we voted for” in all these “Leopards Ate Faces” stories. Yes, we could scream, “IT WAS ALL THERE IN PROJECT 2025!” But let’s be honest: Most voters aren’t policy wonks. For those doing price math in the grocery aisle, politics isn’t a priority. Trump’s promise may have been absurd, but it was simple and seductive.\n\nBut falling for those lies has a cost. On the economic front, Trump and the Republican Party are governing like they always have—for the ultrawealthy, connected, and powerful, at the direct expense of their own voters. As I’ve written repeatedly, it’s like Trump is trying to hurt his base.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, House Republicans voted to gut Medicaid, which disproportionately helps rural Americans. Their tax cuts for billionaires effectively raise taxes on low-income voters—i.e., their core voters in last year’s election. MarketWatch, reporting on a University of Pennsylvania analysis of a close-to-final draft of the GOP tax bill, noted: \n\n The top 0.1% of households would rake in over $390,000 in after-tax income.\n\n The top 1% would gain $44,190.\n\n Households making $51,000 to $92,999 a year would get an additional $815.\n\n The lowest-income households, though, will see their after-tax income shrink by $940.\n\nYes, that voter making under $50K, they get to deal with Trump’s price-raising tariffs and a tax hike.\n\nOn Reddit’s r/conservative subreddit, the reactions to the House passing the bill were surprisingly muted.\n\nSome echoed traditional deficit concerns, such as the commenter who noted, “Conservatives are supposed to want less government spending and less debt. This bill will add trillions of dollars of debt over the next 10 years. We're not even kind of moving in the right direction.” \n\nBut a surprising number took umbrage at the gutting of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\n\nOne top commenter the subreddit—i.e., not a troll—wrote, “I'm all for cutting waste fraud and abuse on Medicaid and SNAP, but … I think if the medicaid/SNAP changes go through as is, GOP will get mauled in the mid-terms.”\n\nAnother top commenter noted, “[I]t's not that I like high taxes, it's that I think high taxes on the lower, middle, and upper-middle-class are much more damaging than high taxes on the ultra-rich. It's both about keeping taxes low on most people, and about preventing the concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny number of people. It's also frustrating because Trump has repeatedly spoken out in favor of such tax hikes on the richest taxpayers as a way of making budgets and tax breaks work.” \n\nThis commenter also called the Medicaid provisions “cruel,” and on SNAP, they said, “[I]t's going to deny benefits to some people we would probably prefer have them. for example the people who are going to be hit hardest are the people who live in areas where jobs are scarce, who have difficult lives with a lot of barriers to getting anything done, and who have other life responsibilities like caring for family members or doing something else important in their community that they don't get paid for.”\n\nIf only there was a party that worked to protect such people …\n\nAll over social media, Trump voters are realizing they’re the ones being labeled as “fraud and waste.” Like this gem on Threads:\n\nAgain, we can point to Project 2025—the Heritage Foundation’s agenda for a second Trump administration—and note how it promised to gut SNAP and Medicaid. Yes, we warned them. But pointing fingers now isn’t useful.\n\nWhat is useful? Turning this betrayal into motivation.\n\nNo, we won’t win over all Trump voters. Many are too far gone. It’s a cult.\n\nBut we don’t need all of them. We don’t even need most. We just need a small shift. \n\nIn Pennsylvania, Trump won last year by 120,266 votes. In Michigan, it was 80,103. And in Wisconsin, 29,397. Altogether, that makes for just 229,766 votes in an election where 155,512,532 were cast—or just 0.15% of all ballots. That’s how small of a shift we’re talking about, though obviously, the bigger the better.\n\nI can’t recall ever seeing a party so eagerly swing a baseball bat at its own voters—many of them new to the Republican coalition.\n\nThe pain is real. And yes, most of us are impacted in some way. But if we can turn that pain into political clarity for even a slice of those voters, we can begin to reverse the damage—and take back our future.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes. Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\n\n\n\nWith House Republicans narrowly passing President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which is designed to blow up the national debt, cut taxes for the rich, and partially pay for that by gutting programs for the poor and working class—you’d think MAGA conservatives would be cheering.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already said that she is placing her bets on Rahm. Rahm is also not shying away from these insinuations and already said that he's preparing. “I am in training — I don’t know if I’ll make the Olympics,” he said a few weeks ago. After Joe Biden's prostate cancer detection, The Free Press caught up with Rahm and asked how he was doing. \"I don’t have prostate cancer,\" he said. On his presidential bid, he said: “Before I make a decision, I want to know that I have an answer to what I think ails our country, ails our politics, and ails the party—and they may all be the same answer.\" Emmanuel's elder brother Zeke is an oncologist and was on air discussing Biden's cancer detection. “Oh yeah. He did not develop (prostate cancer) in the last 100 days, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that,\" he said on Morning Joe. Who is Rahm Emanuel? Rahm Emanuel is an American politician and diplomat born November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. A member of the Democratic Party, he has held several high-profile positions: US Ambassador to Japan (2021–2025), appointed by President Joe Biden, where he worked on strengthening US-Japan relations. From 2011 to 2019, he remained the first Jewish mayor of Chicago. Before that, he was the White House Chief of Staff (2009–2010) under President Barack Obama, helping pass the Affordable Care Act and the 2009 stimulus package. He was the representative for Illinois’s 5th District (2003–2009), serving as Democratic Caucus Chair and leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to a 2006 House majority. Between 1993 and 1998, he remained the senior adviser to Bill Clinton. Emanuel was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household, with his father, a pediatrician, immigrating from Israel and his mother active in the civil rights movement. He is married to Amy Rule, with three children.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-rahm-emanuel-top-dem-likely-to-run-for-white-house-in-2028-i-dont-have-prostate-cancer/articleshow/121382029.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-121382046/121382046.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 14:28:10","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":324462396,"title":"Top finance guru sends blistering reality check to Trump administration","text":"Financial guru Dave Ramsey has warned that federal lawmakers need to 'do their job' to help save Americans' money with their economic policies. \n\nMulti-millionaire Ramsey told Fox Business while at the EntreLeadership Summit in Denver, Colorado: 'Do your job and get something passed that lets us keep our money. It’s pretty simple.\n\n'It's all this political infighting, this absolute bulls**t, at the end of the day. Except for these massive things like, again, just governing. This idea that we love small business in Washington is an absolute load of horse manure.' \n\nRamsey didn't hold back on his feelings about the recent uncertain shift in the economy, especially when it comes to tariffs. \n\nThe guru, who is estimated to be worth around $200million, believes that once tariffs are 'smoothed out' and Congress does its job and passes a bill that will protect American's pockets, residents can expect a calmer environment. \n\n'What we need is a predictable environment,' he told Fox Business. \n\n'If I know this is what my cost is, then I know that this is [what] my price is. Or I know I can't make it in that country anymore, I need to make it a different country. And I've got to resource, you know, reset my resources.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear he wishes for more things to be made in America, including movies, which he recently placed a 100 percent tariff on for any production produced outside of the US. \n\nThe Republican has also recently announced a 'big, beautiful bill' that passed in the House. \n\nThe package also provides for $350billion to go to MAGA projects including to Trump's new 'Golden Dome' missile defense system and his mass deportation policies.\n\nTo fund the massive loss in federal revenue, Congress has decided to make deep cuts to social programs and add work requirements to Medicaid.\n\nIt is also estimated to add about $3trillion to the national deficit - which terrified some of the far-right conservative voting block. \n\nThe bill is expected to be heavily edited in the Senate, including cutting taxes on tips and overtime and auto loans, as well as, extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increasing the Child Tax Credit.\n\nRamsey isn't too sure small businesses are being protected under this new economy. \n\n'These guys in here will tell you, they spent half their lives and a lot of money just trying to keep from getting the snot beat out of them by Washington,' Ramsey told Fox Business. \n\n'It's the unpredictability that kills business in general, but it's devastating to small business,' the entrepreneur, who voted for Trump, continued. 'All I need is a predictable environment, and then I'll pivot and I'll exist.' \n\nSmall business owners' fear and hesitancy is a far cry from how they felt in December, right before Trump was gearing up for his inauguration. \n\nFollowing Donald Trump's November victory, small business owners were feeling more hopeful than they have in years, a poll showed.\n\nJob Creators Network Foundation (JCNF) regularly surveys 400 small business owners to glean how they feel about economic and policy issues in the news.\n\nThe results reveal that small business owners' feelings about the US economy had hit its highest level since July 2021.\n\nIt found that more than six in 10 small business owners were optimistic that the Trump administration would be positive for Main Street.\n\nThe survey also revealed that these owners voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a whopping margin.\n\nThey backed Trump 51 percent to Harris' 34 percent, a giant 17-point margin, the survey found.","summary":"Multi-millionaire Dave Ramsey sent a blistering reality check to federal lawmakers, whose economic policies have been threatening everyday Americans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14745731/dave-ramsey-finance-guru-warning-dc-lawmakers.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/24/14/98714915-0-image-m-86_1748093430527.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 13:59:25","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.11},{"id":324456434,"title":"'Everybody should be afraid': Former DOJ attorney details Trump’s 'terrifying shift'","text":"In a press release on January 31, 2025 — roughly a week and a half into Donald Trump's second presidency — attorney Stacey Young explained why she had left the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). \n\nYoung, who worked in the DOJ Civil Division and later the DOJ Civil Rights Division, declared, \"Our democracy and the rule of law depend on a robust, apolitical civil service, above all at the Department of Justice.

So we should be scared not only because DOJ is investigating and charging, prosecuting individuals who seem to be targets just for retribution, but it's also attacking individuals who the DOJ is not finding enough evidence to actually pursue.

As Jake Tapper and co-author Alex Thompson promote \"Original Sin,\" an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources, media critics have noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before last year's debate against President Donald Trump. Here are four examples at CNN. NEW BOOK REVEALS BIDEN'S INNER CIRCLE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE YEARS BEFORE BOTCHED DEBATE PERFORMANCE CNN White House correspondent pushes White House ‘cheap fakes’ narrative Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported. The term \"cheap fakes\" was popularized, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted from the podium that fact-checkers and mainstream outlets also embraced the term. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House’s narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely \"looked out at the crowd for a few seconds\" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that \"Republicans and right-leaning media outlets\" \"used this moment to say that President Biden froze.\" Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an \"obviously selected video.\" \"These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them,\" Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. Tapper feels differently about them. JAKE TAPPER DECLARES BIDEN WHITE HOUSE LIED ABOUT 'CHEAP FAKES' AFTER CNN PEDDLED NARRATIVE IN 2024 \"The Biden White House falsely- when people showed that clip and asked what was going on- said it was a ‘cheap fake.’ They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.’ It was not fake. It was actual video,\" Tapper said last week. CNN cites expert expressing concern about ‘ageism’ In a story in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report where Biden was memorably described as an elderly man with a poor memory, CNN's website published an article expressing concerns about both Biden and Trump and what type of cognitive ability was normal for a person in their 80s. The article cited a professor who said Biden's issues with word recall were not necessarily indicative of someone having memory issues. Biden at times during the interview with Hur had difficulty remembering when he was vice president and the year of his son Beau's death in 2015. The article concluded with the professor saying that ageism was codified in how people talk to one another, suggesting that the skepticism about Biden was a form of prejudice against the elderly. \"Ageism is not just what people do to each other. Ageism is also a mindset that you carry within yourself,\" the professor said. \"It actually impacts your health negatively.\" JAKE TAPPER'S PAST COVERAGE OF BIDEN'S COGNITIVE DECLINE UNDER SCRUTINY AHEAD OF HIS NEW BOOK Media reporter shreds ‘bogus’ Biden narrative Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter before leaving CNN last year. \"For years, and particularly over the last few months, MAGA Media has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government,\" Darcy wrote in a newsletter last June, before the then-president's disastrous debate. Darcy declared the debate would give Biden an easy chance to \"puncture the narrative\" that he lacked fitness for office, suggesting Republicans had stupidly lowered the bar so much that Biden would easily clear it and come out of the debate stronger. \"That's a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time,\" he wrote. Darcy also blasted the Wall Street Journal report last June about Biden's behind-the-scenes decline in his newsletter, saying it \"owes its readers — and the public — better.\" Asked for comment by Fox News Digital about his past coverage, Darcy, who left CNN last year to start his own newsletter called Status, pointed to his newsletter Wednesday where he declared conservative media outlets were taking an undeserved victory lap. BIDEN INSIDER EXPOSES HOW WHITE HOUSE 'GASLIT' THE PUBLIC ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT'S DECLINE \"For years, right-wing media pushed a warped narrative of Joe Biden as a brain-dead puppet controlled by sinister, shadowy forces. Now they’re demanding vindication—but they do not deserve it,\" he wrote. Ana Navarro stays committed to the cause Even after Biden dropped out of the race last July, \"The View\" co-host and CNN commentator Ana Navarro was committed to defending his mental acuity in office. Later that week, Manhattan Institute official Reihan Salam wondered if Biden should even stay in office until his term ended, but Navarro erupted that any talk about his state behind the scenes was mere speculation. \"No, it is speculation! It is speculation! Because actually, unlike you, I’ve actually seen the guy at 9:00 at night. I have seen him after he has had five different events in 24 hours,\" Navarro said at one point. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Navarro appeared to have a strong interest in Biden, beyond that of a typical media pundit. Although she continues to identify as a Republican, the left-wing commentator is an avid supporter of the Democratic Party, hosted the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and has referred to Biden and Harris as \"Uncle Joe\" and \"Auntie Kamala.\" CNN has stood behind Tapper's past reporting in light of his new job, pointing to examples when he aggressively covered the subject.

Like, where are we headed?’ \n\nThe Comedy Central host criticized his own network, Paramount, for deciding to settle with Trump over an edited clip of Kamala Harris aired on 60 Minutes.\n\nStewart said: ‘Imagine paying $50million for f***ing nothing, just to get somebody to approve a merger.’ Stewart added that he won’t stop there.\n\n‘He’ll go after Harvard and Comcast or whatever the hell else he does, because a policy of appeasement always leads to more conquest,’ he said.\n\nCBS News CEO Wendy McMahon said Monday she’s quitting the network – with a tense statement hinting at her unhappiness at the newsroom’s current state.\n\nMcMahon, 50, sent a memo to staffers that included a veiled reference to Trump’s $20billion lawsuit against the network over its interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe resignation was first reported by The New York Times, three months after insiders first said McMahon was set to lose her job.\n\n‘It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,’ McMahon wrote in her memo.\n\n‘It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.’ \n\nBoth McMahon and former 60 Minutes boss Bill Owens opposed a plan by Shari Redstone, the heiress of CBS parent company Paramount, to settle the ongoing suit being brought by the president. \n\nThe lawsuit claims that an October 60 Minutes interview with Harris was deceptively edited.\n\nMcMahon, whose less than two-year stint was plagued by poor ratings, called her tenure ‘one of the most meaningful chapters in my career.’\n\nBoth Owens and McMahon suggested corporate overreach spurred their decisions, as the deadline for a proposed media merger between Paramount and Skydance approaches.\n\nThe Trump administration must approve the deal. \n\nMcMahon – who had tapped Owens to implement her vision of a two-host version of CBS Evening News – wrote of her next move: ‘It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.’\n\nTrump’s suit – which names both CBS News and Paramount as defendants – accuses 60 Minutes of selecting a more coherent answer from Harris to help with her presidential candidacy.\n\nCBS News has maintained Harris had merely given a lengthy answer, which was then cut down due to time constraints.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJon Stewart has predicted Donald Trump will burn &#8216;our f***ing country down for the insurance&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jon Stewart Shares Grim Prediction About Trump&#8217;s Future first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/jon-stewart-shares-grim-prediction-about-trumps-future/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jon-Stewart-makes-horrifying-dark-prediction-about-the-end-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 12:47:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355}]}
