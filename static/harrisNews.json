And Gov. JB Pritzker — who helped land the city its 26th political convention — says Chicago is prepared, both inside and outside the United Center. Tens of thousands of journalists and delegates flocked to the city over the weekend for the Democratic National Convention, which will formally begin Monday afternoon. So have thousands of protesters, who started day one of a massive march down Michigan Avenue — just as delegates, donors and guests checked into their swanky downtown hotels. The world inside the United Center and its hefty security perimeter will be a very different and insulated one than the one the rest of Chicago experiences. Inside the arena, Democrats will amplify their campaign messaging of positivity over “weird” and help highlight Vice President Kamala Harris as a trailblazing candidate who could become the first Black Asian-American woman to take the White House. Outside, protesters will do their best to have their voices heard — the focal point of a more than 10-months-long effort to force President Joe Biden and Harris to push for an immediate and permanent cease-fire to the war and an end to U.S. military aid to Israel. Pritzker told the Sun-Times he anticipates that there will be some protesters inside the arena, especially from uncommitted delegates who are protesting the war in Gaza. But he said Democrats will show to the world that they respect “peaceful protests.” “I hope that what people cover is at least about the protests, is that there were peaceful protests and that we protected the protesters and their rights, and at the same time, that we tolerate that as Democrats,” Pritzker said. “Republicans and Donald Trump, in particular, does not tolerate protests.” “Obviously you want to allow them to exercise their free speech, but also not disrupt the proceedings,” Pritzker said. “So it’s a balance. Handling a heckler is an art. And I think actually that Kamala Harris has shown she’s got kind of a flair of that,” Pritzker said. Earlier this month, Harris told a group of hecklers, “I’m speaking,” as they interrupted a rally in her first visit to Michigan since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. As for combative protesters, Pritzker said the city will “not protect people who are a danger to the people of Chicago, to the visitors of Chicago, to anybody.” “If you want to cause mayhem, you’re going to get arrested. You’re going to get charged, and you’re going to get convicted,” Pritzker said. The Democratic governor said the National Guard has been part of contingency plans, should outside protests get out of hand. And guardsmen were spotted at Chicago Police Department headquarters on Sunday. “Every level of law enforcement and protection that we can provide, we’ve made contingencies and so on. This has all been in the works for a year and a half now. By the way there’s 60 years of experience ….So I think there’s a lot of learning that’s been done and it’ll be handled properly.” Pritzker, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and former Mayor Lori Lightfoot were key in winning President Joe Biden’s nod to host the convention over New York City, Atlanta and Houston. And Mayor Brandon Johnson inherited the convention after taking office last year. Both Pritzker and Johnson will speak at the convention — Johnson on Monday afternoon and Pritzker on Tuesday evening. The four-day pep rally will go down as the most expensive convention in history. The Chicago host committee announced last week it had raised more than $95 million to pay for the convention, covering everything from lights and sound to food spreads, balloons and other party supplies. That’s $10 million more than Republicans raised for their convention last month in Milwaukee. Untethered by contribution limits related to political campaign committees, massive gifts to Chicago’s host committee have come from corporations including United Airlines, Peoples Gas, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Pfizer and Lyft. Organized labor has also chipped in mightily, with large donations reported by the Laborers’ International Union of North America, Service Employees International Union, and the American Federation of Teachers, among others. A full accounting of contributors won’t be known till well after the balloons drop. Federal election law doesn’t require host committees — which are registered as nonprofits — to disclose their contributors until about two months after the convention ends. Meanwhile on the other side of the aisle, Illinois Republicans have derided Chicago’s grand spectacle. “You’ll see marching bands. You’ll hear John Legend at his concert. They’re pulling out the stops for the convention,” said State Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris. “But what really matters is after the convention, when the taxpayers of the state and of this country really get back into their routine of going to the grocery store and being reminded that they can’t afford to feed a family of four… They’re going to be reminded about what the Democrat agenda looks like and how it affects them.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/18/democratic-national-convention-chicago-kickoff-spotlight-jb-pritzker-kamala-harris","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25137f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7570x4321+0+363/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Feb%2F4f%2Fcfe27c034eb2afa5b7efb5051cdf%2Fdncp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 00:02:06","author":"Mitchell Armentrout,Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Mitchell Armentrout","Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":254394556,"title":"Rep.

Speaking to a crowd of staff, volunteers and supporters at a campaign field office in Beaver County, just outside of Pittsburgh, the vice president contrasted her leadership style with that of Trump, who's long been known for his in-your-face campaign rhetoric, including insulting his rivals, as he's flamed the politics of division. \"This campaign is about a recognition that, frankly, over the last several years there’s been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,\" Harris said. Then, apparently pointing toward Trump without mentioning her presidential election rival by name, Harris said \"anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward.\" HARRIS, TRUMP HOLD DUELING EVENTS IN FIGHT TO WIN BIGGEST BATTLEGROUND Responding, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to the lack of a major news conference or media interview by Harris in the four weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket. \"The Kamala campaign – liars, frauds, and cowards. She can't even do a sit-down interview or press conference – not even with a friendly outlet – because she's scared to death of being exposed for the coward and fraud that she is,\" Cheung said in a statement to Fox News. TRUMP RUNNING MATE VANCE AIMS TO TURN BLUE WALL STATES RED The stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, was the first by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, after they kicked off a campaign bus tour at nearby Pittsburgh International Airport earlier in the afternoon. The barnstorming tour through western Pennsylvania by Harris and Walz and their spouses, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, came on the eve of the kickoff of the Democratic National Convention, which is being held in Chicago. With 19 electoral votes up for grabs, Pennsylvania is the largest prize among the seven battleground states that will likely decide the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. HARRIS AND TRUMP TRADE FIRE IN BATTLE FOR THE BLUE WALL STATES \"We're winning by a lot in Pennsylvania,\" Trump declared on Saturday as he held a rally in Wilkes Barre in the northeast corner of the Keystone State. But an average of all the polls conducted in Pennsylvania since Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket four weeks ago indicates it is all tied up.

The question is whether the Democratic National Convention will be a far different story — a big if given that leaders in the party have at times chided or shunned the network. That said, figures such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) have made recent appearances, while Kamala Harris’ campaign announced over the weekend that part of a mega ad buy would be on the network’s daytime programming, “particularly during day-time programming which reaches a more moderate audience.” In separate interviews, Deadline spoke to Special Report‘s Bret Baier and The Story‘s Martha MacCallum, who are lead anchors of Fox News’ coverage, about what they expect this week, whether it’s a challenge to book Democrats on their shows, and the prospects for Fox News hosting a presidential debate. DEADLINE: The race is totally different from where things left off in Milwaukee. Would you have expected the race to be where it is now? BAIER: I would have put money that Biden was going to probably stay in, and up until that Saturday [after the Republican convention], he was, and saying he was going to be the nominee. Fourteen and a half million Democrats had voted for him, and I thought he was going to stay on. So I thought the race was starting to gel, that it was the former president’s to lose. Now I think we’re going to have a really tight race that, again, will come down to probably six states and probably 300,000 votes or fewer in a country of 330 million. So we could be in for a squeaker. MACCALLUM: You see this huge kind of relief rally on the Democrat side, that they have a new candidate, they have someone they’re excited about. And I think that that has reset this whole race, which is fascinating to watch. We’ll see how things go in Chicago for Democrats, and we’ll see what comes after that. A lot of people feel the race really resets after Labor Day as well. DEADLINE: What storylines will you be watching for, or is this going to be primarily a celebration? MACCALLUM: One of the things I remember thinking during the Republican convention was that it felt pretty organic, the enthusiasm. I haven’t seen people that excited in quite a while. I remember Van Jones over at CNN saying, ‘There’s something happening here this week. There’s a movement.’ There’s an excitement that feels very real among the people who were there, and beyond. So now you have the shoe on the other foot. It is the Democrats’ opportunity, and they certainly have a big shot in the arm with Kamala Harris taking over. And I think the way she consolidated power so quickly, when not long ago people were asking whether Joe Biden should remove her from the ticket, whether she was a drag on the ticket. So this is upside down world, and it’s fascinating, from a reporter perspective, to watch all this happen. I think there’s probably another shoe to drop somewhere. I don’t know what it is, but I think we’ve all become very aware that this is quite a volatile cycle. BAIER: I think it’ll be chock full of different storylines. Israel Gaza, and whether protesters show up, that may be one. I think when it comes to how this race is going to be lining up is really the biggest storyline. She’s clearly closed the gap, and in some cases, is ahead, and some of the betting odds have her more of a chance to win the presidency. Just that alone kind of ups the ante for the convention, and I think it’ll be fascinating. We’re going to have a lot of Democratic surrogates on my show. I know we have Governor [Josh] Shapiro and Governor [Gavin] Newsom, Secretary Buttigieg, others. DEADLINE: How did the Democrats’ change at the top of the ticket alter the way that that Fox News is covering next week? MACCALLUM: We’ve watched a remarkable deposing of the top of the ticket. It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before. There have been times in history when it looked like a candidate was in pretty tough shape, but the party didn’t push him off the ticket and replace him with somebody. So that’s what we saw here, and so it creates a very different environment going into this and of course, we cover it like we cover everything, just watching all of the steps along the way here. I think she’s going to have to start to define herself in a clear way after this convention. DEADLINE: How difficult is it to get Democrats as guests on your show? BAIER: I have Democrats on all the time, and we have a segment called Common Ground where we bring a Democrat and Republican on together, talking about what they’re working on. That has been a real success story for about a year, and now ranking members and chairmen are trying to get on the show a lot. So already the DNC had reached out to us and our show … There’s Democrats, independents and and Republicans who watch our show. I think they want to reach them. MACCALLUM: I talk to John Kirby a lot from the White House. I talk to a number of lawmakers that join us frequently. I guess it is a little bit harder than getting Republicans to come on, but this is their week, so they should want to come on. DEADLINE: Bret, Nikki Haley was on your show last week, essentially trying to tell Donald Trump to focus on the issues and not the personalities. Do you think she was trying to talk to reach him and send a message? BAIER: I do. I think she was clearly saying that the issues are what need to be focused on, and not the crowd sizes and race or the various things that the former president has mentioned along the way. I think she clearly wanted to come on and get that message out, and it got picked up a lot of places. And I’m sure the former president or his campaign got to view it one way or another. DEADLINE: Do you think it is a challenge for Trump to run against a woman, and a woman of color? BAIER: I don’t know if it’s a challenge for him. I think the early days of this transition to a new nominee on the Democratic side has maybe flummoxed the Trump campaign as they’re trying to figure out the best attack line. And I think there’s plenty of time that this race will kind of gel … But I do think the switch over threw some folks for a loop. DEADLINE: What will you be looking for to determine that this is a successful convention for the Democrats? BAIER: The least amount of disunity and the sense of coming together as a party. Unity being the message of the different wings of the party. MACCALLUM: There was a Monmouth poll yesterday that I thought was stunning, and it showed that prior to Biden leaving the race, the enthusiasm rate among Democrats was in the upper 40s, and now it’s in the upper 80s, which is a stunning move. I don’t know how much higher it can go after the convention, but that’s a measure that we’ll be looking at. But I just think that in and of itself is an extraordinary story., the leap in enthusiasm, especially for someone who people thought was a drag on the ticket… And the other thing I’m watching closely is the issue of suburban women voters, and independent suburban women voters in particular, and how they move. Where are the people that are sort of the margins of what is a tight race? How anybody who will be persuaded by this convention and moved over into Harris’ column or Trump’s, I think is that’s the whole story right there. DEADLINE: Fox News has proposed a debate for September and Donald Trump has accepted. What do you think are the chances Fox News will host a debate that both candidates will agree to? (Kamala Harris has not accepted, but says there will be another debate in October, with no network announced). BAIER: We’re doing everything we can to talk to folks and see if we could be the one in October. It’s obviously a different ball game. It’s like the Wild West trying to lock all of it down without the Presidential Debate Commission running the show. So we’re trying hard. If not a debate, maybe consecutive town halls or something like that.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFox News was the most watched network for the Republican National Convention&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Understanding the Chaos: Fox News Anchors Discuss Reporting on the 2024 Election and Kamala Harris&#8217;s Emergence&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/understanding-the-chaos-fox-news-anchors-discuss-reporting-on-the-2024-election-and-kamala-harriss-emergence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-‘This-Is-Upside-Down-World-Fox-News.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:40:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":254394006,"title":"Poll shows Harris is slightly ahead of Trump before DNC event","text":"According to a recent survey, Vice President Kamala Harris is slightly ahead of former President Trump in the upcoming Democratic National Convention.

Forty-four percent said they are satisfied with a Harris-Trump matchup next fall, which is up from the 28 percent who said the same of a Biden-Trump race last month. The poll also found that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), who Harris selected as her running mate earlier this month, is seen as more favorable than Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who Trump chose as his potential vice president. The poll found that 39 percent of respondents said they either have a “strongly” or “somewhat” positive view of Walz while 32 percent said the same of Vance. The poll comes ahead of the Democratic National Convention kicking off this week in Chicago. In the weeks since launching her campaign, Harris has garnered enthusiastic support among Democrats and voters that she will be aiming to keep up this week. She has also closed the gap between her and Trump in numerous national and swing-state polls. According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s national polling average, she has a 1.8 percentage point lead over Trump based on an aggregate of 120 polls. The ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll l was conducted among 2,336 respondents on Aug. 9-13. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points for the full sample.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey, Vice President Kamala Harris is slightly ahead&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Poll shows Harris is slightly ahead of Trump before DNC event first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/poll-shows-harris-is-slightly-ahead-of-trump-before-dnc-event/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Harris-holds-thin-lead-over-Trump-as-DNC-approaches-Poll.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:38:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":254393834,"title":"Democratic Convention Will Feature Celebrity Hosts: Kerry Washington, Mindy Kaling, Ana Navarro and Tony Goldwyn","text":"Kerry Washington, Tony Goldwyn, Mindy Kaling and Ana Navarro have been draft to act as celebrity hosts during the Democratic National Convention this week, CNN reports, citing DNC officials.

Kaling has an established history with Harris, with a 2019 cooking video they appeared in together making the rounds.

For almost a century, Chicago has been under Democratic leadership, and the city has faced significant challenges. These include widespread crime, steep taxes, insurmountable debt, deteriorating infrastructure, and a dwindling population, all of which have had a negative impact on its residents. Chicago holds the unfortunate title of being the murder capital of the United States, with a shooting occurring every two hours and a fatality every 17 hours. In the current year alone, 353 individuals, predominantly African American, have lost their lives to violence in Chicago. The rate of homicides is five times greater than that of New York City. “Democrats wanted to hold the convention somewhere safer, but Beirut wasn’t available,” quipped one wag. However, the approximately 35,000 attendees and 15,000 media representatives visiting Chicago this week for the convention will likely not witness these grim realities. The Democratic National Convention has implemented stringent security measures, including a sizable wall around the event precinct, a precaution they have yet to take at the southern border. Mayor Brandon Johnson has temporarily suspended his “anti-racist” crime policies and ordered his city’s beleaguered cops to enforce the law for once so that everyone will go home saying that Chicago’s crime wave is a MAGA conspiracy theory. “There are extraordinary efforts to make sure the Democratic convention is safe and protected, whereas people outside the bubble are being murdered on a weekly, daily and hourly basis,” says Gianno Caldwell, the Fox News political analyst whose 18-year-old brother Christian Beamon was murdered in Chicago in a still-unsolved 2022 shooting. “Chicago has become the wild, wild west,” says Caldwell, who has dedicated himself to helping victims of violent crime in his hometown through his foundation, the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety. “Having grown up on the South Side of Chicago I understand how progressive policies are systematically killing innocent lives . . . The city is hurting, and hurting even worse under Brandon Johnson and [Gov. J.B.] Pritzker. Looking purely at the numbers of shootings and people being murdered today, Chicago is much different to when I was growing up.” He says the families of shooting victims feel helpless. “If you’re a poor family in great despair there’s nothing you can do. You don’t even have the resources to get a funeral together.” And he points to the disparate nature of justice in the city. Two teens were charged in June with a single misdemeanor after attacking a couple in downtown Chicago so savagely that the wife lost her unborn baby. Yet when a man tossed a Big Gulp root beer at progressive State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, he was slapped with two felony charges for aggravated battery. Foxx’s office routinely charges people with misdemeanors over far more serious attacks that result in permanent injures to victims but throws the book when her dignity is bruised. That’s Chicago for you. Johnson, a defund-police radical, is even further to the left than his loathed one-term predecessor Lori Lightfoot, who last year became the first Chicago mayor in more than three decades to lose re-election. A former prosecutor like Kamala Harris, Lightfoot’s soft-on-crime policies ended up destroying her candidacy. The first black woman elected to her position, like Harris, she came to office as a blank slate and then injected race into everything, at one point declaring she would only talk to nonwhite journalists. Chicago’s already serious crime problem ballooned on her watch. Gangs began looting luxury stores on the Magnificent Mile and delinquent teenagers rampaged through downtown streets, stomping on cars, terrorizing citizens. Carjackings, muggings and shootings are endemic in black neighborhoods in the south and west of the city. Like Harris, George Soros-backed Foxx has effectively decriminalized various offenses including thefts of less than $1,000, and reportedly has dismissed more than 25,000 felony cases. Illinois followed New York’s lead last year with a lenient crime bill that handcuffs police and eliminates cash bail, making it easier for liberal judges to release violent habitual criminals onto the streets. The upshot is that two-thirds of Chicago voters don’t feel safe and nine in 10 voters over 50 have considered leaving for safer pastures in the past year, according to polls. Business are fleeing the city, including Boeing and Ken Griffin’s Citadel hedge fund, because they can’t keep their employees safe. Chicagoans thought Lightfoot was bad, but Johnson’s embrace of Chicago’s sanctuary-city status and exploitation of racial grievances has taken crime and disorder to a new level, with an influx of illegal migrants threatening to bankrupt the collapsing city budget and angering black Chicagoans. Last week, a black pastor warned Democrats that many black Chicagoans are so fed up they are considering deserting the party. “Black people have been with the Democratic Party for over 60 years and we have nothing,” Pastor David Lowery Jr. told reporters. “We don’t own anything in our community . . . All we have is crime and problems.” Johnson, like his predecessor, blames “white supremacy” for Chicago’s ills, even though the city has had black and brown mayors for 40 years. A former teacher and organizer with the militant Chicago Teachers Union, Johnson specializes in pandering to the bloated education bureaucracy that keeps failing Chicago’s kids. Despite education spending double the national average, at almost $30,000 per student annually, less than one-quarter of Chicago’s students can read at grade level and fewer than one in five are proficient a math — and it’s worse for black students, with just 17% able to read and 8% proficient in math. Taking her cue from Johnson, Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates blames standardized testing, which she says is “junk science rooted in white supremacy [and] born out of the eugenics movement [which] has always sought to see black people as inferior.” As a reward for their betrayal of Chicago’s children, the union is demanding pay rises and other perks for its members, totaling another $50 billion that would boost the average teacher’s salary by 50 percent to nearly $145,000. To pay for it all, Brandon wants to raise taxes. “Seventy percent of large corporations in the state of Illinois did not pay a corporate tax,” he said last year. “And it’s that kind of restraint on our budget that has . . . led to poverty, of course, that has led to violence.” So, when Kamala Harris and Tim Walz take the stage in Chicago this week, they will feel right at home. The deep blue city is a showpiece for the policies they want to impose on the rest of the country.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIf the message of this week’s Democratic National Convention is “We’re going&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chicago, a city plagued by crime, exemplifies the failures of Democratic policies. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chicago-a-city-plagued-by-crime-exemplifies-the-failures-of-democratic-policies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2F2024%2F08%2Fchicsgo-downfall.jpg?quality%3D90%26strip%3Dall","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:16:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":254394644,"title":"Harris and Walz make small town stops and campaign phone calls on Pennsylvania bus tour before DNC","text":"ROCHESTER, Pa. (AP) — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and running mate Tim Walz gave pep talks to campaign volunteers and a high school football team Sunday, with their bus tour in a corner of Pennsylvania serving as a modest, small-town version of the grand rally she’s expected to have at the Democratic nominating convention in Chicago this week. Vice President Harris and Walz, the governor of Minnesota, were joined by their spouses, Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz, as they toured in a blue bus. They stopped off to visit volunteers at a campaign office not far from Pittsburgh before continuing on to a firehouse and a high school in another town, along with a pilgrimage to a Sheetz convenience store, part of a storied Pennsylvania chain. Throughout their stops, Harris and her running mate shied away from policy or much politics, instead sticking to broad-strokes messages focused on character, perseverance and the future of the country. Harris, while speaking to a group of supporters and volunteers outside the campaign office in the borough of Rochester, spoke about strength and leadership. She appeared to make a veiled reference to Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who is known for his pugilistic style and projection of a strongman image, when she said the “real and true measure of a strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,” rather than who they beat down. “Anybody who is about beating down other people is a coward,” she yelled, drawing cheers and applause. “This is what strength looks like.” Walz in his remarks seemed to assume the role of his former job coaching high school football and told the volunteers: “Let’s leave it all on the field. Let’s get this thing done.” Rochester is in in Beaver County, which Trump won in 2020. But the Democrats are riding on renewed enthusiasm after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid exactly four weeks ago and endorsed Harris to replace him on the ticket. As Harris’ motorcade left the town, it rolled by a group of about 50 Trump supporters waiting near the road with signs of support for the former president. A handful of Harris supporters were standing nearby with their own signs. The vice president next stopped at a firehouse in Aliquippa, where she met firefighters, petted the station’s dog and gave the crew almond pastries, before heading to a nearby high school, where they met with the local football coach and addressed the team, who kneeled on the field to listen. Walz again slipped into coach mode, reminiscing a bit about his days leading a team and the sport’s character before introducing Harris. She praised the young athletes for their leadership: “Our nation is counting on you and your excellence. We applaud your ambition. She also told them, “Welcome to the role model club.” Southwestern Pennsylvania is a critical part of a key battleground state that has long commanded the attention of presidential candidates. The state voted for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020. Both Harris and Trump are vying to see who can put Pennsylvania in their column on Nov. 5. Most polls, including from the New York Times/Siena College and Fox News, find Harris and Trump locked in a tight race statewide. Trump held a rally Saturday in Wilkes-Barre in the northeastern part of the state, following his earlier rallies in July in Harrisburg and Butler, where he survived an assassination attempt. The bus tour marks Harris’ eighth trip to Pennsylvania this year, and her second this month. The vice president chose to make her first joint appearance with Walz on the ticket in Philadelphia on Aug. 6. On Sunday, they arrived with their spouses earlier at Pittsburgh International Airport and greeted supporters. The foursome held hands and raised their arms together in front of cheering supporters and then boarded a bright blue bus that says “Harris Walz” in big white letters as they set off to make stops in the Pittsburgh area to glad-hand with voters. At a stop in the township of Moon, Harris popped into a Sheetz to seek out Doritos, her go-to snack. In Rochester, Harris, Walz and their spouses spent a few minutes sitting at tables with volunteers and making phone calls to line up support. Harris took a cellphone from a volunteer and spoke to the person on the other end. “I love Erie. At some point we’ll get to Erie,” Harris said. She continued the conversation at at one point said, “79 days to go.” Walz, sitting across the table from Harris, hung up from a call and said of the caller, “He’s all in,” and gave a thumbs up. Kristin Kanthak, associate professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh, said Pennsylvania “is a state that traditionally has been super important, but southwestern Pennsylvania has been really kind of the battleground part of the battleground state.” After Trump’s surprise win in the state in 2016, Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 — and, in so doing, won the White House — in part by running up his vote totals in heavily Democratic Pittsburgh, the state’s second-largest city and the county seat of Allegheny County. Biden assiduously courted the area’s blue-collar labor unions, kicking off his 2020 presidential campaign at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh by declaring, “I am a union man.” Trump, who is counting on strong turnout from his base of white, working-class voters, is not conceding the area. The counties around Pittsburgh have shifted from Democrat to Republican in recent presidential contests, delivering for Trump in both of his earlier runs. Trump has also embraced protectionist trade policies and insists he is pro-worker. His vow to increase U.S. energy production and “drill, baby, drill” has resonated in southwestern Pennsylvania blue-collar counties like Washington, where a natural gas drilling boom has helped make Pennsylvania the nation’s No. 2 producer after Texas. Harris once wanted to ban fracking, an oil and gas extraction process, before recently disavowing her earlier position — a reversal Trump has hammered her for. Dana Brown, director of Chatham University’s Pennsylvania Center for Women & Politics, said in an interview that Harris will use the bus trip to spin up local media coverage as well as reach out to voters in the state’s southwestern region “while she still has a great deal of momentum at her back.” Bus tours have become a staple of political campaigns partly because of the free media coverage they generate. Such trips get the candidates out of their power suits and out of Washington so they can travel the country and score face time with voters in small venues like diners and mom-and-pop shops. The low-key venues of Harris’ campaign on Sunday will be replaced with their polar opposite Monday when the Democratic National Convention opens, offering a prime-time showcase of the Democratic ticket that director Steven Spielberg is helping to choreograph. ___ Price reported from New York.

Fox News’ chief political analyst, Brit Hume, mentioned a key factor behind Trump’s potentially tough re-election battle against Kamala Harris could be his level of likability. On August 18, Hume spoke on the cable network, elaborating on her thoughts about the former president’s campaign. The analyst said that although many Americans are fed up with the current Biden administration, some voters still seemed more inclined to vote for Biden, and now Harris, over Trump. With less than three months left until Election Day, Hume argued that Trump is disliked by half of voters despite his cult-like fan base. “The fact that Biden was doing even as well as he did until the very end, is a testament to the fact that Donald Trump has a very hard, solid base of support, but it never gets above about 40 to 45 percent, maybe a little more at best,” Hume said on Fox News Sunday to host Shannon Bream. “So, his weakness is the predicate for our politics going back now three elections. “He was able to surmount Hillary Clinton, a uniquely unpopular opponent, but he couldn’t beat Biden, and you know you look at the losses in the midterms – or the disappointing results in the midterms. “It’s all about one thing, it’s about that. Donald Trump, no matter how enthusiastic supporters are, nonetheless, is not a majority candidate. “He might win, but he’s not a majority candidate.” In response to Hume’s argument, former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said Trump’s “undisciplined form of communication” also contributes to his poor likeability rating. “Well, first of all, he does listen to a lot of people, but the first he listens to is the inner voice, and we see it in these rallies, which are a particularly undisciplined form of communications,” Rove said. “Look, think about it, two-thirds of Americans think we’re going in the wrong direction. “He leads on the issue of who’s better on the economy, who’s better on inflation, who’s better on migration. That’s all all good numbers for him. and yet this race today he’s behind and why is he behind? “Because he is making this race about things other than the three big issues in this campaign – the economy, inflation, and immigration.” In an August 18 poll, The Hill reported that Trump had a 44.1% favorable rating, with an overwhelming 54.3% viewing the former president as unfavorable. Vance, Trump’s running mate, has an even lower favorability rating of 38.5%. Harris, on the other hand, has an almost even split of favorable and unfavorable. 49.3% of respondents viewed the vice president favorably, with 49.2% viewing her as unfavorable. “Kamala Harris’ favorability rating remains a pivotal aspect of her political viability,” The Hill wrote. “This measure of voter sentiment reveals the depth of Harris’ base and the challenges she may face in rallying a broad coalition. “The favorability rating is instrumental in assessing Harris’ impact on the political landscape and her potential to mobilize support in her current presidential bid.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA POPULAR Fox News political analyst revealed one of the major factors&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post:  first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/3151768/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Veteran-Fox-anchor-warns-Donald-Trump-was-able-to-beat.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:15:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":254393418,"title":"Crime-filled Chicago displays all that’s wrong with Democrats in one failing city","text":"If the message of this week’s Democratic National Convention is “We’re going to make America more like Chicago” then run for the hills.

The Black Man Lab, which for nearly a decade has sought weekly to create a “safe, sacred and healing space” for Black men in metropolitan Atlanta, regularly gathers more than 100 men to pray, meditate and talk through challenges and triumphs they are facing and learn from peers and elders. “It’s almost a communion,” said Carttrell Coleman, a visual artist from South Fulton, Georgia, who has attended the weekly meetings for seven years. “It’s an opportunity for us to share our voices and get resources. The networking is always a good thing. It’s a fellowship, of sorts.” One recent meeting in the immediate aftermath of President Biden’s suspension of his reelection campaign took on special weight as attendees considered the prospect of a Black woman winning the presidency. The candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris has refocused attention on Black men, a demographic that Democrats and Republicans view as persuadable but whose multifaceted experiences and political preferences often go unaddressed in public debate. Harris’ campaign has also reignited discussions amongst Black men about their influence in this election. “Black men are the target, and we hold the keys to the kingdom. This is our moment,” said Lance Robertson, executive director of the Black City Councilmen of Georgia, during the meeting. “The Black man has built America. Now it’s time for the Black man to save America.” Black male voters are traditionally one of the most consistently Democratic leaning demographics in the nation. This year, however, both major parties view Black men, especially those under the age of 40, as attainable voters. Whether Black men turn out in high numbers and to what degree they maintain traditional support for Democratic candidates may prove decisive in November. “To be frank, I think early on in this process a lot of Black men viewed this election with much skepticism and dread,” said Bishop Reginald Jackson, who presides over all 534 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia. “But since the change in the Democratic ticket, there has been a turnaround. I think they feel they have something that they can support. I think a lot of issues which made a lot of them skeptical are being addressed.” At the Black Man Lab event, the men present came from all walks of life. Attendees’ ages ranged from 8 to 86, with multiple pairings of fathers, grandfathers and grandsons telling the group about the unique circumstances each generation faces as Black men in America. Black voters have historically prioritized policies on civil rights and economic mobility, leading to overwhelming support for Democrats. But how those concerns translate into political preferences has shifted as traditional ties to institutions like the Black church have frayed for some younger Black Americans. “The Black church, in a lot of respects, has been a turnoff for the Black man, and we’re only now working to address the need and correct it,” Jackson said. For many younger Black men, advocates stressed, issues like wealth creation, entrepreneurship, police reform and anti-discrimination policies in the workplace are top of mind. “We want to see jobs and opportunity for Black men, especially,” said Andre Greenwood, chair of the YMCA that hosts the Black Man Lab event. Greenwood, who supports Harris, said economic messages will be most important to Black male voters. Harris’ entrance into the presidential race has unleashed a flurry of organizing among her Black male allies. A day after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, a virtual conference tailored for Black men garnered more than 53,000 attendees and raised more than $1.3 million. The event, organized by Win With Black Men, a collective of Black male-led groups, has hosted regular meetings every week since then to engage organizers targeting Black men. “Up until this point, these folks were not really engaged with this campaign season, let alone volunteering for outside organizations. I think what we’re seeing now is a massive level of organic energy that you can’t deny,” said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, a Democratic political action committee that supports Black candidates. Win With Black Men said it would direct the raised funds to organizations nationwide for Black male engagement. More than 150 groups have applied for support. James stressed that while the recent fundraising windfall is notable, the Harris campaign’s own engagement effort with Black men may not be enough unless it is paired with robustly funded outside groups that have longstanding trust in local communities. Harris has also revamped her outreach to Black men. The campaign believes it has a winning message for Black men’s priorities. “It’s wealth and it’s health,” Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said of the message. Seawright leads the Democratic National Committee’s “Chop It Up” town halls for Black men at barbershops and other venues in battleground states this year. He noted that Black men “aren’t monolithic” and added that it is a mistake for campaigns to assume “we only care about criminal justice reform.” The culminating effort also aims to address longstanding skepticism among many Black men about the political system, which is seen as discriminatory and unresponsive to their interests. Others have tackled potential hesitancy among men about electing a woman to the nation’s highest office. Republicans, too, see an opportunity to make inroads with Black men precisely because of those longstanding frustrations. Donald Trump often speaks of his interest in garnering greater Black voter support. Black Republicans, including Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Wesley Hunt of Texas, have hosted a “Congress, Cognac, and Cigars” event series in cities including Atlanta, Philadelphia and Milwaukee. “Black men have been taken for granted by the Democratic Party for years, but President Trump’s message is resonating at historic levels because he is doing the work,” said Janiyah Thomas, Black media director for the Trump campaign. Marcus Robinson, a senior spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, called Republican outreach strategy “hot air, racially charged rhetoric and offensive stereotypes, from questioning Vice President Harris’s identity to claiming Black voters should relate to Trump because he is a convicted felon.” For many attendees at the Black Man Lab event, the reinvigorated presidential race is an opportunity to make sure their interests are addressed at the highest levels of government. “I was in the street doing wild stuff and this saved my life,” said Damon Bod, an exterior house technician from Atlanta, of his experience with the Black Man Lab event. Bod said he lost his entire immediate family to violence and that the event provided him counsel and a community. He said he would support Harris in the election because the men who supported him felt she would advance Black men’s interests. “I’ve been looking at it and hopefully she’ll do a bit of good. My brothers have said she will, people who know me. But only God knows,” Bod said.","summary":"Whether Black men turn out in high numbers and to what degree they maintain traditional support for Democratic candidates may prove decisive in November.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/18/black-men-emerge-as-key-constituency-in-2024-race-bringing-dynamic-views-to-the-top-of-politics/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Election_2024_Black_Male_Voters_64093-1724023247.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:08:33","author":"Matt Brown,matt brown - Associated Press","authors":["Matt Brown","matt brown - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.2},{"id":254393962,"title":"Why Kamala Harris Is Succeeding as a Presidential Candidate in a Way Hillary Clinton Never Could","text":"Is Kamala Harris’ surge in popularity just a honeymoon phase—a bump in the polls that will fade as soon as real campaigning begins? The Democrats are praying that it’s not, while Republicans are hoping for the opposite. But from a psychological perspective, Harris’ presence in the race might well be a turning point toward something broader than a political win for Dems—it could be a return to reality for the American people, who have had to endure a presidential campaign in which both parties traded in fantasy and outright lies. In fact, 2024 threatened to be the year that the nation’s culture departed from reality once and for all—a dangerous turn when it happens to an individual, but a world-threatening turn when it influences an entire society. So maybe the even bigger question than whether Kamala Harris will win the presidency is: Will Kamala Harris bring us back to reality? Sigmund Freud, who basically created the field of psychotherapy as we know it, asked, in his book Civilization and Its Discontents, whether it is possible for society itself to become neurotic. “May we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that under the influence of certain cultural urges, some epochs of culture—perhaps the whole of mankind—have become neurotic?” he asked. The problem in such cases, Freud explained, is that when an entire society develops a neurosis, it becomes impossible to gauge what is “normal.” And if we cannot find a referent for the normal and the good, how can we possibly come back from our national neurosis? This neurosis has been stirred not only by the lies told by the leaders of both parties (not necessarily equivalent in their severity, but still—lies) but also by the demand that Americans deny what they see with their own eyes. Republicans are told that Donald Trump actually won the election of 2020 and that the government for the past four years is based on a fraud. Democrats insisted that Joe Biden had not aged on the job and suffered no cognitive decline; this in spite of the fact that millions of Americans witnessed that decline make itself obvious on national television. Psychologists understand that people under severe stress are susceptible to emotional and psychological regression. They become more impulsive, less rational, and often more dependent on leaders who take on the psychological role of parental figures. This phenomenon has been well documented in times of fascism, but it plays a role in all politics: when Germany experienced its worst economic crisis since the war, Angela Merkel emerged as the nation’s “Mutti.” In therapeutic terms, this is called transference, the projection of parental feelings onto the therapist. Unconscious transferences are independent from conscious values or even realistic attributes—when Merkel was nicknamed Mutti, she was not actually a mother, nor was she even traditionally “maternal.” But for people under extreme duress, they play an outsize role in influencing emotional responses and even voting patterns. The 21st century has brought enormous duress to the world, and those in the U.S. seem particularly ill-equipped psychologically to respond to it. A majority of Americans have already been personally affected by extreme upheavals, in terms of climate change, health, and economics. Nearly half of the country’s residents live in communities that have been hit directly by unusually severe weather: drought, floods, fire, intense storms. In the wealthiest nation in the world, nearly two-thirds of Americans could not cover a $500 emergency without going into debt. Parents increasingly see behavioral and academic struggles in their children, delayed effects of the U.S. response to the pandemic that are now impossible to ignore. Americans appear less prepared than ever to deal with such turmoil. They are trained from early childhood to believe that the right consumer goods, the right pharmaceuticals, or simply a positive personal attitude will provide immunity from suffering. And so, at a time when anxiety arises from every direction, voters’ response to candidates is based primarily on policy ideas rather than on their ability to be reassuring, to soothe the feeling of agitation that arises from so much real worry, and to increasingly help them deny the reality of their suffering. The two main candidates who had been running for president—Biden and Trump—both proved to be severely compromised transference figures. Each drew on an unconscious paternal archetype sadly recognizable in American society. Let’s start with Biden’s. For the past year, the president ran a campaign touting economic success that was often interpreted as denying the struggles of most in the nation. On top of that, he denied the obvious effects of his advancing age. While he tried to project a youthful and sporty image, with his aviator glasses and sports cars, his actual performance presented a rather different, more tragic archetype: the aging, deteriorating father who refuses to pass the torch. Americans have a strong cultural resistance to accepting the inevitability of death, and when their elderly parent is in denial, they are liable to join that parent in minimizing the warning signs. Rather than admit the truth that their father is getting old, they tend to regress into what psychoanalyst Melanie Klein calls the paranoid position: They look for someone to blame (or sue) for anything bad that happens. Trump, on the other hand, personifies a very different paternal archetype: the aggressive, impulsive, narcissistic father figure who promises protection in exchange for absolute fealty. For the children of such parents, safety depends on accepting whatever reality the father believes, and so Republicans are required to deny reality, even if they experience that reality directly. In this worldview, there is no climate change, Trump will make everyone rich, and there is no problem that cannot be solved by belligerence and vengeance. In therapeutic terms, this is called counterphobia, the aggressive denial of a frightening reality. The trouble for the Democrats was that in times of great stress, when presented with a choice between two lying father figures, the liar who appears strong will be preferred over the one who appears weak. Trump’s nasty combativeness only made Biden look weaker and sadder. But then Biden withdrew, and, in a flash, the unconscious transference dynamic of the presidential election was radically reversed. The race is no longer between two flawed father figures. It is now a contest between an impulsive and aggressive father archetype and a very different archetype: the strong, no-nonsense, but compassionate working mother figure. The one who will step up if the father is weak and who will be protective if the father is abusive. This archetype has always existed in the nation’s unconscious (see “Rosie the Riveter”), but it hadn’t yet been activated in a presidential campaign. What about the previous woman to run for president on a major-party ticket? Well, Hillary Clinton never managed to embody this archetype. In fact, she seemed to resist transference as a maternal figure altogether (“I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies”), drawing instead on a different archetype: the woman who could engage equally in the world of men. Trump’s campaign easily attacked Hillary’s position, presenting her as crooked, someone who wasn’t what she presented herself to be. In the American unconscious, Harris’ archetypal shift has spurred what may be a stunning turnabout. The very characteristics that gave Trump the implicit advantage over a weak Biden and an angry Hillary Clinton now make him look irrational, threatening, and petulant next to a calm, controlled Harris. Without Biden in the race, Trump has become the more vulnerable, aging parent; Harris is stronger, younger, and more energetic, tough without being irrational. And in addition, her actual history and policies, a mix of conservative and progressive values, reinforce the strong-but-compassionate archetype, making it that much harder for Trump to parody or ridicule her. She was a tough prosecutor who rejected the death penalty, a child of immigrants who worked to stem immigration by improving conditions in immigrants’ home countries, a supporter of Israel who would still hold Israel accountable for abuses and shows compassion for the Palestinians. In the American unconscious, it is exactly such a mother figure that can restore sanity and safety to a family/country so recently threatened by an abusive father or frightened by a weakened one. If she is willing to speak the truth, the transference may in fact help her bring the nation back to reality. Human beings, after all, do have a capacity to respond in healthy ways to life stresses; there are natural processes that enable us to come to terms with great challenges. When we’re faced with a deteriorating aging parent, the healthy response is not denial but mourning. Mourning is also a necessary response to our changing climate. The healthy response to an impulsive, abusive parent, or a threatening world, is to acknowledge fear, so that protective measures can be put in place. Sometimes, under great stress, therapy is required. A good therapist facilitates these processes, helping patients—and perhaps countries—face their fears and take the critical steps toward changing reality. As Trump continues to present a campaign based on aggressive denial, Harris can offer the profound relief that comes when the stresses that Americans feel in their bones are validated: that the climate is in fact changing, that their children are suffering, and that their ability to protect their families financially is fraying. Harris’ task will be to use the political transference to begin a kind of national therapy, an alternative to the polarization and paranoia that have been dominant in U.S. culture and politics in this century, a road back to the truth. If Kamala Harris succeeds, she has the opportunity to become not only commander in chief but therapist in chief for a nation in denial. This is not a unique role for presidents. As Franklin Roosevelt, another great therapist in chief, once put it, “In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.”","summary":"She’s a refreshing alternative to the two men who were performing very sad archetypes.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/kamala-harris-succeeding-as-woman.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/bf9bd838-a0f5-4e2a-9f1c-1807751d1d2a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 23:00:00","author":"Steven Reisner","authors":["Steven Reisner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":254393152,"title":"Harris and Trump offer worlds-apart contrasts on top issues in presidential race","text":"WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris has replaced President Biden atop the presidential ticket, but his “finish the job” campaign mantra can still largely apply to her top policy goals. She’s promising to continue a lot of what Biden was doing during the past four years if she’s elected to four of her own. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, is itching to get back to the White House and accomplish what he didn’t during his first term. Since Biden stepped down last month, the vice president has announced few major policy proposals beyond a new push to prevent price gouging by food producers and grocers and plans to cut taxes for families, attempt to bring down homebuying and rental prices and reduce medical debt. Harris also used a recent rally in Las Vegas, where the economy runs on the hospitality industry, to call for ending taxes on tips paid to restaurant, hotel and other service employees. That came more than a month after Trump used his own Las Vegas rally to promise the same on tips. Despite her lack of specifics on policy, the vice president has committed generally to some major policy positions on various matters, promising to sign sweeping legislation that’s unlikely to clear Congress. Those include measures codifying the federal right to an abortion, increasing the federal minimum wage, imposing an assault weapons ban, requiring universal background checks for firearm purchases and advancing several long-stalled voting rights measures. While details are still rather vague, there’s no doubt that whoever prevails in November will seek to shape the landscape of American life in ways wholly distinct from their opponent. On nearly every issue, the choices – if the winner gets his or her way – are sharply defined. The onward march of regulation and incentives to restrain climate change, or a slow walk if not an about-face. Higher taxes on the super rich, or cuts to benefit high-wage earners. Abortion rights reaffirmed, or left to states to restrict or allow as each decides. Another attempt to legislate border security and orderly entry into the country, or massive deportations. A commitment to stand with Ukraine or let go. Here’s where each candidate stands on 10 top issues: ABORTION HARRIS: The vice president has called on Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing in federal law abortion access, a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. Like Biden, Harris has criticized bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states and promised as president to block any potential nationwide ban should one clear a future GOP-run Congress. Harris was the Democrats’ most visible champion of abortion rights even while Biden was still in the race. She has promoted the administration’s efforts short of federal law – including steps to protect women who travel to obtain abortions and limit how law enforcement collects medical records. TRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. But he’s declined to say whether he would try to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies. CLIMATE/ENERGY HARRIS: As a senator from California, the vice president was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy that is championed by the Democratic Party’s most progressive wing. Harris also said during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign that she opposed offshore drilling for oil and hydraulic fracturing. But during her three and a half years as vice president, Harris has adopted more moderate positions, focusing instead on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. That provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. The Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national “Climate Corps,” a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Despite that, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden’s goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 – a benchmark that Harris hasn’t talked about in the early part of her own White House bid. TRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: “DRILL, BABY, DRILL.” Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a “hoax” and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it’s his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He’d increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines and roll back the Biden administration’s aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn’t be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads. DEMOCRACY/RULE OF LAW HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has decried Trump as a threat to the nation’s democracy. But, in attacking her opponent, the vice president has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and in being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. The vice president has also talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump’s denial that he lost the 2020 presidential election and his spurring on the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. When she’s interrupted during rallies with supporters’ “lock him up” chants directed at Trump, Harris responds that the courts can “handle that” and “our job is to beat him in November.” TRUMP: After refusing to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, Trump hasn’t committed to accepting the results this time. He’s repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI “from the ground up,” aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime, and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has campaigned hard against “Project 2025,” a plan authored by leading conservatives to move as swiftly as possible to dramatically remake the federal government and push it to the right if Trump wins back the White House. She is also part of an administration that is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier. TRUMP: The former president has sought to distance himself from “Project 2025,” despite his close ties to many of its key architects. He has nonetheless vowed an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for blocking his first term agenda, saying: “I will totally obliterate the deep state.” The former president plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He says he’d then move to fire “rogue bureaucrats,” including those who ”weaponized our justice system,” and the “warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex.” Trump has also pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. IMMIGRATION HARRIS: Attempting to defuse a GOP line of political attack, the vice president has talked up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the border. Early in his term, Biden made Harris his administration’s point person on the root causes of migration. Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient. Harris has attempted to counter that by arguing that a bipartisan Senate compromise that would have included tougher asylum standards and hiring more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers was poised to clear Congress before Trump came out in opposition to it. Harris now says that Trump “talks the talk, but doesn’t walk the walk” on immigration. The vice president has endorsed comprehensive immigration reform, seeking pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children. TRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history – an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard. He’d bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he’d revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new “ideological screening” for immigrants to bar “dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs.” He’d also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor “jihadist sympathies.” He’d seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally. ISRAEL/GAZA HARRIS: Harris says Israel has a right to defend itself, and she’s repeatedly decried Hamas as a terrorist organization. But the vice president might also have helped defuse some backlash from progressives by being more vocal about the need to better protect civilians during fighting in Gaza, where the civilian death toll has now exceeded 40,000. Like Biden, Harris supports a proposed hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden and Harris say the deal could lead to a permanent end to the grinding nine-month war and they have endorsed a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state. TRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel’s efforts to “destroy” Hamas, but he’s also been critical of some of Israel’s tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views. LGBTQ+ ISSUES HARRIS: During her rallies, Harris accuses Trump and his party of seeking to roll back a long list of freedoms including the ability “to love who you love openly and with pride.” She leads audiences in chants of “We’re not going back.” While her campaign has yet to produce specifics on its plans, she’s been part of a Biden administration that regularly denounces discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Early in Biden’s term, his administration reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women’s rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes. TRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women’s sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that “only two genders,” as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to “defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.” As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the “chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth” no longer meets federal health and safety standards and won’t get federal money. He’d take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who “suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body.” Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service. NATO/UKRAINE HARRIS: The vice president has yet to specify how her positions on Russia’s war with Ukraine might differ from Biden’s, other than to praise the president’s efforts to rebuild alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. The Biden administration has pledged unceasing support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. The government has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine, including a tranche of aid that totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance that is expected to last through the end of this year. The administration has maintained that continuing U.S. assistance is critical because Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine. Harris has said previously that it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin’s “brutality.” TRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to “fundamentally reevaluate” the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don’t hit those targets, but “would encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that are “delinquent.” TARIFFS/TRADE HARRIS: Though she was critical of free trade deals before becoming vice president, Harris has more recently offered no signs that she’ll oppose Biden’s policies. That might mean adhering to some protectionist practices that offer similarities with Trump. Biden, for instance, endorsed a tripling of tariffs on Chinese steel, a move that would shield U.S. producers from cheaper imports. In May, the Biden-Harris administration said it would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum to 25% from 7.5%. Biden has also said he opposes the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel, because it is “vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.” TRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs on nearly all imported foreign goods, saying that “we’re going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years.” Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland. Whether higher tariffs come from a Biden administration or a Trump one, they are likely to raise prices for consumers who have already faced higher costs from inflation. TAXES HARRIS: The vice president has promised to work with state entities to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million qualifying Americans and plans to push Congress to make permanent a $3,600 per child tax credit approved through 2025 for eligible families. She also wants to offer a new $6,000 tax credit for those with newborn children, and cut taxes for frontline workers and on healthcare plans offered on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. Harris says her administration will expand tax credits for first-time homebuyers and push to build 3 million new housing units in four years, while wiping out taxes on tips and endorsing steeper taxes on corporations. That last part mirrors Biden, who proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21% as a matter of “fundamental fairness” that will bring in more money to invest in Americans. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. Harris has called for restoring the child tax credit that was enacted under the 2021 COVID-19 relief package, but has since expired. TRUMP: The former president has promised to extend the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law and are set to expire at the end of 2025. That package cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and roughly doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit. Those elements will remain until and unless a new law changes them, but many other tax cuts in Trump’s package will lapse without further action by Congress. Trump says he wants to trim the corporate tax rate further – to as low as 15% – and repeal any tax increases that occurred under Biden. Trump also promised to eliminate taxes on tipped income – though doing so would probably require congressional approval.","summary":"While details are still rather vague, there's no doubt that whoever prevails in November will seek to shape the landscape of American life in ways wholly distinct from their opponent.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/18/harris-and-trump-offer-worlds-apart-contrasts-on-top-issues-in-presidential-race/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Election_2024_Where_They_Stand_30203-1724022259.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:57:26","author":"By WILL WEISSERT,JILL COLVIN and SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press,Will Weissert, Jill Colvin And Seung Min Kim","authors":["By WILL WEISSERT","JILL COLVIN and SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press","Will Weissert, Jill Colvin And Seung Min Kim"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":254393650,"title":"Running against Harris ‘should be an easy race’ if Trump sticks to policies: Sununu","text":"Gov. Chris Sununu (R-NH) argued that former President Donald Trump could easily win the 2024 election against Vice President Kamala Harris if he sticks to criticizing her policies rather than making personal attacks against her. Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential primary, argued last week that the former president needs to “quit whining” about Harris and that simple labels on the Democratic candidate will not sway voters. Sununu, who supported Haley in the primary, agreed with the former U.N. ambassador, suggesting that any Republican who is not Trump would probably be ahead of Harris “by 10 points.” “And so the message is very clear: if you stick to the issues, if you stick to what matters, this should be an easy race for Donald Trump. It really should,” Sununu said on CNN’s State of the Union. Sununu explained that Trump is doing better with male voters in polling data but is down by “10, 12 points at least” among female voters ever since Harris entered the 2024 race. He predicted this voting block would come out “in much bigger numbers” this November if President Joe Biden were still seeking reelection against Trump. As such, the New Hampshire governor advised Trump to remind voters that he is running against “the most liberal and most unpopular vice president in history.” He also noted how Harris selected a very liberal running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), as her vice presidential candidate, and that the 2024 race is shaping up to be “a huge Republican win” in the coming months. “He‘s got to deliver, and we‘ve all showed him exactly that playbook to do so,” Sununu said. “If he can get it together in the last sixty days, he can.

The governor argued that Chicago is not a very safe city, and that Republicans can point to the DNC being hosted in this city and argue “this is what the Democrats highlight.” Similar to Sununu and Haley, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has advised Trump to “stop questioning” the legitimacy of Harris’s campaign crowds, and instead stick to criticizing the about-face she has made on various topics. Trump has accused Harris of using artificial intelligence to manipulate the size of her crowds, though the Harris campaign has confirmed to the Washington Examiner that the photo Trump referenced was taken by the Harris campaign and was not altered by AI.","summary":"Gov.

Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Kanye West were among the celebrities who graced the occasion. Fast forward to present times, the Hollywood scene may have evolved, but the fervor of A-listers for the Democratic presidential ticket remains unwavering. The excitement in Tinseltown is reminiscent of the Obama era as celebrities once again show their support at the current Democratic convention in Chicago. Beyoncé, known for her involvement with Democratic politicians, has a track record of performances at significant political events. From singing the national anthem at Obama’s inauguration in 2013 to headlining a pre-election concert for Hillary Clinton in 2016 alongside Jay-Z, Beyoncé’s support for the Democratic party has been consistent. At the Clinton event, her backup dancers even dressed in blue pantsuits as a nod to the potential first female president. Now, with another potential first female president on the ticket, will “Queen Bey” take the stage? Swift – who has yet to make a presidential endorsement this election cycle – is in the midst of a five-night run of shows in London to cap off the European leg of her “Eras Tour.” The superstar wraps at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday, or day two of the convention, meaning she could theoretically be in Chicago by Wednesday for the final two nights. Swift recently fueled fan theories that she had already endorsed Harris when a woman’s silhouette pictured onstage behind her appeared to depict the vice president. But CNN debunked that theory last week, reporting that the silhouette in question was one of Swift’s background singers. Swift’s army of fans – the Swifties – never miss a beat, and this week’s convention will be no different. Even without Swift, her presence will be felt through her fans in Chicago. Irene Kim, who co-founded the group alongside fellow Swiftie Carly Long, said the Harris campaign has been in touch. “They reached out to us asking how they can support in our initiative,” Kim told CNN. Kim also told CNN she was invited to the Democratic convention as a content creator, along with another member of Swifties for Kamala, but said she won’t be able to make it to Chicago. While A-listers (especially of the stature of Swift or Beyoncé) make noise, the definition of celebrity is evolving. The high-profile attendees will be starry, but perhaps more importantly, the crowd will likely break a record for social media follower count on the convention room floor.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBack in 2008, during the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Barack Obama&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Speculation abounds about the star power that will shine at the Democratic convention first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/speculation-abounds-about-the-star-power-that-will-shine-at-the-democratic-convention/","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/TOBHwQa3iIjPh4oEuyQDpR8S4pc=/0x52:2000x1177/500x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F0d286912-8e99-4e46-8a9d-62d940f341a1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:55:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.283},{"id":254393038,"title":"If anti-Israel loons take over Democrats’ convention, liberals only have themselves to blame","text":"The real story of the Democratic National Convention may wind up being what goes on outside the hall, as 50,000 to 100,000 anti-Israel protesters aim to fly the Hamas flag and generally share their fury at the Biden-Harris administration’s support for the Jewish state. Chicago’s done its best to prepare: Anti-cop Mayor Brandon Johnson has given the Chicago Police Department the longest leash it’ll see on his watch to keep a lid on, even as he’s voiced great sympathy for his fellow far-lefties. The Windy City has also spent big to move its many illegal-immigrant “guests” (and the regular homeless) out of sight, lest they show up on national news and remind voters what Democratic leadership really means for America’s cities. And they’ve isolated the area around the United Center from the general public to frustrate “protesters” looking to make the ugliest scene possible. Local businesses, meanwhile, have boarded up: They know how much the left loves to window-smash, and the Hamas-lovers have won the right to do two major marches near the DNC on Monday, when President Biden speaks, and Thursday, when Vice President Kamala Harris does. As for the protesters themselves: On the one hand, this isn’t 1968, when young men’s fears of being drafted to fight in Vietnam fueled the “Siege of Chicago.” On the other hand, the US hard left is a lot larger these days — packed with veterans of two decades of violent-as-possible “protests” in the name of a whole series of causes, really united only by a hatred of the America that is, and taught by experience that Democrat-run cities won’t hold them to account for damage they do. And if the protests don’t make major news, the movement may stand exposed as the pathetic minority it actually is: Protesters were a non-factor at last month’s GOP gathering in Milwaukee, and their passions have ebbed now that “Genocide Joe” Biden isn’t the candidate but Kamala Harris — who they have every reason to think will be far less pro-Israel. (The prospect of lefty displeasure already helped move her to skip over Pennsylvania’s Jewish governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, after all.) If they do manage to dominate the conversation, though, the Democrats only have themselves to blame.

While each state has its own rules on absentee voting and in-person early voting ahead of Election Day on November 5, some voters can begin submitting their ballots as many as 50 days out. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in the race for the finish line. The average of the latest polls have them in a virtual tie with less than three months to go. The majority of states offer multiple ways for people to vote in the upcoming election. The most common option is voting on Election Day, but there are also vote-by-mail, early in-person voting and absentee voting options depending on the state. Forty-seven states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands offer early in-person voting to all voters at some point ahead of Election Day, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes eight states and the District of Columbia which conduct their entire elections primarily by mail with some in-person options for voters who prefer it. Democrats have not even held their convention yet, and Harris and Trump are not set to come face-to-face on a debate stage until September 10, but by then, some voters could have their ballots already in hand. Both campaigns this year have encouraged supporters to vote in whichever way works best for them by Election Day after some Republicans rejected vote-by-mail options in 2020 amid criticism from Trump. It is important for voters to check the requirements and deadlines specific to voting before Election Day in their state, but here is what voters should know ahead of the very first voting getting underway: The first ballots for the election start being mailed out on September 6 in the battleground state of North Carolina. Those ballots are sent by county boards of elections to eligible voters who submitted an absentee ballot request form. Absentee voting in Alabama starts just days later on September 11. The crucial state of Pennsylvania does not have early voting, but depending on the county, some voters in the battleground state can start voting absentee or by using the mail-in ballot in person 50 days out, meaning September 16. Just a few days after that, some early voting options become available in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia on September 20. That includes early in person or vote by mail in Minnesota. In Virginia, voters can start casting ballots in person early at their local county registrar’s office. And absentee voting begins in South Dakota. New York also starts sending out ballots to some eligible voters including those in the military while West Virginia starts sending out mail ballots. Kentucky also begins sending out some absentee voters. On September 21, the first ballots start being mailed out in New Jersey, but some counties could act even sooner. Idaho and Louisiana also begin mailing some ballots. More ballots start being mailed out two days later in Maryland, Mississippi and Vermont on September 23. On September 24, mailed ballots also begin going out in Missouri. On September 26, early voting begins in Illinois which requires the option be available 40 days out from Election day. Depending on how and when they are requested, ballots also start being mailed out to some eligible voters in Florida, Michigan and North Dakota. The first ballots in Nebraska start being mailed out on September 30 to those who have requested one. Once October rolls around, 19 more states participate in early mail-in voting. 34 more states begin participating in some in-person early or absentee voting that month. All-Mail Elections Eight states and the District of Columbia conduct their entire elections primarily by mail. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington state all have mail-in elections, but each have their own timelines and rules for when voters can bring their ballots back in person should they prefer rather than putting their ballot in the mail.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe 2024 political season has been one of the most tumultuous in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Guide to the upcoming first vote in the presidential election starting next month first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/guide-to-the-upcoming-first-vote-in-the-presidential-election-starting-next-month/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-What-to-know-as-the-first-voting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:39:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":254394468,"title":"Minnesota’s lieutenant governor named one of four Democratic National Convention chairs in Chicago","text":"Elections Minnesota’s lieutenant governor named one of four Democratic National Convention chairs in Chicago Peggy Flanagan joins Sen. Cory Booker, former Gov. Landrieu and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas By Rochelle Olson The Minnesota Star Tribune August 18, 2024 at 10:39PM “It is an honor to be named co-chair of the DNC and highlight the excitement around seconds-in-command right now,” said Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, pictured with Gov. Tim Walz in July. (Glen Stubbe/The Minnesota Star Tribune) CHICAGO - Minnesota Gov. Lt. Peggy Flanagan was named Sunday as one of four co-chairs of the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC), lifting her national profile as she helps steer the four-day gathering and celebration in support of the national ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz. “I am proud of the national spotlight on Minnesota and thrilled that this week will showcase the authenticity and joy the Harris-Walz ticket has brought to our entire country,” Flanagan said in a statement. Flanagan will gavel the event in and out every evening and introduce speakers, including President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. Serving along with her will be Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas and former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who also served as Louisiana’s lieutenant governor and is the national co-chair for the Harris-Walz ticket. “It is an honor to be named co-chair of the DNC and highlight the excitement around seconds-in-command right now,” Flanagan said. With Flanagan serving as a co-chair, the convention events at Chicago’s United Center and McCormick Place will take on an even richer Minnesota flavor. Flanagan had been pursuing a prominent role in Chicago even before the vice president announced her surprise selection of Walz as her running mate Aug. 6. The Democratic National Committee, which oversees the convention every four years, announced the selection of the four chairs. “Their dedication to service, boundless optimism, and passion for progress is emblematic of our party’s values and our message to the American people,” National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said. “I’m thrilled for the nation to see our vision for the future and meet the incredible leaders who will guide the way.” Convention Chair Minyon Moore also praised the co-chairs, saying the convention will honor Biden’s leadership, celebrate Harris and Walz, and “uplift the deep bench of future leaders who will carry our party and country forward.” In the written release announcing the selection of co-chairs, the national committee said they come from the four corners of the country and represent the “breadth and diversity of the expanding bench of talent in the Democratic Party at all levels of government.” The prominent convention role may be a harbinger for Flanagan. If the Harris-Walz ticket wins in November, Flanagan would become the first indigenous female governor in the nation. She is an enrolled member of the White Earth Nation. Walz and Flanagan first won the governor’s office in 2018 and were re-elected in 2022. Throughout their six-year tenure, they have portrayed their work as a true partnership. She is regularly beside him both at public events and privately in cabinet meetings. In recent days, she has repeatedly said the job of a No. 2 is to be ready if the top spot opens. But she’s also warned that much work must be done for Harris and Walz to win in November. She and Walz steered Minnesota through a global pandemic, chaotic civil unrest and a historic 2023 legislative session that saw a passage of a laundry list of progressive laws. “I have always felt like a partner,” Flanagan said recently of her work with Walz for six years. “I have always felt that my opinions are valued. I think you can see my fingerprints all over a lot of our policies and legislative victories.” Before she was elected lieutenant governor, she represented her native St. Louis Park in the state House of Representatives. She also serves as chair of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association, where she seeks to help elect Democratic lieutenant governors across the country.","summary":"Peggy Flanagan joins Sen.

Vice President Kamala Harris has already been crowned the nominee in an online vote: Nothing will actually be decided in Chicago. Which makes the convention as much of a fake as the candidate. The show will strive to present Harris is a fresh face with new ideas, rather than a veteran Hollywood progressive pitching the same policy mix she’s embraced these last 3½ years as President Biden’s No. 2: policies that sent inflation surging, millions of illegal migrants surging into the interior, energy prices soaring and the economy slowing. The fiction is of the party “joyfully” embracing this surprise marvel, rather than falling back on her after its leaders pushed out Biden when they finally realized could only lose and drag down their Senate and House hopefuls, too. Yet she’s a less familiar face than Joe mainly because she’s been a do-nothing veep who largely avoided the media once it became clear she’d stick her foot in her mouth every time she was in front of a camera without a teleprompter. Recall the disastrous Lester Holt interview where she claimed she’d been to the border when she hadn’t (and got called out on it). Democrats are relieved that Joe’s out, but their enthusiasm for Kamala depends on keeping her a blank slate to most voters. And she’s inevitably filling in that blank — and so ending her honeymoon. She just doubled-down on the worst of Joe’s policies, promising $2 trillion in goodies that add up to little more than vote-buying: cancel billions in medical debt, “forgiving” more student loans, a $6,000 tax credit for newborns $25,000 for homebuyers. Spend, spend, spend! More of exactly what caused triggered crushing inflation in the first place. And her prescription for inflation? Stop “price-gouging,” though it’s higher wholesale costs, not corporate greed, that’s driven eye-popping costs for basic goods. Biden himself tried both the “bribe the voters” and “blame the corporations” gimmicks; Harris is barely even repackaging them. And her only other “fresh” ideas come straight from the opposition: Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” and JD Vance’s “boost the child tax credit” talk. She’s actually dropped any ideas that distinguished her from Joe (banning fracking, supporting single-payer health care, doing away with ICE) because they were losers when she ran on them four years ago, and are even worse now. But the DNC show will use pomp and circumstance to paint Harris as the second coming of Barack Obama — a symbol of hope and change. That’s why they’re rushing Joe onstage — and off, ASAP — on the first night. The big crowd-pleasers will be the Obamas the second night and Bill Clinton on the third. But Kamala Harris herself has to carry the finale, still bringing nothing new to the table — leaving undecided viewers to ask why the candidate who stands for Democrats’ future is so hopelessly less inspiring than the ones who stand for its past.","summary":"Democrats will be putting on a show at their national convention this week.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/opinion/the-dnc-will-be-another-stage-to-prop-up-dems-kamala-harris-lies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-2wamjtgal-1724019389139.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724005081&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rXOIs62d-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:35:04","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":254392574,"title":"J.D. Vance Compares Kamala Harris to Jeffrey Epstein as Donald Trump Says He’s ‘Better Looking’ Than Her","text":"Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are facing criticism after making some unorthodox comparisons involving their Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. On Sunday, Aug. 18, Vance, 40, made an appearance on Fox News Sunday, during which he heavily criticized Harris' policies and claimed that Trump's campaign is doing well, despite the GOP's concerns about Harris, 59, pulling ahead in the polls. \"Giving Kamala Harris control over inflation policy, Shannon, it’s like giving Jeffrey Epstein control over human trafficking policy,\" Vance said, speaking to host Shannon Bream, who did not respond to the comment. \"The American people are much smarter than that. They don't buy the idea that Kamala Harris represents a fresh start. She is more of the same.\" Social media users were quick to point out that while Harris has no connection to Epstein — who was charged with sex trafficking of minors in 2019 and later died in prison — Trump and third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have both been associated with Epstein in the past. \"If my running mate was in numerous photos and videos with Epstein, I'd do anything to avoid saying his name,\" one X (formerly Twitter) user wrote, criticizing Vance's comparison. Epstein and Trump were photographed together several times, and the former president stated that he was a \"terrific guy.\" Politico also reported in 2017 that Trump flew at least once on one of Epstein’s private planes and that they had each other's personal phone numbers, among other connections. While appearing on the podcast Flagrant in March, Kennedy, 70, confirmed that knew Epstein and had flown on his planes, adding: \"You don’t know these people are swamp creatures until all this stuff comes out.\" This isn't the first time a member of Trump's campaign has made a highly questioned comparison regarding Harris. On Saturday, Aug. 17, Trump himself made comments about the vice president's appearance during a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Seemingly referring to a recent Time magazine cover, which features an illustrated portrait of Harris, Trump stated: \"Don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that'll be the end of your political career, please,\" per ABC News. \"But I say that I am much better looking. I'm a better-looking person than Kamala,\" Trump said later on, per the outlet. \"They said, 'No, her biggest advantage is that she's a beautiful woman.' I'm going, 'Huh?' I never thought of that. I'm better looking than she is.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live,\" he said. \"Actually, she looked very much like our great first lady, Melania.\" \"She didn’t look like Kamala, that’s right,\" he continued. \"But of course, she’s a beautiful woman, so we’ll leave it at that.\" Trump and Harris have each agreed to debate for the first time on Sept. 10 on ABC News.","summary":"Vance is being heavily criticized for comparing Harris to Epstein, with critics citing Trump&#39;s connection to the convicted sex offender","url":"https://people.com/jd-vance-compares-kamala-harris-to-jeffrey-epstein-as-donald-trump-says-hes-better-looking-than-her-8697125","image":"https://people.com/thmb/gRqTloWbXsqQTm3vhTlH1DF1HEs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(737x242:739x244)/kamala--jd-vance-trump-081824-8f75ff5b9b084904ac1eb030d1ce5168.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:33:44","author":"Charlotte Phillipp","authors":["Charlotte Phillipp"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":254392594,"title":"Democratic National Convention to kick off in Chicago, speakers include Biden, Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton","text":"The Democratic National Convention (DNC) will kick off Monday in Chicago, one month after Republicans held their convention in Milwaukee.

The theme of the convention is “For the People, For Our Future.” While the official schedule has not yet been released, Democratic National Convention officials have confirmed that President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will speak on Monday.The theme for Monday will be “For the People,” with speakers expected to pay tribute to Biden, according to DNC officials. Former U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak on Tuesday, which will focus on the theme “A Bold Vision for the Future.”On Wednesday, under the theme “A Fight for Freedom,” former President Bill Clinton and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi of California will address the convention, according to a source familiar with the schedule. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are also expected to speak this week, DNC officials said.Mike Waltz, Kamala Harris’s running mate, is expected to take the stage on Wednesday to officially accept the vice-presidential nomination. Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination during her speech on Thursday, a night dedicated to the theme “For the Future.”Harris will arrive at the convention shortly after a bus tour through Pennsylvania over the weekend. She will also hold a rally on Tuesday in Milwaukee, the same city where Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination last month.Typically, the convention includes a roll call vote to formally nominate presidential and vice-presidential candidates. However, Harris officially cemented her status as the presidential nominee earlier this month when she earned a majority of delegates in a virtual roll call. The vote was held in early August to avoid potential issues with ballot access in Ohio. A ceremonial roll call is still expected to take place at the convention.Democratic organizers had to rework the programming entirely for the DNC after President Biden dropped out of the race in late July and endorsed Vice President Harris to replace him on the ticket.Biden’s close aide, Ajay Bhutoria, said, “We are here at the United Center, where the Democratic Party convention is going to take place starting tomorrow.

High-profile speakers are still being finalised, multiple sources told CNN, adding that a slew of actors will speak on the convention's main stage. But speculation has run rampant on two stars in particular: Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. With no major performer announced, fans of both Beyoncé and Swift are hopeful that the women – who both endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020 – will show up in Chicago.

Spokespeople for the DNC and the Harris campaign would not comment on the rumors surrounding the two megastars. CNN previously reported that Beyoncé gave Harris an early stamp of approval by signing off on the vice president using her song \"Freedom\"in Harris' campaign – so it's not implausible that Beyoncé might perform the song in person. Beyoncé has a history of performing for Democratic politicians. In 2013, she sang the national anthem at Obama's inauguration. In 2016, along with her husband, Jay-Z, she headlined a pre-election concert for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland with her backup dancers dressed in blue pantsuits to honor the woman who could have been the first female president.

The legendary fashion designer who was a Nazi agentView Gallery Swift recently fueled fan theories that she had already endorsed Harris when a woman's silhouette pictured onstage behind her appeared to depict the vice president. But CNN debunked that theory last week, reporting that the silhouette in question was one of Swift's background singers. Swift's army of fans – the Swifties – never miss a beat, and this week's convention will be no different. Even without Swift, her presence will be felt through her fans in Chicago.

Beaded bracelets are often traded between Swift fans at her concerts – inspired by the lyrics to \"You're on Your Own, Kid\" from the singer's album \"Midnights.\" There's also Swifties for Kamala, a substantial coalition of Swift fans who organically mobilised online on the night that President Joe Biden dropped out of the race endorsed Harris in July. Swift is not affiliated with the group. Irene Kim, who co-founded the group alongside fellow Swiftie Carly Long, said the Harris campaign has been in touch. \"They reached out to us asking how they can support in our initiative,\" Kim told CNN. Kim also told CNN she was invited to the Democratic convention as a content creator, along with another member of Swifties for Kamala, but said she won't be able to make it to Chicago. Earlier this month, convention organisers announced they would credential more than 200 content creators to cover the event, marking a strategic effort to reach younger voters across social media – and a recognition by the Harris campaign of how the landscape of political influencers has dramatically changed. While A-listers (especially of the stature of Swift or Beyoncé) make noise, the definition of celebrity is evolving. The high-profile attendees will be starry, but perhaps more importantly, the crowd will likely break a record for social media follower count on the convention room floor.

Certainly, the transformation and makeover of Vice President Kamala Harris from, at best, a second class politician finding difficulty in speaking plain English to Superwoman status wins that distinction even in these extraordinary conditions. Wow! How could this have happened? How could someone who was widely accused of being an inferior vice president and an extreme left wing progressive now has reversed the highly negative perceptions and bad press to become the darling of the media? Was this blind luck? Was it shrewd planning by the Democrats? Or are there other answers? About Vice President Harris, most people are not familiar with her background. She was elected San Francisco’s district attorney and twice as California’s attorney general. She was elected to the Senate in 2017 and as vice president in 2021. Democrats assert that this experience and background makes Harris an ideal candidate for president. In his initial reactions to Harris’s candidacy, Trump has stumbled badly. The brief against Harris was that she was an extreme progressive who supported radical programs to include the “Green New Deal,” defunding the police and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement); and Medicare for all. The Hill recently reported that Harris was the second most extreme liberal Democrat to serve in the Senate. But since winning the nomination, Harris has reversed course of these and other policies, moving to the center with such alacrity that would induce whiplash in most ordinary people. Regardless of the reasons for her embrace of positions she once vigorously opposed, in the days since President Joe Biden stepped down as a candidate, Harris has run an immaculate campaign. So far, not only has she not made a misstep. She has put ex-President Donald Trump on his back foot as polls show a much tighter race in which Trump is behind in several key battleground states. Remarkable does not adequately describe this political reversal of fortune. In large part and surprisingly, the depth of despair Democrats held for Biden’s chances of winning was underestimated. The sense of intense relief led to raising over $300 million and 100,000 volunteers in the first few days. And characteristics such a cackling laugh and excessive use of body language to substitute for verbal failings became assets. Harris is a very attractive campaigner. That she smiles almost promiscuously turned out to project a very positive attitude in these difficult times especially when contrasted with Trump’s glower. While she has been assailed by Republicans for refusing to answer questions, those charges have not hit home yet. Perhaps that Harris is 59, very energetic and enthusiastic is a refreshing contrast withBiden. She also has been good in using the teleprompter to pass on her sound bites and zingers that have been well received by supporters. And the huge turnout at her rallies indicates the depth of support she has received in a very short period of time. People have speculated over her choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice president. My guess is that Harris felt very comfortable and congenial with Walz. Further, unlike Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Walz has no aspirations for the presidency and thus would be a very loyal vice president. Democrats have attacked Walz as another extreme progressive and have used his twenty-four years service in the Minnesota National Guard to “Swiftboat” him as exaggerating his rank and lying about wartime service. Frankly, many people see Walz as grandfatherly and even Santa Claus-like. That alone will deflect these allegations. Teamed with Walz, Harris has picked a partner whose good nature reinforces the positive nature of her campaign. It is still early days. And with the Democratic Convention less than a week away, Harris’s momentum will probably grow. But after Labor Day, the honeymoon will be over. Some argue it is Trump’s election to lose. In his initial reactions to Harris’s candidacy, Trump has stumbled badly. His vice presidential choice, JV Vance, likewise has subjected himself to foot in mouth political disease. If Trump does not make a major course change, Harris must be seen as the favorite. The FT’s perceptive US columnist Ed Luce argues that it is Harris’ election, not Trump’s, to lose. What he means is that Harris cannot realistically depend on Trump imploding, which he may well. She will come under intense scrutiny. If she survives that, against all odds, Kamala Harris may become America’s 47th president.

While Vice President Kamala Harris has energized crowds of supporters as she prepares to accept the Democratic nomination, progressive activists maintain their mission remains the same. Activists say they learned lessons from last month’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and are predicting bigger crowds and more robust demonstrations in Chicago, a city with deep social activism roots. Who is protesting? Demonstrations are expected every day of the convention and, while their agendas vary, many activists agree an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war is the priority. Things are set to kick off Sunday on the convention’s eve with an abortion rights march along iconic Michigan Avenue. Organizer Linda Loew said even though Democrats have pushed to safeguard reproductive rights at home, the issue is international. They will march in solidarity with people everywhere who struggle for the right to control what happens to their bodies, as well as to protest the money the U.S. spends to back wars that could be used for healthcare, she said. “We believe that the billions of dollars that continue to flow to the state of Israel and the flow of weapons are having an inordinate and horrific impact, but in particular on women, children and the unborn,” she said. “All of these things are tied together.” The largest group, the Coalition to March on the DNC, has planned demonstrations on the first and last days of the convention. Organizers say they expect at least 20,000 activists, including students who protested the war on college campuses. “The people with power are going to be there,” said Liz Rathburn, a University of Illinois Chicago student organizer. “People inside the United Center are the people who are going to be deciding our foreign policy in one way or another.” Where are they protesting? Activists sued the city earlier this year, saying restrictions over where they can demonstrate violate their constitutional rights. Chicago leaders rejected their requests for permits to protest near United Center on the city’s West Side, where the convention is taking place, offering instead a lakefront park more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. Later, the city agreed to allow demonstrations at a park and a march route closer to the United Center. A federal judge recently signed off on the group’s roughly 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) route. Coalition to March on the DNC spokesman Hatem Abudayyeh said the group is pleased it won the right to protest closer to the convention, but he believes its preferred 2-mile (3-kilometer) march would be safer for larger crowds. The group is chartering buses for activists from about half a dozen states. “We’re going forward, full speed ahead,” he said. The city has designated a park about a block from United Center for a speakers’ stage. Those who sign up get 45 minutes. The Philadelphia-based Poor People’s Army, which advocates for economic justice, plans to set up at Humboldt Park on the city’s Northwest Side and will feature events with third-party candidates Jill Stein and Cornel West, plus a 3-mile (5 kilometer) march Monday to the United Center. Some group members have spent the last few weeks marching the more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from Milwaukee, where they protested during the Republican convention. “Poor and homeless people are being brutalized, with tents and encampments destroyed and bulldozed away, from San Francisco to Philadelphia to Gaza and the West Bank,” spokesperson Cheri Honkala said in a statement as the group reached Illinois. “These preventable human rights violations are being committed by Democratic and Republican leaders alike.” How does a new nominee change things? Many activists believe nothing much will change because Harris is part of the Biden administration. “The demands haven’t changed. I haven’t seen any policy changes,” said Erica Bentley, an activist with Mamas Activating Movements for Abolition and Solidarity. “If you’re going to be here, you’re going to have to listen to what’s important to us.” Pro-Palestinian protesters in Chicago have been highly visible, shutting down roads to the airport and staging sit-ins at congressional offices. Some are planning their own one-day convention Sunday with third-party candidates. “Regardless of who the nominee is, we’re marching against the Democrats and their vicious policies that have allowed Israel to kill over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza,” said Fayaani Aboma Mijana, an organizer with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression. It’s unclear if the convention will draw far-right extremists who ardently support former President Donald Trump. Secret Service Deputy Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said last week there are no known specific security threats against the convention. Is Chicago ready? The convention will draw an estimated 50,000 people to the nation’s third-largest city, including delegates, activists and journalists. The city says it has made necessary preparations with police and the Secret Service. Security will be tight, with street closures around the convention center. To combat traffic concerns, city leaders are touting a new $80 million train station steps from the United Center. They also have tried to beautify the city with freshly planted flowers and new signs. City leaders also cleared a nearby homeless encampment. Police have undergone training on constitutional policing, county courts say they are opening more space in anticipation of mass arrests and hospitals near the security zone are beefing up emergency preparedness. Authorities and leaders in the state have said people who vandalize the city or are violent will be arrested. “We’re going to make sure that people have their First Amendment rights protected, that they can do that in a safe way,” Mayor Brandon Johnson told The Associated Press in a recent interview. But some have lingering safety concerns, worried that protests could become unpredictable or devolve into chaos. Activist Hy Thurman protested and was arrested at the infamous 1968 convention. The 74-year-old now lives in Alabama but plans to come to Chicago to protest the war in Gaza. “It’s extremely personal for me,” he said. “I see parallels.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has said that he expects peaceful protests. “We intend to protect the protesters’ First Amendment rights, and also the residents of the city of Chicago and the visitors to Chicago at the same time,” Pritzker told the AP in a recent interview. __ Associated Press video journalist Melissa Perez Winder contributed to this report.

This time, there’s less suspense and more pizzazz","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Once more, with feeling! It’s been nearly two weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris officially won the Democratic presidential nomination in an online vote, the first time a nominee was named prior to a party’s convention. But the roughly 4,700 delegates charged with picking a nominee to lead the ticket did so from locations around the globe on their laptops and devices in relative isolation from one other. There was none of the pomp and fanfare that usually accompany the selection of the party’s standard-bearer. In other words, it wasn’t very fun. Democratic party leaders hope to make up for that by holding a ceremonial vote at the Democratic National Convention, which begins Monday in Chicago. Among the major agenda items will be what’s essentially a re-staging of the official presidential nomination vote from early August, mirroring the sometimes-festive, sometimes-raucous roll call votes that have been a staple of in-person party conventions for almost 200 years. The Democratic National Committee calls it a “celebratory Roll Call” and said in a statement the event would give delegates the opportunity to “celebrate the nomination” of Harris, who is the first woman of color to lead a major party presidential ticket. Here’s how it will work: When is the celebratory roll call? Delegates will gather on the convention floor on Tuesday to cast their symbolic votes. It’s the third consecutive Democratic convention when the roll call was held on a Tuesday and the first in-person roll call since 2016. For decades, Democrats held their roll call on a Wednesday, the second-to-last day of the convention. Will there be any suspense in the roll vote? It’s been more than 40 years since there’s been any question about who the nominee would be heading into a convention roll call vote. Since then, a single candidate has always emerged in each party as the presumptive nominee well before the convention, making the vote itself a foregone conclusion. That is especially true in the 2024 Democratic convention, since the ceremonial vote is non-binding and cannot undo or modify the results of the earlier, official vote to nominate Harris held over five days in the first week of August. That’s not to say there can’t be some attempt to stage a protest vote from the convention floor, but it won’t have any impact on the outcome. The result from the official nomination vote from early August was 4,563 votes for Harris and 52 for “present,” the only other option on the ballot. An additional 79 delegates did not cast votes. What will the ceremonial roll call look like? Convention organizers have indicated the ceremonial vote will follow the general format of past in-person convention roll calls, with some stylistic flourishes. State delegations will still call out their votes from the convention floor in a session presided over by the convention secretary. These presentations are usually an opportunity for each delegation to express their support for the nominee and the party, while also demonstrating their state pride. This year, each presentation will be accompanied by a song to represent the delegation, similar to a star batter’s “walk-up” song at a baseball game. A DJ will play the song on the main stage, while iconic images from each state and territory will be displayed on large screens. What’s the order of voting for the states? The convention secretary will call on state delegations to vote mostly in alphabetical order, with a few key exceptions. Voting in the celebratory roll call will begin with President Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware as a tribute to the president. The roll call vote will conclude with vice presidential nominee Tim Walz’s home state of Minnesota and Harris’ home state of California. Organizers say the modified order symbolizes the passing of the torch from Biden to Harris and the “next generation of Democratic leadership.” Modifying the order in which delegations cast their votes is a common tool that both parties have used to choreograph the roll call to allow certain states to play a heightened role in the process. Do they vote straight through? In past roll call votes at both parties’ conventions, the voting temporarily stops once the nominee surpasses the votes needed to win the nomination so that delegates mark the occasion and hold a celebration on the floor. Eventually, the voting resumes until all delegations have voted. Convention organizers have not indicated how or whether delegates would mark the milestone of Harris symbolically clinching the nomination. The distinction is somewhat moot this year, since Harris is already the nominee, based on the official vote held earlier in August. Is there a vote for the vice presidential nominee? Delegates will cast symbolic votes in the celebratory roll call for both Harris and Walz, according to a statement from convention officials, a departure from traditional roll calls. Normally, the vice presidential nominee is officially chosen by delegates through a separate procedure, often on a different day of the convention. Vice presidential nominees of both parties are usually selected by acclamation, or a voice vote by the entire convention delegation, rather than through a separate roll call vote. This separate process is usually a formality, since the identity of the presumptive vice presidential nominee is often known well before the start of the convention. This year, Walz won the vice presidential nomination in early August. After becoming the presidential nominee, Harris officially nominated Walz to be her running mate, and the convention chair declared Walz the nominee in accordance with party rules. The same procedure was used to nominate Harris as the vice presidential nominee at the 2020 convention. When do Harris and Walz accept the nominations? Harris and Walz became the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees Aug. 6. But each will symbolically accept the nominations in speeches before the full convention. Harris will speak on Thursday, in keeping with both parties’ tradition of the nominee addressing the convention on the final night. Walz will speak on Wednesday night. For decades, the Democratic vice presidential nominee addressed the convention on the final night, just before the presidential nominee. That practice ended in 1996, and the vice presidential nominee’s speech has been held on Wednesday night ever since, with the exception of 2012, when it was held on Thursday. Were roll call votes always done in-person? At the 2020 convention, then-candidate Joe Biden won the nomination after delegates cast their votes virtually through a series of elaborate live remote video presentations from every state and U.S. territory, a process created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unique and sometimes quirky nature of the remote presentations quickly became a convention favorite. This year, convention planners said in a statement on Sunday that the celebratory roll call will once again incorporate some live video elements to “showcase the diversity and beauty of America.” Why was the official nomination vote held before the convention this year? DNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call before the convention to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio’s deadline to file for the general election ballot was Aug. 7. Although the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind “ a Democratic problem.” The Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make an accommodation for the convention at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.

The vice president's plan includes tax cuts, a federal ban on price gouging by food producers and offering down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers who qualify.\"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food,\" she said. \"We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed. But our supply chains have improved and prices are still too high.\"The economy has become a key issue for voters as Harris and former President Donald Trump, the GOP's nominee, aim to address the issue. Trump, who spoke about his economic proposals at a Wednesday rally in North Carolina, said he would expand his stance on tariffs on foreign countries as he criticized Harris' proposal on Thursday, likening it to \"Maduro-esque price controls\" that have crippled the Venezuelan economy.Trump's response comes as Harris has received criticism for promising to go after price gouging as a way to tackle inflation as economists warned the plan could backfire, and likely does not address the root problems of it.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment.In an interview appearance on Sunday on NBC News' Meet The Press, Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was asked by host Kristen Welker if Harris' plan to ban price gouging is \"anything more than a gimmick?\" a reference to The Washington Post's editorial board's criticism of the plan.According to the Post's opinion column on Friday, it accused Harris of being \"less forthright\" with voters about the reasons why prices remain, adding that Harris \"squandered the moment on populist gimmicks.\"\"I think it speaks to Kamala Harris' values that she wants consumers to keep more money in their pockets...We know we got to have business growth in this country...We also know that you can't gouge and hurt the American consumer to pad your bottom line and I think there is a balance there,\" Whitmer said.Continuing to push, Welker asked, \"So you think it's a smart policy?\"Whitmer responded that she thinks \"any effort we make to keep more money in Americans' pockets is worth walking the path.\"In an interview appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, Democratic Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear was asked by host Margaret Brennan about if he knows how Harris' plan would work.\"I do because I've been an attorney general just like the vice president...this isn't about trying to price-fix. It's just making sure that the economy is operating the way it should, that this is really supply and demand,\" Beshear said.However, Brennan noted Republican criticisms that accuse Harris of advocating for price controls like in communist countries and asked Beshear to explain \"how you define what an excessive price is if you don't have a benchmark?\"Beshear responded: \"First, these are types of statutes that exist in state law...This has to be evidence-based. Ultimately, you bring an action, and you have to prove it in court.

Harris is simply saying we have to make sure that markets are properly functioning,\" the House minority leader said.Meanwhile, when asked by ABC News' This Week host Martha Raddatz if Democratic Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth is \"comfortable\" with Harris' economic proposals that could possibly add to the federal deficit, Duckworth said, \"I am comfortable with that because what we need to do is get rid of the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy...This is all about balancing things out.\"Among the biggest policy ideas floated by Trump is the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is currently due to expire in 2025.

The driver of the truck reportedly unloaded a weapon at the 21-year-old, striking him in the head, cheek, and shoulder before fleeing. He was left in critical condition, according to ABC 7 Chicago, and no suspects have been identified. Around the same time across town on the Lower West Side, a man and a woman were found shot to death in a car. Officers responding to the sound of shots encountered a group of armed suspects near the car and opened fire at them, striking one who later died at a hospital. On Saturday, a man and a woman were standing outside just before 5 a.m. when shots rang out and they were struck. The man, 53, was hit in the abdomen and later died, while the woman, 41, was hit in the ankle. A third victim, 33, was struck in the foot.

She is set to officially accept the party's nomination on Thursday, the final night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC).Newsweek has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment via email on Sunday.Battleground StatesThe CBS News/YouGov poll puts Trump and Harris in a complete deadlock in battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—with both candidates maintaining 50 percent of the vote.Battleground states play a key role in the presidential race, and polls from these states are often considered more telling than national averages, as the popular vote does not guarantee the White House. To become president, a candidate must secure 270 Electoral College votes, and battleground states can swing the election to either candidate.Updates to CBS News' statistic model from the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, show the candidates completely tied at 50 percent in Pennsylvania and 49 percent in Wisconsin.It shows Trump leading by a margin of 1 percentage point in Arizona, 50 percent to Harris' 49 percent, and 2 percentage points in Georgia and North Carolina, 50 percent to 48 percent.On the other hand, the model shows Harris leading in Nebraska, 50 percent to Trump's 47 percent, Nevada with 50 percent to Trump's 48 percent, and Michigan by 49 percent to 48 percent.A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters in battleground states shows Harris leading Trump in North Carolina and Arizona, while Trump holds a lead over Harris in Nevada and Georgia. In a survey of 655 likely voters in North Carolina conducted between August 9 and 14, it showed Harris leading Trump 49 to 47 percent. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points in this state poll.In Arizona, among 677 likely voters from August 8 to 15, Harris garnered 50 percent of the vote to Trump's 45 percent. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points in the Arizona state poll.In Nevada, Trump edged ahead by 1 percentage point among 661 likely voters from August 9 to 14, leading Harris 48 to 47 percent. The state poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.Trump had the greatest margin in Georgia, with a poll of 661 likely voters found 50 percent would vote for Trump and 46 percent for Harris. The poll, conducted between August 9 and 14 has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.The Trump campaign issued a press memo in response to the Times/Siena College poll, which said its \"once again, a perfect example of how wildly inaccurate recalled 2020 vote between President Trump and Joe Biden is being used to create a phony lead for Kamala Harris.\"Economy and InflationThe CBS News poll shows that 83 percent of voters consider the economy a \"major factor\" in their decision-making for the upcoming election, with inflation as the second most popular, at 76 percent. Voters can identify multiple issues as major factors in their voting decision.When ask if voters thought \"the price you pay for food and groceries\" will change under Harris or Trump, 48 percent said they will go up under Harris, whereas 37 percent said they would increase under Trump. The poll was largely conducted before Harris outlined her economic plan to ban price-gouging on groceries during a campaign speech Friday.More than half of the voters believe that Harris' decision as vice president have impacted the economy in some way, with 24 percent indicating \"a lot\" and 33 percent \"some.\"Among those voting for Trump, 56 percent selected the economy as a major factor, and 61 percent said inflation.Immigration and the Southern BorderVoters overwhelmingly believe Trump is more likely to reduce border crossings compared to Harris if reelected as president. When asked if their policies would increase border crossings, 48 percent of voters said they expect an increase if Harris wins, while 8 percent said the same for Trump. Conversely, 72 percent believe Trump would decrease border crossings if elected, while 21 percent think Harris would.Nearly a third of voters believe that Harris had \"a lot\" to do with the current border situation, while 28 percent believe she had some impact.Among survey respondents who plan to vote for Trump, 76 percent consider the U.S.-Mexico border a major factor in their decision. In contrast, only 24 percent of those who said they would vote for Harris view it as a major factor.Polling AveragesNationally, the CBS News poll showed Harris leading Trump among likely voters, 51 to 48 percent.Several other national polls have put Harris in the lead, while a survey released Thursday by conservative pollster Rasmussen Reports shows Trump leading Harris by 4 percentage points among likely voters, 49 to 45 percent.The Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,885 likely voters was conducted on August 8 and between August 11 and 14. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.As of Sunday, several national aggregate polls have also placed Harris in the lead, including FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, The New York Times, and The Hill, with margins ranging from 1 to 2.6 percentage points.Battleground state aggregators have also inched towards Harris, with the Times aggregate polls showing Harris only behind in Georgia and tied in Arizona, otherwise leading Trump.Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin aggregate puts Harris ahead in Arizona but slipping behind Trump in Nevada and Georgia.","summary":"A poll released on Sunday shows that Trump leads among voters who believe the economy and the U.S.-Mexico border are major factors in their voting decision.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-good-signs-new-poll-amid-kamala-harris-surge-1940880","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2452328/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 22:09:49","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":254391972,"title":"Chicago to host NAACP convention in 2026","text":"The NAACP will bring its 117th annual convention to Chicago in 2026, the organization announced Sunday.

Vance came out swinging against Kamala Harris on Sunday. While speaking with Fox News’ Shannon Bream, the Republican vice presidential candidate insisted, “Giving Kamala Harris control over inflation policy, Shannon, it’s like giving Jeffrey Epstein control over human trafficking policy. The American people are much smarter than that.” “They don’t buy the idea that Kamala Harris represents a fresh start,” he continued. “She is more of the same. It is doubling down on the failed policies of the Harris administration to give Kamala Harris a promotion rather than to fire her, which is what I think most Americans are going to do in November.” The Trump-Vance campaign featured scrutiny recently for using Epstein’s former plane, which many used as an occasion to bring up Trump’s own connections with the notorious sex trafficker while Epstein was still alive. Vance had attempted to blame the vice president for domestic inflation and added that she hasn’t done anything about the problem “for the past 1,300 days.” His reference to “the failed policies of the Harris administration” appeared to be an attempt to implicate her in any perceived failures of the sitting president, Joe Biden, despite the vice president traditionally not being in a position to exert a significant amount of power. The GOP vice presidential candidate also insisted that the Trump/Vance ticket is “going to be in the right place come November” and that they are unbothered by poll numbers showing Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz surging ahead. “We can’t worry about polls, we have to run through the finish line and encourage everybody to get out there and vote. But our message is going to be very simple: If you wanna get back to the peace and prosperity, the rising take-home pay, Donald Trump delivered it once and he can do it again,” Vance argued. Trump inherited a better economy from his predecessor, President Barack Obama, than Biden did from Trump himself. It’s also true that Trump was at the helm of the United States during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing serious struggles for the U.S. economy. Trump claimed that following those months, the economic recovery experienced by the U.S. was “the biggest in the history of our country by almost triple…that’s bigger than any nation” — a statement that proved false when the nation’s recovery was compared to that of the Eurozone as a whole, as well as to Italy and Germany’s own recovery efforts. Vance also accused “the media” of using “fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters.” He added, “I’m telling you, every single person who’s watching this, the Trump campaign is in a very, very good spot.” It is unclear which if any specific “fake polls” Vance was speaking about, but he seemed to be repeating a claim Trump made repeatedly while running against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2018, a study out of Ohio State University stated that “fake news” may have helped Trump win that election. The study, which was not peer-reviewed, concluded that 4% of Obama’s supporters from the 2012 election did not vote for Clinton due to misinformation they had read. Those voters “were 3.9 times more likely to defect from the Democratic ticket in 2016 than those who believed none of these false claims, after taking into account all of these other factors,” researchers wrote.

Vance in the video above.","summary":"He says the vice president has done little to address the American economy \"for the past 1,300 days\" as VP\n\n\nThe post JD Vance Compares Kamala Harris to Jeffrey Epstein in Inflation Policy Attack | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jd-vance-compares-kamala-harris-to-jeffrey-epstein/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vance-harris-economy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 21:46:29","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":254391390,"title":"Trumpworld’s DNC counter-programming plans revealed","text":"Republicans will join the swathes of Democrats descending on Chicago this week as Trumpworld tries to find a way to blunt Kamala Harris's momentum. As the four-day Democratic National Convention gets under way in the Windy City, Donald Trump and his allies are making plans for counter-programming to the event. Trump's Chicago hotel will become the epicenter of the Republican world as his allies including Florida Senator Rick Scott and his colleague in the House, Byron Donalds, are among those who will lead the GOP's efforts to counter-program the convention. Themes of the four-day event at the Trump hotel will include immigration, crime and the economy, and will mirror issues being spoken about at the DNC in order to drive home the Republican party’s message. Trump campaign spokespeople Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita issued a statement on Sunday: “At the DNC, Kamala Harris will hide behind celebrities because everyday families know that she has been an absolute disaster for our nation, and real Americans are worse off now than four years ago. “Harris has failed to answer media questions for 28 days because she can’t explain away her record of supporting policies that cause inflation, bans on private health insurance, destroying American energy, and higher taxes.” They went on to note that Trump and running mate JD Vance will host rallies and smaller “messaging events” around the country as Democrats are concentrated in Chicago. Trump’s schedule for the week is more packed than it has been in months, with events featuring him and Vance every day. He’ll cap off the week Friday with events in Arizona and Nevada. “As they meet Americans where they are in battleground states across the country, President Trump and Senator Vance will remind voters that under their leadership, we can end inflation, protect our communities from violent criminals, secure the border, and Make America Great Again,” said LaCivita and Wiles. The Independent has reached out to the DNC for a response. It’s an attempt by the former president to push Harris out of the spotlight as her party’s convention is set to be a four-day cheerleading session highlighting Democratic victories over the past three years while also portraying Trump himself as a threat to democracy and abortion rights. Since Biden dropped out of the race, Democrats have seen a surge in volunteers. Harris’s campaign raised a staggering $310m in July despite Biden being the nominee for much of the month; Trump’s, by comparison, raised $139m in the same period. The former president has watched and appeared to grow increasingly annoyed as Harris has rebounded in the polls since entering the race, putting swing states back into close contention and throwing Republicans onto the defense. Another bump in the polls caused by the DNC, should it go unanswered by Republicans, could put Harris at an advantage in those key battleground states. The former president shook up his campaign last week and brought onboard 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in a senior advisory role reportedly above his de facto campaign managers Wiles and LaCivita, amid reports that Trump is nostalgic for his lean but winning 2016 operation.","summary":"Republicans are convening at Trump’s hotel in Chicago for events highlighting border security issues, inflation and crime – while Kamala Harris takes center stage at the DNC","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-dnc-events-vance-b2598146.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/18/22/GettyImages-2166903102.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UxKpHD1v-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-18 21:43:02","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":254393732,"title":"Kamala Harris Opposed 2017 Trump Tax Cuts, Which Doubled Child Tax Credit","text":"The tax plan approved tonight by my Republican colleagues is shameful.

Amplify myths about Harris","text":"An unrelentingly bitter US presidential race, defined by name-calling, attack ads and stunted campaigning, has so far left little space for discussion about climate change, despite the world experiencing unprecedented heat and disasters. But with Donald Trump now facing Kamala Harris rather than Joe Biden, the Republican has used recent rallies to echo misinformation and memes on X, including fictional bans on red meat and gas stoves. The aim? To undermine Harris. “Kamala called for slashing consumption of red meat to fight climate change,” Trump said during a July 27 rally in the state of Minnesota. The Democratic nominee would “get rid of all cows … and I guess that at some point, they’ll go after the humans,” the former president added, echoing “depopulation” conspiracy theories that have plagued Harris in right-wing spaces since she waded into the topic of “climate anxiety” among younger generations at a White House press conference last year. J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate, amplified the claims in an August 3 speech in Atlanta, saying Harris “wants to take away your gas stoves, she even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat.” Such climate myths took on a life of their own on X, encouraged by conservative commentators in swing states and MAGA accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. However, Harris made no such campaign promise. She has cooked with a gas stove herself and noted in a 2019 environmental panel that she “love(s) cheeseburgers from time to time,” although she has supported the idea of updating dietary guidelines. “A tried-and-true tactic in politics is to misrepresent your opponent’s positions to make them sound extreme and unacceptable. Trump and Vance are doing exactly that with Vice President Harris’s positions on climate action,” said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. The false narratives add onto Trump and Vance’s criticism of the vice president’s stance on issues such as fracking, a violently disruptive underground oil and gas extraction technique. Harris initially advocated banning the practice in 2019 before becoming Biden’s running mate in 2020. She has more recently sought to avoid questions about it, particularly in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania where fracking is big business. Still, climate activists have mostly saluted Harris, whose environmental stance has historically been to the left of the president — notably in going after oil companies as California attorney general. The Biden administration also pushed a renewable energy shift in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in reducing carbon pollution in US history.","summary":"An unrelentingly bitter US presidential race, defined by name-calling, attack ads and stunted campaigning, has so far left little space for discussion about climate change, despite the world experiencing unprecedented heat and disasters.

Vice President Harris and Walz, the governor of Minnesota, were joined by their spouses, Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz, as they made their first stop visiting local volunteers making phone calls at a campaign office in the borough of Rochester, in Beaver County. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, won the county in 2020. But the Democrats are riding on renewed enthusiasm after President Joe Biden exactly four weeks ago dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris to replace him on the ticket. Harris, while speaking to a group of supporters and volunteers outside the campaign office, spoke about strength and leadership. She appeared to make a veiled reference to Trump, who is known for his pugilistic style and projection of a strongman image, when she said the “real and true measure of a strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,\" rather than who they beat down. “Anybody who is about beating down other people is a coward,” she yelled, drawing cheers and applause. “This is what strength looks like.” Walz in his remarks seemed to assume the role of his former job coaching high school football and told the volunteers: “Let’s leave it all on the field. Let’s get this thing done.” Southwestern Pennsylvania is a critical part of a key battleground state that has long commanded the attention of presidential candidates. The state voted for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020. Both Harris and Trump are vying to see who can put Pennsylvania in their column on Nov. 5. Most polls, including from the New York Times/Siena College and Fox News, find Harris and Trump locked in a tight race statewide. Trump held a rally Saturday in Wilkes-Barre in the northeastern part of the state, following his earlier rallies in July in Harrisburg and Butler, where he survived an assassination attempt. The bus tour marks Harris' eighth trip to Pennsylvania this year, and her second this month. The vice president chose to make her first joint appearance with Walz on the ticket in Philadelphia on Aug. 6. On Sunday, they arrived with their spouses earlier at Pittsburgh International Airport and greeted supporters. The foursome held hands and raised their arms together before cheering supporters who held campaign signs. They then boarded a bright blue bus that says “Harris Walz” in big white letters as they set off to make stops in the Pittsburgh area to glad-hand with voters. In Rochester, Harris, Walz and their spouses spent a few minutes sitting at tables with volunteers and making phone calls to line up support. “79 days to go, Hannah,” Harris said while on the phone. At another point while making calls, she said, “We’re all in this together.” Walz hung up his phone and said of the caller, “He’s all in,” and gave a thumbs up. He made another call and asked the person on the line, “How are you feeling? What are you hearing from folks?” Kristin Kanthak, associate professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh, said Pennsylvania “is a state that traditionally has been super important, but southwestern Pennsylvania has been really kind of the battleground part of the battleground state.” Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, is a diverse county with urban, suburban and rural areas, and a lot of people there haven't decided how they will vote, she said. “It makes sense to come here and ask for votes because there are votes up for grabs here,” Kanthak said of Harris. “It’s not just about turning out your base. It’s about having an opportunity to speak to truly undecided voters.” In the 2020 race, Biden won Allegheny County with 60% of the vote, while Trump won neighboring Beaver County, which includes Rochester, with about 58% of the vote. After Trump’s surprise win in the state in 2016, Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 — and, in so doing, won the White House — in part by running up his vote totals in heavily Democratic Pittsburgh, the state’s second-largest city and the county seat of Allegheny County. Biden assiduously courted the area’s blue-collar labor unions, kicking off his 2020 presidential campaign at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh by declaring, “I am a union man.” As president, he opposed the acquisition of Pittsburgh’s storied U.S. Steel by a Japanese company, saying it “should remain totally American,” and enacted steeper tariffs on Chinese steel. Trump, who is counting on strong turnout from his base of white, working-class voters, is not conceding the area. The counties around Pittsburgh have shifted from Democrat to Republican in recent presidential contests, delivering for Trump in both of his earlier runs. Trump has also embraced protectionist trade policies and insists he is pro-worker. His vow to increase U.S. energy production and “drill, baby, drill” has resonated in southwestern Pennsylvania blue-collar counties like Washington, where a natural gas drilling boom has helped make Pennsylvania the nation’s No. 2 producer after Texas. Harris once wanted to ban fracking, an oil and gas extraction process, before recently disavowing her earlier position. Dana Brown, director of Chatham University's Pennsylvania Center for Women & Politics, said in an interview that Harris will use the bus trip to spin up local media coverage as well as reach out to voters in the state's southwestern region “while she still has a great deal of momentum at her back.\" “She is going to garner a lot of that free media attention,” Brown said. “I believe their hope ... is to keep that momentum up and focused on her and less so on her opponent.” Bus tours have become a staple of political campaigns partly because of the free media coverage they generate. Such trips get the candidates out of their power suits and out of Washington so they can travel the country and score face time with voters in small venues like diners and mom-and-pop shops. Biden rolled across Iowa on an eight-day bus tour he dubbed “No Malarkey\" in December 2019. During his 2012 reelection campaign, President Barack Obama traveled though small-town Ohio on his “Betting on America” bus tour. “It's always fun just being out of Washington, and for me to be able to interact with folks is wonderful,” Obama said at one stop. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton also traveled by bus when they campaigned for a second term. The Democratic National Convention opens Monday. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The allegations came at a time Melania is missing from the public eye while her husband is running the presidential campaign against Kamala Harris. Stephanie used to work at Vogue and started organizing Met Galas. They developed a remarkable friendship with regular monthly lunches and other events but eventually the fell apart and Stephanie published the book in 2020 as Trump lost the election. Stephanie and Melania became friends when Donald Trump asked Vogue's Anna Wintour to help Melania introduce to New York society -- before their Marriage. Melania was presented at the 2004 Met Gala and their friendship continued as Melania got married to Donald, became mother to Barron. As Donald Trump became the president, Stephanie joined Melania's team as a senior advisor to the first lady. In her tell-all book, she exposed Melania and Trump's marriage as sham and said that the relationship was created by the TV executives for Donald Trump's The Apprentice. After Stephanie and Melania's public fallout, Trump said Stephanie was a \"total airhead\" who was dumped by Melania years ago for being a publicity seeker. \"I find it baffling & shocking Trump hired 'an airhead' to produce 18 Trump inaugural events acting as Melania's senior advisor....'Airhead,' I'm not. Melania didn't have the chance to 'dump me.' I QUIT!

Joe Manchin of West Virginia had long been one of the more conservative Democrats in the upper chamber.Manchin, who often laments the once-unshakable level of bipartisanship that was an earlier hallmark of the Senate, previously floated running for president — while criticizing President Joe Biden for some of his more left-leaning policies.After Biden stepped aside as the Democratic presidential nominee last month, Manchin briefly opened the door for a potential campaign.But Vice President Kamala Harris quickly secured support from Democratic leaders, and Manchin shut down the campaign idea.Within days, Harris' political stock soared and her campaign boasted a surge in enthusiasm and millions of dollars in donations.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Manchin praised his former Senate colleague.\"I've been surprised. She's done some good things,\" Manchin said of Harris' early moves as the presumptive Democratic nominee.\"She and I sat on the Intelligence Committee for one year together, side by side. So we were very close, worked well together,\" he continued. \"She's very bright, very smart.\"Manchin said Harris — who had a distinctly liberal legislative record when she served in the Senate — has energized the campaign.\"What she's been able to do in three weeks has been amazing. I think she's put a vivacious energy to this campaign,\" he said. \"[S]he's got people fired up.\"Manchin also complimented Harris' shift on fracking. As a 2020 presidential candidate, Harris backed a ban on the oil and gas drilling technique. But her campaign said late last month that she would not support a fracking ban.\"[N]ow, facing this leadership as one of the most powerful people in the world, she's looking at where we stand on energy, and I'm happy for that,\" Manchin said.The senator, who has served in the upper chamber since 2010, declined to run for reelection in November.","summary":"Sen.

Yet Trump retains the upper hand on the two top-cited election issues in the poll -- the overall economy and inflation -- and also leads on a third -- immigration -- keeping the race a closely contested one. Among all adults -- relevant since there's plenty of time to register -- Harris and Gov. Tim Walz lead Trump and Sen. JD Vance by 50%-45%. Among those now registered to vote, it's 49%-45%, a slight Harris advantage given sampling tolerances. And Harris has a 6-point lead among likely voters, 51%-45%. Roughly echoing these results, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, also finds that more people see Harris as qualified for the job, 53%, than say the same about Trump, 47%. See PDF for full results. In a five-way matchup, the poll finds Harris/Walz and Trump/Vance at 47%-44% among the general public and registered voters alike, and 49%-45% among likely voters. None of these is a statistically significant difference, suggesting the Democrats would prefer a two-way race. That said, among all adults, support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (and his running mate Nicole Shanahan) is down to 5%, from a peak of 12% in April. Cornel West/Melina Abdullah have 1%, as does Jill Stein of the Green Party. These candidates' ballot access is to be determined; per ABC News estimates, Kennedy currently is on the ballot in 21 states, Stein in 20 and West in eight. Candidate attributes Underlying shifts from July are dramatic, particularly in views of some candidate attributes. There also are sharp increases in Democrats' satisfaction with the presidential matchup and enthusiasm for their candidate. Among all adults, Harris leads on two measures on which Biden lagged badly. Americans by a wide 56%-26% pick her over Trump as having the physical health to serve effectively as president, reversing Trump's 31-point lead over Biden on this attribute last month. And Harris leads Trump by 9 percentage points in being seen as having the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively, erasing a 30-point Trump lead over Biden on this measure. Harris also leads Trump by 15 points on honesty and trustworthiness and by 6 points in better-representing people's personal values, both roughly matching Biden's position before he left the race. And she leads Trump by 7 points in empathy -- understanding the problems of people like you -- an important gauge on which Biden and Trump were essentially even in July. There's another characteristic particular to Harris: Thirty-eight percent of Americans say that having a woman serve as president would be a good thing for the country, far more than the 14% who see it as a bad thing. The rest, 47%, say it makes no difference. (Forty percent of women call a woman president a good thing, as do 35% of men.) Strength/enthusiasm In another sharp change, 60% of Harris' backers support her strongly, matching Trump's strong support and compared with just 34% strong support for Biden last month. Further, 50% overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied if Harris were elected, compared with 36% who said that about Biden in early 2023, even before concerns about his cognitive age grew. Just among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, enthusiasm or satisfaction with Harris as their candidate is 19 points higher than Biden's at that time, at 91% versus 72%. Forty-five percent overall say they'd be enthusiastic or satisfied with a Trump victory, about the same as in early 2023 (43%). It's 85% among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, up 6 points. To be sure, fewer than half of Americans, 44%, are satisfied with a Harris-Trump matchup, with 55% dissatisfied. But that's sharply improved from views on a Biden-Trump race, with which just 28% were satisfied, 71% dissatisfied, last month. It's also the case that Harris' choice of Walz as her running mate has been better received than Trump's selection of Vance, as reported Friday. Key issues At the same time, Trump leads Harris by 9 points in trust to handle the economy and inflation alike, roughly maintaining his position on these issues against Biden last month. More than 85% of adults rate both of these as highly important in their vote for president, tops among 11 issues tested. Trump also leads Harris, by 10 points, in trust to handle the immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, versus a 14-point Trump lead in July. But other issues surpass immigration in importance, including health care, on which Harris leads Trump by 7 points; protecting American democracy, Harris +6; and crime and safety, on which they're close. Notably, the gap on crime and safety has narrowed from a Trump lead, +7 points, in July, to Trump +3 points now, not a significant gap. And Harris leads by 5 points in trust to handle gun violence, compared with a virtual tie for Biden (+1) against Trump in July. Both shifts may reflect Harris' credentials as a former prosecutor. Harris also leads, by 5 points, in trust to handle appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court. Among items lower on the importance list, she leads Trump by 12 points in trust to handle abortion and 14 points to handle race relations, while he's +5 points on handling the Israel/Hamas war (down from +9 against Biden). Candidate influence While Trump leads in trust to handle the economy and immigration, most people give Harris at least somewhat of a pass on the Biden administration's policies on both issues. The public by about a 2-1 margin, 64%-33%, thinks Harris had limited influence on Biden's economic policies, and by 57%-39% says the same about her influence on immigration policies. Economic views matter, given the issue's importance. With 72% of Americans rating the economy negatively, Trump is sure to seek to pin blame on Harris, and she to try to avoid it. Currently, he leads by 61%-33% among those who rate the economy negatively; she, by 89%-8% among those who rate it positively. Wednesday's new inflation figure, a low since early 2021, may offer help to Harris, but prices and interest rates still have risen sharply on the Biden/Harris watch, and recession fears are afoot. Trump may face more of a challenge on the abortion issue. Although fewer rate it as highly important, it's also the case that Americans by 56%-39% think Trump had substantial influence in bringing about the U.S. Supreme Court decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion -- a decision the public opposes by 62%-35%. Supporters of the abortion ruling support Trump by 81%-13%, but the majority that opposes it supports Harris, by 72%-25%. Indeed, among people who think Trump had a larger role in bringing about the abortion ruling, Harris leads, 69%-28%. Among those who think Trump had less influence, that flips to a 73%-22% Trump lead. Vote-preference gaps based on views of Harris' influence on economic and immigration policy are far less pronounced, and run in the opposite direction. She does 10 points better with people who think she's had more influence on economic policy, and 9 points better among those who think she had more influence on immigration policy, both compared with those who think she's had less influence. Vote groups Some of the changes among groups from Biden to Harris are striking. Among them: Independents went from +4 points for Trump in July to +11 Harris now, a 15-point swing. Classic swing voters, independents have gone with the winner in nine of the last 12 presidential elections, all but those in 2012, 2004 and 1976.People younger than age 40 have moved from +2 Biden in July to +20 for Harris now, an 18-point swing.Women age 18-29 split about evenly (Trump +2) in July; now they favor Harris by 23 points, a 25-point swing in this group. It's almost as big, an 18-point swing to Harris, among women age 30 to 49. Harris also has improved from Biden's score among men age 18-29, from Biden +1 in July to Harris +14 now, a 13-point swing.Support from Black people has swung by 12 points in Harris' direction, from +60 for Biden in July to +72 for Harris now. Her gain is about equal among Black men and Black women alike. (Harris is a Black and South Asian person. The sample size of Asians in this survey is too small for a vote-preference estimate, but a combination of the last two surveys with a Harris-Trump matchup, the first done before Biden withdrew, finds Harris ahead of Trump among Asians by 65%-32%.)Harris has seen an 8-point swing among Hispanic people. That's occurred mostly among Hispanic women, a 17-point swing from +2 for Trump in July to +15 for Harris now.In the middle-income range, people with household incomes from $50,000 to $99,999 have gone from Trump +7 in July to Harris +8 now, a 15-point shift. Looking ahead Some potential voters may be persuadable in the campaign ahead. Among people who don't currently support Trump, 12% say they'd consider voting for him. Among those who don't now support Harris, an almost equal number, 11%, say they'd consider her. The question is how the candidates attract new supporters while keeping their bases motivated. Appeals on ideological lines seem thin: While 46% see Harris as too liberal, as Trump consistently charges, almost as many, 42%, see him as too conservative. Another challenging line is Trump's contention that the Democratic Party encouraged the sentiment that led to an attempt on his life. Instead, more Americans blame the Republican Party for the risk of politically motivated violence in this country, 37%, than blame the Democrats, 26%; an additional 25% blame both equally. Best for Trump is his advantage on the economy and Harris' association with Biden, who labors under a 37%-55% job approval rating, essentially steady the past 15 months. Indeed, Harris' own rating for handling her job as vice president is just 39%-49%. But Trump's retrospective rating also is underwater, 44%-49%. And at this stage, at least, Harris possesses one potentially crucial election commodity: momentum. Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel Aug. 9-13, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,336 adults. Partisan divisions are 29%-29%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

Instead, more Americans blame the Republican Party for the risk of politically motivated violence in this country, 37%, than blame the Democrats, 26%; an additional 25% blame both equally. Best for Trump is his advantage on the economy and Harris' association with Biden, who labors under a 37%-55% job approval rating, essentially steady the past 15 months. Indeed, Harris' own rating for handling her job as vice president is just 39%-49%. But Trump's retrospective rating also is underwater, 44%-49%. And at this stage, at least, Harris possesses one potentially crucial election commodity: momentum.

On Wednesday and Thursday night, NPR's politics team will be hosting coverage with analysis throughout the evening. The history of the DNC in Chicago Chicago has hosted a number of party conventions — most recently the DNC in 1996, and perhaps most notably the DNC in 1968. As NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving puts it, \"Chicago ‘68 has been repeatedly conjured as the epitome of disaster like the sinking of the Titanic, or the stock market crash of ‘29.\" At the time, President Lyndon Johnson had announced he was not running for re-election, and Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. Vice President Hubert Humphrey was then left to battle it out for the nomination with anti-war Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Huge crowds of demonstrators came to Chicago in 1968 for the DNC, protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, pushing for racial equality and an end to poverty. Protestors and police ended up clashing, with violent images on TV for the nation to see. But beyond the convention location, there have been a number of echoes of 1968 playing out in 2024. (And not just in the political world: Both years also saw new Planet of the Apes movies, Summer Olympics and U.S. moon missions, as NPR's Rachel Treisman notes.) In April, historian Keith Orejel summed it up in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"I mean ok, Columbia has unrest and there's widespread anti-war activism, that might be coincidence. But there is a guy named Robert Kennedy running for president and the [Democratic National Convention] is in Chicago. Like is this a bit?\" A few months later we had another 1968 parallel: President Biden announced he will not be seeking the nomination. But while the shadow of 1968 looms over this week's convention, especially as it relates to protesters and security, the convention itself is more of a formality than it was in 1968 — we know who is going to be the nominee. ➡️ It's official: Kamala Harris becomes Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee ➡️ Harris taps Minnesota Gov.

Trump pulled off his win by narrowly winning in key battleground states, flipping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania red for the first time since the 1980s. Florida, which had gone for former President Barack Obama in 2008 and in 2012, also flipped red for Trump.At the same time, Clinton did win the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes—a margin of 2.1 points. However, as the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population, determines the election's outcome, her national vote lead didn't matter. Trump's win was widely viewed as an upset victory and led many to question what went wrong with the polls.\"You know, in 2016, I was polling low because people didn't want to say who they're voting for. I don't know if that's supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is what it is. And we did very well in 2016,\" Trump told reporters during a press conference at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey on Thursday.Newsweek reached out to the Harris campaign via email for comment on Sunday. The Trump campaign, when reached for comment, emailed Newsweek polling data from conservative polling company Rasmussen Reports showing the former president leading the vice president by 4 points nationally.But how do the polls in 2024 actually compare to 2016? Here's a closer look at where things stood then versus now.National Polling 2016 vs. 2024Exactly eight years ago on August 18, 2016, polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight, which became part of ABC News in 2018, showed Clinton with a substantial national polling lead over Trump. The polling average showed the Democratic candidate with 43.6 percent support compared to Trump's 36.8 percent—a lead of 6.8 points for Clinton.Comparatively, Harris is only 2.6 points ahead of Trump nationally in FiveThirtyEight's current average as of Sunday afternoon. The Democrat has the backing of 46.4 percent of voters while the Republican has the support of 43.8 percent. Notably, Harris' national lead is smaller than Clinton's on the same day in 2016, although the vice president's overall support appears to be a little higher.Michigan Polling 2016 vs. 2024Clinton was substantially ahead of Trump in Michigan at this point in 2016, according to FiveThirtyEight's average. The average showed Clinton more than 11 points ahead of Trump on August 18, 2016.Comparatively, Harris is just 2.6 points ahead in the current average. Trump has the support of 43.4 percent of Michiganders while Harris has the backing of 46 percent as of Sunday.Clinton went on to lose Michigan by just 0.23 percent in 2016. Trump carried the Midwestern state by 47.5 percent compared to her 47.27 percent. The margin was less than 11,000 votes.Pennsylvania Polling 2016 vs. 2024Trump was down substantially in Pennsylvania in August 2016 as well. Exactly eight years ago, the FiveThirtyEight's polling average showed the Republican with 41.2 percent and Clinton ahead by 8.3 points at 49.5 percent.As of Sunday, FiveThirtyEight has Harris narrowly ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania by 1.4 points. The vice president has the support of 46.2 percent of Pennsylvania voters while the former president is backed by 44.8 percent.Trump won Pennsylvania by 0.72 percent in 2016. He secured 48.18 percent of the state's voters compared to Clinton's 47.46 percent. The margin was just over 44,000 votes.Wisconsin Polls 2016 vs. 2024Similar to Michigan, Clinton was leading Trump by more than 11 points in FiveThirtyEight's Wisconsin average eight years ago today. The average had the Democrat at 50.7 percent and the Republican at 39.4 percent.Harris currently is ahead of Trump by about 3 points in Wisconsin. The FiveThirtyEight average has the vice president with the backing of 47.2 percent of Wisconsin voters compared to 44.2 percent that back Trump.Clinton lost in Wisconsin by 0.77 percent, or just under 23,000 votes. The Democrat won 46.45 of the vote in the state and the Republican won 47.22 percent.Florida Polls 2016 vs. 2024Back in 2016, Clinton was more than 5 points ahead of Trump in Florida at this point in the race, according to FiveThirtyEight's average. The Democrat had the backing of 48.7 percent of Floridians and the Republican was supported by 43.2 percent.The polling average for Florida is nearly reversed as of Sunday, with Trump in the lead by 4.6 points. The former president leads Harris with 47.9 percent of the Southern state's voters to her 43.3 percent.Trump won Florida by 1.2 points in 2016. He carried the state with 49.02 percent of the vote while Clinton had 47.82 percent. The margin was nearly 113,000 votes.Will the Polls Be Wrong Again?Analysts have offered multiple theories for what went wrong with the polling in 2016. As Trump mentioned on Thursday, some have suggested that voters did not admit to pollsters that they planned to vote for the Republican. Others have suggested that the polls were weighted badly, giving certain demographics too much influence.Some Trump voters may also have been less likely to respond to surveys. An April 2021 report from the Pew Research Center explains part of why this could be the case.\"Achieving proper representation of Republicans is more difficult than it used to be. Survey participation has long been linked to individuals' levels of education and social trust. Now that the GOP is doing better attracting voters with lower levels of education and, according to some analysts, doing better than in the past attracting low trust adults, Republican participation in surveys is waning, increasing reliance on weighting as a corrective,\" the report said.Many pollsters believe they've made significant improvements and corrections compared to 2016. However, the polls were notably off in 2020 as well, underestimating support for Trump. Although they largely showed President Joe Biden winning nationally and in key battleground states, the margins were closer than the polls suggested.","summary":"\"In 2016, I was polling low because people didn't want to say who they're voting for,\" former President Donald Trump said last week.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polling-compared-hillary-clintons-2016-1940839","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2452319/clinton-trump-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 21:08:10","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":254392824,"title":"Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend","text":"Kamala Harris’ big week As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago on Monday, the party will be looking to introduce Kamala Harris to the many Americans who still know little about her, with just 11 weeks until Election Day. A mad scramble is underway to roll out her biography as Trump works to villainize her. The DNC speakers this week will include former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former first lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On Monday night, President Joe Biden will deliver a speech at the event that just weeks ago was expected to center on his re-election bid, but has been rapidly reshaped around his vice president’s own candidacy. Progressives meanwhile are homing in on a a more pragmatic, economy-focused policy agenda like raising the minimum wage and child care funding in place of sky-high ambitions like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal as they prepare for a potential Harris presidency. Chicago has been bracing for thousands of protesters to show up outside the convention, amid concerns about a potential confrontation with police. Mayor Brandon Johnson said Sunday, “Our local police department, along with the local police agencies as well as the Secret Service, we are ready for this convention.” As Israel strikes Gaza, Blinken heads to region for cease-fire talks Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to the Middle East on Sunday to try to seal a cease-fire deal after months of contentious negotiations. The U.S. and fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar said they were closing in on a deal after two days of talks in Doha, with American and Israeli officials expressing cautious optimism. But Hamas has signaled resistance to what it says are new demands by Israel, and the long-running talks have repeatedly stalled. An Israeli delegation was set to travel to Cairo on Sunday for further talks, and Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. Israeli strikes have continued across Gaza despite the renewed hopes of a deal, with an overnight bombardment killing 28 people including a woman and her six children, Palestinian officials said Sunday. In the West Bank, some Palestinians say Israelis are taking advantage of the fact that the world is focused on Gaza to redouble their efforts to “colonize” the Palestinian territory. Ernesto forecast to become a hurricane again as it moves north Tropical Storm Ernesto was downgraded from a hurricane Saturday night after making landfall in Bermuda, but as of Sunday morning it’s forecast to strengthen again as it heads toward Canada’s Newfoundland. “Some intensification is possible Sunday and Sunday night,” the National Hurricane Center said. “The cyclone will likely become post-tropical near southeastern Newfoundland by Monday night or Tuesday morning.” Thousands in Bermuda lost power, and as of Sunday afternoon more than 10,000 utility customers (about 34% of the island) were still without. Dangerous beach conditions, including large waves and rip currents, are expected along the East Coast and Atlantic Canada until early next week. Who is the ‘Ketamine Queen’ charged in Matthew Perry’s death? Jasveen Sangha, deemed the “Ketamine Queen” by investigators, is accused of supplying the drugs that killed “Friends” star Matthew Perry. She had been selling ketamine and other drugs “since at least 2019” and had turned her home into a “stash house,” federal prosecutors say. Court documents say a search of Sangha’s residence found “evidence of drug trafficking” and pills containing “methamphetamine, psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine, and prescription drugs that appeared to be fraudulently obtained.” Sangha was arrested in March in a separate federal drug case and was out on $100,000 bond when she was arrested and charged in Perry’s death. She faces anywhere from 10 years to life in federal prison if convicted. Meet the Press South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham has suggested former President Donald Trump “may not win this election” unless he focuses on policy over showmanship. “President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America, and if you have a policy debate for president, he wins. Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election,” Graham told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker. Graham also suggested that he and fellow Republicans who are “giving advice on TV to President Trump” should “get together and actually campaign for the guy,” citing Trump’s former rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis.

Earthquake scientists are learning warning signs of the ‘big one’ Japan’s recent “megaquake” warning had seismologists watching carefully. Did the smaller quake mean that the “big one” was on the doorstep? No one could say for sure, but the odds were suddenly higher. The warning ultimately ended Thursday after no unusual activity was detected, but it highlighted a big question for U.S. seismologists: If they find clues that a devastating earthquake is more likely, even just slightly, what warrants sounding the alarm? “You don’t want a mass evacuation panic that’s not warranted, but you want people not to go on their merry ways,” said Harold Tobin, Washington’s state seismologist. Forecasting this future catastrophe is critical, and researchers think they are homing in on the triggers or precursors of earthquakes in the world’s most dangerous seismic regions, but the science is far from settled.

The article about Harris cracking down on the problem was not taken seriously by X users, who recalled that the current Biden/Harris administration has seen some of the highest numbers in illegal southern border crossings in U.S. history. \"Garbage propaganda,\" conservative blogger Mike LaChance posted about the article, which was published on Saturday. KAMALA HARRIS DECLINES TIME MAGAZINE INTERVIEW AS SHE CONTINUES TO AVOID THE PRESS Written by Politico reporter Blake Jones, the piece detailed how Harris’ new, tougher policy proposals for how she will handle the southern border if she becomes president, have been influenced by \"her own\" \"playbook\" that she employed earlier in her career. Jones wrote, \"Harris’ vow to fight for border security has roots in her run for California attorney general in 2010, when she barely defeated a Republican opponent who had support across the state from police chiefs and prosecutors.\" The author recounted some of her policy at the time, stating, \"Harris, a former prosecutor herself, decided to embrace a crackdown on the transnational gangs that smuggle drugs and people across the U.S.-Mexico border. She expanded a task force devoted to cross-border criminality — during the Great Recession, when the state was cutting its budget and eliminating programs — and fostered greater intelligence sharing with Mexican authorities that officials said yielded arrests years later.\" As the piece noted, implementing these policies is the experience Harris is drawing on for new border policy, which appears to be much tougher than the policies her current administration has enacted regarding the border. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but did not receive an immediate response. A recent Harris 2024 ad mentioned her commitment to \"fixing the border,\" drawing the ire of her critics who have sought to highlight as one of her weaknesses after the Biden administration saw record levels of illegal border crossings, most notably after the vice president was put in charge of solving the \"root causes\" of illegal immigration.

Almost immediately, people began using the tool to flood the social media site with fake images of political figures such as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as of Musk himself — some depicting the public figures in obviously false but nonetheless disturbing situations, like participating in the 9/11 attacks. Unlike other mainstream AI photo tools, Grok, created by Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, appears to have few guardrails. In tests of the tool, for example, CNN was easily able to get Grok to generate fake, photorealistic images of politicians and political candidates that, taken out of context, could be misleading to voters. The tool also created benign yet convincing images of public figures, such as Musk eating steak in a park. Some X users posted images they said they created with Grok showing prominent figures consuming drugs, cartoon characters committing violent murders and sexualized images of women in bikinis. In one post viewed nearly 400,000 times, a user shared an image created by Grok of Trump leaning out of the top of a truck, firing a rifle. CNN tests confirmed the tool is capable of creating such images. RELATED | Gov. Little signs AI-generated porn bill into law The tool is likely to add to concerns that artificial intelligence could create an explosion of false or misleading information across the internet, especially ahead of the US presidential election. Lawmakers, civil society groups and even tech leaders themselves have raised alarms that the misuse of such tools could cause confusion and chaos for voters. “Grok is the most fun AI in the world!” Musk posted on X Wednesday, in response to a user praising the tool for being “uncensored.” Many other leading AI companies have taken some steps to prevent their AI image generation tools from being used to create political misinformation, although researchers found users can still sometimes find ways around enforcement measures. Some companies, including OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, also include technology or labels to help viewers identify images that have been made with their AI tools. Rival social media platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook have also taken steps to label AI-generated content in users’ feeds, either by using technology to detect it themselves or asking users to identify when they’re posting such content. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding whether it has any policies against Grok generating potentially misleading images of political candidates. By Friday, xAI appeared to have introduced some restrictions on Grok, in response to critical reports and the disturbing images that users were creating and posting. The tool now refuses to create images of political candidates or widely recognized cartoon characters (whose intellectual property belongs to other companies) committing acts of violence or alongside hate speech symbols, although users noted the restrictions seemed limited to only certain terms and image subjects. X has a policy against sharing “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm,” although it’s unclear how the policy is enforced. Musk himself shared a video last month on X that used AI to make it appear that Harris had said things she, in fact, did not — in an apparent violation of the policy and with only a laughing face emoji to suggest to followers that it was fake. The new Grok image tool also comes as Musk faces criticism for repeatedly spreading false and misleading claims on X related to the presidential election, including a post raising questions about the security of voting machines. It also comes days after Musk hosted Trump for a more than two-hour livestreamed conversation on X in which the Republican hopeful made at least 20 false claims without pushback from Musk. Other AI image generation tools have faced backlash for various issues. Google paused the ability for its Gemini AI chatbot to generate images of people after it was blasted for producing historically inaccurate depictions of people’s races; Meta’s AI image generator came under fire for struggling to create images of couples or friends from different racial backgrounds. TikTok was also forced to pull an AI video tool after CNN discovered that any user could create realistic-looking videos of people saying anything, including vaccine misinformation, without labels. Grok does appear to have some restrictions; for example, a prompt requesting a nude image returned a response saying, “unfortunately, I can’t generate that kind of image.” In a separate test, the tool said it also has “limitations on creating content that promotes or could be seen as endorsing harmful stereotypes, hate speech, or misinformation.” “It’s important to avoid spreading falsehoods or content that could incite hatred or division. If you have other requests or need information on a different topic, feel free to ask!” Grok said. However, in response to a different prompt, the tool did generate an image of a political figure standing alongside a hate speech symbol — a sign that whatever restrictions Grok does have, they appear not to be enforced consistently. –CNN’s Jon Passantino contributed to this report.
