However, no deal was made, and the SALT Republicans told Mullin they wanted the original deal they negotiated in “good faith” with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).\n\nIf no deal is reached and the end-of-year tax deadline passes, the SALT cap will be eliminated and expire along with the other 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions that apply to households.\n\nKim told the Washington Examiner ahead of the call with Mullin that she is worried the Republican conference may be heading down the same path it did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with a low SALT cap.\n\n“When we got this portion of the tax bill wrong in 2017 … and as I reminded our House leadership during the House negotiation times, that we lost a few of our Republican colleagues, especially where I am in Orange County, because we didn’t do this right,” Kim told the Washington Examiner ahead of the call with Mullin. “We reminded the speaker and the leadership that that is the fate that we may be committing if the SALT Caucus does not get a win on this one and we do not get this right.”\n\nKim added that part of the deal made between the SALT Caucus and Johnson included the speaker supporting it in the Senate. Johnson told Senate Republicans he hoped they would make minimal changes to the reconciliation legislation so it could get to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4.\n\nHowever, the Senate is not as keen on SALT as the House is, and a drop in the cap is expected once it hits the upper chamber. However, reverting to the current $10,000 level has angered many in the SALT Caucus, including Lawler and Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY).\n\nBoth have said they are “done negotiating” and that if the reconciliation bill comes back to the House without the negotiated $40,000 cap, it is “DEAD ON ARRIVAL.” \n\nSome Republicans, including the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and its like-minded Senate counterparts, have argued against raising the SALT cap, accusing it of subsidizing blue states and wasting federal money.\n\nHowever, New York and California Republicans have pushed back on this.\n\n“What we’ve asked for was something that was reasonable and fair, that focused on middle-class families and is supported by the Republican principle of allowing taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) told the Washington Examiner. \n\n“This idea of subsidizing blue, poorly-run blue states is a fallacy,” Malliotakis added. “It’s a fallacy. Why? Because New Yorkers pay more to the federal government in taxes than they receive. The people who are being subsidized are the ones who are receiving refundable tax credits, which are still in this bill. So, if we’re going to be doing that, then we should be doing the SALT relief.”\n\nLawler, who represents a swing district won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, has said over the last few months that Republicans should remember that they wouldn’t even be in the majority without seats such as his.\n\nThough the Freedom Caucus is typically the rabblerousers in the House, the SALT Caucus stepped up during the reconciliation process and has the ability to demand significant legislative changes.\n\nREPUBLICANS FRUSTRATED AS TRUMP IGNORES TIKTOK LAW AGAIN \n\nBecause of the House’s razor-thin margins, the SALT and Freedom caucuses have the numbers to essentially tank the entire bill if they don’t get what they want. \n\nCurrently, Johnson can afford to lose three seats to pass the legislation along party lines, with that number fluctuating depending on Democrats’ attendance.","summary":"House and Senate Republicans are not close to a deal on raising the state and local tax deductions, leaving the fate of the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill up in the air as the lower chamber’s razor-thin margins give SALT Republicans the upper hand.

Or at least, throwing a wedding.\n\nHuma Abedin, veteran Democratic operative, and Alex Soros, son of leftist megadonor George Soros, tied the knot in a glitzy ceremony on “No Kings Day.” But their romance is more than a romance – it’s a blueprint for brokering peace between Israel and Palestine. That’s the degree of significance you might be inclined to heap on the Abedin-Soros union after reading The New York Times’ gushing coverage of their wedding. (RELATED: Cash-Strapped Democrats Call For Regime Change – But Not In Iran)\n\nThe details of their star-studded love story are laid bare in a profile from the outlet. Wedding guests included Democrats such as former President Bill Clinton, and his wife Hillary, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and her husband Doug Emhoff, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Anna Wintour, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jimmy Fallon numbered among the celebrity attendees. \n\n Alex Soros and Huma Abedin first met at a birthday party for a Rothschild family heiress, according to this NYT puff piece about the wedding they had on “No Kings” day pic.twitter.com/5C1U9Avu4P — Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) June 19, 2025\n\nAbedin had her first substantial conversation with Soros at a birthday party for heiress Nicky Hilton Rothschild held Oct. 13, 2023. Both Abedin and Soros’ moods were soured by the events of Oct. 7. “Ms. Abedin is Muslim; Mr. Soros is Jewish,” The New York Times reminds us. \n\nAbedin had been “mostly single” since her high-profile divorce from disgraced politician Anthony Weiner. Their interaction “left [Abedin] with no reason to think that pattern was about to change.” Abedin did not recognize Soros. When he offered to drive her home, she opted for an Uber instead. When he followed her on Instagram, she did not follow him back. When he direct messaged her, she did not respond. \n\nEvery great romance begins with a string of firm rejections. Maybe Soros charmed her with his adroit DoorDash skills. \n\n“And on Sunday night, I cooked,” Soros said of a shared meal with his future wife. “That means I ordered from Nobu.” At 39, Soros is a millennial, meaning “quirky” haplessness is a native skill. The elder Abedin, 49, was no doubt spellbound.\n\n 🚨EXCLUSIVE PICS: While thousands of leftists protested Trump’s agenda across the country on Saturday, many top Democrats were celebrating the lavish wedding of former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Alex Soros, the son of left-wing megadonor George Soros. https://t.co/kr0ySWZuvi pic.twitter.com/SKI6acVuf3 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 15, 2025\n\nAbedin “brings out a much more joyful, loving side of me,” Soros said, according to The New York Times. “I’m completely vulnerable with her, and she’s kind and warm and nonjudgmental. I’m at the point where she’s a part of me.” Abedin’s public persona does much to conceal her kindness. A recent photoshoot with her then-fiance in The New Yorker elicits not warmth, but arctic frigidity. Maybe she learned it from Hillary Clinton, whom she served as top aide for years. (RELATED: Liberals Squander First Chance To Learn From 2020 Mistakes)\n\nRegardless, the couple has made it work. Religious differences and all. “Ms. Abedin and Mr. Soros signed the ketubah in honor of Mr. Soros’s Jewish faith and the nikah in honor of Ms. Abedin’s Muslim faith in an intimate, interfaith ceremony,” The New York Times writes. Their ceremony was officiated by both a rabbi and a trustee at Muslims for Progressive Values. The trustee is a “certified life cycle celebrant,” according to the outlet. I have many questions. The least of which being: Does this Muslim for Progressive Values celebrate all life cycles, or just human ones? Can I book him for a salmon running ceremony?\n\nPutting aside my ignorance in these matters, I encourage readers to look to Abedin and Soros as an example of intra-faith, intra-generational bridge-building. \n\n“With so much hardship and violence across the world today, it wasn’t an obvious time for a wedding party. But as so many friends shared in their toasts, gathering to celebrate joy and love felt not only right, but necessary,” Abedin said in a wedding speech, according to The New York Times. If two high-powered liberals can put aside their differences and throw a lavish ceremony full of Democrat A-listers, why can’t the nations of Israel and Palestine? \n\nFollow Natalie Sandoval on X: @NatalieIrene03","summary":"Every great romance begins with a string of firm rejections","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/19/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-alex-soros-george-soros-democrat-wedding-party-new-york-times/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2216172557-scaled-e1750361759717.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 20:19:23","author":"Natalie Sandoval","authors":["Natalie Sandoval"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.426},{"id":333213090,"title":"White House has suggestion for Jasmine Crockett after Dem calls Trump supporters 'sick'","text":"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clapped back against Rep.

Producer Brian Teta asked Behar, who has been with the show for 26 years, what she likes about doing the ABC talk show and why she's been on it for so long. \"It's because of the freedom to speak my mind, that has always been the attraction,\" she responded, before talking about other parts of her career. \"I like the people I work with, number one, I like everybody.\" \"I also feel an obligation to speak about the administration that we’re in the midst of, and I feel like we’re in a privileged position to say certain things and that we, you know, we can actually influence people’s thinking sometimes, even if it’s a little bit, that we’re in a lot of trouble in this country right now, and that I like the idea that we can say stuff that people will listen to,\" she said.

She's different when she's running for office, and she's all scared to make a mistake. When she's herself, she's very funny. She should have come on ‘The View’ more, I think at that time.

The co-hosts also talked about Sunny Hostin's viral question posed to former Vice President Kamala Harris last year during the 2024 campaign, as Teta joked that the liberal co-host had \"single-handedly taken down the Democratic Party\" when Harris' bungled answer went viral.

Both entrepreneurial, they saw an opportunity to make a lot of money by working on a movie-related project together.\n\nRemember Planet Hollywood? It was a themed restaurant chain filled with movie props and memorabilia. It was launched in New York City in 1991, soon boasted 60 locations worldwide and was known for its famous celebrity backers, who prominently included Schwarzenegger, Stallone and Bruce Willis.\n\nIn addition to his fame as “Conan the Barbarian” and the future governor of California, Schwarzenegger, 77, also has long been known as a savvy businessman. Schwarzenegger said he began working with restaurateur Robert Earl, known for expanding the Hard Rock Cafe franchise globally, and film producer Keith Barish to create a new entertainment-themed restaurant chain — one that celebrated Hollywood mythology and glamour.\n\n“And the next thing I know, I get a call from my lawyer, who was also Sly’s lawyer, and he said, ‘Arnold, is there any kind of room for Sly on Planet Hollywood?'” Schwarzenegger recalled.\n\n“I said, ‘That’s actually a good idea, because that could bring us together, and I wanted that,” Schwarzenegger said. “At that point I had grown out of my craziness.”\n\n“So, sure enough, we made it work,” Schwarzenegger said. “Then Bruce Willis became part of Planet Hollywood, then Whoopi Goldberg became part of Planet Hollywood, then Chuck Norris.”\n\nThe rivalry between these two self-described “alpha males” began in January 1977, when both were seated at the same table during the Golden Globe Awards, Stallone told Variety in 2017. After Schwarzenegger received the award for best acting debut for his 1976 film “Stay Hungry,” he began “gloating.” Stallone then noticed Schwarzenegger laughing when he lost the best actor for his starring role in “Rocky.”\n\nBut Stallone said he got the last laugh when when “Rocky” won best picture. He also revealed that he picked up a big bowl of flowers and heaved it in Schwarzenegger’s direction.\n\n“I went, ‘OK, the gauntlet is down,'” Stallone said. “This began a 10-year battle royale. I mean, we couldn’t stand to be in the same galaxy.” But ultimately the feud came to an end, after Stallone said they realized they’re both “the same person.”\n\nUnfortunately, the Planet Hollywood glory didn’t last too long. Amid financial problems due partly to a reputation for lackluster food, the company filed for bankruptcy in October 1999, and the number of locations began to decline. As of May 2025, though, three Planet Hollywood restaurants and four hotels continue to operate.\n\nBut Schwarzenegger and Stallone eventually made several movies, including “The Expendables 2” in 2012, which also featured Willis and an ensemble of other aging male action stars such as Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme.\n\nThe two men also have long been known for their conservative politics, though Stallone said he’s never identified as a Republican. Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger has long been a registered Republican, though he also has been on the record since 2016 as vehemently opposing Donald Trump and endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nStallone did not appear to publicly endorse Trump in the 2024 election. However, following Trump’s victory in November, Stallone attended an event at his Mar-a-Lago club, where he praised him as a “second George Washington” and compared him to his character Rocky Balboa, Variety reported. To thank Stallone for his support, Trump announced that the “Rocky” star would serve in a new role as “Special Ambassador to Hollywood,” sharing the title with pro-Trump actors Jon Voight and Mel Gibson.","summary":"The 2 action stars saw an opportunity to make $$$ by working together on a project celebrating their Hollywood fame.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/19/arnold-schwarzenegger-sylvester-stallone-ended-nasty-feud-to-make-money/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ArnoldSly1.jpeg?w=1024&h=731","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 17:56:12","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.189},{"id":333175554,"title":"World News | Some US Restaurants, Servers Oppose Republicans' 'no Tax on Tips' Budget Proposal","text":"Washington, Jun 19 (AP) Some segments of the US restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid. The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill.

Tips included in sprawling tax cuts package For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's US presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept. The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than USD160,000 in 2025. The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at USD 25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds USD 150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec 31, 2024. Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that “cash tips” qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement. Main industry trade group supports tax-free tips Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn't respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee's and Chili's. The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 US restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders. But the US restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the “no tax on tips” proposal leaves out too many of those workers. A push to eliminate taxes on service charges The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers' bills, according to the National Restaurant Association. George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models. Skandalos tried pooling servers' tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn't understand and kept tipping. Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20 per cent service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said. Skandalos said “no tax on tips” doesn't acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes. “This bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people's pocketbooks, but now let's finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,” he said. Tipped workers seek higher wages But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips. “'No tax on tips' is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,” he said. Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of USD 7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as USD 2.13 per hour. Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford's bill. Garcia said she makes USD 33,000 a year, including up to USD 600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty. “It would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,” Garcia said. Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they're inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it. For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay. “I think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,” she said.

Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible. \n\n“I think there’s a huge hole in this concept of ‘no tax on tips’ because a lot of restaurant workers aren’t receiving tips in the first place,” said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. “It’s not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.”\n\n Tips included in sprawling tax cuts package \n\nFor now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.\n\nThe House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024. \n\nBoth the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that “cash tips” qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement. \n\n Main industry trade group supports tax-free tips \n\nWary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn’t respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee’s and Chili’s.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.\n\nBut the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the “no tax on tips” proposal leaves out too many of those workers.\n\n A push to eliminate taxes on service charges \n\nThe coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers’ bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nGeorge Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.\n\nSkandalos tried pooling servers’ tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn’t understand and kept tipping.\n\nSkandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.\n\nSkandalos said “no tax on tips” doesn’t acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.\n\n“This bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people’s pocketbooks, but now let’s finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,” he said.\n\n Tipped workers seek higher wages \n\nBut Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.\n\n“’No tax on tips’ is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,” he said.\n\nPappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

You’ve never apologized for that. That was a full failure!”\n\n“All these failures, and no one ever says I’m sorry!” he later groused.\n\nTaken aback, Cruz blamed former President Joe Biden’s “weakness” for enabling the war. Carlson countered that Biden’s “aggression” caused the bloody war and pointed to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to the Munich Security Conference in February 2022 as evidence.\n\nPutin had been mobilizing his forces along the border with Ukraine for months before the invasion took place.\n\nCruz harked back to a sanctions package against Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline that was shot down by the Senate before the war, which he argued may have prevented it. He also cited the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan as a key factor in Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.\n\n“I gotta say, I don’t understand, for some reason, you are really invested in defending Russia. I don’t get that. I’m not attacking you,” Cruz vented at one point, stressing that he was “genuinely” bewildered why Carlson is “so passionate” about that.\n\nCarlson later shot back that “I don’t want to be at war with Russia” and warned of the dangers of Moscow and Beijing growing closer. \n\nThe former primetime Fox News anchor also argued that “Russia is stronger” now despite the onslaught of sanctions imposed against Moscow and claimed that the West has grown weak. \n\n“Western Europe is weaker and more in debt. The United States is weaker and much more in debt,” Carslon contended, insinuating that the US needs to prioritize domestic plights rather than overseas wars.\n\nAt one point, Cruz acknowledged that while he voted against the first major tranche of military aid to war-torn Ukraine, he voted against subsequent ones after concluding the efforts to support Kyiv weren’t working. \n\n“It hasn’t worked. So I’ve been in between. I haven’t been on the full Ukraine, full-throated hawk side or the anti- [Ukraine side] from day one,” the Texas senator said.\n\nThe bulk of Carlson’s explosive interview with Cruz centered around the Israel-Iran conflict and philosophical differences on foreign policy intervention. Cruz dubbed himself an “isolationist hawk” who wants a middle ground between hawks and doves. \n\nLawmakers in the Senate are currently mulling bipartisan legislation to significantly ramp up sanctions on Russia.","summary":"Right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson demanded that Sen.

That figure was more than 62,000 a year ago under the Biden administration, the White House said.\n\nAnd Auburn coach Pearl, who has been an outspoken supporter of Trump, was thrilled to see how Trump is handling the country's border security.\n\n'We didn't need new laws, we just needed a president that would enforce the ones we already had! President @realDonaldTrump is making America safe again!,' he wrote on X.\n\nPearl, who previously slammed Kamala Harris for her 'woke progressive beliefs,' expressed his support for legal immigration in November after Trump had won a second term in office.\n\n'President Trump won big because more Americans believed he will fix Inflation, secure our border, support legal immigration, bring peace to the world through strength and put America first,' he said on X.\n\nBruce Pearl has backed President Donald Trump over his handling of illegal immigration\n\nPearl has been an outspoken supporter of Trump, seen during a meeting with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store\n\nThe White House claimed that zero illegal immigrants were released into the US in May\n\n'I pray and I believe he will work for all Americans, uniting us as one nation under God!'\n\nPearl's latest remarks on immigration came as he also praised Trump's 'instincts' in regards to the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nNational anthem singer reveals true extent of fury at her incendiary ICE protest before Dodgers game\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump didn't rule out US military intervention as missile attacks continue in both countries.\n\nNonetheless, Pearl trusts that Trump will make the right decision as he mulls deploying US forces to take out Iran's Fordow nuclear facility.\n\n'He's got incredible instincts, like instincts that I think historically will be down as one of the greatest leaders in the history of the world,' Pearl said on Dont @ Me with Dan Dakich.\n\n'That's a strong statement… I think the vast majority of it is incredibly calculated. Every now and then, it may be a little bit off the cuff, but I trust him.'\n\nPearl also said that the world was 'about to become a safer place' with ' a non-nuclear Iran', and gushed about Trump's handling of the Middle East.\n\n'If the Middle East gets safer and stronger, look at what dynamic country Israel is. Look at all the unicorns that are there. Look at all the high tech and development. Look at all the wealth,' he said.\n\n'If you began to spread that to some of these other Middle Eastern countries, who are they going to partner with? The United States, Russia, China? It's going to be the U.S. because Donald Trump has led the way to create peace and prosperity for everybody in the region.' \n\nPearl, who is Jewish, has especially outspoken in his support of Israel since the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas in 2023.\n\nFollowing his team's win over Creighton in March Madness, he campaigned for the return of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who was ultimately held in captivity for 584 days before his release in May.\n\nJuventus players had a bizarre meeting with Trump on Wednesday in the Oval Office\n\nTrump, however, received a frostier reception from different sports figures on Wednesday as he hosted select Juventus players in the Oval Office.\n\nSeveral players - including Americans Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie - visited the president ahead of their Club World Cup clash in DC, but Trump seemingly baffled them as he spoke about trans athletes and the Israel-Iran situation with them in the room.\n\n'It was all a surprise to me, honestly - they told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go,' Weah said after Juventus' 5-0 win later that night.\n\n'I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it’s kind of like, I just want to play football man.'\n\nDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAuburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl backs Donald Trump over ICE controversy and Israel-Iran war\n\nAdd comment","summary":"College basketball coach Bruce Pearl has backed Donald Trump over his illegal immigration crackdown, insisting that the president is 'making America safe again.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-basketball/article-14829281/bruce-pearl-donald-trump-ice-iran-israel.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/19/16/99536875-0-image-m-49_1750348015224.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 15:53:45","author":"Editor,Jake Nisse","authors":["Editor","Jake Nisse"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.235},{"id":333218084,"title":"Nolte: Trump Says ‘MAGA HATES Fox News’ and Its 'FAKE' Polling","text":"President Trump tore into “Crooked FoxNews Polls” after the cable outlet released another one of those polls that result in eye rolls from anyone who understands polling.\n\n“The Crooked FoxNews Polls got the Election WRONG, I won by much more than they said I would, and have been biased against me for years. They are always wrong and negative. It’s why MAGA HATES FoxNews, even though their anchors are GREAT,” the president wrote Thursday on his Truth Social account.\n\nHe added correctly that, “This has gone on for years, but they never change the incompetent polling company that does their work.”\n\nTrump has complained about Fox News polling for years, and for good reason: Fox polling sucks. The following examples are just from 2020.\n\nFox News told us Trump would lose Michigan by twelve. He lost by less than three. Fox News told us Trump would lose Arizona by nine points. The final tally was Biden 49.4 percent to Trump’s 49.1 percent. Fox News told us Trump would lose North Carolina by four. Trump won by 1.3 points. Fox News told us Trump would win Ohio by only by three. He won by 8.1.\n\nFox was a little better in 2024, but they also refrained from doing much polling nearer to Election Day.\n\nTrump went on:\n\n“Now a new FoxNews poll comes out this morning giving me a little more than 50% at the Border, and yet the Border is miraculously perfect, NOBODY WAS ABLE TO COME IN LAST MONTH. 60,000 people came in with Sleepy Joe in the same month last year.”\n\n“I hate FAKE pollsters” he continued, “one of the Worst, but Fox will never change their discredited pollster!”\n\nNo, Fox will never change its discredited pollster because Fox News loves spreading fake polls.\n\nThe poll released by Fox News today has Trump eight points underwater in overall approval, 46 percent approve to 54 percent disapprove, and has never once had him over 50 percent approval during this second term.\n\nOn border security, Fox says he’s at 53 percent approve, 46 percent disapprove. On immigration, he’s upside-down eight points with 46 percent approve to 53 percent disapprove. On foreign policy, he down 15(!) points, 42 percent approve to 57 percent disapprove. On the economy and inflation, he’s down 18 points and 34(!) points, respectively.\n\nThroughout his first term, Fox News has never had Trump over 50 percent approval on immigration, foreign policy, the economy, or inflation.\n\nHere’s the real howler… According to this Fox poll, Kamala Harris has the highest favorability rating out of the ten people the pollster asked about. She’s at 49 percent favorable to 51 percent unfavorable. Trump is at 45/55.\n\nMaybe these numbers are accurate. Who knows? What I do know is that we can’t trust these numbers because Fox News polls suck.

Mikie Sherrill won New Jersey’s hotly contested Democratic gubernatorial primary with 34% of the vote in a six-way race. New Jersey is one of just two states holding off-year governor’s races in 2025, the other being Virginia.\n\nSherrill is now the frontrunner heading into November’s election. Her Republican opponent, former state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli came shockingly close to winning four years ago. But like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, he benefited from Donald Trump not being on the ballot or in office. This time around, Trump is all in, loudly endorsing Ciattarelli—much to Sherrill’s delight, no doubt.\n\nSherrill immediately pointed to the sky-high Democratic turnout as both the key to her win and a preview of November. \n\n“We had almost 800,000 people voting in this primary. That’s unheard of,” she told the Washington Post. “It shows you the passion people have, shows you what’s coming in November here.”\n\nAnd that’s underselling it. Democratic turnout now stands at 814,669, a genuinely extraordinary number. The closest comparison is from 2017, which saw 503,682 votes. In 2021, it was just 382,984 (an unopposed primary), and only 195,171 in 2013.\n\nRepublicans also hit a record of 459,574 votes, up from 339,033 in 2021 and the mid-200,000s in 2013 and 2017. But even with this boost, they still lag far behind Democrats’ surge.\n\nThis turnout is especially encouraging given New Jersey’s sharp rightward shift in the 2024 presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state just 52-46, compared to President Joe Biden’s 57-41 win in 2020—a net 10-point swing to Republicans, largely driven by weak Democratic turnout. That’s clearly been fixed.\n\nHolding New Jersey’s governorship—and reclaiming Virginia’s—matters. But what’s really exciting is what this says about the 2026 midterms.\n\nConventional wisdom says that the party in the White House gets shellacked in the midterms—especially with an unpopular president. But Biden and Democrats already broke that rule in 2022. Nothing’s carved in stone.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans got obliterated in Trump’s first term during the 2018 midterms, when Democrats flipped 41 House seats and 7 governor seats. His second term is off to an even worse start, and with these early signs of hyper-engaged Democrats, the vibes are good.\n\nSure, 2026 is still a long way off. But if these numbers spook enough Republicans in swing districts, Democrats might be able to grind this narrowly divided Congress to a halt. \n\nThat alone is worth celebrating.","summary":"Last week, Rep.

Ed Luce, of the Financial Times, still with us as well for this conversation. Michael, good to see you. Your recent piece reflects on the consequential events of this past weekend with the headline, “America Is at a Terrifying Turning Point-and There's No Going Back.” Tell us what you mean.\n\nMICHAEL TOMASKY: Well, good morning Jonathan. I think we all woke up Saturday to that absolutely shocking news out of Minnesota about the shootings. And it was just very hard to process. And then of course, we followed the manhunt over the succeeding days and learned more about the assailant, the alleged assailant.\n\nThat was preceded, though, by what happened to Senator Padilla in Los Angeles the previous week. And now ever since I wrote that piece, it's been followed by what happened to Brad Lander, the Mayoral Candidate in New York yesterday, when he also was manhandled by ICE agents.

They always teach us in journalism that three is a pattern, but more seriously, I mean, you can't. watch these things and not suspect that something bad is happening that's new and unique and that isn't where we've been before.\n\nI say in the piece, we did go through a period of pretty extreme political violence in the United States in the late 1960s and early and mid 1970s. This feels worse to me. This feels more permanent. That felt like it was aberrational because it was about a couple of issues that caused a generational convulsion, Vietnam and civil rights. This though feels different because frankly, one of our two major political parties winks at, and sometimes abets, and then sometimes literally pardons political violence.\n\nJONATHAN LEMIRE: And Ed Luse, you covered similar ground in your latest piece with this chilling headline, “Return to the American Assassin.”\n\nEDWARD LUSE: Yeah, so I strongly agree with what Michael just said, that we're at a, we've been at a turning point for a while. The difference between previous periods of political assassination, political violence, fringe sort of terrorist kind of activity in the late 60s and the 70s was that that was not being exhorted from the White House, that was not being encouraged by the White House.\n\nWhat Donald Trump has done, and it's the first big act, of course, when he, after he was inaugurated this time in January, was to pardon those hundreds of people who were felons because of the Jan six storming and of course, commuting the sentences of those who had plotted it and been involved directly in violence. That signaled that Trump has your back, if you commit violence in his cause. He has also recently said he's considering pardoning the nine men who were convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAgain, exactly the same. Exactly the same signal green light is being sent from the White House. We never had that coming from the White House, under LBJ or under even Nixon, let alone under Carter. This is a very, very different kind of situation. So I strongly agree with Michael's point that there's a pattern here, and that pattern originates from the top, not from the fringes.\n\nJOHN HEILEMANN: Hey, Michael, it's Heilemann here. I think, you know, you see the, it's not doesn't feel coincidental that you've seen the assassinations. You've seen the Senator Padilla. Now, here in New York you've seen a Mayoral Candidate, the Comptroller taken away. These are, you know, talk about three's a pattern, you know, etc. As you say.\n\nAnd I think in some respects, obviously it feels it feels more focused than the violence in the 60s. The point that you make more – I'm not sure, worse or better, because some of the things happened in the 60s were pretty horrific, from Kent State to the bombings at Columbia, etc, etc. But the point you make also is here to stay. And I want to try to get you to comment on that.\n\nWhat makes this feel to you as though the 60s was transient and that the patterns we're seeing now might be even longer lasting?\n\nTOMASKY: Because you felt the Vietnam war was going to end eventually, you felt that the civil rights movement was, you know, that at some point we were going to find some kind of equilibrium there. It's arguable whether we have even yet today. But, you know, those didn't feel like things that were permanent features of our political life and culture. But this does now. And because as I wrote and because, as Ed said, it's coming from the top. It's being abetted and winked at by the White House. And that's a really different thing.\n\nNow, will that change? Maybe that will change. You know, if the Republicans lose spectacularly in 2028, assuming there's an election and the Democrats win and Republicans decide to do an autopsy and decide to change course. But I think the MAGA grip on the Republican Party, with its winking at violence and sometimes even worse than that. I think that's here to stay for the foreseeable future, for sure.\n\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: Well, Michael, of course, people on the MAGA right would remind you and remind everybody in this conversation that it was Donald Trump himself who was a target of two assassination attempts over the past summer during the middle of the campaign. I think one of you, I, I think it may have been Ed talked about hard to imagine the horrific consequences if those one of those two assassination attempts had been successful. So this obviously is not just a MAGA right phenomenon. What explains what happened to Donald Trump twice over the past summer?\n\nTOMASKY: Well, there doesn't seem to have been a strong political motivation for either of those shooters. Obviously, those were horrible events. But there doesn't seem to have been a strong political motivation identified by the FBI in either of those cases.\n\nMore broadly, though, Joe, you make a fair point and a point that I should address. There's some political violence that emanates from the left, there's no question about it. But, you know, here's the difference. Antifa, you know, they hate the Democratic Party as much as they hate the Republican Party. The Democratic Party is just part of the capitalist oppressor class. To those people. They weren't running to the polls to vote for Kamala Harris. And, you know, if those kinds of groups had offered their support to Harris or any high ranking Democrat, it would have been, I'm sure, spurned. But not that any such offer would have been made because those groups hate the Democrats.\n\nOn the right, there's a different relationship between the extremist groups and the Republican Party and the sitting president. Very different.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Yeah, and Ed Luse I’ll ask the same question of you, obviously, you wrote about the two assassination attempts against President Trump over the past summer. Explain how that fits into your thesis.\n\nLUSE: Well, what's odd about that is, that Trump isn't more concerned about the danger of bullets in politics. I mean, as I wrote, if Trump had been killed last July, goodness knows what the social breakdown would have been, of course, in itself would have been a tragic crime to kill the nominee of one of America's two parties.\n\nBut the backlash to that is just unknowable, which makes it all the more puzzling that, you know, when the department of homeland security and the FBI and American threat assessors for domestic violence have consistently over many years been saying, look, the terrorist threat and lone wolf threat of political assassination and other and other terror events comes from these far right militias. It makes it all the more surprising that Trump's administration is dismantling those units that were set up at the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to monitor those groups and try and preempt such violence.\n\nSo I don't think there's any allegation, not that Trump's used to it, that he's being consistent here, but he was within a quarter of inch of losing his life. And I think some of the actions he's taken to remove these monitoring groups at federal agencies are making it likely that other, other such tragedies like we saw in Minnesota are going to take place. I mean, that's just a real puzzle. And it shouldn't be happening.","summary":"The recent assassinations of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband have led the media to try to figure out a way to blame the Republican Party for it.

The DNC entered May with $18 million, while the RNC entered with $67.4 million.\n\nThe decline is partly due to big donors withholding their money — just three people donated $100,000 or more to the DNC from January to April.\n\n“People invested more money than they ever had before [in 2024], they dug deeper than they ever had, and they are quite frustrated by the result,” DNC Chairman Ken Martin said. “They want answers. I don’t take it personally. I wasn’t in charge.”\n\nThe party’s finances have gotten so bad that its leadership is in talks to borrow money to keep operations going, two people familiar with the discussions told the New York Times.\n\nAnalysts believe the decline in finances is due to a parallel decline in the Democratic Party’s image. A leadership battle between former DNC Vice Chairman David Hogg and Martin consumed the energy of the organization for nearly two months.\n\n“This is worse than some high school student council drama,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) told the outlet.\n\nRufus Gifford, finance chairman for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign, told the New York Times that the timing of the leadership battle could hardly have been worse.\n\n“What they are seeing is headline after headline of incompetence and infighting, and I think that is a real problem not just for the DNC but for the larger Democratic brand,” he said. “We need to come together and focus on the issues at hand. That’s got to happen now. And I mean today. And if that can’t happen, we need to shift course.”\n\nDespite the worrying signs, most Democrats are sticking behind Martin, in particular praising his work ethic. He’s traveled to nearly half the 50 states during his opening months as chairman, soliciting contributions from donors along the way.\n\nThough his performance as chairman has been viewed satisfactorily by many within the party, he’s been burdened by heavy self-doubt. An audio recording released earlier this month by Politico, showing a May 15 Zoom meeting, showed a heavily demoralized Martin choking up and questioning his ability to keep leading the party.\n\n“I’ll be very honest with you, for the first time in my 100 days on this job … the other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I want to do this anymore,” he said, speaking with Hogg and other DNC officers.\n\nMartin voiced frustration with the treatment of other head officers in recent power struggles and the position it put him in.\n\n“I’m just quite frustrated with the position I’m in. … No one knows who the hell I am, right? I’m trying to get my sea legs underneath me and actually develop any amount of credibility so I can go out there and raise the money and do the job I need to put ourselves in a position to win,” Martin said, speaking to Hogg. “And again, I don’t think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to. So it’s really frustrating.”\n\nHogg was removed from his position as vice chair on a technicality earlier this month. He opted not to run again.\n\nRANDI WEINGARTEN AND LEE SAUNDERS QUIT THE DNC IN LATEST UPHEAVAL\n\nMartin also has his fair share of critics within the party. Randi Weingarten, the influential leader of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, refused to continue as at-large members of the DNC. They pointed to issues with Martin’s leadership after \n\n“While I am proud to be a Democrat, I appear to be out of step with the leadership you are forging, and I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our communities,” Weingarten said to Martin in her resignation letter.","summary":"The Democratic National Committee&#8217;s internal crisis has reached a critical point, as its cash reserves dry up.

A potential deal breakthrough is always a possibility.\n\nThe $35 million settlement was recently floated and considered by both sides, according to two sources, as negotiations over the $20 billion lawsuit enter their sixth month. The impasse threatens to throttle a bigger prize — media heiress Shari Redstone’s plan to sell Paramount to independent studio Skydance.\n\nApproval of the deal by Trump’s regulators at the Federal Communications Commission is seen as contingent on settlement of the case, people at Paramount tell The Post. Trump legal reps and officials deny that the two issues are related, but Paramount executives are concerned that any large settlement would be considered a bribe since the fate of the $8 billion Paramount-Skydance merger is at stake.\n\nA settlement for $35 million would have been a 30% haircut from the original $50 million Trump’s legal advisers had tried to squeeze out of the company to end the lawsuit filed in Texas federal court last year, as The Post previously reported.\n\n“(The Trump people) appeared to be willing to settle for less, but even that amount worries the Paramount people,” one deal insider told The Post.\n\nA source close to the Trump legal team denied that it was on the verge of settling for $35 million.\n\n“We have a strong case,” the source said.\n\nA Paramount spokesman declined comment. A legal rep for Trump didn’t return a request for comment. A Redstone rep didn’t return a request for comment.\n\nOne thing appears certain: Paramount’s continued reluctance to pay a significant settlement, one lower than the Trump people had initially sought, hardened the president’s legal team’s position and could create a situation where the case remains in court for a protracted period, sources close to the matter say.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that CBS News’ longtime news program “60 Minutes” doctored an interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIt comes as Trump-nominated FCC Chair Brendan Carr subsequently launched a probe into the alleged biased editing, casting a cloud over whether the merger will get the green light from the regulator.\n\nRedstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, stands to net as much as $2 billion when her long-held desire to unload the company to Skydance is completed. Without a settlement, there is no windfall for the cash-bleeding Redstone, and therein lies the issue for Paramount.\n\nRedstone has officially recused herself from negotiations given she will personally benefit, but the notion that the lawsuit is tied to the regulatory approval of her deal is vexing her management team and preventing it from signing off on a payment of any size that could be legally construed as a bribe. The team fears it could be subject to litigation and even criminal bribery charges that are not covered by insurance, people with direct knowledge of the matter tell The Post.\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress have raised the bribery issue and the worry is that a state attorney general or Congress — if it changes hands in the midterms — could launch an investigation.\n\nRedstone had indicated in the past she was willing to pay as much as $50 million to make the case go away so she can preserve some semblance of her inheritance from her late father, media mogul Sumner Redstone, which has been decimated with the decline in Paramount’s fortunes in recent years.\n\nThe board has recently offered $15 million — the same amount paid by Disney-owned ABC News to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump after “This Week” anchor George Stephanopolous repeatedly accusing him of “rape.”\n\nIn the CBS lawsuit, both sides have weighed making up the difference with public service ads involving causes that the president would appreciate, including those combating antisemitism and promoting US veterans, The Post previously reported.\n\nBut the stalemate continues with the Trump team brushing off the $15 million offer, the $35 million deal stalled and the PSA offer not advancing. Meanwhile, the delay — and its implications for the Paramount-Skydance deal — has been looming large for all the players involved.\n\nSkydance is run by movie maven David Ellison, the son of Trump friend and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is worth approximately $250 billion.\n\nBehind the scenes, Skydance continues to draw up plans for a massive restructuring of the media properties, including CBS, once considered the crown jewel of the Redstone empire for its top-rated shows, sports and influential news programming such as “60 Minutes.”\n\nCord-cutting and changes to the media business landscape have squeezed profits at CBS News. The network’s boss Wendy McMahon and longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens recently departed, voicing concerns over the settlement of what it considers a frivolous case with Trump in order to proceed with the deal.\n\nSkydance and its deal partner, private equity powerhouse RedBird Capital, have anointed former NBCU chief Jeff Shell as the new CBS chief if the deal gets done. He is likely to downsize the organization and, according to sources, address the alleged political biases in its news programming that are at the center of the Trump lawsuit.\n\nFor years conservatives have complained that CBS tilts the scales in interviews and programming that projects a left-leaning political bias that under a strict reading of Federal Communications Commission rules could violate the law since it operates over public airwaves that demand it serve the “public interest.”\n\nCBS has denied the charges and the main allegation that it purposely edited the Harris interview to edit out her famous “word salad” vernacular to make her sound more presidential.\n\nIf there is no settlement, the federal judge in the Trump lawsuit is expected to grant discovery in the case in the coming weeks, which would be a significant legal escalation that Paramount and Redstone wanted to avoid.\n\nIf the matter doesn’t get resolved by October, the deal could be voided under the preliminary agreement reached between Skydance and Paramount.\n\nRedstone has a looming tax bill coming due over her late father’s estate and other obligations that could total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","summary":"Negotiations to settle Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over the Kamala Harris \"60 Minutes\" interview entered their sixth month.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/19/media/paramount-delays-35m-settlement-with-trump-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/trump-paramount-cbs.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1750253571&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 14:24:12","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":333113944,"title":"Hulk Hogan representative addresses rumors that wrestling legend is on his death bed","text":"Hulk Hogan’s representative has assured fans there are “no reasons to panic,” amid false reports that he “might not make it” after undergoing surgery last month.\n\nIn May, a spokesperson for the retired wrestling legend, 71, told TMZ that he had undergone “a little fusion procedure” on his neck.\n\nDuring a Wednesday livestream, YouTuber Bubba the Love Sponge claimed he had heard from “reliable sources” that things were “not looking good” for Hogan.\n\nHowever, a representative for Hogan has debunked those claims, telling E!

Is she Indian?”\n\nAfter realizing he had crossed a line, he appeared to blame his behavior on the alcohol. \n\n“I’m gonna get heat for that one, brother… that was not me, that was the beers talking,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, Hogan was suspended from WWE for three years after a recording surfaced of him going on a racist rant, using the N-word repeatedly when discussing his now-estranged daughter Brooke’s love life.\n\nBrooke, 37, has reportedly been estranged from her parents, Hogan and Linda Hogan, for years.

Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, grew teary at the vigil, and consoled attenders, as a brass band from the Minnesota Orchestra performed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nColin Hortman, Melissa and Mark’s son, hugged Walz and placed a photograph of his parents on their memorial. This is the first of several public vigils planned to memorialize the Hortmans before their funeral, MPR reported.\n\nThe vigil also featured a string quartet, as well as a Native American drum circle. Attenders sang Amazing Grace together.\n\nMourners, standing “shoulder to shoulder”, also brought “flags, handwritten notes and other mementos to Hortman”. A large blanket, laid out on the ground, allowed attendees to pen messages, per MPR.\n\nOne message reported by MPR said: “Melissa was a true model of humility. She didn’t do this work to boost her own ego, further her political career or garner fame and glory. She did it to improve people’s lives.”\n\nThe vigil’s organizers told attenders not to bring signs and decided not to have a speaking program. Walz said that Hortman should lie in state at Minnesota’s capitol, MPR said.\n\nThe Hortmans’ suspected killer, Vance Boelter, also stands accused of attempted murder for shooting state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin. Boelter, 57, faces state and federal charges for the fatal shootings.\n\nThe Hoffmans are recovering from their injuries. Authorities said that Boelter, who allegedly had a list of targets including other Democratic lawmakers and abortion rights advocates, traveled to two other legislators’ homes that evening – with plans to assassinate them.\n\nAttenders, some of whom knew the Hortmans personally or through her work, came from diverse political backgrounds. As Zack Stephenson, who co-chairs a state house budget committee, prepared to honor Hortman several hours before the vigil, he described their friendship.\n\nStephenson said that he met Melissa Hortman when he was 18, volunteering on her campaign. He worked closely with Hortman in the state house and described her as a mentor.\n\n“She was a leader who was not afraid to invest in other leaders. It didn’t threaten her,” Stephenson told the Guardian.\n\nHortman prioritized kindness in her work and told fellow Democrats in 2023 that they shouldn’t confuse kindness for weakness. They could be strong leaders and still be respectful and kind, Stephenson recalled her saying.\n\n“No one worked harder than her,” Stephenson said. “Those kind of timeless values of, be kind to people, work hard, care about the institution more than partisan politics, those things really matter. People saw that.”\n\nLynne Billing, of St Paul, Minnesota, told MPR she knew Melissa Hortman “was special and I knew she really cared about people”.\n\n“It’s just a huge, huge loss and I’m just here to say I’m going to miss her,” Billing said.\n\nWhile remembrances for the Hortmans have come from people of all political stripes, Donald Trump said he will not call Walz, adding that calling would “waste time”, AP said. Trump, in ruling out a call to Walz, described Minnesota’s governor as “slick” and “whacked out”.\n\n“I could call him and say: ‘Hi, how you doing?’” Trump reportedly said. “The guy doesn’t have a clue.

The former Mrs Michael Gove and her husband were \"terrifically matey\" with David and Sam in the \"early days of the Cameron ascent\". The couples holidayed in Ibiza, shared the school run and \"had a high old time\"; Vine had a \"girl crush\" on Sam.\nYet over time, she came to feel that she and Michael weren't quite good enough for their friends. As she found herself performing \"administrative duties\", or serving wine at the couple's drinks parties, she began to feel less like \"a friend\" than \"a fixer\" – or even \"staff\". Then came Gove's decision to back Leave, which ended the friendship for good. Now divorced, with fewer friends in high places, Vine wrote the book, she says, \"because she had nothing to lose\" – which is what makes it \"so brilliant\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

This memoir performs a valuable service in putting the \"record about him straight\" – while exposing Cameron's unprincipled cronyism. Yet in other ways, it's a \"strange book\". Vine lays a great deal of \"personal upset bare\" – including the misery her ex-husband's prominence caused to their children. Will they thank her for this in years to come? And as she \"harps on\" about the class differences between her and the Camerons, she reveals a \"chip on her shoulder the size of Yorkshire\". Cameron's \"father was a stockbroker, not the Duke of Devonshire\". She really should \"pull herself together\".\n\nIt is, in fact, the personal sections that make this book worth reading, said Gaby Hinsliff in The Guardian. Vine writes \"unsparingly and grippingly\" about her difficult childhood, her \"awful postnatal depression\", and the \"slow death\" of her marriage. When it comes to politics, she often loses perspective – writing of Brexit as if it were a minor \"political disagreement\", not a fundamental issue for the country.\nVine has made full use of her \"ringside seat at the heart of government\", offering \"piercing insights into those who lead us\", said A.N. Wilson in the Daily Mail. These are \"perhaps the most riveting political memoirs\" since Alan Clark published his diaries back in 1993.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nHow the Israel-Iran conflict broke out\n\nThe Explainer\nIsrael's strike on Iran's nuclear and missile programmes was years in the planning\n\nWho wants to be a millionaire?

That’s got to happen now. And I mean today. And if that can’t happen, we need to shift course.”\n\nPlease feel free to insert a “tee hee” after every paragraph.\n\nThe pro-child mutilation, antisemitic DNC’s money problems are equally glorious…\n\nSix people briefed on the party’s fund-raising, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss its finances frankly, said big donors — who are an essential part of the party’s funding — had been very slow to give to the party this year as Mr. Martin solicits contributions. His commitment to state parties, which amounts to $1 million in monthly spending, has further strained the finances.\n\nNow the pro-child mutilation, antisemitic DNC is talking about getting loans to cover expenses.\n\nThe Times reveals that the pro-child mutilation, antisemitic DNC’s cash reserves “shrank by $4 million from January through April,” while the RNC’s “coffers swelled by roughly $29 million.”\n\nCurrently, the pro-child mutilation, antisemitic DNC has just $18 in the bank, while the RNC has $67.4 million.\n\nMartin got one thing correct.\n\n“People invested more money than they ever had before [in the 2024 election], they dug deeper than they ever had, and they are quite frustrated by the result,” he said. “They want answers. I don’t take it personally. I wasn’t in charge.”\n\nCouldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of Jew haters and pro-child mutilators.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n“I don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.”\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n“The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question ‘What is Juneteenth?’” Morial said.\n\nWhat if you’ve never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nDr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n“I think many folks haven’t known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.”\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n\nAre there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.”\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n\n\nThe resulting Juneteenth holiday — its name combining “June” and “nineteenth” — has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries.

We’ve always been so grateful.\n\n\"To Barack and all the dads and father-figures celebrating today, Happy Father’s Day!\"\n\nThe couple celebrated a major milestone - their 32nd anniversary - in October last year.\n\nThe celebratory post also comes as the Becoming Netflix star previously slammed divorce rumors directly on various podcasts, last month stating that 'everyone would know' if they were separating while on The Diary of a CEO.\n\n\"If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it,\" she told Steven Bartlett, adding: \"I would be problem solving in public. I'm not a martyr.\"\n\nOn her own podcast, she revealed she skipped out on Trump's inauguration for a personal decision that was met with 'ridicule and criticism'.\n\n\"People couldn't believe that I was saying no for any other reason. They had to assume that my marriage was falling apart,\" she declared on her IMO podcast.\n\nThe Becoming author also appeared on Sophia Bush's Work in Progress podcast where she said she's simply been focusing on herself.\n\nMichelle revealed she felt some guilt for taking a step back from some public-facing duties, adding: \"That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people.\n\n\"I mean, so much so that this year people couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.\n\n\"This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that's what society does to us.\"\n\nExplaining further, she continued: \"I chose to do what was best for me. Not what I had to do. Not what I thought other people wanted me to do.\"\n\nAlthough her absence has been keenly felt in recent months, Michelle did deliver a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last summer where she told attendees of her home city, Chicago, to get behind the then-presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Hope is making a comeback,\" she said to the crowd at the time.\n\nAnd she hasn't bowed out of public life completely either as she said on the podcast she'll remain at the forefront of fighting for certain issues and working on projects close to her heart, adding: \"I still care about girls' education.\"","summary":"![CDATA[The former First Lady has broken her silence about the speculation]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/michelle-obama-addresses-divorce-rumors-995804-20250619","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt74b535eb62f7b5da/68540086807efdd5171bf42b/michelle-obama-telling-message-barack.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 12:43:29","author":"Liv Bridge","authors":["Liv Bridge"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":333070662,"title":"'Loyalty enforcer': Laura Loomer compiles list of MAGA faithful critical of Donal Trump","text":"MAGA influencer Laura Loomer is promoting herself as President Donald Trump’s hatchet man.\n\nLoomer claims she has been compiling a list of MAGA faithful who have been critical of Trump’s budget bill or his sudden un-MAGA interest in inserting the U.S. military into international politics, Daily Beast reports. Now she’s threatening to deliver that list to the White House.\n\nEarlier, Loomer called on her followers to “Take screenshots of every single right winger who is s--- talking Trump.”\n\nREAD MORE: Trump is following in the footsteps of the worst traitor in US history\n\n“I am screenshotting everyone’s posts and I’m going to deliver them in a package to President Trump so he sees who is truly with him and who isn’t,” she posted on X. “I think by now everyone knows I mean it when I say I’m going to deliver something to Trump. ... I am the loyalty enforcer.”\n\nCritics say Loomer, who is not a federal employees and has not been appointed to any division in Trump’s administration, already holds too much sway.

Experts say that as the talk of war heats up, Iran could launch a silent but deadly cyberattack on the US. Banks, hospitals, and other important systems may already be infected and waiting to be triggered, as the conflict approaches a crucial tipping pointAyatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, declared in a statement read by a television host that his nation would not abide by President Donald Trump's demand for an unconditional surrender.Iran has threatened to go to all-out war if the US joins the conflict after rejecting calls to abandon its nuclear program.James Knight, an expert on cybersecurity, believes that if tensions rise, Iran could launch a digital attack on US infrastructure. Although a long-term collapse is unlikely, Americans should remain vigilant, keep their devices up to date, and be prepared for potential short-term issues.What kind of cyberattack could Iran launch?If the US formally intervenes in the conflict between Israel and Iran, Americans should expect bank disruptions and possible blackouts, stated James Knight, as quoted in a report by the Daily Mail.The Iranian government may launch a last-ditch effort to exact revenge by activating malware that hackers have already implanted in US systems.Knight warned, We can anticipate some lone wolves who will want to carry out some sort of retaliation, even if the US does not get involved. Knight disclosed that in the digital sphere, this might entail several groups of Iranian hackers targeting vital US infrastructure, such as hospitals, power grids, banks, and oil pipelines.Knight clarified that major power plants and energy production facilities are the most likely targets of a cyberattack, which is more likely to cause chaos across the United States than to cause long-term damage.He remarked, It would be the retaliation, tit for tat, sort of attacks. Destroying things, resulting in blackouts. Knight clarified that each Iranian cyber unit has a distinct area of expertise, with some concentrating on stealing passwords, private data, and breaching large networks, such as hospitals, to target regular Americans.He said that hackers could access ICU medical devices and compromise a hospital receptionist's computer, causing life-saving equipment to be shut down across the country.Hackers might target digital currency platforms, payment processors, and American banks in the interim. They won't topple the United States. They're only trying to cause pain, he said.How can Americans protect themselves?Here are some public protection measures against hacking, as per James Knight.Be cautious of emails and set strong passwords.Regularly update computers and mobile devices with the latest security updates. Switch to multi-factor authentication by sending a secret code to a person's phone or email when logging into certain sites.Passkeys are a passwordless, phishing-resistant technology that uses cryptographic keys stored on a user's devices and authenticated using biometrics.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris won U.S elections 2024: U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi asked to investigate resultsCould malware already be inside U.S. systems?Iran has an advantage because, in anticipation of the impending conflict, their hackers have infected American computer networks with malicious malware.

Only when Iran feels it is absolutely necessary or when it has nothing left to lose in a conflict with the US do these malicious programs get activated.Iran is known to take credit for US defense breaches, often boasting about their plans.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Thursday announced his endorsement of Democrat Rebecca Cooke for Congress in Wisconsin’s 3rd District — making a foray into one of a handful of districts that could decide the next House majority, which President Donald Trump carried by 7 points less than a year ago. “Rebecca is a working class fighter who developed her populist roots in rural Western Wisconsin. A daughter of farmers, a waitress and a small business owner — she’s lived through failed policies from Washington elites and is ready to deliver tangible outcomes that working people will actually feel,” Sanders said in a statement shared first with NBC News. Sanders’ endorsement brings renewed national attention to a race that Cooke lost by less than 3 percentage points last year as GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden earned a second term. And it also highlights a notable cross-section of support for Cooke — who has also been endorsed by the Blue Dog Democrats' PAC, a longtime supporter of party moderates — as Democrats in Washington and around the country review the party's policy platforms, personalities and coalitions after they suffered defeat to Trump in the 2024 election. Cooke said in an interview that Sanders’ endorsement meant a lot to her because “Bernie really is no bulls---.” “He’s been able to pass legislation in the fray of Washington while remaining really true to his core values that center around the working class, and his voice has never really wavered,” she said. Cooke said she voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary and has valued his authenticity ever since. “Why wouldn’t I seek support from someone like that in an era, kind of, where nothing feels authentic, when Bernie really is?” she added. Last year, Cooke campaigned on a message focused largely on the economy and ran ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in her district. She also ran with the support of the New Democrat Coalition and Blue Dog Democrats, two groups of moderate congressional Democrats who tout their support for bipartisanship and working across the aisle. The Blue Dog PAC endorsed her again this month. Sanders followers and some Blue Dog types have clashed over the years over policy and the direction of the Democratic Party. Cooke acknowledged that “it could seem surprising, you know, to welcome an endorsement like that from Senator Sanders.” “But I really think that it’s important that we let go of purity tests in politics and that we stay disciplined on creating election wins,” she said, adding that in her campaign she hopes to shed the labels of “moderate” or “progressive” and gain support from a broad base of voters. “I am a Blue Dog and a new Dem, but I’m also very progressive where it counts,” Cooke said. “I don’t like the labels and the boxes that kind of have been created, because immediately, you know, you’re written off and ‘othered’ in your party because you’re this or because you’re that. And really, I’m just — I’m running because I’m for western Wisconsin, period.” The national stakes Democrats need a net gain of at least three districts to retake a majority in the House in 2026. And Wisconsin’s 3rd District is expected to be highly competitive again in 2026. It's one of just nine Republican-held House seats rated as toss-ups by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. As Cooke welcomes Sanders' support in a district Trump has carried three times, after Barack Obama and other Democratic presidential nominees carried it in previous elections, the Democratic Party is grappling with how to move forward from the 2024 election. Some Democrats — like Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts — have said Democrats alienated some voters in recent years by insisting that candidates agree with certain socially progressive norms and use “woke” language that not all voters understand. “We have to, you know, quit demonizing people along the political spectrum. Otherwise we’re, we’re never going to get there. We’re never going to achieve the things that we want to get done,\" Cooke said. Sanders, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, kicked off a nationwide “Fighting Oligarchy” tour this year, rallying with voters across the country and urging Democrats to fight Trump and his allies and to listen to voters’ concerns about the economy. Sanders made several stops in Wisconsin, including in Eau Claire County, which is in the 3rd District. Sanders' endorsement statement praised Cooke as a potential \"partner in Congress\" who shares his goal of \"building opportunities for the working class.\" \"She will be an ally to me in the House as she works to enforce antitrust laws against corporate monopolies that have bankrupted family farms like hers, raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage and expand Medicare to cover vision, dental and hearing,\" Sanders said in the statement. He has already thrown his support behind several other candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. They include Maine’s former state Senate president Troy Jackson, who is running for governor; Michigan Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed; and Michigan state Rep. Donavan McKinney, who is challenging Rep. Shri Thanedar in the Democratic primary in a Detroit-area district. On Monday, Sanders also backed New York state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in next week’s New York mayoral primary.","summary":"Sen.

Responding to a question about his presidential ambitions, Newsom said, “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”\n\nThat’s in keeping with the time-worn playbook for politicians who look in the mirror and see a president staring back. They shun naked ambition and portray themselves as reluctantly offering to serve the nation in its moment of crisis, whatever that might be.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Newsom, in an address broadcast live by CNN, warned that Trump’s sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented immigrants was such a crisis, saying “other states are next.”\n\n“This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”\n\nNewsom uttered a similar theme in his Wall Street Journal interview. “I have a responsibility to combine passion with action, to stand tall and firm and defend the values that I hold dear, that I think the vast majority of Americans hold dear, and assert myself in this moral moment,” he said.\n\nTrump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to Newsom, providing a springboard for him to fill a vacuum and claim leadership of the opposition to Trump. The Democratic Party has been unable, in the seven months since losing the White House, to curb its internal power struggles. Nor have political media anointed any of the potential candidates to succeed Trump as the frontrunner.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Newsom, who has been cultivating a national image ever since winning re-election in 2022, would probably start ahead of most would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhether he would finish ahead, and go on to win the presidency, is another matter. The road to the White House is long and winding, with plenty of opportunities to stumble — as the career of another Californian, Kamala Harris, attests.\n\nAssuming that Newsom’s hints mean he’s a candidate, in the final 18 months of his governorship he’ll be juggling a day job and a side gig, which is likely to diminish his standing in California, which is mediocre at best.\n\nA recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that by a 2-1 margin, California voters already believe Newsom is more focused on running for president than in fixing the state’s problems.\n\n“People kind of look at him as being very ambitious,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said about Newsom.\n\nA Newsom presidential campaign would be something of a referendum on California. Its serious social and economic problems, which have not markedly improved during Newsom’s governorship, would be campaign fodder for Democratic rivals and, if he were to win the nomination, for the Republican candidate.\n\nVideo clips of California cities’ squalid encampments of the homeless, the smash-and-grab robberies and the sometimes violent demonstrations against Trump’s immigration sweeps would bolster the sour image that those in other states already have of California. Elect Newsom, his rivals would say, if you want the nation to emulate California.\n\nBeing a Californian was one of the burdens Harris could not overcome last year. An ad featuring her advocacy of giving conversion surgery to transgender prison inmates was, it’s widely believed, the single most effective spot of the campaign.\n\nSaddle up. Win or lose, a Newsom campaign for the White House would be a bumpy ride.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Trump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to the governor, providing him a springboard to fill leadership vacuum.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/19/walters-gavin-newsom-contemplating-run-president/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRN-L-ELIAS-COL-0509-1.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 10:15:50","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":333130492,"title":"Where's the music that meets this moment? Black artists are stepping up","text":"It’s been one year since Kendrick Lamar took the Kia Forum stage in Inglewood for “The Pop Out: Ken and Friends,” the first in a series of highly publicized victory laps that have come at the expense of his deflated rival, Drake. Their rap battle began more than a decade ago, and the two heavyweights exchanged subtle lyrical jabs until the gloves came off in the winter of 2023. By the following spring, they were exchanging a flurry of scathing diss tracks, each diving deeper into the other’s personal life. The fight was competitive until K-Dot landed the haymaker. It wasn’t the chart performance of “Not Like Us” that declared Lamar the winner. No recording artist has more Billboard Hot 100 entries than Drake. In fact, he has more appearances on the chart than Michael Jackson, Elvis and the Beatles combined. When it comes to talent and commercial success, Drake is unquestionably among the greats. The reason Lamar was able to knock him out was because Drake’s authenticity couldn’t take a punch. That’s not just my score card. That’s what the culture was feeling. Lamar performed “Not Like Us” five times during that Juneteenth show last year and dropped the accompanying music video on the Fourth of July. By the time Vice President Kamala Harris was playing it at her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee in Atlanta, every sporting event in America was playing that song. Yes, the “A-minor” double entendre was catchy, and it is always good to have Mustard on the beat. But what elevates “Us” is the same thing that grounds the artist who wrote it — an unapologetic defense of the culture and the people from which the art originates. As the saying goes: “Everybody wants to sing our blues. Nobody wants to live our blues.” For Lamar, the decadelong rap battle stems from his lifelong disdain for gangster cosplay and the vacuous monetizing of Black culture. As the diss tracks between the two progressed, it was clear Drake was still trying to win a rap battle — while Lamar was inspiring a conversation beyond their beef, rap music and even the entertainment industry. At the heart of Lamar’s surgical evisceration of Drake’s brand of artistry is a question all creatives must ask of themselves at some point: What am I doing this for? * * * Few inflection moments in American history have shaped our society quite like the convergence of war, technological advancement, old-fashioned prejudice and artistic expression during the summer of 1969. From the Apollo moon landing and Woodstock to the Stonewall riots and the Harlem Cultural Festival, there wasn’t a disciple or demographic that was not directly affected over that stretch. It was during the summer of 1969 when the great Nina Simone gave a concert on the campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta after the school’s most famous alumnus — the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — had been assassinated the year before. Simone joined other artists there to offer the students encouragement. That summer she also debuted the song “To Be Young, Gifted and Black” and performed it during the Harlem Cultural Festival. Her contemporaries Donny Hathaway and Aretha Franklin soon recorded their own versions of the song — not because of its chart success, but because of its purpose. “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said after her Morehouse performance. “How can you be an artist and not reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.” Indeed, after Bob Dylan asked “how many years can some people exist before they’re allowed to be free?” in his 1962 protest song, “Blowin’ in the Wind,” Sam Cooke was inspired to declare “it’s been a long time coming, but I know change is gonna come” in 1963. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham pushed Simone to write her first protest song in 1964: “Mississippi Goddam.” By the summer of 1969, she was known as much for her work in the civil rights movement as for her music. Simone still wrote songs about love, heartache, those sorts of things. However, the reason her legacy still looms large today (the Irish singer Hozier named his third EP after her in 2018) is that Simone was also willing to use her art to reflect the times. Not sure if you’ve looked around the country recently, but the times we live in are a-changing. And just as was the case in the summer of 1969, the summer of 2025 finds the U.S. at a convergence of war (Ukraine-Russia/Israel-Gaza-Iran) and technological advancement (especially artificial intelligence) and old-fashioned prejudice (indiscriminate ICE raids). However, in this updated version of America, the White House has taken over the Kennedy Center, has cut off National Endowment for the Arts grants, has threatened the broadcast licenses of news networks and is holding a guillotine over Big Bird’s head. Because of President Trump’s unprecedented hostility toward long-standing cultural and academic institutions, there is a question of how far tech and media executives will allow today’s artists to reflect the times we’re living in. “I think it’s hard today to get a feel for the totality of what people are feeling because there’s so much out there to consume,” documentarian and author Nelson George told me. “The Chuck D who’s 25, right now, I don’t hear him. The Tracy Chapman of this era. Do we really not have voices that are saying something or are we not getting access to those people? All those songs from other moments in history, I’m surprised there hasn’t been an anthem for this time yet.” Comedian Roy Wood Jr. said he feels that in his line of work, “resistance humor or educating humor” works best in television because “TV is a reflection of who we are, where I feel like movies are what we wish we could be or were.” The host of CNN’s “Have I Got News for You” also said because of the political climate we’re in, instead of challenging us to learn or grow as a culture, TV executives are “canceling a lot of the shows that really focused on serious societal issues because there’s a pushback against those types of topics.” Big Sean, whose 2013 project with Lamar is pegged as the starting point of the Drake beef, said there was significance to Lamar’s “pop out” appearing on Juneteenth, the federal holiday marking the end of slavery in the U.S. “I feel like being Black is awesome.… We worked as a people to get there, to feel like that,” he told me. “That’s why I’m so thankful for the people that said I’m Black and I’m proud.” And that James Brown vibe is the type of art Big Sean said he is currently working on, the kind that uplifts and gives listeners hope. Lamar’s Juneteenth show was livestreamed on Prime and became Amazon Music’s most-watched production. For Ben Watkins, creator of the Prime TV series “Cross,” the success of Lamar’s performance — along with his Super Bowl show and current tour with SZA — is proof there is a hunger for authentic Black artistic expression in this current political environment. As he was putting together the TV show, Watkins said, he told everyone involved: “I’m going to do a Black man with swagger, I’m going to show D.C. to its fullest and I’m going to honestly talk about some of the controversies and contradictions of a Black cop.” The reaction? “That sounds great to us.” “Cross” premiered the week after the 2024 election and for 100 days it was among Prime Video’s top 10 most-watched series. Grammy winner Ledisi said she wasn’t planning on writing a political anthem when she began composing “BLKWMN” for her latest album. However, her tribute to the resolve of Black women was embraced as an anthem after its release in February. “I wasn’t thinking of any of that, just creating,” she told me. “When you’re truly creating … you just have an intention of releasing whatever that feeling is. I’m glad it resonated with the times.” Even before the song took off, Ledisi unexpectedly found herself in the middle of social media attacks for daring to sing the National Black Anthem at this year’s Super Bowl. That’s why when she sang a couple of lines from one of Lamar’s anthems during a recent tour stop in Chicago, I couldn't help but feel it was more a word of encouragement for herself and the predominantly Black audience than it was a nod to a commercially successful track. That week Trump announced plans to resurrect names from the Confederacy on public land. Just hours before Ledisi took the stage, “No Kings” protesters came marching by, followed closely by local police. Their chants echoed loudly throughout the North Loop, their passion forcing those shopping and dining near the river to take notice. The concrete walls and thick glass designed to rebuke Chicago’s winter could not keep out the cries of the people. Later that night Ledisi, whose Nina Simone tribute album was nominated for a Grammy in 2021, looked up in the balcony, smiled — and visibly exhaled. “We gon’ be all right,” she sang to a full Chicago Theatre house. “We gon’ be all right.” * * * Few inflection moments in American history have shaped our society quite like the convergence of war, technological advancement and old-fashioned prejudice during the summer of 1865. The second round of the Industrial Revolution was on the horizon, the Confederacy was on its last legs, and the first Juneteenth celebration was born. However, while the Civil War was all over, racism managed to emerge from the wreckage unscathed. In fact, a Confederate journalist by the name of Edward A. Pollard began working on a revisionist history book that painted the South as noble and slavery as unimportant to their way of life. Pollard’s piece of fake news, “The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates,” was completed before President Andrew Johnson had even declared the war officially over. And to this day there are elected officials from former Confederate states who repeat untruths about the war that originated from Pollard, an enslaver. Today there are state holidays in honor of men who fought against this country because for some white people it still feels better to believe Pollard’s lies about the Confederacy than to accept the truth about America. Historically this is where creatives have come in, using artistic expression to fill in the gaps in our understanding of one another. Sometimes the art is profitable. A few times it hits No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller list or Billboard chart. More often than not, it is underappreciated. However, art that reflects an authentic lived experience is always necessary. It is both the spark that can ignite a fire and the coolant that prevents us all from overheating.

But for the time being, she says she’s speaking out against “this administration’s campaign of censorship and control.”\n\n“It is my responsibility to respond to these attacks on the First Amendment,” Gomez told a small gathering in Eastern Kentucky on Wednesday. “I refuse to stay quiet while the government chips away at fundamental rights by weaponizing our regulatory authority.”\n\nGomez is one of three current commissioners — the only Democrat among them — overseeing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), an independent federal agency that regulates a broad range of communications industries, including television, radio, satellite, internet and cable.\n\nTraditionally, the agency has overseen the licensing of television and radio stations, taken on initiatives such as combating robocalls and worked to expand internet access across the country. But actions launched by the FCC in the months since the Trump administration has returned to power have greatly troubled Gomez.\n\nUnder FCC chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican confirmed by the U.S. Senate during President Donald Trump’s first term, the regulator has launched investigations into public media stations’ use of sponsorships; opened a probe into the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Comcast, the parent company for NBC News; and revived complaints that media coverage was biased against Trump.\n\n”The FCC has targeted the editorial decisions of news networks, independent reporting by public media and internal labor practices by private companies. These are dangerous and unprecedented actions by an independent government regulator,” Gomez said.\n\nGomez has embarked on a nationwide tour advocating for First Amendment rights and speaking out against what she sees as Trump administration actions to undermine those rights. Her first two stops were in two of the country’s largest cities, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., but her latest stop Wednesday was at a community center in the Letcher County community of Fleming-Neon, population around 500.\n\nShe said recent FCC actions are especially troubling because media corporations targeted by Trump and the FCC also have business before the FCC.\n\nOne example Gomez poses: CBS News and its parent company Paramount.\n\nOne of the FCC’s revived complaints over media coverage centers on CBS News’ “60 Minutes” news magazine show. Trump had sued the show over claims that an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was deceitfully edited, something CBS News’ parent company Paramount has denied.\n\nParamount is trying to settle the Trump lawsuit at the same time it is seeking approval from the Trump-appointed FCC for a merger with media company Skydance. As lawsuit settlement discussions continue, both the executive producer of “60 Minutes” and the president and CEO of CBS News have resigned. Bill Owens, the 60 Minutes executive producer, had said he could no longer lead the show independently.\n\n“The FCC is supposed to make decisions based on law, facts and technical expertise, not politics,” Gomez said. “We need journalists who feel free to report the truth even when it cuts against our own political biases, and corporate parents who give journalists the independence they need.”\n\nThe Lantern sought the FCC’s response to Gomez’s criticisms by emailing an address associated with Republican FCC Chair Carr but received no response by late Wednesday.\n\nGomez also doesn’t know how long she’ll be in her position. Other members of independent agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Commission have been fired by Trump this year. She said she checks her email daily to see if she’s next, even though she plans to continue her tour even if the Trump administration seeks to remove her.\n\n“I don’t know why I haven’t been fired. I have not been quiet,” Gomez said.\n\n‘Speak their truth’\n\nOther members of the panel Gomez joined in Letcher County were also not quiet in advocating for rights protected by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom to petition one’s government with grievances.\n\nOther panelists included a journalist, a church deacon, a former Democratic Kentucky state representative and the leaders of Letcher County nonprofits Appalshop, the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center and the Center for Rural Strategies which organized the event.\n\n“People being able to speak their truth is what is going to really be healing for our country,” said Tiffany Sturdivant, the executive director of the media, arts and education center Appalshop in Whitesburg. “I want us to really, really be brave. Freedom of speech is to me — it’s about telling the truth and not being afraid of that.”\n\nWading through the near-instant accessibility of information and news sources is a different challenge, though. Sturdivant said people should try to “seek out the truth for themselves” and have conversations in person and in their communities beyond social media.\n\nWhile stereotypes about Eastern Kentucky are perpetuated in the national media, she said, there can be “something special” about having an in-person conversation that can dispel those narratives.\n\nWes Addington, executive director of the nonprofit law firm Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, told the gathered audience that it was up to people to continue to advocate for the right to petition one’s government — specifically in court before a judge.\n\nAnother panelist, author and former Democratic Kentucky state Rep. Bill Weinberg, mentioned how Elon Musk had at one point called for the impeachment of judges who defy or delay the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul the federal government.\n\nAddington responded by saying while some court decisions go down in history as deplorable — such as the U.S. Supreme Court allowing the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — decisions can be reversed. But not abiding by decisions in real time is “when you cross that line.”\n\n“When the decisions of the Supreme Court become something you can decide in the moment whether you’re going to follow or not,” Addington said, “that’s when you lose what this country was founded on.”\n\nGomez said hearing from the other panelists reaffirmed her belief in the need for journalism and the need to protect journalism.\n\n“A lot of people that I speak to tell me they’re tired. It’s a little too soon to be tired,” Gomez said. “We need to take care of our precious liberties, and the way that we do that is by being aware and by speaking up and pushing back.”\n\nKentucky Lantern is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

How many of our country’s problems could be solved by breaking up monopolies? Could the left and right team up against Silicon Valley? My guest today is Lina Khan, the former head of the Federal Trade Commission, and the face of a movement against corporate power in America. Lina Khan, welcome to Interesting Times. Thanks so much for having me. It’s a great pleasure. So we’re sitting here, we are inside the headquarters of one of the biggest newspapers in the world. We’re conducting an interview that has been enabled by iPhones and MacBooks, products made by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. After we leave this interview, I am going to get on a train and order for my family a succession of large items on amazon.com - diapers, paper towels, and so on. And then I will get home and get in a Toyota, possibly stop at Target before I get back to my house, and basically have an entire day lived in the shadow of big business, and I won’t think twice about it. In spite of having some kind of localist agrarian sympathies somewhere deep in my conservative soul. And I think that’s true of how many, many Americans live. So I want you to tell me: what is wrong- or what can be wrong- with big business. So antimonopoly, as a philosophy and framework really adopts a skeptical posture towards unchecked concentrations of economic power. And it’s basically a corollary to how we think about the need for checks and balances in our political sphere. And there was a recognition that, in the way we overthrew a monarch to safeguard core liberties and freedoms, we had to protect ourselves from autocrats of trade and the entities that had come to dominate key arteries of commerce and communications. And so we passed the antitrust and antimonopoly laws as a way to try to safeguard those freedoms. I think the other important thing to remember is how our markets are structured is not some inevitability. It’s deeply the product of laws and rules and policy choices that are enforcers are making. Evidence shows time and time again that when you have a reduction in competition in markets, firms can abuse that power. It can result in higher prices for consumers. It can mean lower wages for workers. It can mean fewer opportunities for small businesses and independent businesses. And it can also ultimately lead people to feel less free if they feel that in their day to day lives, they don’t have real choice, and firms can get away with abusing their power. So there can be a range of problems more generally that emerge when you have markets that are dominated by a handful of firms that are not checked, either by competition or by rules that limit their ability to coerce and abuse. So that’s an answer that weaves political and economic arguments together, and I want to slightly separate them in framing the discussion, and then we can reconnect them as we go along. So on the economic side, right, it feels like we’ve lived through a period, let’s say, over the last 15 years of chronic economic discontent in American life, that just in the last 10 or 15 years, that has yielded up Donald Trump’s populism as a critique of Republican orthodoxies on issues ranging from entitlement reform to free trade. It yielded up the Bernie Sanders revolution in 2016. that did not take over the Democratic Party, but certainly disrupted it. But there’s also a way in which this discontent has seemed often kind of inchoate, and it ping-ponged around between different issues: Is it wage stagnation that people are upset about? Is it health care costs? Is it deindustrialization? And I guess I want to do you think that antimonopoly and the critique of big business is a kind of master key to understanding economic discontent in our time? I think the issue of unchecked corporate power sits upstream from a lot of the problems that people face in their day-to-day lives. Of course, antitrust and even antimonopoly are just one set of policy tools, and so you need other policy levers to create markets that are really serving working people in their day-to-day lives. But I do think we’ve seen this issue of monopoly power, of incumbents that are not being checked by competition and therefore can get away with making products worse, making prices higher, not feeling a pressure to really serve their customers or compete for workers. It also has been reflected in issues around resiliency. We saw during the pandemic, we routinely hear from senior members of the Defense Department that extreme consolidation has also made our supply chains much more brittle. And so the manifestations of this problem are manifold and show themselves in all sorts of areas. OK give me give me a couple of concrete examples. So if I said to you I’m unhappy about how health works in America, what is the monopoly related corporate consolidation related piece of that. So there are so many different monopoly stories happening in the health care system. We’ve seen time and time again consolidation of hospital systems. And practically that has meant that prices are higher for people. It has meant that service is worse. We’ve also seen the emergence of these middlemen, these pharmacy benefit managers that basically connect the pharmaceutical companies with the pharmacists, with the insurers. We’ve seen in the FTC’s lawsuits have shown this, that the practices by these firms have resulted in skyrocketing costs, including for things like insulin. The FTC’s work, when I was there, uncovered all sorts of patenting tricks by big pharma companies that were keeping out generics, including for things like asthma inhalers, which have been around for decades. But too often Americans were having to pay out of pocket hundreds of dollars, even though in other countries, people pay as little as $7. So that’s just a snapshot of some of the problems that results from a lack of competition. One of the other big problems that I heard a lot about including from health care workers, was the expansion of private equity into health care markets. I would hear routinely from ER doctors, for example, about how the expansion of private equity there had meant that there were all these punishing quotas, and ER doctors would have to think twice about whether they’d be able to comfort a grieving mother who had just lost her kid or have to move on to the next patient. And so there are all sorts of cost effects here in terms of people are paying more. We are seeing literal wealth transfers from Americans to these health care companies, in part because of a lack of competition. But it also manifests in all sorts of other ways in terms of degradation of service doctors feeling like they don’t have autonomy to really do what is best for their patients and are instead having to follow these dictates of these distant giants that don’t even have a presence in the community. That’s a good that’s a good economic argument. Now let’s talk about politics for a minute. Because one of the things we’re going to get into is that Lina Khan thought, if you will. Has, I think, emphasized the role that thinking about political influence should have in antitrust that it’s not just about where prices are set and economic outcomes. And so on. It’s also just about the sheer power that a really big and powerful company can have in a Democratic society. So I want you to make that concrete. Yeah I mean, I would say, first of all, I think the economic and the political are not such sharp dichotomies. I think there is actually a gray zone in terms of how people experience the economic effects in ways that affect their own politics and their own sense of agency. But big picture we see, monopoly power affect our politics in a whole set of ways. They can play an outsized role in our elections, in our political system, in slightly more subtle ways. These firms end up just having much more of a presence in DC, where even outside of the electoral cycle, their views, their preferences, what issues they do want a member to take on versus not ends up being just much more dominant. And that can really deeply skew and distort how elected officials, how policymakers even understand what problems exist out in our economy. I heard Congresswoman Gluesenkamp Perez recently make this point that when she has somebody just to be clear, that’s the moderate Democratic Congresswoman from the state of Washington. That’s right, that’s right. And she mentioned that when she has somebody come talk to her, one of the first filters she uses is this person being paid to come talk to me, or is this somebody who’s had to take off time from work. Have to arrange somebody else to do a daycare pickup. And that ends up being very telling to her about how she should weigh somebody’s view and opinion. More generally, we see how large corporations can also use their leverage to push back against state and local policies that they don’t like. We’ve seen big business, including big tech companies, threaten to leave certain countries if those countries pass laws that would provide more protections for their citizens. And so we can see some real hardball tactics as well. I think more generally, and this is especially true in areas where the government and the public ends up having outsized dependence on a single firm. It can really allow those firms to call the shots, to make certain demands and really affect the public and the government in a negative way. Alright, let’s go back in time to your younger days and talk about basically the development of the contemporary school of antitrust. So you were in college during the financial crisis, is that right. So that’s I mean, talk about the financial crisis for a minute and how it affected your thinking, because it seems like it’s an example of where a lot of Americans were suddenly confronted with this idea of too big to fail as a problem of bigness that was not related necessarily to the prices that they were paying for goods or anything like that, but ended up having tremendous consequences for the economy. So the financial crisis made an impression on me in a few ways. First, it seemed to illustrate a situation where a certain domain that was viewed as appropriate, just for high level economists and experts ended up blowing up the economy. And it turned out that actually, this was an area that had deserved much more public scrutiny and was not something we had just said. The experts will take care of it because that ended up being pretty disastrous. And so that I think at a basic level, seeded in me a desire to really try to probe some of these areas that are treated as kind of too complex or too opaque. I think similarly, both the lead up to the financial crisis, but also its aftermath, made a big impression on me. In terms of showing what public accountability did or did not look like. There were a handful of large financial institutions and a handful of financial executives that made decisions that ended up being deeply destabilizing for a vast majority of people in this country. I mean, we had millions of foreclosures, and in law school, I ended up representing some of the homeowners that were being foreclosed on by the banks. There was so much rampant fraud there in terms of what the banks were able to get away with and in terms of who ended up bearing the costs of that fraud and those mistakes. It was overwhelmingly working families and less so the individuals at the banks or the banks themselves. And so both of those components ended up making a big impression on me and just seeded in me more of a desire to study markets and figure out what was really going on. And did you think that the Obama administration’s response to the financial crisis was ultimately unsuccessful. Because a lot it seems like a certain amount of left populist perspectives on American life actually have their origins in that 2008 to 2010 period, and in this sense that maybe the Obama administration, in its desire to stabilize the economy, either let Wall Street get away with certain things that it shouldn’t have, or to your example about foreclosures basically did too much for the big banks and not enough or even counterproductive things for ordinary homeowners. Is that what’s your perspective on looking back on the Obama years or especially the first term. Yeah, I mean, I try to have some humility about what people in those leadership positions were faced with when looking at it was not a good time. It was not a good time. And you’re having to make decisions with incomplete information on really compressed timelines and with potentially catastrophic outcomes on the table. And so I have an appreciation for just what those decision making moments can look like. In hindsight, it does seem clear that the recovery ended up being much slower, in part because there were real fears of excessive stimulation. And I think from the perspective of homeowners, the policy was not one that was kind to them. And the foreclosures ended up, I think, having a huge effect on both people’s material lives, but also their political understanding of who our government really serves and who ends up bearing the costs when the big bank screwed up. And this is also a point of origin, I think, for right wing populism, too, though, in a peculiar way, because in certain ways, the Tea Party movement kicks off famously with the Rick Santelli going on a rant complaining about homeowners being bailed out. The idea being that the homeowners had taken out these reckless mortgages and the government shouldn’t be bailing them out. But there was always I think, a kind of blend in Tea Party politics of this libertarian zeal, on the one hand. But then something that I think overlaps with politics on the left, this sense that corporate America or Wall Street got away with something and Main Street was left holding the bag. I think that’s right. The financial crisis also seemed to really force us to reckon with the market fundamentalism that had reigned Supreme in both parties, candidly, for the most part since the Reagan years, the idea at its core that the market will get it right and will figure it out. And when in doubt, the best thing for the government to do is to get out the way. And inasmuch as we are seeing a contestation and a revisiting of some of those core assumptions in both parties, I think some of that stems from the financial crisis as well. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think there’s some reasons to argue a little bit about to what extent market fundamentalism was ever purely dominant, but we can get into that in a few minutes. So to go on with the story, right. So you worked at a think tank for a while after college, and you went to Yale Law School while in Yale Law. You wrote what ended up becoming a famous, somewhat famous essay by the standards of law review essays about Amazon and antitrust. And the argument there was, in part, a critique and a reaction against how antitrust policy, how antimonopoly policy had been done and thought about in American life since the 1970s and 1980s. So can you talk a little bit about what was the antitrust consensus of the Reagan to Clinton to Obama years. And what was the argument against that consensus. So before the 1980s, there had been a whole set of antitrust laws that were broadly around protecting fair competition, and there were all sorts of ways that competition was evaluated. And generally there was a skepticism of unchecked concentration and a view, more or less, that the government should play a pretty assertive role in trying to prevent extreme consolidation and trying to prevent monopolization and trying to prevent monopoly abuse. Starting as early as the 40s and 50s, there started to be a critique of that. Initially, these scholars were pretty fringe, but especially once the Reagan administration came into power. A lot of these views ended up getting a lot of traction, and the short of it was a view that the antitrust laws were incoherent and ineffective in promoting competition, and instead, they should be much more permissive in allowing consolidation and allowing monopoly. And starting in the 80s, we just saw huge waves of consolidation. That meant that industry after industry, where a few decades ago you had dozens of competitors. Increasingly you just have a few. And sometimes the extent of this consolidation can be masked, because if you go to a grocery store and you go to the laundry detergent aisle or the chip aisle or the candy aisle, you’ll see a lot of brands, but a lot of those brands, you’ll see a lot of brands, you’ll see a lot of plans. You’ll see a lot of brands, a lot of brands, but they’re just controlled by two or three companies in market after market. Be it laundry detergent or even areas like chips or candies or snacks. And so that extensive consolidation is the direct result of a policy pivot. A pretty radical policy pivot that was made in the early 80s and that was pretty much in place, including through the Obama administration. And look, no doubt we saw slight modifications, slight changes in emphasis, but especially when it came to policing mergers, but also policing abuse of monopoly power, there was a huge presumption against the government intervening, again, because there was this idea that more or less markets will self-correct. So I want you to play political pundit for a minute, because I want us to talk about how some of these ideas actually entered into American politics and captured the imagination of people who were not economists, who were voters and politicians and activists and others. And I think it had a lot to do with the rise of Silicon Valley and the emergence of these new large scale formations of corporate power that just hadn’t been there before. And my sense of the story is that this is not at all a neat right left story that you had for a period of time. The Obama administration, while skeptical of consolidation in some ways, was very friendly to Silicon Valley. You have Donald Trump running for president in 2016, not as an anti-monopolist but as a more anti-corporate. I’m going to be on the side of workers Republican than we’d seen before. Trump doesn’t govern that way, really, in his first term, but certainly threaded through his administration. There’s this skepticism of Silicon Valley, in particular, as kind of a bastion of progressivism. So you have that skepticism. But then you also just have this really strong swing on the left. From my perspective, that seems to happen from the mid Tens to the point when Joe Biden is elected, when suddenly Silicon Valley is seen as a threatening and dangerous and destabilizing force, and it becomes kind of the focus in a lot of debate of some of these anti-monopolistic arguments that you’ve been offering. So why do you think that swing happened as a political matter. A few things happened to my mind. The 2016 election was a bit of a wake up moment, I think, especially for the Democratic Party. But both sides, in terms of seeing very clearly how a handful of dominant platforms wielded enormous sway over their ability to shape public opinion, over their ability to decide what gets seen and heard in the 21st century public sphere, and a recognition that these companies were not meaningfully checked by competition. And oftentimes it was just the whims or the idiosyncrasies of a single CEO that could end up having massive public ramifications. And so there was a reckoning with that concentration of power and what it would mean. There was also just a greater groundswell of reporting that was coming out about the other ways that these firms were abusing their platforms, including through things like surveilling kids, collecting all sorts of data on kids, getting people addicted to social media. And so the social costs and especially effects on children ended up catalyzing more skepticism towards these firms as well. I think on the politics, there was just a raw reckoning with the exercise of power that we were seeing from these firms. The third thing I would note is that a through line across these big tech companies is that they came to dominate key arteries of Commerce and communications. They ended up becoming gatekeepers. And that meant that you had all sorts of users that were dependent on them, but you also had businesses, major Fortune 500 businesses that all of a sudden were also suddenly dependent on the whims of a Google or Amazon, and could see how a single tweak of the algorithm could end up being devastating. And so I think there was actually a broader political coalition that was able to bring attention to the power of these firms in a broader set of just political interests that were being harmed. But there was also, I think, a kind of tension on the Democratic side, where so on the Republican side, especially during the COVID era, the right became intensely focused on the idea that these companies had outsized power to police the boundaries of speech and the way they were going to police it because Silicon Valley leaned progressive, was going to be left wing and was going to be hostile to the right. And on the liberal side, it seemed like there was kind of a mixed feeling. There were people who took what I would take to be your view that and would say, O.K, the things that conservatives are upset about with these platforms are themselves the result monopolistic power. And so we should talk to conservatives and create a united front around some of these issues. But then there were also plenty of liberals and Democrats who were like, Yes, these are incredibly powerful companies that have the capacity to police speech on the internet, and we should tell them to do it right. We should effectively create public private partnerships to fight back against disinformation and misinformation, because that is the great threat of our age. Am I describing a tension that you see in Democratic politics. Because it really seemed like there were lots of Democrats who around 2020, 2021, were perfectly happy to have Facebook or Twitter exerting lots of power over politics as long as they were doing it on the progressive side of things. It’s fair to say that there were different views about how we should respond to this extreme concentration of power. There were people that thought it was the concentrated power itself that was the problem, because we shouldn’t want a handful of executives to get to make these calls in the first instance. And there were others that thought, maybe it’s inevitable that we’re going to see this consolidation, or maybe it’s just easier if we befriend them and get them to do our bidding instead. And do you think the anti consolidation side won. What do you mean by won. Well there’s no permanent victories in politics. But which do you think was more powerful in the Biden administration. And we can talk about your work there. So you became head of the FTC under Joe Biden. And how did you how did you see your purpose in that role. So I took the helm in summer of 2021. Had a bipartisan vote, had come to the job after years of writing about how I thought agencies like the FTC had been too hands off, had been sometimes ineffective, and what we really needed was a reinvigorated approach to antitrust and consumer protection. And so I viewed that reinvigoration as being a core part of my mandate, practically. That took the form of a whole set of things. Partly, it was making sure we were using the tools that Congress gave us, stunningly at the FTC, as well as at a set of other agencies. There are all sorts of areas of dormant authority, parts of the law, or sometimes even entire laws that enforcers decided they just didn’t think were wise to enforce or were no longer fashionable. And so a core thing that we tried to do was just make sure we were doing what Congress had charged the agency with doing, which was enforcing without fear or favor the law prohibiting unfair methods of competition, for example, or a law that was supposed to make it easier to penalize companies when they lied about their products being made in America. It also meant, from my perspective, broadening the aperture of how the FTC even figured out what problems existed in markets and in the economy. One of the criticisms that the FTC had faced in the 2010s was that it had become myopic and was focusing on things like practices by ice skating teachers or church organists, and instead had been on the sidelines for some of the biggest incidents of corporate abuse in the 21st century, be it the subprime mortgage crisis, be it for profit schools that were preying on students. And so making sure we were actually using our tools to address the biggest pain points for people, be it in, be it in tech markets where people had become very dependent on these firms, be it in areas like food and agriculture. And so those were just kind of two of the governing pivots that I’ve really focused on. Generally, as you would expect, as a Democratic appointee, most of your fans were Democrats and most of your critics were Republicans. But there was both a quite vocal contingent of Democrats, particularly corporate and corporate adjacent Democrats who were pretty anti-Lincoln. And then there was a group of populist Republicans who tended to sometimes at least say nice things about you, including figures as diverse as now the vice president of the United States, JD Vance, Matt Gaetz, Josh Hawley and others, I guess. What is your perspective on populist Republican sympathy for this agenda. To what extent is it real. To what extent did it matter to your work. What areas was it most notable in. If it was real. So it absolutely seemed real in the sense of reflecting genuine concern about unchecked corporate power. It was most prominent in issues relating to technology markets, both for issues of how are these companies getting to call the shots about who gets heard and seen, but also around issues relating to data brokers and just this vast surveillance apparatus that we’re seeing by these private, opaque companies. And so for people who are very averse to the government being able to surveil you, there was a recognition that allowing all of these data brokers to surveil us is as equally dangerous. So that was one big area of bipartisan concern. The other big area was this issue of the hollowing out of parts of America that were resulting from independent businesses not being able to get a fair shake. So there were a whole set of issues where we saw strong bipartisan concern. And one of the biggest areas, we actually saw it on the ground. Where was this issue of non-competes? These contractual provisions that basically limit your ability to freely go work for another company or go start your own business. When the FTC proposed a rule that would ban non-competes, we got 25,000 comments from people all across the country. Some of these comments would say things like, I’m a lifelong Republican, a hard core free market capitalist, but if the FTC bans non-competes, it’ll be the best thing government has ever done. And so there was just a recognition that there are all sorts of artificial ways that people’s liberty is being constrained because of unchecked corporate power. And if the FTC is going to take that on, that’s going to be very popular and materially improve people’s lives. But there is still like a fundamental, I think, philosophical disagreement between the kind of capaciousness the scale of your view of what the FTC should be up to and any kind of conventional free market vision. And maybe this is most manifest in the fact that you lost a lot of court cases your record at the FTC in terms of court decisions, M was not one of constant victories. Why was that. So that was a misperception. If you actually look at our court record compared to past administrations, it was at worst equal. And in some instances better. I mean, we won 95 percent of the cases we brought in. The merger context alone. One area where we saw this was in fact in taking on illegal mergers. We ended up finalizing new merger guidelines, which is basically the framework that the administration laid out for how we would assess whether a deal violated the antitrust law. Within a year of those being out, we had over a dozen court opinions that were validating and agreeing with core parts of those guidelines. And so there is a whole set of areas where the law has advanced in the direction that we were pushing it. And of course, I wish we’d had more time. But where does that where does the misperception come from then that. Well, there was a very concerted very well-resourced effort to discredit the work of the FTC and to create a lot of misperception about our successes. And we saw that, in all sorts of ways, but it was really disconnected from reality. I think we just saw a lot of hysteria, and that manifested in trying to convince people that the FTC was losing. The FTC was ineffective, but that was just pretty divorced from reality and what was actually happening in court. O.K, but the Biden administration did lose. I mean, it’s. Well, Kamala Harris lost. Lost the election. Donald Trump won. And before we get to the second Trump administration’s approach to antitrust, I’m curious again about the politics of this kind of effort. So the Biden administration did a lot of things, the antitrust, antimonopoly stuff. The fight against Silicon Valley was not the only thing it did, but it was one of the big ones. And obviously, that didn’t translate into political success. Why not. So the antitrust component was a small part of the whole administration and a lot of what we did, came and is still coming into effect. Some of the rules that we finalized, including a rule that would require that companies make it as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to sign up. A rule that prohibits firms from including junk fees. So that once you get to the checkout, there are all these inflated fees that you don’t really know what you’re paying for. All of these material ways that we are improving people’s lives, in some instances, there were delays with that, and on other instances, I think there was a lack of full awareness of what some of these efforts were, and they’re kind of different reasons for that. In other instances, I think there were just broader issues relating to people’s frustration with high costs, whether they felt like people were really speaking to that experience. I mean, look, I’m not some type of electoral strategist, but what I can say from when I would go out and meet with people across the country. There was a lot of frustration. There was a lot of disillusionment. There was appreciation that somebody from DC had come to hear about what challenges that we’re facing, but a sense of pessimism that government would actually do the right thing if it would require standing up to powerful corporations. I mean, we’re kind of up against a multi-decade drift away from using the levers of government and law enforcement to stand up for working people. When it means taking on powerful corporations. And I think people are still, very skeptical. But there was a lot of popularity and a lot of will be an electoral strategist for a minute because the Democratic Party is in the wilderness a bit at the moment. It lost the last election. Is there just a political. Do you think there’s a political narrative out here, out of your work and out of your arguments and others like it that’s waiting to be claimed. If you got a call from the future Democratic nominee for president in 2028. Would you say, look, there’s a story here that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn’t really tell, even though they were doing these things. That should be the centerpiece of the Democratic argument going forward. Well, I would say two things. One is, as a law enforcer, you are figuring out if there is a harmful practice, who is doing it. You’re filing a lawsuit against a company. And I think one thing that really resonated with people was a awareness and a recognition that these abusive practices are not just happening. They’re not just like whether somebody is doing them. There is a corporation that is breaking the law in ways that is making their life worse. And I think sometimes we see a reluctance to be so pointed and to explain who is pursuing these practices in ways that is making it more expensive for people at the grocery store, making it harder for people to get affordable health care, making it harder for people to get affordable housing. I think there can just be a reluctance to name the abuser in some of these instances in ways that I think can make people question, what is your narrative. What is your explanation for why my life isn’t better. And if you get into power, what are you going to do about it. All right. Let’s come back to that in one second. But alas. So then a last question related directly to politics, the Trump administration. What is the Trump administration’s approach to antitrust. It seems like there are some ideas inherited from your time at the FTC that still find support. There are some that have been rejected. It also seems like many things with the Trump administration, uncertain, a mixed bag. Things change from week to week. But what’s your take on Trump 2.0 antitrust so far. I would say overall it’s a mixed bag. There is some continuity. There are kind of core initiatives that we had set in motion that are still underway. They’ve kept the merger guidelines in place. For example, the cases that we pursued against the big tech companies, including Amazon and Facebook and Google. So far are still on track and the administration is pursuing those despite some lobbying efforts. I think I personally am also still waiting to see, especially at the FTC, whether the zeal that we see on some of these more conservative grievance issues is also going to be extending to just some of the day to day challenges that people are facing, be it in health or be it in food and agriculture. I also worry, as we see in other parts of the administration, that the law could be weaponized to reward friends and punish enemies. I think we are seeing a real backsliding when it comes to the dismantling of huge parts of the government. I mean, on the one hand, we hear this administration still wants to be tough on big tech, but they’ve dismantled the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had a whole set of investigations underway into big Tech’s incursion into payment platforms. And so it seems like we’re seeing a lot of rhetoric. But if ultimately you are serious about governing monopoly power, about governing in ways that’s checking monopoly power, you need a government, you need a functioning government. And I think so many of the efforts that we’re seeing in the direction of weakening and enfeebling the government is going to make that much more difficult. And there’s just a basic contradiction there. Yeah I mean, I think that there is a my sense is that on the one hand, there’s a strong impulse, especially among younger conservatives who came of age in the late 2010s, and had a profoundly negative reaction to their sense of what corporate power wanted to do, basically on cultural issues, especially in the late 2010s. And out of that have this strong interest in ideas like the ones you’ve referenced ideas about bigness generally as a threat to individual liberty. And, there’s an FTC commissioner named Mark Maeder who wrote a long paper attacking stringently, attacking libertarian supporters of big business for ignoring big businesses threat to individual freedom and personal liberty. So that’s like there as a very potent philosophical strain. But at the same time, the main thing that I’ve seen Mark Maeder say about you, Lina Khan. Is there was a Twitter, an ex, excuse me, an ex, back and forth right about the FTC, the Trump era FTC backing away from a PepsiCo case where there’s this strong philosophical overlap. But then meador is on Twitter saying that we’re backing away from this because Lina Khan’s FTC overreached disastrously in all these kinds of ways. Do you think there’s a strong incentive for the Trump FTC to rhetorically distance itself from you, even when it has philosophical positions in common with you. Well, I think what we have seen is a whole set of attacks on them in terms of them continuing to do too much of what we have been doing. And so it wouldn’t surprise me if they felt like they had to appease some of those masters, including by potentially backtracking on meritorious cases. I mean, the case against Pepsi, we found after a two year investigation that Pepsi was systematically discriminating against small and independent retailers in ways that is leaving communities much more worse off when it comes to access to affordable food. Having real options in terms of independent grocery. And so this is something that would materially improve people’s lives. And for them to backtrack on that and dismiss the case is pretty troubling. But do you I think that’s about politics. You don’t want to say. You don’t want to speculate. They fired the Democratic commissioners who would have been at the FTC and would have had some insight into what some of that decision making would be, which was pretty disturbing as well. So I can’t speculate. But, I will say embedded in the FTC’s DNA is if you are doing your job, honestly and with integrity, you will probably upset some powerful interests, right. If you are charged with going up against illegal monopolies, monopolies tend to have a lot of political power. And if you don’t have the backbone and the spine to stand strong in the face of that pushback. I think that’s going to lead to some pretty bad outcomes for people and a lot of talk, but no follow through. OK all right. Let’s come to a final act in the conversation and go back to where we started and talk about the problems, the economic problems in American life that the antitrust, antimonopoly movement wants to solve. Because in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory, you’ve had a really interesting argument between liberals, right. There’s been a really stark division between people who want to organize liberal thinking around antimonopoly, anti-corporate power thinking, and people like my colleague, who have been arguing, basically, that the Democratic Party doesn’t have a strategy for dealing with the intense thicket of regulatory obstacles to building things in America. Building homes in America. Building factories in America. And I don’t think people on my colleague’s side of the debate would necessarily even disagree that we need more regulation and more scrutiny of corporations in some areas, but I think their view is that there is all of these impediments to economic flourishing that just have nothing to do with the size and scale of big corporations and have everything to do with how government operates and how it puts obstacles in the way of growth and development. So that’s ended up being the kind of key argument right now inside the liberal and Democratic tent. Do you think that these are actually ideas that can work together. That, in fact, the Democratic Party should be anti-monopolist, but also pro-growth in all these other ways that involve taking on problems in government power. Or do you think that there’s this fundamental tension, that this is like an actual fork in the road for the Democratic Party. I mean, a core part of a monopolists playbook is to create artificial scarcity. And to actually serve as that bottleneck. And so I think taking on those types of corporate bottlenecks, taking on those monopolies is absolutely in the service of creating more growth. I mean, on the issue of regulations and the extent to which, they are stifling that growth, I would say it can be pretty dangerous to talk about regulations as a monolith. There are different types of regulations. There can absolutely be regulations that are creating a lot of complexity and a lot of bureaucracy and perversely, oftentimes benefit big business at the expense of small business, because it’s the bigger firms that are better equipped to navigate. I can say at the FTC, one of the legacies of the Reagan administration that we were dealing with was a lot of internal red tape and internal bureaucracy that had been created to try to handicap the agency and enfeeble the agency that we had to take on and strip away. So we ended up looking at the law, saying, a lot of these procedures are not even required in what Congress said. The FTC just kind of made it up to handicap itself. Let’s streamline those. And we ended up being able to push through some of these rules on subscription traps, on fake reviews, on junk fees in under two years. We need to talk in a market by market way. But if you are offering a diagnosis that is also suspiciously quiet about the role of corporate power, I think that should raise some questions as well, I guess. But couldn’t the counterargument be that if you’re raising a diagnosis that seems to always be saying, look at this really narrow, specific thing like junk fees that show up on hotels.com or wherever else that you don’t expect, right. Those are pretty annoying, right. But in the end, they’re not nearly as big a deal to most Americans as housing prices. In general, it’s very, very clear just from living in the United States of America and knowing people in lots of different places that blue states and liberal states have to some degree, manufactured scarcity in housing through heavy, heavy regulation. And red states have not. Isn’t this, in a way, just going to be a bigger deal for most people than junk fees at the end of a hotel booking or something like that. Not that junk fees are good, but if you’re talking about what liberals should be most concerned about. Sure I mean, I would just say the antimonopoly agenda is more than junk fees. Yes no, it’s upstream from so much, including whether people can get access to inhalers for $35 as opposed to hundreds of dollars on the issue of housing. I mean, I think you really need to study specific markets. I just read a study, a very close study of Dallas, the Dallas housing market. I also read that study. Yes And looking at whether significant zoning liberalization actually led to more affordable housing. And that analysis said, no, actually it didn’t. I do think on this issue of is antimonopoly, just about small things. It really contrasts with my experience of being at the FTC and seeing on the ground the enormous support for the FTC, taking on, be it a legal repair restrictions, which you could say, oh, that’s a minor thing, whether you can freely, repair your own tractor or your own grill machine. This really implicates people’s own sense of autonomy and agency. And I think gets to this broader issue of do people feel like they are masters of their own lives, or do they feel like increasingly core questions about their day to day life are dependent on the whims of these distant Giants. And that whole set of issues is deeply tied to questions of market structure and whether independent businesses can thrive, whether you, as a worker, can freely go take a job somewhere else or go start your own business. And Yes, even things like whether you have to stay on coals for three hours to talk to a customer service representative to cancel your subscription, all of those things deeply affect and shape your experience of America and a day to day life, and I think, really affect whether you feel free or not. All right. Well, let’s end. Let’s end with the internet and Silicon Valley and Meta, which used to be called Facebook because as you mentioned, that’s one of the antitrust cases that the Trump administration has continued. It’s made the case in court that Mark Zuckerberg’s company is a social media monopoly power that overstepped in acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram. And should be broken up in some way. Now, this is based on actions the company took like a decade ago. And I think it’s a good distillation, in a way, to just ask if Meta were actually broken up. What would it what would it solve for the average American internet user. What would be the benefit, be it material, be it political, be it social. So the case is arguing that Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were illegal, that they were defensive, that Facebook itself was not organically able to compete and thrive in the mobile market. And so then it went out and bought these companies that were native to Mobile, that were doing really well, that users really liked, brought them in-house. And as a result, people have been deprived more options. It has also meant that in some instances these services have been degraded. WhatsApp, for example, famously had provided users more privacy as $1, and WhatsApp would not be monetizing your data or kind of selling personal information about you. And once that what WhatsApp was bought internal to Facebook. Facebook’s model of course, is very different. It is all about monetizing your user. And so there were real costs in terms of privacy. We don’t know yet what remedy the FTC is ultimately going to seek. In the initial filings, they did indicate very strongly that the breakup of Facebook, including the divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp, would be the right remedy, that people would then have more options, that these firms would be able to make more independent choices and be able to fill more gaps in terms of what consumers really want. I think the other big question is, what does a forward looking remedy look like. Because you’re right, these acquisitions were done over a decade ago. And they were done, I should stress, at a period when from the point of view of the average person, Facebook looked more powerful than it does now. That I mean, to me, as an internet user, it seems like the story of the internet, while it is dominated by Giants in various ways, is also a story of churn, rise, decline, competition and so on. And if you told me you should think about Facebook as a monopoly in 2014 or 2015, that would just seem more persuasive to me than it does right now. Well, it’s an interesting question, as we think about AI and what the future of these artificial intelligence markets are going to look like. Yes, because you do have a significant overlap between the kind of firms that were dominant in the Web 2.0 era and these hyperscalers that are going to potentially be positioned to dominate some of the key inputs for artificial intelligence. Meta is a player. They have some of these more open models. And so one thing we’re seeing play out in the Google litigation right now, Google has been found to be an illegal monopoly, both in online search markets as well as digital ad markets. And one key question that judges are facing is what is a forward looking remedy look like. And the Justice Department, both under the last administration and in this administration, has made some arguments around what it would look like to make sure that Google is not able to reap the rewards of its illegal behavior in AI markets. And that’s a core tenet. As you’re thinking about antitrust remedies want to stop the illegal behavior, you want to stop its recurrence, but you also want to deny the lawbreaker the fruit of its lawbreaking. And that could mean in these old school, more old school markets, or it could mean in these forward looking markets. And so we’re going to have to wait to see how that plays out. But as someone who is both concerned about the future of AI and concerned about the impact of the internet on society. This is a case where I. I look at the arguments you’re making. And I think to myself even where they’re persuasive, they don’t necessarily seem to prioritize the things that I’m most worried about that if you say to me, O.K, we want Facebook to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram or whatever remedy you might seek, right. And I’m concerned about the impact that the internet has on my children, I’m not going to say to myself, Thank God we’ve finally gotten more competition right in the social media app space. That’s great. That’s what I need. I need 17 TikToks and not just one. That’s not my reaction. In the same way with the age, with the age of AI. There’s a way in which your remedy seems orthogonal to the things I’m most worried about. But I want to give you a chance to say that maybe I’m wrong, and that maybe antitrust and antimonopoly is useful for thinking about the social harms of the internet or the potential for a dangerous, breakneck race toward superintelligence. Do you think it is relevant to these concerns. Well, one of the things that came out through the Facebook trial was this issue of Instagram showing a shocking number of individuals it had categorized as groomers, recommending to them the profiles of young people. And so we can ask what why was this. Is this related to the fact that Facebook is not having to compete. But I do think we’ve seen situations where firms not being checked by competition on issues like are you making your services safe for kids can all be worsened by the issue of monopoly power. There are absolutely social harms that are less related to this issue of monopoly power. And whether you do or don’t have competition, I think we need certain background rules, including on things like what kinds of data can firms collect on you. What can they do with that data. Some of this implicated the FTC’s consumer protection work, where for decades, the primary paradigm for how to think about people’s privacy had been this idea of notice and consent, the idea that firms could just show you lengthy terms of service. And as long as they could point to the fine print, they could basically get away with doing it. We ended up instead drawing some bright lines and saying, there are certain types of sensitive data like your health data, your precise geolocation data, your browsing data where the default cannot be. The firms can just collect and disseminate this data, including with companies in foreign jurisdictions. And so these types of background rules are absolutely needed for ultimately making sure that these Digital Markets are serving us as a society. O.K, I’m going to make one last try, though, to force you to be more sweeping in your analysis. So we started out with the idea of big corporations as a potential threat, again, not just to consumer welfare, but to the way we live together in democracy itself. And we’re ending with my personal concerns, but they’re widely shared concerns about the way that Silicon Valley, in particular, its technologies are reshaping the nature of human life, the nature of human interaction, the nature of childhood, and then potentially with AI, all kinds of things beyond that. And my sense throughout this interview is that you don’t want to separate the political and the economic for good reason. You ran the FTC. The FTC has an economic mandate in terms of competition. And so on. But it seems to me that for that could push further on the political side of the argument and say, look, there is a case for breaking up concentrations of power, even if it’s bad for the economy, if it’s good for society and good for Democratic flourishing. And that could apply to Silicon Valley, that we want weaker tech Giants for the sake of political goods and not economic ones. Do you think that’s true. It’s absolutely true that policymakers could decide that the existing antitrust and antimonopoly laws don’t allow law enforcers to use their own social conception of the public good, to use the law in those directions, which is maybe why you’re sensing a bit of reluctance in my part to say, Yes, antitrust can do that. But it’s not even not just the laws, that we have on the books now, but you I don’t want to impute too much to you, but you are the would be leader of what is an influential movement in American life, again, that has support you in distinctive ways on both the left and the right. So I’m just curious. Yeah, for big not just thoughts on what can the FTC do under Donald Trump or under President Bernie Sanders or any other Democratic president. But what should a movement worried about. How should a movement worried about corporate power. Think about the internet and Silicon Valley going forward, that’s all. If you outsource your policy prescriptions to just a certain set of market prescriptions, I think that’s dangerous. And you kind of lose sight of what are some of the broader public values and the social good that we care about. And so I absolutely think that we need to be using our tools of government to make sure that the future trajectory of some of these technologies is actually going to be serving us as a public, even if it’s not kind of checking all the boxes for what some neoclassical economists would want. Excellent. So I’ve talked Lina Khan into banning the internet and on. Not really. But on that note, Lina, thank you so much for joining me.

Democrats also have historical precedent on their side, with Virginia electing governors who represent the opposing party of the president in power.\n\nYet Earle-Sears is unperturbed. \n\n“They’ve been attacking me since 2001 when I first ran. They haven’t stopped attacking me,” Earle-Sears told the Washington Examiner in a sit-down interview Wednesday, about her Democratic critics.\n\nDEMOCRATS LOOK TO VIRGINIA’S ABIGAIL SPANBERGER FOR A WIN AFTER ROUGH PATCH\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor stresses that her campaign and potential administration will focus on accountability and transparency in government, among other issues. Earle-Sears has a four-part strategy that she hopes will propel her to victory in the November election. She’s focused on safety and security, the economy, education, and energy—all of which she claims make her a better candidate than her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger.\n\n“She wants to raise taxes. I want to continue to lower taxes to the point where I want to make sure we get rid of the dreaded, hated car tax,” Earle-Sears said. “Nobody likes that, including, I’m sure, she doesn’t like it, but she won’t do anything about it. I will.” \n\nBoth gubernatorial candidates have endorsed ending the annual personal property tax on vehicles in Virginia, which is unpopular with residents. \n\nVirginians are largely satisfied with the policies that the Youngkin administration has enacted, including the crime rate dropping 38% in 10 of the state’s worst cities, according to Earle-Sears. \n\n“The polls are telling us, and the people are telling us, that they want what we’re doing to continue. And this is where I believe my opponent, Abigail Spanberger, is going to get tripped up,” she said. “Because the people like what we’ve done. They want what we have to continue. But you see, she was never a part of any of the good that we’ve done.” \n\nPolling data released last week from Founders Insight showed 46% of likely general election voters surveyed would cast a ballot for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, compared to 43% who would vote for the Republican nominee and 9% who said they were undecided.\n\nThe undecided vote could still be persuaded to vote for Earle-Sears between now and the election. \n\nAfter the Virginia primary on Tuesday, the Democratic ticket will include Spanberger, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi as the lieutenant governor nominee, and former Del. Jay Jones as the attorney general nominee. The Republican ticket includes Earle-Sears, Attorney General Jason Miyares (R-VA) running for reelection, and John Reid, the only GOP candidate for lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Virginia governor race, and to a lesser extent the New Jersey governor race, this fall is widely seen as a political bellwether ahead of next year’s midterm election. \n\nThe Old Dominion has shifted toward the GOP after the 2024 election, although it still voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump persuaded more suburban voters in Northern Virginia to back his campaign, which Earle-Sears will likely need to improve on in order to succeed Youngkin. \n\nThat effort is complicated after the Department of Government Efficiency slashed thousands of federal jobs. The impact will be hard felt in Virginia, home to nearly 236,000 government workers and industries that rely on the federal workforce.\n\n“We’ve been creating efficiencies in government since we’ve come back into office. For example, we’ve found so many inefficiencies everywhere. For example, at the DMV, we’ve been able to shore that up, and people are so happy,” Earle-Sears countered when asked about the federal layoffs.\n\nEarle-Sears said she and Youngkin created private sector jobs in Virginia that are now hiring laid-off federal workers. \n\n“We’ve created over 250,000 new jobs in Virginia, and we have created 15,000 business startups, never existed, small businesses, because we know how to do this,” she continued. “And we are hosting job fairs for those on the federal level who are no longer working there. And in fact, when you look at what’s happening in our employment space, we’ve seen that some of those former federal workers have taken jobs in the private sector, or they’re taking jobs at the various levels of state-local government.”\n\nSpanberger has also carefully crafted a narrative as a centrist Democrat who was willing to buck Democratic leaders when she served in the House of Representatives, making it harder for Earle-Sears to paint her as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\n“Abigail has a record of bringing people together to get things done for Virginians — it’s why she was ranked the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia,” said TaNisha Cameron, a Spanberger campaign spokesperson. \n\n“And everywhere she travels across the Commonwealth, she hears from Virginians who are worried about high costs, the quality of their children’s schools, and how the chaos coming from Washington will affect their families,” Cameron continued. “As Governor, she will remain focused on putting Virginia first by making Virginia more affordable, strengthening Virginia’s schools, and growing the Commonwealth’s economy for everyone.”\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor has instead opted to criticize her opponent for other issues, including voting against the Laken Riley Act, legislation that requires federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants charged or convicted of theft-related offenses, while in office. Trump later signed the legislation into law earlier this year. \n\nThe president, who never carried Virginia in his three presidential elections, has not yet weighed in on the governor race, and it is unclear whether he will do so. \n\nBut Earle-Sears remains confident that his support is forthcoming.\n\n“Now, do you think our president wants me to win? Of course, he does,” Earle-Sears said. “He likes to win, and so do we. And he will come when it is time, and until then, we will continue to do the work. We’re not flinching. We’re not afraid of hard work.”","summary":"RICHMOND, Virginia — Four years after winning statewide office in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears is back in the political arena.

Republican Senator Rand Paul said it could look like \"images you saw of the Soviet Union or North Korea.\"The new piece of protest art on The Mall is an 8-foot-tall sculpture featuring a reconstruction of the Statue of Liberty's head being crushed by a large gold-colored thumbs-up, along with the wording \"DICTATOR APPROVED\" and a series of quotes from leaders with various levels of authoritarian, if not autocratic, tendencies praising Trump.The quotes featured are from such leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Putin's reads: \"President Trump is a very bright and talented man.\" And Bolsonaro's: \"We do have a great deal of shared values. I admire President Trump.\"The permit application was issued by one Mary Harris though no further information about her or any other associated artists was provided, according to the Washington Post. It runs until 5 p.m. ET on June 22.According to the publication, the new sculpture is \"very similar in style and materials\" to a number of other pieces of protest art that were displayed in locations including the National Mall during the fall of 2024.One of these featured a bronze reconstruction of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk with a large swiveled turd on top of it along with references to the January 6, 2021, storming of Congress by Trump supporters in a bid to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.A plaque placed on the artwork read: \"This memorial honors the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021 to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election.\"What People Are SayingWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: \"If these Democrat activists were living in a dictatorship, their eye-sore of a sculpture wouldn't be sitting on the National Mall right now. In the United States of America you have the freedom to display your so-called 'art,' no matter how ugly it is.\"Speaking to the Washington Post, Francesca Carlo, a 20-year-old visiting Washington D.C. from Cleveland, said: \"If all these authoritarian politicians approve of our president then maybe people will see a pattern recognition and see where democracy is headed.\"On X one user from Harlem, New York, wrote: \"New public art that was just installed on the National Mall. The artist, obviously, is brilliant, but an enormous shoutout to the genius who managed to secure a permit in order to erect the statue legally.\"What Happens NextThe \"dictator approved\" artwork has a permit to remain in its position on the National Mall until June 22. It remains to be seen if other similarly styled works will appear going forward.","summary":"The artwork features praise for President Trump from various authoritarian or dictatorial leaders.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-says-activists-have-right-display-ugly-anti-trump-statue-2087761","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2666685/sculpture.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 08:57:44","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.295},{"id":332993004,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Calls Out Exactly How ‘Moron’ Donald Trump Rose To Power","text":"Bruce Springsteen isn’t letting up on his digs at Donald Trump and the administration he’s previously branded “incompetent and treasonous”.\n\nThe Boss – who is in the midst of the European leg of his Land of Hope and Dreams tour with the E Street Band – told The New York Times that he wanted to use his shows’ set list to address the “current situation” in the United States.\n\n“It’s an American tragedy,” said the rocker in a feature published on Wednesday. \n\nHe went on to say: “I think that it was the combination of the deindustrialisation of the country and then the incredible increase in wealth disparity that left so many people behind.

Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\"\n\n'Heartbeat laws'\n\nGeorgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a near-total abortion ban in the state, in 2019. \n\nThe law, which also defines a \"person\" to include an \"unborn child\" was blocked before it took effect because it violated the right to abortion established by the US Supreme Court in its 1973 landmark Roe v Wade ruling.\n\nBut when that law was overturned in 2022, it cleared the way for the state law to immediately take effect.\n\nThe Georgia law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present.\n\nCardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realise they are pregnant.\n\nThe Georgia law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed.\n\nIt also provides for later abortions when the mother's life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a foetus unviable.\n\nMonica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Georgia's abortion law told the Associated Press in May the situation was problematic.\n\n\"Her family deserved the right to have decision-making power about her medical decisions,\" Ms Simpson said in a statement. \n\n\"Instead, they have endured over 90 days of retraumatisation, expensive medical costs, and the cruelty of being unable to resolve and move toward healing.\" \n\nIn May, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement saying that Georgia's six-week law does not require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after being declared brain-dead.\n\n\"Removing life support is not an action with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,\" Mr Carr's spokesperson, Kara Murray, said in the statement.\n\nThaddeus Pope, a bioethicist and lawyer at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, said while a few states have laws that specifically limit removing treatment from a pregnant woman who is alive but incapacitated, or brain dead, Georgia isn't one of them.\n\n\"Removing the woman's mechanical ventilation or other support would not constitute an abortion.\"\n\n\"Continued treatment is not legally required.\"\n\nBut Georgia state Senator Ed Setzler, a Republican who sponsored the 2019 law, said he supported Emory's interpretation.\n\n\"I think it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child,\" Mr Setzler said.\n\n\"I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\"\n\nHas anything like this happened before?\n\nA similar case took place in Texas 10 years ago when a brain-dead woman was kept on life support for about two months because she was pregnant. \n\nA judge eventually ruled that the hospital was misapplying state law, and life support was removed.\n\nGeorgia's abortion ban has been in the spotlight before.\n\nLast year, ProPublica reported that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills. \n\nThe stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller entered into the presidential race, with Democrat Kamala Harris saying the deaths were the result of the abortion bans that went into effect in Georgia and elsewhere after Roe v Wade was overturned.","summary":"Adriana Smith was pronounced brain dead in February but due to Georgia abortion laws, doctors say they were forced to keep her on life support for

internet made the billionaires the punchline after they turned on each other with a flurry of insults.\n\nX users poked fun at the fight between the world’s richest man and the president, with some memeing Musk as Quentin Tarantino character Kill Bill over his attempts to end the Republican legislation. \n\nOthers ridiculed the billionaires and compared them to bickering teenagers, and joked that Trump would add Musk to his deportation lists. \n\nIn one social media post that went viral, an X user likened Trump to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin erasing political enemies from pictures, instead erasing Musk. \n\nThe public fallout between Musk and Trump stunned Washington DC and sent Republicans scrambling, but some saw the funny side as political journalist Michael Tracey chimed in with his own prediction. \n\n‘At this rate Musk might receive a one-way ticket to El Salvador,’ he said on X. \n\nElon Musk’s baba mama Ashley St. Clair also waded into the dramatic fallout between Musk and Trump as she asked the president if he ‘needs any breakup advice.’ \n\nSt. Clair spoke out as she is in the midst of a custody battle with Musk for their son, and she previously fumed at the billionaire to DailyMail.com when he slashed her child support in half. \n\nMany had predicted that Trump and Musk’s rosy bromance wouldn’t last long, as some pointed to betting markets on when they would turn on each other. \n\nBetters heavily favored a fallout before July 1, 2025, less than six months after Musk joined Trump’s administration as a special advisor. \n\nPolitical firebrand Laura Loomer also chimed in, saying she had ‘been on the hill all day and it’s all anyone is talking about.’ \n\n‘Will be interesting to see what Republican lawmakers do now,’ she said. \n\n‘I know law makers who are asking if they should side with President Trump or Elon.’ \n\nAfter Musk sent a raft of insults at Trump including claiming he was the sole reason Trump won the 2024 election, the president fired back on Thursday afternoon. \n\n‘Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!’ he said on Truth Social. \n\nHe added in a follow up post: ‘The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. \n\n‘I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!’ \n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican’s campaign.\n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day. \n\nMusk’s claim that Trump wouldn’t have won the election without him appeared to strike a chord with the president. \n\nTrump said he likely still would have won the key state of Pennsylvania without Musk’s assistance, partly because Kamala Harris didn’t choose the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate.\n\nEven

partnership deal","text":"Nippon Steel’s shares surged 4.6% this morning. (EPA Images pic)NEW YORK: Nippon Steel and US Steel said yesterday that they had completed a long-debated transaction granting the US government a “golden share” – a veto-like power over the Japanese company’s strategic decisions.The agreement modifies a transaction originally announced in December 2023, in which Nippon Steel agreed to acquire US Steel for US$14.9 billion.However, the outright buyout of the iconic US company sparked bipartisan political opposition, including from President Donald Trump.Trump, who railed against the proposed deal throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, last month announced a pivot, branding the revamped venture as a “planned partnership”.The US government will now have a say on Nippon’s plans for US infrastructure and jobs through its golden share.Nippon Steel CEO Eiji Hashimoto said today in Tokyo that this “won’t hinder activities that we hope to conduct”.A national security agreement between the companies and Washington also provides that approximately US$11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028.“The agreement is fully satisfactory to us, as it ensures the management freedom and re-producibility that are essential for business investment,” Hashimoto told reporters.“We intend to start implementing measures for revitalisation and development as soon as possible,” he said, promising not to “transfer jobs and production sites elsewhere.”Nippon Steel shares surged 4.6% this morning, even as Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei index slumped 0.7%.Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick, a Republican, thanked Trump on X and called the outcome “a massive victory for working families in the Mon Valley, our economy, our national security, and America’s manufacturing future!”However, the United Steelworkers (USW) union, which vigorously fought the deal, vowed to “continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments,” according to a statement.“And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining,” it said.‘World-leading capabilities’Under the December 2023 transaction, Nippon agreed to pay US$55 per share for US Steel – an all-cash deal that included a 40% premium and pitched the combined company as the “best steelmaker with world-leading capabilities”.While the agreement included a pledge to maintain the name US Steel and the company’s Pittsburgh headquarters, industry watchers expected an exodus of executives.However, the deal sparked bitter opposition from the USW and a broad range of politicians, including then-president Joe Biden and former Ohio senator JD Vance – now Trump’s vice-president.So Nippon stepped up its lobbying efforts in Washington and Pittsburgh to win support for a transaction that appeared for months to be on life support.Biden blocked the transaction in early January, shortly before leaving office.He said that placing “one of America’s largest steel producers under foreign control” could “create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains”.However, backers of the deal had been hoping the political climate shift following Trump’s election victory over Biden’s vice-president Kamala Harris might help revive it.Besides agreeing to keep US Steel’s Pittsburgh headquarters and to maintain US production, the revamped deal’s national security agreement calls for a majority of US Steel’s board to be US citizens, as are key leaders including the CEO.The government’s “golden share” will allow it the right to appoint one independent director and grant it consent rights for proposed capital budget cuts, the redomiciling of activities outside the US and on acquisitions in the country.The “golden share” does not entitle the US government to dividends, nor does it require Washington to make investments in the company.","summary":"The US government will now have a say on Nippon's plans for US infrastructure and jobs through its golden share.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/06/19/nippon-us-steel-complete-partnership-deal/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/4393574f-nippon-steel_1600x1000_1-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 03:21:37","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":332898222,"title":"America’s future, inflation, government spending bigger worries for US voters than Iran’s nuke and Ayatollah regime, reveals Fox News poll","text":"Iran viewed as growing threat in 2025, up sharply from 2019A recent Fox News poll, conducted June 13-16, 2025, reveals that 73 per cent of registered voters perceive Iran as a national security threat to the US, a significant increase from six years ago, while opinions are divided on Israel’s decision to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities; the poll also indicates that voters see the Russia-Ukraine conflict as less pressing than the situation in the Middle East, but still support financial aid to both Ukraine and Israel, with partisan divisions influencing support in each conflict.The survey, which included 1,003 registered voters, also shows that while voters are concerned about Iran's nuclear program, other issues like the future of the US, inflation, and government spending are considered more pressing. The poll also touched on President Trump's approval ratings on various issues, as well as favorability ratings for other political figures.Also read: Iran Israel latest: World War 3 fear grips as Russia threatens USA, Turkey backs TehranSeventy-three percent of registered voters think Iran poses a real threat to the US, marking a 13-point increase from six years prior.Majority across political spectrum agree on Iranian threat The increased sense that Iran constitutes a threat is real, but it also reflects the unique timing and circumstances surrounding this poll, says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.Shaw added, The poll was in the field as images of Iranian missiles falling on Tel Aviv dominated television and the internet. The immediacy and clarity of the conflict undoubtedly contributes to how voters gauge what is at risk. Majorities across party lines agree on the threat posed by Iran: Democrats (69 per cent), Republicans (82 per cent), and Independents (62 per cent).These figures represent increases since 2019, with Democrats up by 12 points, Republicans by 17, and Independents by 4.Support split over Israeli military action against IranThe survey was released as President Donald Trump urged for Iran’s unconditional surrender. Voters are split on Israel’s decision to launch military strikes against Iran’s nuclear programs, with 49% approving and 46 per cent disapproving.Republicans (73 per cent approve) are more than twice as likely as Democrats (32 per cent) and Independents (32 per cent) to approve of the strikes.Most voters believe the attacks against Iran will make the world a more dangerous place (59 per cent) rather than safer (36 per cent).About three-quarters of Democrats (74 per cent) and Independents (77 per cent) agree the strikes will increase peril, as do nearly 4 in 10 Republicans (36 per cent).Nuclear concerns climb but rank mid-tier among voter prioritiesAlmost 8 in 10 voters say they are extremely or very concerned about Iran’s nuclear program (78 per cent), up from 66 per cent in April and matching the high in September 2010.When presented with a list of eight issues, Iran’s nuclear program falls in the middle.The future of the US (85 per cent extremely or very concerned), inflation (84 per cent), and government spending (80 per cent) rank higher.Antisemitism (69 per cent), illegal immigration (67 per cent), the use of US military troops domestically (66 per cent), and protests in US cities (63 per cent) rank lower than concerns about Iran.Also read: All-out war: Iran warns Trump it will start responding to US if found involved in attacks by IsraelWhile roughly 8 in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are concerned about Iran getting a nuke, it only ranks in the top three concerns for Republicans.Middle East conflict seen as more relevant to US life than Ukraine warOverall, 8 in 10 think what happens in the Middle East matters a great deal or some to life in the US (81 per cent).More than half support financial aid to the Israelis for their military (53 per cent), a 3-point increase since March, but down from a high of 60 per cent in November 2023, shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks.Since November 2023, Democrats (-14 points) and Independents (-11) are less likely to support sending money to the Israelis while Republicans (+4 points) solidified their support. Even though most think the stakes are high, there is a reticence to get involved in the Middle East, says Shaw.Shaw also stated, The public isn’t blind to history and history teaches us that those who get directly involved in these conflicts do so at their peril. Trump’s approval mixed across issues amid global crisisTrump left the G7 summit early, citing the ongoing and intensifying situation in the Middle East as the reason.Trump’s approval rating on foreign policy has held relatively steady since April: 42 per cent approve vs. 57 per cent disapprove for a net negative rating of -15.He fares better on border security (53 per cent approve, 46 per cent disapprove) and immigration (46 per cent, 53 per cent) while he does worse on the economy (40 per cent, 58 per cent) and inflation (34 per cent, 64 per cent).Overall, 46 per cent approve of his job performance as president, while 54 per cent disapprove.Trump’s personal favorable rating held steady at 45 per cent.Compared to those in his administration, Trump’s about even with Vice President JD Vance (44 per cent favorable) and performs better than Rubio (42 per cent), Elon Musk (41 per cent), and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (32 per cent).RFK Jr. and Harris lead favorability ratings among political figuresRobert F. Kennedy Jr. does the best with a 48 per cent favorable rating.For comparison, the favorable ratings among Democratic Party leaders were in the same ballpark: Kamala Harris (49 per cent favorable), Joe Biden (43 per cent), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40 per cent), and Gavin Newsom (39 per cent).Everyone tested was viewed more negatively than positively, although by only 2 points for both Harris and RFK Jr.Also read: All about GBU-57, the 30,000-pound U.S. beast that could help Israel neutralize Iran’s deepest threatUkraine aid support remains stable amid lowered public attentionThe continuing war between Russia and Ukraine takes a backseat to the conflict in the Middle East, with 72 per cent saying the war matters a great deal to life in the US compared to 81 per cent who say the same about what is happening in the Middle East.Those saying the Russia-Ukraine war matters are down from 81 per cent in October 2023 and a high of 85 per cent in March 2022.Even so, 56 per cent of voters support sending money to Ukraine to help fight Russia.That number has held steady at between 54 and 63 per cent for the last three years.Majorities favor sending financial aid to the Ukrainians (56 per cent) and the Israelis (53 per cent) to fight their respective wars, with partisanship driving support in the different theaters.Seventy per cent of Democrats support funding Ukraine compared to just 46 per cent of Republicans, while 71 per cent of Republicans favor sending aid to Israel compared to just 43 per cent of Democrats.The Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,003 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (149) and cellphones (566) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (288).Also read: How close is World War 3 amidst Israel Iran war?Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points.","summary":"A new poll reveals that a significant majority of registered voters in the US view Iran as a potential threat to national security.

Responding to a question about his presidential ambitions, Newsom said, “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.”\n\nThat’s in keeping with the time-worn playbook for politicians who look in the mirror and see a president staring back. They shun naked ambition and portray themselves as reluctantly offering to serve the nation in its moment of crisis, whatever that might be.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Newsom, in an address broadcast live by CNN, warned that Trump’s sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented immigrants was such a crisis, saying “other states are next.”\n\n“This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”\n\nNewsom uttered a similar theme in his Wall Street Journal interview. “I have a responsibility to combine passion with action, to stand tall and firm and defend the values that I hold dear, that I think the vast majority of Americans hold dear, and assert myself in this moral moment,” he said.\n\nTrump’s anti-immigrant drive is a political gift to Newsom, providing a springboard for him to fill a vacuum and claim leadership of the opposition to Trump. The Democratic Party has been unable, in the seven months since losing the White House, to curb its internal power struggles. Nor have political media anointed any of the potential candidates to succeed Trump as the frontrunner.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Newsom, who has been cultivating a national image ever since winning re-election in 2022, would probably start ahead of most would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhether he would finish ahead, and go on to win the presidency, is another matter. The road to the White House is long and winding, with plenty of opportunities to stumble — as the career of another Californian, Kamala Harris, attests.\n\nAssuming that Newsom’s hints mean he’s a candidate, in the final 18 months of his governorship he’ll be juggling a day job and a side gig, which is likely to diminish his standing in California, which is mediocre at best.\n\nA recent poll by UC-Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies found that by a 2-1 margin, California voters already believe Newsom is more focused on running for president than in fixing the state’s problems.\n\n“People kind of look at him as being very ambitious,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said about Newsom.\n\nA Newsom presidential campaign would be something of a referendum on California. Its serious social and economic problems, which have not markedly improved during Newsom’s governorship, would be campaign fodder for Democratic rivals and, if he were to win the nomination, for the Republican candidate.\n\nVideo clips of California cities’ squalid encampments of the homeless, the smash-and-grab robberies and the sometimes violent demonstrations against Trump’s immigration sweeps would bolster the sour image that those in other states already have of California. Elect Newsom, his rivals would say, if you want the nation to emulate California.\n\nBeing a Californian was one of the burdens Harris could not overcome last year. An ad featuring her advocacy of giving conversion surgery to transgender prison inmates was, it’s widely believed, the single most effective spot of the campaign.\n\nSaddle up. Win or lose, a Newsom campaign for the White House would be a bumpy ride.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Gavin Newsom finally admits hes contemplating a run for president","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/06/18/gavin-newsom-finally-admits-hes-contemplating-a-run-for-president/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RPE-L-IERULING-0615-02.jpg?w=1024&h=744","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 01:05:20","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.096},{"id":332986160,"title":"Why Democrats Are Dodging the Iran Debate","text":"As the Israel–Iran conflict heats up and Republicans openly battle over America’s response, a strange quiet has descended over the Democratic Party’s leadership. At first glance, this silence may seem like an attempt to watch their GOP opponents self-implode, but that’s not the only reason they have shied away from the headlines. The Democrats know their coalition is just as fractured, fragile, and combustible as the Republican one — and they’re afraid to light the match.\n\nPresident Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the G7 Summit in Canada on Monday “because of what’s going on in the Middle East,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Upon returning to the U.S. early Tuesday, Trump made several Truth Social posts warning that Iran cannot, under any circumstance, get a nuclear bomb — but he never explicitly typed out a blatant endorsement of Israel’s strikes on Iran. Instead, Trump said Iran should have signed the “deal” he told them to sign before their 60 days ran out, adding that Iran’s choice would lead to such a “waste of life.” \n\nImportantly, Trump neither ruled out potential U.S. intervention nor dismissed the possibility of engaging with Iran directly if they sought dialogue first. \n\nFor days, both mainstream and independent media alike have been gripped by the same question: What will Trump do next? \n\nRepublicans at War Over War\n\nBut while the nation waits for Trump’s next move, the Republican coalition is at odds regarding how to respond to the Middle East crisis. On one side are traditional hawks — figures like Sen. Lindsey Graham, former CIA director Mike Pompeo, and outspoken radio host Mark Levin — who argue America must stand firm with Israel, supporting military action against Iran without hesitation. Levin in particular has been engaged in a public feud with Tucker Carlson for weeks, derisively calling him “Chatsworth Qatarlson” and accusing the former Fox News star of undermining Trump’s policy and echoing Iranian interests. \n\nCarlson, who leads the faction skeptical of intervention, warns against America becoming entangled in another costly and dangerous foreign war. He has criticized Levin, Sean Hannity, and Rupert Murdoch as reckless warmongers, accusing them of pushing the U.S. toward unnecessary conflict. In an interview with Steve Bannon, Carlson claimed his Fox News show was shut down because he was critical of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. He said the network was trying to “knock elderly Fox viewers off their feet” by “turning up the propaganda hose” about Iran’s nuclear threat.\n\nThis rift has played out loudly on social media platforms like X, with each side questioning the others’ patriotism and judgment. Even Trump lobbed a shot at Carlson in video captured Monday, telling him to “go get a television network and say it so that people listen.”\n\nIn contrast, the silence of Democrat front ranks has been deafening. \n\nDemocrats Keep Quiet to Avoid a Civil War\n\nProgressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have clearly opposed military escalation. In a bipartisan move, AOC and other Squad Democrats joined forces with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian who put forth legislation that would restrict America’s potential wartime debut on the world stage. But much of the Democrat establishment — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and failed presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris — have stayed conspicuously quiet on the issue. Instead, they have been posting on social media about Father’s Day, the “No Kings” protests, and anti-ICE outbursts. \n\nThis omission is revealing. The Democrat coalition is deeply divided between an establishment faction firmly supporting Israel and a progressive wing wary of waging more wars. Senators like Arizona’s Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman have voiced strong support for Israel, while younger constituents of the party — their pro-Gaza voter base — demand restraint. \n\nFor Democrats, the issue of Iran is a political minefield. Any public stance risks alienating a significant part of contradicting coalitions. Their silence is less about strategy and more about fear — after bombing the 2024 election to Trump’s second term, deciding whether or not to drop one on Iran could further inflame internal divisions and jeopardize their fragile electoral prospects. \n\nRepublicans Must Lead — But at What Political Cost?\n\nThis leaves Republicans alone on the battlefield — not just in foreign policy, but in the domestic political theater surrounding it. Unlike Democrats, they don’t have the luxury of silence. Trump is president again. The GOP controls the White House and is setting the tone for America’s response on the world stage. That comes with a cost: the infighting, the media pressure, the ideological rifts all laid bare.\n\nRepublicans have to hash this out in the open because the world is watching — and because right now, they’re the party in power. Every move, every tweet, and every televised spat carries real-world consequences. The Democrats, at least for now, can afford to stay quiet and let the GOP wear the burden of leadership. But if this crisis escalates further, their silence won’t shield them forever. At some point, everyone will have to choose a side — and say it out loud.\n\nJulianna Frieman is a writer based in North Carolina.

The digital landscape has rapidly changed in the era of social media, and both politicians and media personalities have taken notice. Some have referred to the 2024 election as the \"podcast election,\" arguing that podcaster Joe Rogan and others like him turned the tide for President Donald Trump by having him on their shows. Meyers famously roasted Trump for his political ambitions at a White House correspondents' dinner in 2011, a few short years before he went on to win the presidency. Now in the second Trump term, 14 years later, Meyers spoke to Variety magazine about how the media landscape has changed. After the interviewer noted the trend of politicians appearing on comedians' podcasts, Meyers agreed they have turned out to be a far better platform for them than television interviews ever were. SETH MEYERS SKIPS ASKING GEORGE CLOONEY ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE, NOT RECOGNIZING HIM AT FUNDRAISER \"We’ve kind of weaned ourselves off politicians as guests to begin with, because we have more fun talking about politics than talking to politicians,\" Meyers said of his show which hosted then-President Joe Biden in February 2024 and then-Vice President Kamala Harris in October 2022. \"I actually think there’s more value in a politician going on a podcast and not feeling the rush to just hit talking points, which sometimes they might have on a show like mine,\" he added. \"I think it’s good for the politicians and good for the voters for them to go someplace where there’s more time and less of a race to hit whatever their PR team has come up with.\" While Meyers argued that podcasts don’t necessarily infringe on the type of comedy he does, he noted that they do have one key advantage. \"If there’s anything that podcasts have affected, it’s that you realize that when you’re talking to somebody for eight minutes, it’s very unlikely you’re going to get deeper than a podcast host does with them over the course of an hour and a half,\" he said. He contrasted this with television interviews, where \"You want to move quickly and be funny, because it has to be a different thing than a long-form podcast interview.\" BIDEN SHRUGS OFF AGE CONCERNS DURING FRIENDLY SETH MEYERS CHAT: 'IT'S ABOUT HOW OLD YOUR IDEAS ARE' CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The interviewer noted a prediction from veteran talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that there might not be late-night hosts in 10 years, and Meyers said it may indeed turn out to be true. \"Unless some major sea change happens, I don’t think there’s going to be a whole new wave of network hosts, in the way there always has been,\" Meyers said. \"Nobody understands this business and this format better than Jimmy Kimmel, so when he talks about it, I tend to share his opinion.\" He added further that podcasts continue to be as big as ever, because people are simply going to adapt to the best technological format that carries their message.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court struck down a challenge to a Tennessee law restricting access to puberty blockers and hormone treatment to children who identify as the opposite sex. Several news organizations framed the ruling negatively and implied it was a \"setback for transgender rights\" for all ages, despite the decision affecting only minors. The result was also described as a \"major blow,\" a \"devastating loss,\" and a \"stunning setback.\" SCOTUS RULES ON STATE BAN ON GENDER TRANSITION ‘TREATMENTS’ FOR MINORS IN LANDMARK CASE \"BREAKING: The Supreme Court upholds a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors in a huge setback for transgender rights,\" the Associated Press reported on X Wednesday. \"BREAKING: Supreme Court upholds a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, delivering a major blow to transgender rights,\" NBC News similarly posted. \"The US Supreme Court backed a Republican-backed ban in Tennessee on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, in a setback for transgender rights that could bolster efforts by states to defend other measures targeting transgender people,\" Reuters wrote. \"The Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights,\" The Boston Globe also posted. While the Tennessee law was passed in 2023 and Supreme Court oral arguments were heard in December, some news outlets tied the ruling negatively to President Donald Trump's policies. Newsweek warned in its headline that the ruling was a \"major setback for transgender rights,\" telling readers the decision \"effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump's Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people.\" The Washington Post described the 6-3 ruling as a \"divided Supreme Court\" and called the broader trans debate \"a polarizing national issue the Trump administration has seized on in initiatives targeting transgender rights.\" NPR said the decision \"plunged the Supreme Court into yet another culture war feud.\" SCHUMER RIPS SUPREME COURT DECISION UPHOLDING STATE BAN ON TRANSGENDER TREATMENT FOR MINORS: ‘AWFUL’ The New York Times attempted to equate the ruling on trans-identifying minors to the Supreme Court's 2020 decision giving gay and transgender adults civil rights protections from employers under Title VII. \"The decision, which came amid the Trump administration’s fierce assaults on transgender rights, was a bitter setback for their proponents, who only five years ago celebrated a decision by the court to protect transgender people from workplace discrimination,\" the Times wrote. CNN went even further, decrying the ruling coming at a \"critical time\" for the transgender community. \"The 6-3 decision by a conservative majority is a major blow to the transgender community and its advocates at a critical time,\" CNN wrote. \"Since 2020, Republican-led states around the country have passed a wave of laws regulating the lives of trans Americans, with a particular focus on minors.\" \"And President Donald Trump, who ran for reelection in part on ending the ‘transgender lunacy,’ has taken several steps intended to roll back gains made by that community,\" CNN continued. The Guardian called the ruling \"a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS CNN political director David Chalian said Republicans will use the ongoing transgender debate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, but stressed there will be a \"real human impact\" on American families. \"We're going to learn what the human impact is of this court decision among families across the country, but in the politics of it, I think the two things to watch are how Republicans will sort of hit the gas on this issue, what they believe is a winning culture war issue for them, and watch how Democrats, especially those considering a 2028 presidential campaign, respond to this court ruling. Have they learned to message around this issue in a way that's more politically palatable than what Kamala Harris was able to do back in 24,\" Chalian said on the channel.

They see now that Tennessee has been successful, and so they're going to implement laws that copy the language here,\" MSNBC legal analyst Barbara McQuade said. \"So I think if you are a family today with a transgender child, your child is likely at risk if you live in a state that is hostile to transgender Americans.\"","summary":"Several news organizations pushed the narrative that the Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee&apos;s ban on trans treatment for minors was a &quot;huge setback&quot; for transgender rights.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/supreme-court-ruling-trans-treatments-minors-decried-media-huge-setback-transgender-rights","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/activist-holds-trans-flag.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 22:23:25","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221}]}
