Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Barack Obama. \n\nThe authors posit that whether Harris won or lost, ‘she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him.’\n\nBiden’s staffers remained with the Harris campaign, making it even more difficult to publicly refute the president. \n\nSean Clegg, a Harris advisor not trusted by the Biden staffers, was helping her prepare for a joint appearance with Walz when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished when he stopped her. \n\n‘Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,’ he said, according to an excerpt published by The Hill.\n\nClegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides previously claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out..\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe, but for refusing to drop out earlier in the race after his June debate disaster.\n\nPlouffe claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called ‘the cardinal sin’ of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Joe Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as ‘catastrophic.’\n\n‘When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,’ he told The Atlantic.\n\n‘The Sun Belt was worse than the Blue Wall, but the Blue Wall was bad. And, demographically, young voters across the board—Hispanic voters, Black voters, Asian voters—were in really terrible shape. \n\n‘When the switch happened, some of that stuff got a little bit better, but nowhere near where we ended up or where we needed to be. This was a rescue mission. \n\n‘It was catastrophic in terms of where it was.’ \n\nBiden finally bowed to pressure from allies and stood aside on July 21.\n\nThe party quickly coalesced around his vice president to become the candidate, avoiding a drawn out contest that some feared would divide Democrats and hand the election to Trump but to no avail.\n\n‘I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won,’ said Plouffe. \n\n‘But if we had a primary in which a bunch of people ran and auditioned … through that process, whoever emerged … would have been a more fully formed person, would have had more time to mount a general election campaign. \n\n‘[Not having that process] is the cardinal sin.’\n\nAnd then they had to condense a campaign down into a little more than 100 days. \n\n‘Our first week, it was like, “Well, we need a biography ad, we need to talk about the border, we need to lay out an economic contrast, we need to get health care in there, abortion,'” Plouffe said. \n\n‘If you have six, seven, eight months, you storyboard all this stuff, you have a narrative arc. Everything was smashed and collided here.’\n\nBiden and Harris’ teams blamed each other for wasting over $1 billion in donor cash on a disastrous presidential campaign. \n\nVice Presidential flop Tim Walz blamed himself and Harris for the Democrats ‘ ‘mess’ after their losses at the top of the ticket in November. \n\nWalz and Harris lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout, becoming the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Biden simply told Kamala Harris &#8216;no daylight, kid&#8217; as she prepared for her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden&#8217;s brief advice to Kamala Harris that stopped her from blaming the elderly president right before her initial debate with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bidens-brief-advice-to-kamala-harris-that-stopped-her-from-blaming-the-elderly-president-right-before-her-initial-debate-with-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Bidens-three-word-warning-to-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:13:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":299961620,"title":"Esmond Birnie: T​he economic impact of Donald Trump's return as US president looks dire for both Northern Ireland and America","text":"In the real world, the actual choice for American president in November 2024, at least in terms of economic (il-) literacy was very uninspiring. Donald Trump, the Republican Party candidate, repeatedly said that for him tariffs were an object of beauty – a seeming cure all for every economic ill. (Notwithstanding the well evidenced consensus view in economics that tariffs are a bad thing in general, they damage both the country applying the tariff and those countries on the receiving end). Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party candidate, made some very strange comments that seemed to imply that greedy grocery shops were the main cause of inflation (what about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the creation of money through Quantitative Easing?). My argument is that Trump’s second presidency will have a range of economic impacts on Northern Ireland and the UK. Most of these are negative and some could be very negative: • (very negative) Tariffs reduce Northern Ireland and UK sales to USA. • (negative) Strong arming by Trump may reduce US investment flows (FDI – foreign direct investment) into NI. • (extremely negative) Trump’s up-ending of collective security and alignment with Russia makes a People’s Republic of China grab for Taiwan more likely. Given that Taiwan makes 60-90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors and the presence of so much global shipping lanes through the South China Sea, any such invasion would have an economic impact many times bigger than the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Quite apart from the horrible human cost, it would be a horrendous shock to the supply side. • The tax implications of rising to Trump’s challenge to raise defence spending in Europe. • Possibly the only economic ‘positive’ from a Trump White House could be if he leads to a rolling back of possibly excessive ‘DEI’ (Diversity, Equality and Inclusion) activity in the USA. That could in turn leads to a reduction in DEI over-reach in the UK (as argued by Pamela Dow, former Cabinet Office Civil Servant, in a recent, November 2024 article in the New Statesman magazine, what the UK has certainly seen in recent decades is a relatively rapid growth in Human Resources employment and it is rather unclear how much benefit this has really generated). Looking at the tariff impact in more detail. Here’s an estimation for Northern Ireland: 1. Assume a 20% tariff is applied by the US against NI (UK) goods. 2. Assume NI prices in the US market go up by 20% (ie no reduction in profits by NI firms and no depreciation of £ compared to $). 3. Assume an elasticity of demand (based on an average of various studies) -0.4. 4. This all then implies demand in the USA drops by 8%. 5. Using Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) data (December 2024 with some estimation), NI sale of goods to the USA annually is about £1.3bn, 8% of that is therefore about £100m. 6. By implication NI sales and hence output would drop by about £100m, but this is a direct and narrow estimation of the overall impact. Would such a drop be a big or a small impact? It is ‘only’ about 0.2% of Northern Ireland overall GDP which is about £50 billion. However, if NI’s growth in GDP this year is well under 1% (and this sort of out-turn is quite likely) that would be equivalent to a quarter of overall economic growth. Also, very importantly (and various estimates at the UK-wide level, such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, bear this out) 0.2% is probably too narrow an estimate. Allowing for second or third round effects could push up the overall effect two or three-fold. So, a Trump tariff cost of maybe about £200m-300m annually. This is because we allow for the possibility of retaliation against the US tariffs and the impact of a general reduction in the growth rate of world trade. The fiscal policy aspect of increased defence spending in the UK in the Trump era is also an interesting matter. There will be the undoubted challenge of finding ways to fund such spending. So far international development aid has been reduced but next time it may have to be spending on welfare for working age people (that particular budget line has continued to grow even after the Covid pandemic is over). On the more positive side of the assessment, we are beginning to see ‘military Keynesianism’. As in the 1930s government spending on re-armament is acting as a boost to the economy. Some particular Northern Ireland-based manufacturers have or will benefit from this. Not just Thales but Harland & Wolff (the presence of the immense dry dock in Belfast takes on a strategic value) and also smaller firm such as Denroy Plastics. The latter has been making plastic components for Typhoon jets. In summary then, the overall economic impact of Trump second time round looks rather dire. Both for us and also for America.

Ilhan Omar, promoted a fundraiser for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate who was arrested and now faces deportation over his role in violent campus activities. \n\nThe fundraiser, launched after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Khalil, has so far surpassed $360,000, exceeding its initial $250,000 goal. \n\nOrganizers have since raised the target to $500,000, stating that the funds will support Khalil’s legal defense, provide financial aid to his family, and contribute to “long-term justice efforts” to hold authorities “accountable” for his detention. \n\n“Before his detention, he was targeted by a coordinated smear campaign, with individuals falsely framing his activism as criminal behavior,” the campaign states.\n\nHirsi, a Barnard College senior and far-left activist, shared the fundraiser on her Instagram, urging her followers to contribute. She later criticized Columbia faculty for staying silent on Khalil’s arrest, calling their response “shameful behavior.” \n\nKhalil has been accused of being a “Hamas sympathizer who espouses violent, anti-American views,” with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) student organization — which he served as a senior activist in — calling for the “total eradication of Western civilization.”\n\nSeveral videos have since been released showing violent disruptive campus activities purportedly led by Khalil.\n\nIn one clip, Khalil can be seen dressed in a hoodie featuring Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, urging protesters to “destroy” and “explode the heads of Zionists.”\n\nOn Monday, a judge temporarily halted Khalil’s deportation in defiance of the Trump administration, which says his activism broke the law.\n\nHirsi was previously suspended from Barnard, a liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University, for her involvement with the unauthorized “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” that was later dismantled by officers with the NYPD. In response, her mother, Somalia-born Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN), stated she was “enormously proud” of her daughter.\n\nThe matter comes as Omar, notorious for her antisemitic sentiments, continues to push for Mahmoud Khalil’s immediate release. \n\n“We will not let this administration trample our constitutional rights and silence voices they don’t like,” she wrote.\n\nIn August, Omar touted the power of her district’s massive radical pro-Palestinian “uncommitted” movement, which urged voters to reject Democrats who do not back anti-Israel policies, as she called for a “policy shift” on Israel and Gaza amid her fears of another Trump presidency. \n\nShe warned then-Vice President Kamala Harris that refusal to capitulate to the movement could cost Democrats the election.\n\nOmar, a member of the progressive “Squad” in Congress, has a history of controversy. \n\nShe has been accused repeatedly of being antisemitic and anti-American, including in past statements accusing Israel of being an “apartheid regime” that has “hypnotized the world” and claiming pro-Israel stances of politicians are “all about the Benjamins.”\n\nShe has also referred to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, as a day in which “some people did something.”\n\nIn 2023, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) insisted Omar is “unfit” to represent the U.S. on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nRep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) also blasted the congresswoman after she equated the United States and Israel to Hamas terrorists and the Taliban.\n\n“Omar is an antisemite who hates America and hates American troops,” he said. “She has no place serving in Congress.”\n\nIn 2019, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) defended Omar, telling reporters that while Omar had made several anti-Jewish remarks, she had not been “intentionally antisemitic.”\n\nIn 2023, the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) accused Omar of hating America “as much as Israel.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIsra Hirsi, daughter of Minnesota “Squad” member Rep.

James Comer (R-KY) alleged this week as his Oversight Committee investigates the platform for potential fraud. \n\nComer told OANN’s Andrew Giuliani on Wednesday that the committee made multiple requests to the U.S. Treasury Department to see if the online donation giant had SARs when former President Joe Biden was in office, but “of course, they never would get back with us”:\n\nIt was only after President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election when Treasury officials “confirmed that there were some” reports, Comer said.\n\n“They allowed my staff to go in and view like 10 or 12. They were really bad,” the Kentucky congressman stated. “But I can say with confidence, there are hundreds more.”\n\nThe OANN appearance came just days after the Oversight Committee, along with Committee on House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (R-WI) and Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY) sent a letter to newly confirmed Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent to request access to all of the documents previously withheld by the Biden Administration:\n\nThe Committees remain concerned with recent reports suggesting fraud and evasion of campaign finance law by individuals exploiting online contribution platforms, especially ActBlue. Until recently, ActBlue had not implemented standard procedures to guard against identity theft and fraud, such as by requiring a Card Verification Value (CVV) to process online transactions. The organization is also the subject of several state-level investigations stemming from allegedly fraudulent contributions made via the platform without the reported contributors’ awareness —serious allegations that, if proven true, would violate federal law.\n\nAccording to Comer, the Trump administration “actually responds to our requests for information,” and that the volume of SARs shows that “the banks were suspicious of a lot of activity” regarding ActBlue’s account.\n\n“Obviously, they’re new and figuring out where the bathrooms are and trying to get a handle over everything,” Comer continued, referring to the new Trump administration Treasury. “But I’m very confident that the Oversight Committee will be allowed in to view those suspicious activity reports, and the fact that there are so many shows that the banks were suspicious of a lot of activity.”\n\nHe went on to say that he suspects that ActBlue donations were not “actually coming from John Doe and Jane Doe sitting at home, donating $10 every week to every Democrat candidate running for every office in America.” \n\n“We always suspected that there was an influx of cash coming in from other ways, and the way ActBlue set up their account, it would be very easy to launder money into there through fake credit card accounts and fake names and things like that.”\n\nThe recent Republican push to dig into ActBlue comes as the Massachusetts-based fundraising platform hemorrhages senior officials with no explanation, the New York Times reported last week. \n\nAt least seven senior officials resigned from their roles late last month, and a remaining lawyer suggested that he has even faced internal retaliation, writing “we have Anti-Retaliation and Whistleblower Policies for a reason” in a work Slack thread.\n\n“The exodus has set off deep concerns about ActBlue’s future,” reported the Times, citing a letter from two unions representing the group’s staffers that stated that the “alarming pattern” of departures was “eroding our confidence in the stability of the organization.”","summary":"The Biden administration covered up \"hundreds\" of suspicious activity reports (SAR) for the Democrat Party's fundraising machine, ActBlue, Rep.

Democrats remain deeply divided about the ideological direction the party should follow going forward, and elected Democrats are coming under increasing scrutiny from the base amid concerns they aren't doing enough to oppose President Donald Trump's policies.What To KnowCandidates aren't likely to make official announcements until closer to 2028; if history is any indicator, most will announce after the midterms. But some are already taking early steps to build up their national name recognition, and some of their recent moves have fueled speculation about the presidential race.Costas Panagopoulos, professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Newsweek on Thursday that while it may seem early, candidates need time to mount a presidential campaign and build a base of support and donors. Getting a head start in a presidential race can be beneficial to staking out early positions and warding off other serious challengers who may be on the fence, he said.\"But they have to weigh that against the possibility of peaking too early and creating the space for alternatives to enter the race later in the game that may excite the electorate,\" he added.Potential candidates may also fill a \"leadership vacuum\" Democrats face at the moment, as the opposition to Trump thus far has been \"scattered,\" Panagopoulos said.Here is a look at some of the potential candidates for the 2028 presidential election.Former Transportation Secretary Pete ButtigiegPete Buttigieg, who rose to national prominence during his 2020 presidential bid, announced on Thursday he is not running for Senate in Michigan, a decision some believe indicates he may have his eyes set on 2028.In a Substack post, Buttigieg wrote he considered running for the upper chamber but opted not to do so, as Michigan already has several Democrats who could make strong candidates.\"While my own plans don't include running for office in 2026, I am intensely focused on consolidating, communicating, and supporting this kind of vision,\" he wrote. \"For years I have argued that the decisions made by elected leaders matter entirely because of how they shape our everyday lives - and that the choices made in this decade will determine, for the rest of our lifetimes, the American people's access to freedom, security, and democracy.\"He wrote that he feels \"more motivated than ever to contribute to the future of this country\" and will be spending the coming months \"engaging both legacy and digital media in the service of a politics of everyday life, rooted in the values of freedom, security, and democracy.\"Polls suggest Buttigieg is popular with Democratic voters, and his stint as transportation secretary kept him in the news over the past few years.Surveys also found that he would start in a strong position if he chooses to run, as he consistently places second behind former Vice President Kamala Harris in recent surveys of Democratic voters.California Governor Gavin NewsomGavin Newsom, who leads the largest state in the country, has long been floated as a potential presidential candidate.His recent podcast, which features conservative guests ranging from Steve Bannon to Charlie Kirk, has added to speculation he may be trying to extend his name recognition and reach new audiences who may be less likely to support Democrats, though some in the party aren't a fan that he's platforming those individuals.During a recent podcast, he said he is against transgender athletes competing in women's events, weighing in on a key culture war issue where Democrats have found themselves at odds with a majority of voters.He has established himself as a leading opponent of Trump in his second term so far, and some Republicans are viewing him as a formidable candidate. But he would enter the general election with some voters viewing him as a California liberal, a criticism Harris struggled to shake in 2024 despite her shift to the center.Former Japan Ambassador Rahm EmanuelRahm Emanuel, whose extensive career in politics also includes the titles of U.S. congressman and Chicago mayor, hasn't been viewed as the most likely candidate, but a report from Politico's Jonathan Martin suggests it's an open secret that Emanuel may run.\"Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy,\" Martin wrote. \"The biggest Rahm-may-run tell, though, is that he's already road-testing the first outlines of a stump speech, or at least an issue he can make his own.\"Since Harris' loss, Emanuel has been a leading voice calling for the party to embrace a more centrist approach and could appeal to more moderate Democrats. He was floated as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair candidate, and has made several media appearances.But his candidacy would do little to excite progressives, with whom he has been at odds throughout his political career. He may also be less exciting for voters looking to a new generation of leadership.He also has not publicly confirmed that he's eyeing a presidential bid.Emanuel told Politico, \"I've only been back two months, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not done with public service and I'm hoping public service is not done with me.\"Former Vice President Kamala HarrisWhether Harris decides to make another go at the White House is the biggest question looming over the potential field of candidates.Following her defeat in November, she said she plans to \"stay in the fight,\" but hasn't said exactly how she plans to do so. She is speculated to be considering a California gubernatorial run, but many Democrats want her to run for president again.A recent SurveyUSA poll of 835 voters who haven't backed Trump, conducted from February 13 to February 16, found that 37 percent of respondents prefer Harris in 2028.On one hand, not all Democrats blame her for the presidential loss to Trump. Some say the race was always going to be difficult to win due to inflation and criticism toward the party dismissing concerns about former President Joe Biden's age.Others, however, argue there were plenty of errors made on the campaign trail, from refusing to distance herself from Biden or touting an endorsement from former GOP Representative Liz Cheney, which critics say alienated key Democratic constituencies. These critics believe other Democrats would be better positioned to lead the party moving forward.Harris hasn't said she plans to run again, and Politico reported earlier this month that she plans to make a decision about the gubernatorial race by summer's end.Who Else May Run?Dozens of other Democrats have been named as potential presidential candidates. These hopefuls can differentiate themselves not only through policy, but by embracing broader social components and changes in the information environment, such as how former President Barack Obama harnessed social media in his 2008 campaign, Panagopoulos said.Governors JB Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan have been named potential candidates. Like Buttigieg, Whitmer also turned down the opportunity to run for Senate in her home state.Shapiro and Whitmer both have strong electoral records from battleground states that backed Trump last year, but have less national name recognition.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Harris' running mate, has been named a potential candidate as well. He told The New Yorker earlier this month that he would \"certainly consider\" a run, but hasn't made anything official.Some progressives are rallying behind Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, but she has not expressed interest in running, and it's unclear whether she'd be able to win support from more moderate Democrats and independents.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear hasn't ruled out a presidential run. He was viewed as a potential VP choice for Harris, and has managed to win over Republicans in a solidly conservative state. But he doesn't have quite the same level of national recognition as other potential candidates.Other Democrats want a candidate who hasn't held office, such as businessman Mark Cuban. Cuban, however, has ruled out a bid, Politico reported.What People Are SayingPanagopoulos, to Newsweek: \"One of the main considerations for primary voters is electability, and I'm sure that it will be a top consideration in the 2028 race. As much as voters might be looking for specific policy positions, they're also looking for candidates who can go on and win a general election, and that will be primary preoccupation in 2028. There's a lot that can still happen between now and then, including the midterm elections.\"Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' campaign for California attorney general, recently told Politico: \"I would pretty much guarantee you she [Harris] has no idea what her next move is. She is not someone who makes rash decisions. She takes, sometimes, a painfully long time to make decisions. Could she run for governor? Yes. Do I think she wants to run for governor? Probably not. Could she win? Definitely. Would she like the job? I don't know. Could she run for president again? Yes.\"What Happens NextMost candidates won't start making official campaign announcements until after the midterms, but it's not unprecedented for hopefuls to jump in early. Businessman Andrew Yang and former Representative John Delaney announced their 2020 campaigns in 2017.The first primary contests will be held in early 2028. It's unclear what the primary schedule will look like. Democrats moved South Carolina, a traditionally conservative state that delivered Biden a game-changing win in 2020, to the front of the schedule, but some Democrats want that changed for the next election cycle.","summary":"Speculation is growing that potential 2028 candidates like Pete Buttigieg could be starting to build their national brand.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-2028-field-coming-view-2044479","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2606886/2028-democratic-field-coming-view.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 21:02:20","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":299931118,"title":"How a grandfather’s legacy led Modern Green Book in supporting 2,300 Black businesses","text":"When Black entrepreneurs were struggling against the perils of a global pandemic, \n\nTheo Edwards-Butler responded to their calls for help by pulling from the pages of history and her own family legacy. \n\nIn 2020, the contagious nature of COVID-19 forced people to quarantine in their homes. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, entrepreneurs of color were disproportionately affected by the lockdowns. Black businesses owners witnessed a 11 percent drop in earnings, while white-owned businesses experienced a 2 percent decrease. It was an economic gut-punch that widened the wealth gap for Black entrepreneurs, who already receive three times less capital than white entrepreneurs to start their ventures. \n\nIn Birmingham, Ala., Edwards-Butler helped Black professionals survive beyond the statistics by creating a virtual business database called the Modern Green Book. The project borrows its name from the “Negro Motorist Green Book,” a vital resource that helped Black travelers find safe havens to eat, sleep, get gas and more during their road trips across segregated America. The guidebook was published during the mid-20th century by postal worker and World War I veteran Victor Hugo Green. Although different in their objectives, — Green’s work focused on pushing back against racial discrimination while traveling — Edwards-Butler’s support for Black-owned businesses matches the energy of a time when many Americans were challenging systemic racism on multiple fronts following the murder of George Floyd and other Black people at the hands of law enforcement. \n\n“People were looking for a way to continue the protest further than just marching,” Edwards-Butler said. “The Modern Green Book was a way to ensure that our voices would be heard, our dollars would be seen and how impactful the Black dollar and Black-owned businesses are to communities.” \n\nAbout five years since starting her passion project, more than 2,350 businesses nationwide have increased their visibility and received marketing assistance from the Modern Green Book’s growing platform. In 2021, she organized the inaugural Culture and Commerce Festival, where attendants perused the tents of more than 30 Southern Black-owned businesses and enjoyed delicious foods, a car show and a hip-hop concert. This year’s festival will take place at the end of August, which is Black Business Month. In 2023, she officially launched started the MGB Agency to help entrepreneurs advertise better in a digital landscape. \n\nIt was Edwards-Butler’s grandfather, Adee C. Butler, who taught her the power of the Black dollar. Butler was the son of sharecroppers and church leaders. His upbringing in Memphis educated him about the economics behind operating farmland and a place of faith. \n\n“You have to operate a church like how you would operate a business to keep the lights on and to keep the congregation there,” Edwards-Butler said. “So I think he saw his parents go from sharecropping to being community leaders with his church, and then when he got older, he became Mr. Entrepreneur.” \n\nButler wasn’t a 9-to-5 man. The only boss he had was himself. He owned his own farm near Louisville, Ky., where Edwards-Butler was raised. He owned a gas station, mechanic shop, apartment building and operated a hotel with his sister. Edwards-Butler’s first job was helping her grandmother pluck eggs from the chicken coop on Saturday night to sell to the church congregation on Sunday morning. \n\n“He was a very influential man to the Louisville business community,” Edwards-Butler said. \n\nButler knew the dangers of conducting businesses while Black under Jim Crow. During family road trips, Butler-Edwards remembers how nervous her grandfather was during pit stops in rural, white towns. He would suggest that they keep going to the next stop, where they would be safer as a Black family. It took Edwards-Butler a little while to sense the risks herself. \n\n“He was very big on ‘Keep your gas tanks full because you never know when your next stop will be’ or ‘I don’t know if we can stop in this town,’” Edwards-Butler said. “There were a few times where we would stop at a gas station, and you would definitely get the vibe [that] they’re serving us because it’s the societal standard to be welcoming to everybody – But they did not want to be welcoming to everybody.” \n\nBut that fear didn’t stop Butler from growing generational wealth for his family. He wasn’t the type to stash cash in a mattress. He put his money into assets that would increase in value over time, like property and his coin collection. Before his death, Butler passed down his financial savviness to his son, who later taught those tips to Edwards-Butler. \n\n“He set up our family to be in the position that my parents and even myself are in today,” Edwards-Butler said. \n\nNow Edwards-Butler is using her talents and ancestral wisdom to help Black-owned businesses today, and there’s no better time to do so. The same corporations that beefed up their diversity programs in 2020, are now dismantling those initiatives due to the political attack on diversity, equity and inclusion. Consumers have organized multiple boycotts against Target, Amazon, Walmart and other corporations for going back on their initiatives to support Black entrepreneurs. \n\nEdwards-Butler talked to Black Joy founder Starr Dunigan about the importance of honoring Green’s Legacy and how boycotters can boost their impact even when they live in an area where big-box retailers are all that’s available for their shopping needs. \n\nHow were you introduced to the original Green Book and how did that knowledge influence you?\n\nI actually learned about it in high school. There was not a whole section on it or anything like that in our textbooks. It was something that our history teacher told us. He was like, ‘And also during this period of time, there was a book that Black motorists would use to drive around during the Jim Crow era. It was always in the back of my mind, but it was never anything that ever came up in conversation. It’s really not talked about. It’s more likely that people don’t know about it than do know about it. \n\nThen when I was getting this [project] going, I was like, ‘Oh, this is like a virtual Green Book – a modern Green Book.’ So that’s how we got the name for it.\n\nThe more research I did into who Victor Hugo Green was as a person and how he wanted this book to become a place of Black excellence, I think that’s what drove me to the creation of the Modern Green Book. I think because I knew what the Green Book originally was and what it stood for, I think that’s what drove me to using that name, that history and that Legacy to build upon.\n\nSince you did a lot of research into Victor Hugo Green, what would it look like to incorporate his vision and passion for Black-owned businesses today?\n\nBy going to support these businesses and to make sure they are sustainable and thriving. I think that’s really what it was all about. He wrote a quote in – I can’t remember which book it was – but he said, ‘At some point in time, this book will not be necessary.’ It’s him wanting to have this level of success for Black-owned businesses and for Black people in general to where we can claim our stake in this country and be able to fully embrace who we are as people and our contributions to the country. A good bit of that is the businesses that we’ve created. I think if we all were to continue to pour into these businesses and these entrepreneurs, and continue to build Black businesses going forward, I think that would really honor his vision and his legacy, too.\n\nSo you started this project in 2020, which is five years ago. Congrats on that milestone. Can you talk about how the attitudes towards Black-owned business have changed in 2020 versus now? \n\nI definitely think it’s been a bit of a roller coaster with how everybody feels about it. It kind of ebbs and flows. When 2020 first hit we saw maybe a full year and a half of people really, really, really being ten toes down in supporting Black-owned. Then 2023 started and you saw a dip because it was not necessarily the popular thing to do or, you know, people were just doing it so naturally, at that point it wasn’t advertised as much.\n\nBut I do think in 2024, we saw a rise of the number of Black-owned businesses. Then the amount of support those businesses received helped them have that longevity because a lot of them are still open today. \n\nI think honestly – and it hurts me to say this – I do think sometimes it takes a big social or political thing to happen for people to really come together to support Black-owned businesses. Like in 2024 when it was election season and we saw [former Vice President] Kamala Harris take on that role, and then we saw Trump get back into [the presidency], everybody’s, ‘OK. Now it’s time.’ I think right now we’re in the upswing of supporting Black-owned. People are actively looking at our website, and they’re not just our normal regulars. We’re getting a lot of new people coming into the community who are looking to support Black-owned businesses intentionally.\n\nAs someone who has a deep passion for Black entrepreneurs, how can we make that support more sustainable?\n\nI talk about this all the time because I’m very big on we have to match the energy that our majority-owned counterparts bring to the table. So when I say majority-owned, I mean white-owned, white women-owned, even Asian American-owned. Their communities really, really stick to supporting their businesses. Like, I’ve never walked into a Latin American-owned business and not seen other Latin Americans in there supporting. Right? I think, one, we as a people need to understand that in order for us to get the support we want is that we have to be the people in there giving the support first.\n\nThen two, we’ve got to find a money source to be able to elevate all of our businesses up to the same standard. I think a lot of times when we look at our majority-owned counterparts, they have a lot more marketing dollars, a lot more dollars that they can use on building out brick-and-mortar spaces, a lot more dollars they can use on public relations. So we have to find a money source – something to help us elevate ourselves and to put ourselves on the map. \n\n Three, I think we also need to hold ourselves to a very certain standard. We as consumers need to stop thinking, ‘Oh, well Black businesses are going to overcharge me. Black businesses aren’t as professional. Black businesses aren’t this or aren’t that.’ Us as Black business owners need to set a standard for ourselves that we will try to get away from some of those negative practices. It might be one of us that has that negative practice, but it affects all of us.\n\nYeah, I’ve heard people say, ‘Well, I’m going to go to a Black-owned business and I am going to spend a lot more money.’ And my thought process was, ‘Well, maybe that’s because they get a lot less capital than white-owned businesses do. So yes, their prices may be a little bit higher.’\n\nYes. They can’t necessarily afford to go and work with a big brand that might have the ingredient or tool they need to create their product. Whereas a majority-owned business can spend $10,000 on something, the Black-owned business might not be able to spend as much. A lot of times we’re doing it on our own. We don’t have a factory or a warehouse. We don’t have manufacturers. A lot of times, work is done out of our homes or out of small offices. And so it tends to add up in price when you add all those things together.\n\nWe’ve heard a lot about boycotts this year. I just wanted to get your thoughts about it because I know there’s a lot of questions from people who are in small, rural communities and the only thing they have is Walmart. So do you have any advice for those people who are in areas where they feel like they can’t boycott because of where they are? \n\nIt’s hard to stay out of stores like that, especially when it’s your only option. If you are going to be shopping in those stores regularly, then try to make a switch from a product that you typically would buy from Target or Walmart to a Black-owned version of it. A lot of times there’s a Black alternative. \n\nMy advice would be to try your best to have the majority of your cart be from a business that would fall under what is considered DEI. So Black-owned, Latino-owned, Asian-owned, you know what I’m saying? So do your research, find those like Black-owned brands. You can switch up your toothbrush brand at Walmart, which sells Coral Oral – a Black-owned toothbrush brand. That shows Walmart or other corporations like Target, that these Black businesses and these entrepreneurs are worth our dollars to create platforms and [DEI] programs for. It shows the impact that these businesses have on these big-box stores.\n\nYou can also switch something out that you would normally buy from Target and buy those items from a small, Black-owned, Latino-owned or diverse business. That will show Target, Walmart and others that rolling back DEI wasn’t a good idea because we can just make a bigger impact with our dollars spent in these other stores. \n\nSo that’s what I would say because I do get it. Thankfully I’m in a position where I can wait and order things online. I’m in a city where there are enough Black-owned businesses in my area that I could probably make a switch without having to go into the big box stores.\n\nSince you communicate with these Black business owners, what are they telling you that they need from us right now?\n\nIt’s one thing to support one time, it’s another thing to support consistently. Now that people understand that buying Black is something we need to be paying more close attention to, I think people need to understand that it’s more than just a one-time thing, right? How can we make buying Black a regular occurrence for everybody? \n\nAs consumers, we’re buying stuff almost every day. So how can we turn our consumer shopping habits into 20, 30 of our purchases coming from or going to Black-owned businesses regularly? Don’t just buy it that one time. Buy it when you get close to running out. Buy it again.","summary":"The Modern Green Book has helped over 2,300 Black businesses survive the pandemic and anti-DEI campaigns during the platform's five-year existence.","url":"https://www.nj.com/blackjoy/2025/03/how-a-grandfathers-legacy-led-modern-green-book-in-supporting-2300-black-businesses.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/KYKSVHAC2RCSBNKBT5SNSSZMIE.jpg?auth=61c9dcf2666c1328fccd832b8d935ff05d8d735bcca32caa02618694a39ca1a4&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 20:40:48","author":"Jonece Starr Dunigan","authors":["Jonece Starr Dunigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.318},{"id":299924148,"title":"Natasha's actions may block women from getting political appointments - Akpabio","text":"Senate President Godswill Akpabio has fired back at Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, warning that her actions and attitude may hamper the prospect of women getting political appointments in high-ranking positions in Nigeria.\n\nAkpabio, a former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, spoke during plenary on Thursday, March 13, 2025, expressing concern that the controversy surrounding Akpoti-Uduaghan’s allegations against him could have long-term consequences for women’s inclusion in governance.\n\nThe Kogi Central lawmaker recently said that the Senate President made repeated sexual advances at her, claiming that her refusal to play ball with Akpabio was responsible for her ordeal in the upper legislative chamber.\n\nThe allegation came to light after the Red Chamber moved to punish Natasha for her misconduct during plenary, where she protested the seating rearrangement. She was later handed a six-month suspension after following the recommendation of the Ethics Committee.\n\nALSO READ: Natasha: Akpabio at risk of long jail term as fresh details emerge\n\nThe Kogi lawmaker subsequently submitted to the Senate a sexual harassment petition against Akpabio, after which she took the matter to court.\n\nNatasha followed up by reporting the matter to the United Nations Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), where she claimed that the Senate suspended her for reporting a sexual misconduct case against Akpabio.\n\nAkpabio highlights the dangers of Senator Natasha's actions\n\nThe Senate President condemned Natasha's handling of the situation, accusing her of escalating the matter unnecessarily.\n\n“When this issue began, she initially brought it to the Senate through a petition but did not allow the chamber to deliberate on it before taking it to court. Even then, she did not allow the court to address it before escalating the matter to the international community,” he stated.\n\nThe former Akwa Ibom Governor likened the accusation to a hypothetical scenario where former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris accused President Joe Biden of sexual assault for simply shaking her hand or guiding her through the White House.\n\n“If such an allegation were made, it would create a precedent where no woman would ever be chosen as vice president again.”\n\nALSO READ: Senate writes UN IPU - gives reason for Natasha’s suspension\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President appealed to politicians not to shut the door of opportunities to women, especially his four daughters, because of one person's action.\n\n“I have four daughters, and I want to plead with politicians to still give them and other women a chance.

We're dealing with a lot of uncertainties. I worry about folks being out of work. I worry about what we think about diversity and inclusion...who do we want to be as a country keeps me up at night.'\n\nIMO, short for 'in my opinion,' is a weekly podcast that debuted on Wednesday.\n\nMeant to be mainly an advice platform, the siblings took one question from the audience with the help of special guest Laurie Santos, a Yale psychology professor who hosts her own podcast, 'The Happiness Lab.' \n\nMichelle did bring up her husband, sharing how they got through negativity during two terms in the White House.\n\n'You cannot live through social media,' the former FLOTUS said. \n\n'I don't think I've once looked through a comments section- period. I would implore young people, don't let that negative energy enter into your space.'\n\nShe added how rumors are often spread online, and it distorts our sense of reality. \n\nAlthough the podcast is not meant to be political, there were many references to current events, with Michelle calling federal and public workers the soul of the nation.\n\n'We still live in a world where science matters,' Michelle declared to applause and cheers from attendees. \n\nShe also referenced billionaires who don't 'seem happy' despite having more money than they can spend.\n\n'I know a whole lot of these billionaires, and I don’t know, as we can see, that they seem happy. Ultimately, if that’s your only goal, is to have more than you need, to never been satisfied...there will be a hole in your heart,' Michelle said. \n\nDuring the podcast's inaugural episode, Michelle shared she would not be able to 'get through' her eight years in the White House without Robinson.\n\n'Being married to the president of the United States [is a] thing that that none of us kind of banked on,' she said. \n\n'We knew Barack was smart and ambitious, but, you know...'\n\nMichelle never wanted her husband to run for the highest office. \n\nIt was her brother who convinced her to support her husband's political ambitions. \n\n'You talked me into supporting his run. He was smart enough to know that he needed to come to you and sell you on the idea. Because I was definitely like, no, no way,' she said. \n\nMichelle also confessed that she was irritated by Obama's lack of punctuality at the start of their relationship. \n\n'Barack had to adjust to what on time was... you know, I've got this husband who, when it's time to leave, he's getting up and going to the bathroom. \n\n'And I was like, dude, like 3 three o'clock departure means you've done all that. \n\nThe podcast is produced by Higher Ground, the production company founded by the Obamas in 2018, but it's unclear what, if any role, Barack has in the production. \n\nThe company has previously released a limited series about Stevie Wonder and a celebrity interview show about family recipes. Michelle previously hosted a podcast, The Michelle Obama Podcast.\n\nThe Obamas have attempted to quash speculation about their marriage by posting a romantic selfie smiling and embracing on Instagram for Valentine's Day.\n\n'Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day, Michelle Obama!' the Democrat wrote in a social media caption.\n\nIt was unclear when the image was taken, but Michelle shared the same selfie on her own account.\n\nShe wrote: 'If there's one person I can always count on, it's you, Barack Obama. You're my rock. Always have been. Always will be. Happy Valentine's Day, honey!'\n\nThe Obamas have been spending an increasing amount of time in California since 2021 when eldest daughter Malia relocated to LA after graduating from Harvard to pursue a career in screen writing and film production.\n\nFamously, the Golden State was their first stop after leaving the White House in 2016 with the former First Couple treating their family to a vacation in a secluded Palm Springs mansion.\n\nSince then, their love of the famously Liberal state has only grown with younger daughter Sasha transferring to the University of Southern California from the University of Michigan in 2022.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in sociology, Sasha has shown interest in following her sister into the entertainment business.","summary":"Former First Lady

emerges for the 2028 presidential race","text":"Pete Buttigieg ruled himself out of the race for the Michigan Senate seat on Thursday, setting off an avalanche of speculation that he has his sights set instead on 2028. \n\nButtigieg’s family recently moved to Traverse City, Michigan from Indiana, raising questions over whether he would run for the Senate should the seat become available or run for governor. \n\nBut Buttigieg ruled both 2026 bids out this week, but he signaled he was not done with public life. \n\n‘I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,’ Buttigieg wrote on X.\n\n‘While my own plans don’t include running for office in 2026, I remain intensely focused on consolidating, communicating, and supporting a vision for this alternative,’ he added in another post. \n\nIn a separate essay about his decision, Buttigieg said while he wasn’t running next year’s election, he would be ‘getting to work.’\n\nThe former transportation secretary turned heads ahead of the 2020 election when he mounted a formidable underdog bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and went on to become one of the top contenders. \n\nHe had one of the strongest fundraising operations of the entire Democratic presidential field depsite the crowded race. \n\nBut as his frontrunner status dwindled after placing second in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg exited the race and endorsed Joe Biden for president before joining his administration.\n\nWhile he did not come right out and say he would run against in 2028 for the nomination, not running in Michigan next year clears the way for another White House bid.\n\nIn his announcement on Thursday, Buttigieg vowed he would not be exiting the public spotlight. \n\nThe 43-year-old said he would be spending more time engaging the media as well as ‘partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered.’\n\nSince leaving office, Buttigieg has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration’s policies when it comes to tariffs, taxes, DOGE slashing funds and the workforce and the U.S. response to the war in Ukraine. \n\nHe has also clapped back and defended his tenure as transportation secretary amid direct attacks on him by Trump administration officials who have pointed fingers following a series of plane crashes.\n\nButtigieg said Thursday he would be taking advantage of leaving public office to speak with people in Michigan and other communities like South Bend, IN where he served as mayor from 2012 to 2020. \n\n‘You’ll be seeing me on familiar platforms and newer ones, developing this vision and discussing with fellow Americans what they most need from their government and their country at a time like this,’ he wrote. \n\nSuch actions are telltale signs of someone looking to promote their name recognition and brand as they consider higher office. \n\nAhead of his announcement on Thursday, Politico reported the decision was framed by ‘several allies and people in his inner circle as putting him in the strongest possible position to seek the presidency.’\n\nShould Buttigieg run for president in 2028, he is likely to face a crowded field of Democrats seeking the nomination just as he did in 2020. \n\nThere have been reports of former Obama White House chief of staff and Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel eyeing a bid as well former Vice President Kamala Harris considering another run. \n\nOther names floated have included several term-limited Democratic governors. Among them is another prominent figure who would give Buttigieg a run for his money in his adopted home state Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPete Buttigieg ruled himself out of the race for the Michigan Senate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A potential Democratic contender emerges for the 2028 presidential race first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/a-potential-democratic-contender-emerges-for-the-2028-presidential-race/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-The-dark-horse-Democrat-who-is-eying.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 20:03:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.215},{"id":299946098,"title":"Ilhan Omar’s Daughter Promotes Fundraiser for Detained Pro-Hamas Activist Mahmoud Khalil","text":"Isra Hirsi, daughter of Minnesota “Squad” member Rep.

She later criticized Columbia faculty for staying silent on Khalil’s arrest, calling their response “shameful behavior.” \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Jew Hate Database (@jewhatedb)\n\nKhalil has been accused of being a “Hamas sympathizer who espouses violent, anti-American views,” with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) student organization — which he served as a senior activist in — calling for the “total eradication of Western civilization.”\n\nSeveral videos have since been released showing violent disruptive campus activities purportedly led by Khalil.\n\nIn one clip, Khalil can be seen dressed in a hoodie featuring Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, urging protesters to “destroy” and “explode the heads of Zionists.”\n\nOn Monday, a judge temporarily halted Khalil’s deportation in defiance of the Trump administration, which says his activism broke the law.\n\nHirsi was previously suspended from Barnard, a liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University, for her involvement with the unauthorized “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” that was later dismantled by officers with the NYPD. In response, her mother, Somalia-born Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN), stated she was “enormously proud” of her daughter.\n\nThe matter comes as Omar, notorious for her antisemitic sentiments, continues to push for Mahmoud Khalil’s immediate release. \n\n“We will not let this administration trample our constitutional rights and silence voices they don’t like,” she wrote.\n\nIn August, Omar touted the power of her district’s massive radical pro-Palestinian “uncommitted” movement, which urged voters to reject Democrats who do not back anti-Israel policies, as she called for a “policy shift” on Israel and Gaza amid her fears of another Trump presidency. \n\nShe warned then-Vice President Kamala Harris that refusal to capitulate to the movement could cost Democrats the election.\n\nOmar, a member of the progressive “Squad” in Congress, has a history of controversy. \n\nShe has been accused repeatedly of being antisemitic and anti-American, including in past statements accusing Israel of being an “apartheid regime” that has “hypnotized the world” and claiming pro-Israel stances of politicians are “all about the Benjamins.”\n\nShe has also referred to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, as a day in which “some people did something.”\n\nIn 2023, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) insisted Omar is “unfit” to represent the U.S. on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nRep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) also blasted the congresswoman after she equated the United States and Israel to Hamas terrorists and the Taliban.\n\n“Omar is an antisemite who hates America and hates American troops,” he said. “She has no place serving in Congress.”\n\nIn 2019, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) defended Omar, telling reporters that while Omar had made several anti-Jewish remarks, she had not been “intentionally antisemitic.”\n\nIn 2023, the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) accused Omar of hating America “as much as Israel.”\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Since last December, Johnson has been cheerleading a congressional investigation into ActBlue, the largest Democratic online fundraising platform. Last year, it took in $3.8 billion, more than double the amount raised by the equivalent Republican PAC, WinRed. Two of Johnson’s lieutenants, Wisconsin Republican congressman Bryan Steil and Kentucky Republican congressman James Comer, along with New York Republican representative Nick Langworthy, have issued a subpoena seeking suspicious activity reports from the Treasury Department related to ActBlue, hunting for evidence of what they claim is possible fraud. California Republican congressman Darrell Issa, always a voice of calm and reason, has called on the Treasury Department to probe whether ActBlue has knowingly supported terrorist groups. (The organization did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThe assault on ActBlue—just as seven of the group’s senior leaders have quit for unknown reasons—could do plenty of damage to Democrats all by itself. Yet it could also be merely the start of a broader Republican tactic: attempting to disrupt the flow of Democratic campaign money. Ted Cruz has been flirting with the same idea; in February, the Texas Republican threatened to issue his first subpoena as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to Bonterra, a private company that owns significant Democratic and progressive tech fundraising infrastructure. Cruz has backed off for now, saying that Bonterra has made a good-faith effort to turn over the requested documents.\nNevertheless, these early forays are rippling through the Democratic fundraising world, especially because the Trump administration has appeared eager to use the Department of Justice to go after its political adversaries. “People ask whether Democratic donors are intimidated because they don’t want to be investigated,” says Rufus Gifford, who was finance chair for Joe Biden’s, and then Kamala Harris’s, 2024 presidential campaign. “I haven’t seen that. But no one is going to raise their hand and say so.”\nIndeed, a senior official at a prominent Democrat-adjacent group chooses his words very carefully on the subject. “Republicans are systematically trying to go after funding sources or things that enable key parts of the Democratic funding operation, boxing in their opponents and making it hard to operate,” the official says. “It’s part of them trying to chill dissent, including going after law firms, like Perkins Coie, that have worked for Democrats. Whether or not they have any actual legal success, they’ll make it hell in the process, eating up resources.”\nOr perhaps keeping those resources in the pockets of donors and away from Democratic groups or candidates. Many PACs won’t file their first disclosure reports of 2025 until April 15, and electoral off-years are generally sleepier, so it’s difficult to assess whether there has already been a downturn in giving. Anecdotally, at least, there is considerable chatter about possible Democratic donor reluctance—though fear of Trump, coupled with frustration over November’s election results, may also be a convenient excuse to keep checkbooks closed.\n“There is a sense of impending—I don’t want to call it ‘doom,’” says Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, which focuses on educating and mobilizing Black voters. “But impending trouble, because the Trump administration is doing essentially what they said they would do. So there’s concern among both political donors and philanthropic donors.”\nShropshire says she’s hopeful, though, that ultimately the impact of Republican attacks won’t be intimidation but inspiration. “I’ve had conversations with donors who are really clear on the role wealthy folks played in moments of transformative change—for instance, the Civil Rights Movement,” she says. “And some of them are feeling very much like we’re in another moment where change needs to happen, and they’re more committed.” But it won’t be until this fall, when some major state gubernatorial races heat up, that Shropshire says she will feel confident in judging donor enthusiasm.\nJohn Morgan, a longtime Democratic contributor and fundraiser, isn’t waiting to do his handicapping. When I ask if he believes fellow big-money donors are wary of being investigated, Morgan’s answer is quick: “Well, we know Jeff Bezos is.” For his own part, though, the Florida trial lawyer says he isn’t spooked. “If I have to be Navalny, well, that’d be a good way to go,” Morgan says. Given Trump’s admiration for Vladimir Putin, the reference is equal parts apt and unnerving.","summary":"Party organizers worry that the GOP’s investigation into ActBlue is part of a broader crusade that could cripple grassroots contributions and scare off big-money benefactors from jumping into the fray.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/maga-assault-democratic-fundraising","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67d2fe504c6555d947b0369f/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/mike-johnson-maga-funding.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 18:39:53","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":299907508,"title":"A reminder that Kamala Harris was a terrible candidate","text":"A new excerpt from the book looks at the fraught relationship between Harris and former President Joe Biden, whose infirmity led to his withdrawal from the race, which, in turn, led to Harris becoming the Democratic candidate in late July 2024. The excerpt concerns Biden’s demands that Harris hew closely to his administration’s record — he told Harris there should be “no daylight” between her campaign positions and his record as president. But before going into that, Allen and Parnes make a telling observation about the nature of the Harris candidacy.\n\nThe issue was how Harris could present herself as a change agent. She thought it was risky to make a big break with Biden — after all, she had been his loyal vice president for four years. Maybe she could find some new issues. Or maybe, as Allen and Parnes write, Harris “could rely on voters to see her gender, her genes, and her ‘lived experience’ — a middle-class upbringing, schools outside the Ivy League, and a career as a prosecutor — as symbols of change.”\n\nThat’s pretty revealing. The first two factors Harris could think of to present to voters were her gender and race. You can make history by voting for me! Then Harris would tout that she grew up middle class — just like you! — and didn’t even go to an Ivy League school. Imagine that. And then she would stress, against voters’ observation and common sense, that her experience as a prosecutor and elected official in San Francisco made her a tough-on-crime candidate. \n\nThat is a pretty concise way to say that there just wasn’t much to Harris as a candidate for president. There was a reason Democratic primary voters were unimpressed with her when she ran for president in 2019. Four years as vice president did not change much.\n\nBut there’s no doubt Biden made things difficult for Harris. Even as the media fawned over her — remember the “sugar high” that stretched from the time she was given the Democratic nomination through the party convention? — she was still burdened by Biden’s disastrous record on inflation, on the border, and on global disorder. \n\nBiden “would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win,” the authors write. “But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us. ‘No daylight’ was the phrase he had used as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 to bind Republican nominee John McCain to an unpopular president, George W. Bush.”\n\nThat, too, is revealing. In 2008, Biden used the “no daylight” gambit to tie an opposing presidential candidate, McCain, to the disastrous record of his predecessor, Bush. And now, in 2024, he did it again, only Biden was the president with the disastrous record and Harris was the successor candidate. The results, a McCain loss and a Harris loss, were the same.\n\nIt didn’t help that it seemed Biden’s entire staff jumped onto the Harris campaign. “Almost everywhere she went, Harris walked among former Biden aides who sought to defend his presidency,” the authors write. “Her campaign was run by a former White House deputy chief of staff … and a phalanx of department heads who had served Biden until the previous month.”\n\nHere’s a question. If Harris had not been so tied to Biden, if she had been able to craft the campaign she wanted to run, would she have been able to win? That seems highly unlikely. The truest truism in politics is that candidate quality matters. And Harris was a terrible candidate. Had she been freed from the Biden constraints, she would still have been a terrible candidate. Had she run against someone other than Donald Trump, she would still have been a terrible candidate. Had there been a world of daylight between Harris and Biden, she would still have been a terrible candidate. \n\nSo blame Joe Biden for handicapping the Harris campaign. If he did, he did it not by tying Harris to his record as much as by having an awful record in the first place. But in the end, don’t blame Biden for Harris’s loss. She did that all by herself.","summary":"A REMINDER THAT KAMALA HARRIS WAS A TERRIBLE CANDIDATE. Recently, a video circulated of former Vice President Kamala Harris engaging in her trademark word salad during an appearance at an AI conference in Las Vegas.

She is now facing criticism for her response—or rather lack of a reply—since the Democratic candidate’s tragic loss to Trump in the November 2024 election.\n\nWhile Kamala was relatively silent after the results came out and Donald Trump’s return caused a sudden political shift in the American political scenario, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and the Democratic nominee for vice president, has ensured his presence doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nAs per The Irish Star, he has been actively engaging with voters, attending town halls, and calling out the Trump administration’s controversial policies. In addition, Walz has also revealed that he is about to hit the road on a national tour of Republican districts, saying, “I’m hitting the road, travelling to red states across the country to give a voice to the people. Your congressman may not want to listen, but they’re going to hear from us anyway.”\n\nWalz further explained that his decision to embark on a political tour came after a group of people voiced their concerns about what Trump’s administration was doing and expressed their concerns about how he might wish to establish an authoritarian government. Walz wants to be the one who listens to them and understands them. \n\n“It was about these Republican representatives recognizing this stuff’s really unpopular, so they’re going to quit the town halls. These folks need to be heard. They need to be heard, and to be candid with you, Democratic leadership needs to hear them,” he added.\n\nTim Walz UNLEASHES on Trump:\n“He stiffed contractors, he stiffed workers. He doesn’t pay his bills. He declares bankruptcy…He is the worst possible business executive that I have ever witnessed.”\nGIVE HIM HELL, GOVERNOR!\n\n— CALL TO ACTIVISM (@CalltoActivism) March 13, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris has only posted on her social media to mark some important U.S. landmark days rather than speak against the opposition’s wrongdoings. One online account wrote, “By far the most appealing thing about Walz is him constantly apologizing on live TV for losing while Kamala has spent the last six months at awards shows and Broadway plays.”\n\nConsequently, Harris has expressed a desire to remain involved in public life, per the BBC. During a student event in December, fight against things that need a voice and matter to improve the world. She might consider running for California governor in 2026 when Gavin Newsom steps down or contest another run for the White House presidency in 2028.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAccording to the BBC, while recent Democratic candidates who lost elections—like Al Gore, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton—have decided against seeking the presidency and settled as opposition, allies, or donors, reports suggest that there’s scope for Kamala to run for the White House yet again. Her bad luck and circumstances caused her to lose in 2025.\n\nIn her personal life, Harris made headlines for alleged tensions in her marriage to Douglas Emhoff, which started after the election loss. Reports revealed that Harris blamed him for her career setback and was frustrated with him. While neither confirmed any speculations, Emhoff posted a sweet Instagram wish for Harris on Valentine’s Day.","summary":"Kamala Harris recently faced criticism for her silence after the election loss.

But ultimately, it’s a collection of hollow, symbolic displays focused on changing how Democrats are perceived. Take, for example, the first solution: “Embrace patriotism, community, and traditional American imagery.” The fact that this even needs to be said to Democrats is indicative of their problem. The Democratic Party currently rejects patriotism and traditional American imagery because it does not think America is anything special.\n\nThis has been on display since the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020. Just last year, former President Joe Biden, when he was still the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, told black college students that they have to be “10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot” and that America doesn’t love black people. Democrats celebrated athletes protesting the national anthem and even recreated that protest at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThis is the mindset that Democrats have cultivated. Democrats now tell pollsters they are far less proud to be an American when a Republican is president than Republicans do when Democrats have power. Even when Democrats come out and say that they do not believe the United States is a racist country, they turn around and undermine their insincere claim by talking about “systemic” racism when it comes to policing, the economy, or any other facet of life.\n\nDemocrats cannot truly embrace patriotism because they can’t run away from the race-obsessed worldview on which they have centered their ideology. And when they lose, prominent Democratic strategists such as David Axelrod say the country is too racist and sexist to elect a black woman. They aren’t serious about changing to appeal to voters, only in changing how those voters perceive them.\n\nThis is apparent in two ways. The first is the “ban far-left candidate questionnaires,” which is only included because former Vice President Kamala Harris embarrassed herself by telling the American Civil Liberties Union that she supported taxpayer-funded sex changes for transgender prisoners. That remark from 2019 was turned into an effective ad for the Trump campaign. Note that the solution is to ban those kinds of questionnaires so candidates like Harris can better hide from voters what far-left positions they support.\n\nA similar perception-focused reform urges Democrats to “get out of elite circles and into real communities.” This is, in essence, the strategy used by the Harris campaign to promote her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN). Democrats tried to portray Walz as a man’s man who loved guns and football and camouflage clothes. The result was embarrassing stunts such as his hunting expedition, which made it look like Walz had never held a gun, or his Madden football video game match against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), which made it seem like he never watched football.\n\nNow, try to picture prominent Democrats hitting some of the sites recommended. Can you imagine Harris or Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) ever going to a gun show or a tailgate and the result not being a cringeworthy display like Walz’s? Even the recommendation that Democrats should go to “local restaurants” is an admission that Democrats feel more comfortable on an Ivy League campus or at a celebrity fundraiser.\n\nThen there is the problem of accountability, or owning “the failures of Democratic governance in large cities.” To do so would be to indict Democratic governance as a whole, as the mayors these cities cycle through are backed by the party establishment every go-around. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, fresh off of abandoning her city during destructive wildfires, was endorsed by a who’s who of Democratic Party Leaders: Biden, Harris, former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nIn Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson was endorsed by multiple Democratic members of Congress who have no affiliations with Chicago, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). New York City Mayor Eric Adams was endorsed by several New York Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. Jerry Nadler, and Gov. Kathy Hochul. Soft-on-crime Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón was endorsed by Harris in 2020.\n\nFor Democrats to “own” the failures of those failed governors and local leaders, they would have to admit that they have been foisting terrible candidates on voters for decades. This is before you even reach the terribly governed states, such as California. Does something such as “yeah, we have run this state or city terribly for 20-50 years, but we promise that we will get it right next time” seem like an authentic message that voters will accept?\n\nAll of this stems from the notion among Democrats that any electoral failure is a communication failure. Voters simply didn’t know what Democrats stood for, according to Democrats, because how could they ever lose if voters understood? The proposed fixes here are not policy fixes rolling back the party’s radical stances on sex changes for children and inmates or unfettered illegal immigration. They are messaging reforms, urging Democrats to paint themselves as people they are not to make them seem more relatable to voters.\n\nDEMOCRATS ARE LOST IN A POLITICAL ABYSS\n\nThe Democratic Party is staffed by and nominates coastal elites and overeducated liberals who are out of step with the country. Those staffers and politicians support policies that favor their elitist, overeducated friends while lecturing the rest of the country about accepting massive numbers of unvetted illegal immigrants, not driving cars or eating meat, and letting men in women’s sports.\n\nUntil Democrats change the makeup of their party and the policies that flow from their out-of-touch leaders, the proposed authenticity reforms are like putting lipstick on a very unpopular, elitist pig.","summary":"Democrats are trying to figure out how to connect with voters after their hard-left disposition cost them the 2024 elections.

THESE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking told Fox News that the former transportation secretary is in a strong possible position to run for president in 2028 and that running for either senator or Michigan governor \"in 2026 would have taken that off the table.\" NEWSOM MAKES MAJOR HEADLINES IN INAGURAL EDITION OF HIS NEW PODCAST Across the country, term-limited California Gov. Gavin Newsom – who has long been suspected of harboring national ambitions – is grabbing tons of attention and millions of YouTube hits thanks to a new and very high-profile podcast series. The first two guests were MAGA world superstars Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Democrat J.B. Pritzker – the billionaire two-term governor of blue state Illinois and one of his party's leaders in opposing Trump's second-term agenda – will head to New Hampshire next month to headline the state party's annual fundraising gala, sparking plenty of 2028 speculation. DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR'S TRIP TO THIS KEY STATE SPARKING 2028 SPECULATION Trips to New Hampshire – which for over a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House – are seen as an early indicator of a politician's interest in running for the presidency in the next election. But there's more. There is plenty of focus on former Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee last summer after he dropped out of the race amid mounting questions over his physical and mental stamina. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS TIMETABLE FOR MAJOR POLITICAL DECISION Harris, who lost last November's White House election to Trump, is seriously considering a 2026 bid to succeed Newsom in her home state of California. But a run for governor in 2026 would likely derail her from making a 2028 White House bid. A source in the former vice president's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital that Harris has told allies she will decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a gubernatorial campaign. And Harris recently made a stop in Nevada, an early-voting state in the Democrats' primary calendar. Harris' 2024 running mate – Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz – is not ruling out a White House run of his own in 2028. Walz on Friday kicks off a high-profile town hall tour in Iowa, the state that, through the 2020 cycle, kicked off the Democrats' presidential nominating calendar. Meanwhile, three other prominent Democrats considered potential 2028 contenders – Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania – on Thursday are addressing the House Democrats' annual policy retreat. Even Rahm Emanuel, the former congressman from Illinois, White House chief of staff in President Obama's administration, and Chicago mayor who most recently served as U.S. ambassador to Japan, is potentially mulling a 2028 run. Emanuel this week was the topic of a feature report by Politico. While 2028 seems like a very long way away, the early moves in the next White House race begin – well, early – for the party out of power. VANCE IN ‘CATBIRD SEAT,' BUT HERE ARE THE OTHER REPUBLICANS WHO MAY ALSO RUN IN 2028 That was the case for the Republicans in the 2024 cycle. The first stop in Iowa, which continues to kick off the GOP's presidential nominating schedule, in the 2024 cycle by a potential White House contender came in March 2021 – just weeks after Biden assumed the presidency. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – who eventually ended up not running for president – grabbed plenty of attention as he spoke to the Westside Conservative Club in suburban Des Moines. \"There's no sense in waiting,\" New Hampshire-based political strategist Lucas Meyer told Fox News. \"If anyone is serious about running for president, they would probably be well served in getting after it now.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meyer, a former president of the New Hampshire Young Democrats who chairs the advocacy group 603 Forward, called it a \"wide open field\" for Democrats. \"The crowd of leadership at the top of the Democratic Party isn't very deep at the moment,\" he observed. \"There's oxygen there for someone.\"","summary":"The early moves in the 2028 White House race, at least among the Democrats, are getting underway as potential presidential contenders grab plenty of attention","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-making-early-moves-line-up-2028-presidential-bids","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/931/523/gavin-newsom-charlie-kirk-podcast.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 17:53:08","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":299878216,"title":"Pete Buttigieg's Chances of Winning in 2028, According to Polls","text":"Pete Buttigieg is expected to rule out running for Michigan's Senate seat, in a move that leaves him free to contest the presidency in 2028.One of the few survivors of the 2020 Democratic primary, the former transportation secretary is one of Democrats' top choices for the next election, second only to former Vice President Kamala Harris.Newsweek contacted a representative of Pete Buttigieg for comment via email.Why It MattersWhile the 2028 election is a long way off, Democrats have a limited time to find talent before the race begins in earnest. Buttigieg is a high-profile Democrat with credentials in Midwestern swing states, making him an ideal choice if he has the time to prepare. Rejecting a Senate run indicates that he wants to make that time available.What To KnowPete Buttigieg is expected to rule out running for Michigan's Senate seat, which Democrats are attempting to hold after the retirement of Senator Gary Peters, according to Politico.The rejection of the seat, which Buttigieg would have a clear advantage in, indicates that the former South Bend mayor is thinking carefully about his time over the next four years.The fact that Buttigieg is reportedly opting out of the Michigan race, which would have required him to campaign heavily for the swing state Senate seat, is more evidence that he is considering a presidential run in 2028.Buttigieg has a strong track record in presidential primaries. \"Mayor Pete\" gained national attention during the 2020 primary, gaining the largest number of delegates in the Iowa caucus, only to drop out and endorse former President Joe Biden, who tapped him as transportation secretary.Buttigieg has retained high name recognition and approval among Democrat voters since his first presidential run, and, according to polling, he is the party's second choice to be the nominee in 2028.He trails Harris significantly; the former vice president and last year's Democratic nominee has the support of 35.1 percent in the polls, but Harris is unlikely to run again, and Buttigieg is already ahead of California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is now old enough to run for president.What People Are SayingFormer Representative Mark Schauer, a Democrat, to The Hill: \"I think [Buttigieg] is a rare political talent, which he's demonstrated as the Transportation secretary and on the campaign trail.\"Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas to The Hill, criticizing his qualifications for the role of Transportation Secretary: \"Pete Buttigieg couldn't organize a one-car funeral.\"What Happens NextButtigieg has not formally declined running in the Michigan race yet.

Trump’s push for a Ukraine settlement","text":"As high-stakes diplomacy unfolds between the United States and Ukraine, one thing is clear: President Donald Trump has little personal sympathy for his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky. Their last meeting at the White House in February only reinforced this reality, with Trump once again treating Zelensky with thinly veiled disdain.\n\nThere are rational reasons for Trump’s attitude. Zelensky bet too heavily on Joe Biden, tying Ukraine’s fate to the Democratic party. When Biden’s second term never materialized, and Kamala Harris crashed and burned, Kiev was left without a reliable sponsor in Washington.\n\nTrump’s instincts – both personal and political – place him in direct opposition to figures like Zelensky, who, despite also being an unconventional political outsider, represents a style of governance fundamentally at odds with the US president’s worldview.\n\nWhat is particularly striking is Trump’s open criticism of Zelensky, a direct violation of established diplomatic norms. The White House has even floated the idea of his resignation – a notion recently reported by the German media outlet Bild. According to these reports, Trump no longer sees Zelensky as a viable ally and is exerting significant political pressure to force him out.\n\nThe administration has not denied these claims. However, gaining Trump’s approval is no easy feat. Among today’s political heavyweights, very few leaders have managed to earn his genuine respect. The capricious and ego-driven 47th president of the United States has little patience for the leadership class of the European Union, nor for the leaders of America’s immediate neighbors, Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump appears far more at ease with strong, authoritative figures who project power – leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and, most notably, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nUkraine as a geopolitical asset\n\nYet, in politics – as in business – one does not always get to choose one’s partners. Throughout his career in the highly competitive and often ruthless New York real estate market, Trump had to engage with individuals with questionable reputations. In that sense, his approach to international politics is no different from his business dealings: pragmatism trumps sentimentality.\n\nTrump’s interest in Ukraine is not about personal affinity; rather, he views the country as an asset in which the US has made a substantial investment. While he did not personally decide to back Kiev, he now finds himself responsible for managing America’s stake in the conflict, and like any businessman, he wants a return on investment.\n\nThis is why Trump’s approach is not one of immediate disengagement. He is looking for ways to extract value – whether through Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, transport and logistics infrastructure, fertile black soil, or other material assets. He does not want to simply write it off as a sunk cost, at least not before attempting to recoup some of America’s losses.\n\nThus, his administration is attempting to force Kiev into a settlement on terms dictated by Washington. This effort culminated in Tuesday’s meeting in Riyadh, where Trump’s negotiators presented Zelensky’s team with a stark choice: accept the US conditions – including a ceasefire or partial cessation of hostilities – or risk complete abandonment.\n\nZelensky’s diminishing leverage\n\nBefore this crucial meeting, Zelensky reportedly sent an apology letter to Trump, attempting to smooth over the tensions which followed their embarrassing White House encounter. According to US special envoy Steve Witkoff, this was an effort to salvage what remains of Ukraine’s negotiating position.\n\nTrump remains deeply skeptical of Zelensky’s ability to deliver on any agreement. The Ukrainian president’s credibility has been severely undermined, and his capacity to negotiate on behalf of his country’s political elite is far from certain. After all, Trump has learned from past experience that promises made by Kiev do not always translate into action.\n\nFollowing the Riyadh meeting, Trump’s attention turned to the far more consequential issue: negotiations with Moscow. Unlike Zelensky, Putin is negotiating from a position of strength, which makes any agreement far more complex. The days when the West could dictate terms to Russia are long over, and Trump likely understands that his leverage with Moscow is limited.\n\nThe European dilemma\n\nIf Trump can reach an understanding with Putin, then the next stage of this process will involve forcing Western European nations to accept the new geopolitical reality. For Washington’s European allies, who have invested heavily in Ukraine, this will be a bitter pill to swallow. The EU establishment has spent years positioning itself as the defender of Kiev, and to be excluded from decisive negotiations would be nothing short of humiliating.\n\nHowever, this is precisely what is happening. The bloc’s leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have been reduced to spectators, offering empty declarations of support for Ukraine while having no real influence over the outcome of events. For them, a settlement brokered by Trump without their participation would be the ultimate confirmation of their diminishing role in global affairs.\n\nWorse still, much of Western Europe’s investment in Ukraine – both financial and political – will likely be lost. While the Biden administration at least attempted to keep European allies involved in decision-making, Trump has no such inclination. His goal is to conclude a deal that serves American interests, and he is unlikely to show concern for the reputational damage this will inflict on the EU’s political elite.\n\nA test of Trump’s deal-making skills\n\nThe situation now presents Trump with one of the biggest diplomatic challenges of his presidency. Unlike in business, where deals can be walked away from, geopolitical agreements have long-lasting consequences. His ability to navigate this complex landscape – balancing pressure on Kiev, negotiating with Moscow, and sidelining Western Europe – will determine whether he can claim victory as a peacemaker.\n\nUltimately, Ukraine’s fate is no longer in its own hands. The decisions made in Washington, Moscow, and – ironically – Riyadh will shape the country’s future. Whether Trump can strike a deal that satisfies all parties remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Ukraine’s days as the central pillar of the West’s confrontation with Russia are coming to an end.\n\nThis article was first published by Izvestia newspaper, and was translated and edited by the RT team.","summary":"US President Trump wants to extract value from Kiev, and has no love for the current leader \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/614162-zelenskys-last-stand-trumps-push/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67d307d685f5401f8c40c68c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 16:33:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.008},{"id":299862034,"title":"Pete Buttigieg won't seek Senate, governor jobs amid presidential bid speculation","text":"Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday morning that he will not run for U.S. Senate or governor in the state of Michigan, potentially clearing the way to possibly mount a run for president in 2028.\n\n\"I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,\" Buttigieg wrote on X. \"I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today's cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative.\"\n\nButtigieg's announcement comes as Democrats grapple both with being locked out of power in Washington and the prospect of defending multiple key Senate seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\nA lot can happen between now and the next presidential race, but there is little doubt that's what the former secretary is gearing up for. A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking said they believe this move puts him in the strongest possible position to run in 2028 and running for governor or senator in 2026 would have taken that off the table.\n\nButtigieg was expected to potentially announce a run for the seat being vacated by incumbent Sen.

He mentioned neither party by name.\n\nWithout calling out President Donald Trump by name either, Buttigieg called the United States \"demonstrably less free, less secure, less democratic - and less prosperous - than it was just ten weeks ago,\" and said that people need to both show a positive vision of a \"better future\" for America and to be creative over \"where we make our case\" given that how Americans receive information has changed.\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, first rose to national prominence when he ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He served in President Joe Biden's Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay Cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDuring Biden's 2024 presidential campaign -- and later, Vice President Kamala Harris's own campaign after Biden left the race -- Buttigieg served as a key campaign surrogate and was floated as a potential running mate for Harris, who ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nButtigieg's decision comes as both the U.S. Senate and governor races in Michigan, a key battleground state, heat up.\n\nA few figures floated as potential Senate candidates have already indicated they will not run for the seat. But the field may be set to grow. Democratic Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow wrote on X on Thursday morning, \"Busy morning, huh? Thank you to everyone encouraging me to run for Senate. I'll have more to share soon.\"\n\nThe Cook Political Report currently rates the 2026 Michigan U.S. Senate race as a toss up. Michigan's other Senate seat, up for election in 2024, was narrowly won by Democratic candidate Elissa Slotkin even as Harris lost the state.\n\nSeparately, the Michigan gubernatorial race already includes multiple high-profile candidates, including Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie and Justin Gomez contributed to this report.","summary":"Pete Buttigieg announced that he will not run for U.S. Senate or governor in the state of Michigan, potentially clearing the way to mount a run for president in 2028.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pete-buttigieg-seek-senate-michigan-governor-jobs-amid/story?id=119751434","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ef51184b-1a99-439f-a336-b6c4ee5efaaa/pete-buttigieg-gty-jef-250313_1741877861738_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 16:23:19","author":"Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.087},{"id":299877340,"title":"Tim Walz blames himself and Harris for America’s 'mess' under Trump, tells MSNBC, 'I own this'","text":"Former vice presidential candidate Gov.

Can Tesla win them over, too?","text":"Once upon a time, owning a Tesla signaled that a driver was tech-savvy, eco-conscious, or just plain rich. Now, for many people, it signals something different: an endorsement of Elon Musk's politics.\n\nMusk's rightward turn — including his embrace of President Trump, his central role in slashing and dismantling government agencies, a litany of controversial remarks and one lightning rod of a gesture — has triggered a remarkable backlash, analysts say.\n\nMassive protests at Tesla dealerships. Owners with buyers' remorse and apologetic bumper stickers. People calling Teslas \"swasticars.\" Vandalism, and sometimes violence, against Tesla vehicles, chargers and storefronts.\n\nBut, of course, there are also many Americans who celebrate Musk's actions. Could Republican support — in some cases, a backlash to the backlash — make up for lost sales?\n\nPresident Trump seems to hope so: Despite his previous scathing criticisms of electric vehicles over price and travel range, this week, he said that he'd buy a Tesla as a \"show of support\" for his adviser. In a photo op at the White House, he sat in a red Model S and told reporters he hoped his purchase would boost Tesla sales.\n\nSurvey data does clearly show that the Tesla brand is soaring in popularity among Republicans and conservatives. But there's a problem for the auto company: The liberals, moderates and independents that Musk is driving away are more likely to consider an electric vehicle. The new fans he's winning over — for now — not so much. Some surveys have found a gap of more than 20 percentage points.\n\n\"There are going to be no explosion of sales that recover the losses that Tesla has been enduring because of this political shift,\" says Alexander Edwards, the head of Strategic Vision, a company that surveys new vehicle buyers. \"All they've done is alienate their primary consumer,\" and won new fans who aren't in a position to buy an EV, he says.\n\nMike Murphy, a Republican political consultant, is more optimistic. Slightly. \"He could help make Republicans consider EVs more, take a little of the political stigma away,\" he says. \"But it has nowhere near the short-term impact upon Tesla that Elon's Bond villain status among Democrats and among Harris voters has.\"\n\nFor some conservatives, Musk is a reason to buy\n\nThe backlash against Musk has been brewing at least since 2022, when he announced his plans to buy Twitter and his social media posting, often on political topics, increased significantly. And from the beginning, responses did cut both ways.\n\nAt the time, Norman Pieniążek was beyond frustrated with Twitter and other social media platforms. In the 1980s, Pieniążek had been an underground publisher in Poland, fighting against censorship after the government imposed martial law there. He later moved to the U.S., and when his posts challenging the science around COVID were taken down by Facebook and Twitter, it felt like censorship all over again.\n\nThen Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter to unlock its potential as \"the platform for free speech around the globe.\"\n\n\"I said 'Okay, that's my guy,'\" Pieniążek recalled. He needed a new car anyway, and was planning to get a gas-powered one. But he changed his mind. \"My heart is with him,\" he remembers thinking. \"I have to put my money where my heart is.\"\n\nHe bought a Model X.\n\nMeanwhile, some conservative buyers are motivated by disgust with the backlash against Musk and Trump, which they consider unfair.\n\n\"It's honestly made me want to buy more cars from Tesla,\" says Kamali Wright, who works in marketing in Florida. He owns a Model 3 and calls Musk and Trump his two favorite people.\n\n\"If everybody's going to hate on this guy,\" he says, \"that's going to make me buy even more.\"\n\nWright wants to get a Cybertruck next.\n\nData show Republican support is rising\n\nThe investment banking company Stifel, working with polling firm Morning Consult, found that among Republicans, favorable opinions of Tesla started rising in February 2024, while interest in buying one picked up that August. Among Democrats, net positive views of Tesla dropped 22 percentage points from February; among Republicans, they rose 16 percentage points. Democratic net purchase consideration dropped 12 percentage points since August; among Republicans, it increased 13 percentage points.\n\n\"It's pretty eye-opening,\" says analyst Stephen Gengaro, who wrote a report on the findings.\n\nBut then he pulls up a different chart, showing how political partisanship lines up with overall interest in buying an EV. And there, Democrats hovered 10 percentage points above Republicans throughout the last four years, through January 2025.\n\nAnd that's not just a question of ideological opposition to battery-powered cars. It's also about what Republicans tend to prefer in a vehicle. EVs' towing problems, for instance, can be an issue for Republican buyers, who are \"significantly more likely to be in a truck and using their vehicle for work,\" notes Edwards, of Strategic Vision. And charging infrastructure tends to be concentrated in cities; rural areas tend Republican. Even outside cities, states with progressive governments have been more interested in building out EV infrastructure as part of fighting climate change. Add it up, and it tips the scale against EVs for some buyers.\n\n\"Tesla has gained a large number of Republican fans who love what Mr. Musk is doing, both politically and with the brand of vehicle and with social media,\" says Edwards. \"But they have little interest in an electrified vehicle.\"\n\nEdwards has been asking Tesla buyers about their political affiliations for the last decade. Last year, for the first time the data showed that the average Tesla buyer was more likely to be a Republican than a Democrat.\n\nBut that wasn't because Republican purchases were surging; it was because Democrats were fleeing the brand.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats continue to dominate among buyers of other electric vehicles.\n\nEdwards thinks this political shift also explains a trend among car shoppers overall. His data show the number of buyers who would \"definitely consider\" a Tesla dropped by nearly two-thirds between October 2021 and December 2024.\n\nIn short, it's a problem for Tesla that the demographic that's the most interested in EVs — liberals and progressives — is finding the most successful EV-maker in America repellent.\n\nAfter the election, Murphy, the Republican strategist, conducted a national poll focused on Musk. \"If you voted for Kamala Harris, you give Elon a 76% negative rating and only a 5% positive rating — which is saying something, because the margin of error on the poll is 4%,\" he says. \"So scientifically, [we] can't even quite prove there are Harris voters who like Elon on the planet.\"\n\nPolitics don't explain all Tesla's woes\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment, but Musk has previously said it's the quality of the product that matters, not a CEO's views.\n\nBut Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the car data company Edmunds, says that Tesla is different from other car companies. Most Americans probably couldn't name another auto CEO, she points out.\n\nShe thinks it's certainly true that some new Republican buyers will make up for some lost sales to Democrats. But Tesla's problem is more profound than that, she says: \"Why would you ever want to alienate current customers — or just potential buyers in general?\"\n\nStill, it's possible to overstate the role of politics in Tesla's flagging sales. There's more competition for the brand, as companies like General Motors, Ford, Honda and Hyundai ramp up their EV production (and globally, Chinese automakers take a huge slice of the EV market). Tesla is also rolling out an update to the Model Y, giving shoppers a reason to wait a few months; analysts say that's currently pulling pull sales down.\n\nThere are also plenty of drivers who say their feelings about Musk have nothing to do with what's in their driveway. Some people are outraged by Musk but still think Teslas are superior vehicles. Some Trump fans love Musk but can't give up the growl of an engine. And there's Nancy Baroody, who is a big fan of Musk — when I ask if that played any role in her decision to buy a Tesla last fall, she's a little baffled.\" I really don't let politics influence what kind of a product I like,\" she says.\n\nFor EVs, politicization isn't new \n\nPolitics aren't everything for a car brand — but they're still something. And that's especially true for EVs.\n\nMurphy, who has launched a group called the American EV Jobs Alliance to try to build bipartisan support for electric vehicles, has spent years pondering why more Republicans won't buy them. He argues that long before Musk's political turn, EVs were already politicized — as symbols of \"green,\" liberal values.\n\n\"They were seen as political statements, not as cars,\" he says. \"And that's not good for selling more electric vehicles.\"\n\nMurphy would like to see EVs sold on their merits: The gas savings, the quick acceleration, the smooth and quiet ride, never having to do another oil change. Yes, they're better for the climate, and that motivates many buyers to seek them out. But leave that out of the marketing, he urges automakers.\n\n\"Take the politics out of it,\" he says, \"and let people with clear eyes pick the car that's best for them.\" If they did, he thinks, a lot more of them would pick EVs.\n\nBut right now, Murphy says, the politics of buying an EV aren't going away — just getting more complicated. What Musk is doing, he says, is a little bit like pouring gasoline on a battery fire.","summary":"Tesla is gaining traction among conservative buyers while it loses support among liberals.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News host Sean Hannity last week she received a “truckload” of additional documents from the FBI’s Southern District of New York field office after she accused the office of withholding evidence from the Department of Justice.\n\nBondi said the DOJ would “go through [the documents] as fast as we can” and claimed they are “going to come out,” though she did not give a timeline, adding she wants a “full report” on why the documents allegedly sat at the FBI’s New York field office.\n\nA reporter asked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday about Bondi’s claim she received a “truckload” of documents, questioning when they would be released, with Leavitt saying she does not have a timeline and referred the reporter to the Department of Justice.\n\nForbes has reached out to the Department of Justice and FBI for comment.\n\nChief Critics\n\nThe prolonged wait for new Epstein documents has prompted criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. The Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats X account posted a thread last week, days after Bondi said she received more Epstein documents, accusing her of “SITTING on the Epstein files” following a “cheap stunt that released no new information.” The Judiciary Democrats also criticized Bondi on Monday after the Justice Department put prosecutor Andrew Rohrbach—who prosecuted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as New York City Mayor Eric Adams and disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried—on leave. “Not only is Pam Bondi stonewalling the Epstein files’ release… she just punished Ghislaine Maxwell’s prosecutor,” the Judiciary Democrats posted. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who previously slammed the February release of Epstein files as a “complete disappointment,” said Tuesday on X it is “alarming that Congress has gotten almost no communication from the DOJ or updates regarding the matter other than ‘reviewing documents.’”\n\nHow Musk And Trump Helped Fuel A Right-Wing Epstein Conspiracy\n\nThe Justice Department’s release of Epstein documents had long been talked up by politicians and right-wing influencers, particularly in the lead-up to the 2024 election. While campaigning for the presidency in 2024, President Donald Trump told podcaster Lex Fridman he would be “inclined” to release Epstein-related documents after Fridman pressed him. Trump told Fridman he had “never been to his island, fortunately,” though Trump was named in flight logs as having flown on Epstein’s private jets at least seven times in the 1990s, though has never been linked to Epstein’s crimes. Elon Musk, billionaire and DOGE chief, posted about Epstein’s so-called “client list” in July 2024, stating: “Either FBI does their duty or the case for an entire departmental reset or abolishment is strong.” In an interview with Tucker Carlson in October 2024, Musk said, “if Trump wins, that Epstein client list is going to become public,” accusing various billionaires of supporting former Vice President Kamala Harris’s candidacy because they are “terrified” of being named in documents (though Harris did not comment on whether or not she’d work to release Epstein-related files). During FBI Director Kash Patel’s confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., asked if Patel would “work with me on this issue so we know who worked with Jeffrey Epstein in building these sex trafficking rings,” to which Patel said he “absolutely” would. In January 2024, Bondi said on Fox News Epstein documents should have “come out a long time ago,” stating people who may be implicated in any Epstein-related files have “no legal basis” to keep their names private. Several popular right-wing X accounts, including Libs of TikTok and End Wokeness, have frequently tweeted about Epstein both before and after the election to their collective 8 million followers.\n\nIs There Actually An Epstein Client List?\n\nThere is no evidence that a so-called “client list” kept by Epstein exists, despite rumors of one persisting online for years. Those who believe in its existence appear to believe it may hold the names of celebrities, wealthy individuals and members of the political elite that may have been involved with, or known about, Epstein’s crimes. But experts on Epstein have repeatedly cast doubt on the existence of a client list, including Julie K. Brown, the Pulitzer-winning reporter for The Miami Herald, who exposed the legal efforts to keep Epstein out of jail. Brown told Rolling Stone last week there is “no such thing” as far as she knows, based on her review of civil lawsuits and discussions with victims and other sources. “Basically, his telephone directory and flight logs somehow got molded or misconstrued into this idea that there’s some kind of a client list,” Brown said. Brown has previously called the alleged “client list” a “figment of the internet's imagination” and a “means to just slander people.”\n\nWhat Happened With The First Epstein Document Release?\n\nThe release of Epstein-related documents in late February was considered a failure as most of the information revealed had already been leaked, sparking accusations that the release was a political stunt. The Justice Department gave large binders to several right-wing influencers at the White House, which read, “The Epstein Files: Phase I,” which also sparked some criticism. The bungled release led to finger-pointing, as Bondi sent a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel demanding the agency send Epstein-related documents she says the FBI withheld from the Justice Department. Without naming Bondi or the Epstein controversy, Patel posted on X the FBI had entered a “new era” in which there would be “no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left unturned.”\n\nKey Background\n\nEpstein was indicted in federal court in 2019 for sex trafficking and was accused of abusing underage girls. He has long been the subject of internet conspiracy theories, including that he did not commit suicide in jail and instead was killed, though there is no evidence to support this idea. Epstein has been linked to a long list of various powerful people, including former President Bill Clinton, who appeared on flight logs but has denied knowing about Epstein’s crimes, and Prince Andrew, who was accused of sexual assault by an alleged Epstein victim and later settled a case with her in court.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nEpstein Files Land No New Revelations—Despite Big Promises Throughout Campaign (Forbes)\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi Accuses FBI Of Withholding Jeffrey Epstein Files—What To Know (Forbes)\n\nFirst Epstein Names Unsealed: Here Are The Biggest Takeaways (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Data from Spotify and Apple Podcasts is not yet available for the show, however, the views that it received on YouTube are public, providing a snapshot into its listenership.The podcast's first episode received 43,826 views as of press time, while the second, which featured an interview with Issa Rae, has received 14,000 views. In contrast, the most recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience received 749,795 views as of press time, a much higher viewership.However, one area where Obama is beating Rogan is subscriber engagement. On YouTube, Obama has 17,100 subscribers while Rogan has 19.5 million. Obama's first podcast episode has reached more than double her subscriber base, with her second reaching nearly 100 percent of her subscribers, while Rogan's most recent podcast reached around 3.8 percent of his own subscribers.It's also important to note that this new podcast from Obama is very much in its infancy. Though, the former first lady is no stranger to hosting podcasts. The Michelle Obama Podcast was released in 2020 and \"was the most successful original in Spotify history, bringing in more women listeners over 40 than any other podcast,\" according to her website bio.Speaking about her podcast on Instagram, Obama wrote: \"There's a lot going on in the world right now. We're living through some really complicated and confusing times and on top of that, folks are trying to juggle family life, work dynamics, relationships, aging parents, and more.\"What People Are SayingMichelle Obama, in a post on X speaking about her podcast: \"In our first episode, we share stories about growing up on Euclid Avenue in Chicago and the journey that led us to who we are today—from life on the South Side to going to college together to the White House and, more recently, our experience after losing our mom.

Is a 2028 presidential bid coming?","text":"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg revealed Thursday that he will not run for governor or the open Senate seat in Michigan, clearing the way for a potential White House bid in 2028. \n\n“I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,” Buttigieg wrote on X Thursday morning. “I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values — and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today’s cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative.”\n\nA number of allies have noted that the move would put the former 2020 presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana, mayor in a stronger position to run for president in the next Democratic primary, as running campaigns in 2026 and 2028 would be challenging. \n\nButtigieg said recently that he had been “looking” at a Senate campaign, and that he had a meeting with Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as the party is working to hold on to the swing state seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. Republicans hope to flip the seat after nearly winning the state’s other Senate seat in the last election. \n\nButtigieg moved to Traverse City, Michigan, along with his husband and children after four years in the Biden cabinet. Those in his inner circle told Politico that the workload of being in the Cabinet, the travel that accompanies such a job, and the idea of starting a campaign soon after, affected the decision not to run for the Senate. \n\n“In the months ahead I will be spending more time engaging both legacy and digital media in the service of a politics of everyday life, rooted in the values of freedom, security, and democracy,” Buttigieg wrote in a post on Substack. “I will be engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered. And I’ll also be taking advantage of my exit from office to spend much more time offline, in dialogue with people like my neighbors in Michigan and communities like South Bend, Indiana, where I grew up and served as mayor.”\n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped shepherd former President Barack Obama’s two campaigns for the highest office, said he spoke to Buttigieg on Wednesday. \n\n“The hardest decision in politics is to pass on a race you have a very good chance to win,” Axelrod told Politico. \n\n“Pete was an A-list recruit and would have been a formidable candidate for the Senate had he chosen to run,” he added. “But had he won in ’26, it would almost certainly have taken him out of the conversation for ’28. This certainly keeps that option open.” \n\n“Beyond that, I have a sense that he wanted to spend more time with his family, and with people in communities like his, where the conversations and concerns are so different than the ones you hear in the echo chamber of Washington,” said Axelrod. \n\nThe former mayor’s decision not to run for the open seat in a state won by President Donald Trump in November reshapes the upcoming race, with State Sen. Mallory McMorrow having told other Democrats in the state that she will run for the office. Rep. Haley Stevens has also made moves towards running for the seat, such as hiring staff. \n\nDemocratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii spoke to Buttigieg on several occasions as he made his decision. \n\n“He wanted to decide quickly enough to give other folks a chance to mobilize if they wanted to run,” Schatz told Politico. “He handled it responsibly. He’s a rising star in the Democratic Party.”\n\nIn a hypothetical 2028 Democratic primary, Buttigieg is only polling behind former vice president and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, who’s considering whether she will run for governor of California in 2026.","summary":"‘The hardest decision in politics is to pass on a race you have a very good chance to win,’ political strategist David Axelrod says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-buttigieg-senate-president-2028-b2714443.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/13/12/01/GettyImages-2185967089.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8CfYFkET-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-13 15:19:12","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.319},{"id":299901542,"title":"Trump is torching his greatest political asset","text":"It is a political truism that it’s bad to be the president in charge when the economy turns sour.\nIt may be especially bad for President Donald Trump — because, through endless controversies during his decade in politics, voters’ belief in his economic savvy has been his most consistent polling bright spot,\nNow that bright spot may be gone.\nCNN has had the polling company SSRS ask voters whether they approve of Trump’s handling of the economy since the beginning of his first term. They did so again last week — and Trump got positively grim results. Forty-four percent of respondents said they approved, and 56 percent disapproved. \nThat makes for a net disapproval of 12 percent, which is easily his worst ever in this particular poll, as the chart below shows: \n[Image: https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-at-10.47.01%E2%80%AFAM.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nTrump’s (former?) reputation on the economy is an underrated reason for his political strength\nThere have been endless explanations and theories offered for Trump’s rise and persistence in politics. Some of these are stylistic (his willingness to stoke racism or say offensive things, his tweets), others are ideological (his challenge to the previous GOP elite consensus on immigration, free trade, and foreign policy).\nBut another key reason for his rise and return is the belief among many voters that Trump is a savvy businessman and would therefore handle the economy well.\nTrump did, after all, play such a character for many years on his reality television program, The Apprentice, making rapid-fire assessments of contestants’ business prowess and firing those that didn’t make the cut. His name had long been used in hip-hop music to symbolize wealth and flashy success. He published a book called The Art of the Deal. \nFor voters who aren’t dug into a particular ideological camp, the belief that a seemingly rich, successful businessman would be better at managing the economy than a typical politician seemed logical. And indeed, though Hillary Clinton led Trump in polls for most of the 2016 campaign, the electorate consistently thought he’d handle the economy better than she would.\nTrump’s record during the first three years of his first term seemed to vindicate this belief, as growth remained strong and markets soared ever higher while unemployment, inflation, and interest rates all remained low. The Covid-19 pandemic threw that for a loop in 2020, but even then, voters didn’t fully turn against Trump on the economy. \nThe Biden presidency subsequently featured the highest inflation in decades, followed by huge hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to try and conquer that inflation. Voters absolutely hated this, and Joe Biden’s popularity tanked. All this seemed to fit with the idea that Democrats are terrible at economic management and that, if Trump was back in power, he’d bring back the good old days of 2017–2019. Accordingly, Trump solidly outpolled Kamala Harris on the economy.\nSince beginning his second term, though, Trump has been acting quite differently than he did in his first. He’s been much more aggressive on pushing his tariff and trade war agenda, in a way that’s been highly visible. The results have also been highly visible, as markets have plunged in the past few weeks.\nIn general, the second Trump term has been aimed toward pleasing the MAGA base. But if Trump cares about retaining his popularity among the less hardcore general election swing voters who helped him win in 2016 and 2024, this is an ominous sign. Of course, he may not care — he doesn’t have to face another election. Republican candidates around the country will be the ones in electoral peril.","summary":"It is a political truism that it’s bad to be the president in charge when the economy turns sour.

The politician noted that 90% of pot ash used in Minnesota — a common fertilization tool — comes from Canada. He went on to say that these tariffs have made the U.S. an “untrustworthy” trading partner and worried that the moves Trump is making now will harm America’s trading partnerships for decades to come.\n\n“Quite honestly, the chaos and the uncertainty it causes, so many Minnesotans are asking when was Canada our enemy? It makes no sense,” Walz said.\n\nWalz, a former public school teacher, also spoke out about the administration’s “senseless attack” on the Department of Education.

Donald Trump is this caricature who had a reality TV show where he pretended that he knew how to run businesses.

Let’s not go down memory lane.” He was allegedly excluded from all subsequent media prep sessions.\n\nWhen the interview with CNN’s Dana Bash took place in late August, Harris found herself reciting a “laundry list” of Biden policies sitting on a chair that was lower than Walz’s. The authors suggest this meant she “did not look like a candidate seeking the highest office in the land” and only reinforced a perception that she was “either incapable, or afraid, of answering tough questions on her own.”\n\nWith Harris continuing to struggle to make the case for why she should be the next president of the United States and outline her vision for the country's future, her September 10 debate against Trump was seen as a key opportunity to definitively establish her narrative in front of a national audience.\n\nBut, on the day of the clash, Biden called Harris and reportedly made clear that he expected her to protect his record, even at the expense of forging her own path, reminding her once again: “No daylight, kid.”\n\nAllen and Parnes’s reporting perhaps cast new light on a pivotal moment in the campaign, when Harris told the panellists on ABC’s The View on October 8 that “there is not a thing that comes to mind” that she would have done differently to Biden.\n\nWhile the former California attorney general and senator has been seldom seen since losing the election last November, Walz has gradually re-emerged to give interviews reflecting on their defeat.\n\n“I own this,” the Minnesota governor told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Wednesday night, referring to Trump’s chaotic tariff war causing economic shockwaves and Elon Musk’s attempt to streamline the federal government resulting in mass redundancies.\n\n“We wouldn’t be in this mess if we’d have won the election and we didn’t. We have to make sure that Americans know it’s not just that Donald Trump is bad, but we’re offering them something better.”\n\nWalz also revealed to The New Yorker’s editor David Remnick earlier this month during a podcast appearance that he could be tempted to run for the White House himself in 2028 and that he has barely spoken to Harris since their loss, insisting the pair were not estranged but merely busy with their own lives.","summary":"Former president and aides were more concerned with protecting his legacy than allowing nominee to define her own narrative, authors argue","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-harris-policy-walz-trump-b2714431.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/16/17/2192528790.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QMBLwFvY-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-13 14:46:05","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":299840920,"title":"Are Democrats Regretting Trying To Out-Hawk Trump?","text":"The Democratic Party has been trying to paint negotiations as appeasement. During the 2024 elections, the Democratic platform condemned then-candidate Donald Trump's \"fecklessness\" on Iran and \"love letters\" to North Korea. When Trump argued that the U.S. should negotiate with countries like Iran and Russia over economic sanctions, Kamala Harris' campaign attacked his \"weak\" and \"reckless foreign policy.\"\n\nBut some Democrats seem to regret taking that line. \"Being afraid to negotiate, to my mind, is the ultimate sign of weakness because it just proves that you think that if I get in a room, you're going to trick me and I'm going to do something stupid,\" Rep. Adam Smith (D–Wash.) said during a panel discussion Wednesday. \n\nSmith, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, was speaking to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, an antiwar nonprofit where I worked as a researcher in 2020 and 2021. When asked by Quincy Institute Vice President Trita Parsi whether Democrats were seen as warmongers, Smith admitted that the party \"walked into that problem.\"\n\nThe congressman argued that Democrats must \"much more aggressively embrace diplomacy. I think we should have been much louder during the Biden administration.\" He claimed to have always believed \"that the Biden administration should have directly talked to Russia,\" although not in a way that led to \"shutting off Ukraine and leaving them completely vulnerable the way Trump just did.\"\n\nSmith concurred with Parsi's claim that Democrats could \"reclaim the position as the party that actually promoted diplomacy, opposed stupid wars.\"\n\nNot all Democrats agree with Smith's criticism, of course. During confirmation hearings for Trump appointee Elbridge Colby last week, several Democratic senators doubled down on a hawkish line of attack, complaining about Trump's eagerness to talk to Russia. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D–Ill.) put it the most bluntly: \"Trump is in the middle of a capitulation, not a negotiation.\"\n\nAt the Quincy Institute event, Smith blamed \"pressure from the right and pressure from the left\" for the Democrats' muddled stance. The Democratic Party is trying to balance between Republicans, who call Democrats weak in the face of adversaries, and leftists, who believe that Democrats are in bed with \"neoconservative global dominance visions\" and \"jump all over us for anything we do,\" he argued.\n\n\"My father used to have this expression that between two stools, you sit on the floor,\" Smith concluded.\n\nSmith isn't the first person to note the problem of the \"defensive crouch\" in Democratic foreign policy. By accepting hawks' \"framing of the issues\" and trying to win on those grounds, Democrats often \"box themselves in to continuing policies that they have previously declared failures,\" journalist Daniel Larison wrote in 2021, several months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nRather than drumming up public support, Democrats' hawkish turn has hurt them politically. Americans disapproved of former President Joe Biden's handling of Russia and Ukraine by 22 percent in 2024, but a slim majority approved of Trump's handling of the issue by February 2025, polls showed.\n\nTrump's more hawkish proposals—taking over Gaza, Greenland, and Canada—poll very badly. A new poll released by CNN on Wednesday shows that a slim majority thinks that Trump is not \"an effective world leader.\" It's not that Trump's foreign policy is particularly popular; it's that Democrats' hawkish approach has been particularly unpopular.\n\nBeyond criticizing the domestic politics of hawkishness, Smith acknowledged that it's \"simply not possible to have that level of dominance\" over the entire world that the U.S. had after World War II or the Cold War. \"We're going to have to look for partnerships, alliances and a little bit more flexibility on the whole democracy, autocracy thing, in order to build that stable world that we envisioned,\" he said.","summary":"Rep.

Eric Trump last year stated that Swinney's behaviour made it “virtually impossible” to do business in the country. President Trump has recently been invited to visit the UK by King Charles. However, John Swinney called for this to be scrapped after Trump clashed with Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. The First Minister said it was now “simply unimaginable” that the US President would be allowed a rare second state visit with King Charles unless Trump categorically backs Ukraine. The ill-feeling is in spite of Donald Trump's Scottish ancestry , with his mother Mary Anne Macleod coming from the Isle of Lewis, before emigrating to New York. Trump opened his first golf resort on the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012 and then took over Trump Turnberry in 2014.

He won the Iowa caucuses and placed second in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nButtigieg was a strong advocate for Democrats during the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nHe supported the candidacy of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, appearing at rallies to push voters to choose the then-vice president over Republican Donald Trump. Buttigieg was a frequent guest on conservative-leaning talk shows during the campaign season, when he gained a reputation for answering tough questions about both the Biden and Harris candidacies.\n\nWhile Buttigieg did not practice politics in Michigan, the 43-year-old South Bend native moved to the state in 2022 with his husband. Buttigieg previously was elected mayor of South Bend in 2012 and served in that capacity until 2020.\n\nPeters, of Bloomfield Township, in January announced he will not seek reelection when his second Senate term ends in 2027, when he plans to dedicate more time to family.\n\nVoters first elected Peters in 2014 to the seat once occupied by fellow Democrat Carl Levin, the longest-serving senator in Michigan history.","summary":"Buttigieg’s decision “was framed by several allies and people in his inner circle as putting him in the strongest possible position to seek the presidency,” a Politico report stated.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/03/buttigieg-wont-seek-michigan-us-senate-seat-eyes-presidency-report-states.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/XUY3YQR4VZEA7DUZOZ5PMBDGVA.jpg?auth=d9dc8900d2933931e37734928dfd62b08098e1c2491b0b2d2ca857a3fb7aef4e&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 13:48:40","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.001},{"id":299816754,"title":"Tim Walz Takes Responsibility for Trump Chaos: ‘I Own This’","text":"Skip to Main Content\n\nNewsletters\n\nCSCHEAT SHEET\nNEWSLETTERS\n\nCheat Sheet\n\nManage Newsletters\nSubscription Offers\n\nBiden World\nTim Walz Takes Responsibility for Trump Chaos: ‘I Own This’\n\nThe former Democratic nominee for VP said he and Kamala Harris fumbled their White House bid, therefore helping to create the tariff war and resulting economic slump. \n\nLeigh Kimmins \n\nPublished Mar. 13 2025 9:37AM EDT \n\nLeigh Kimmins\n\nGot a tip?

But not at the IRS.\n\n\"The upheaval at the IRS is already having real impacts,\" reports The Washington Post, referring to plans (already underway) to reduce the workforce by half. \"Sources familiar with the agency report that its level of phone service is falling, in part because employees are spending their time waiting to use shared computers to respond to [the Department of Government Efficiency's] requests for weekly emails detailing their work. (Not all IRS employees are issued their own computers.) And they report that taxpayer behavior is already adjusting to the reality of a diminished IRS workforce: IRS receipts—taxes paid already and taxes the agency is scheduled to receive from those who have already filed—are significantly lower than they were at this point last filing season.\"\n\nWait, back up. They don't have their own computers? And they're sitting in a queue like schoolchildren in the library, waiting to use a single shared computer to respond to Musk's five-things-you-did-last-week emails? How long does it take to write those emails? And why don't they have computers?\n\nLook, I'm worried by the slapdash approach Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has taken. But the continued federal employee freakout over being asked to justify their jobs by detailing what they've done at work makes no sense to me.\n\nI know a girl from college who is a \"Work-Life Specialist and Mindfulness Facilitator\" at the U.S. Department of Transportation. She leads yoga sessions and \"meditation made simple\" workshops for federal employees, per her LinkedIn. This is a job I don't want my taxpayer dollars funding. For Musk to apply scrutiny to this type of thing is a huge win for the American people.\n\nThere are lots of legitimate criticisms to make about whether cuts in staffing will actually lead to a better IRS. Taxpayer services will surely suffer if there are fewer people available to answer phone calls and emails; refunds might be delayed, which comes at a real cost to people. Worse tax collection means less revenue for the government, and it's not like spending is under control—expect the fiscal hole we're in to get worse if this continues. But \"we just can't figure out how to ration computer use in the year 2025 to craft a bullet-pointed email\" is an absurd line that elicits no sympathy, and just leaves me confused about what the hell they've been doing all this time. Everything's not, in fact, computer in the federal government.\n\n\"Is any criticism of the government a deportable offense?\" asks NPR's Michel Martin to Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Troy Edgar regarding Mahmoud Khalil.\n\n\"What is the specific conduct the government alleges that Mr. Khalil engaged in that merits removal from the United States?\" asks Martin, to non-answers and equivocating from Edgar. \"He has been promoting this anti-semitism activity at the university,\" Edgar responds, noting that Khalil's been supporting terrorist activity. \"What specifically constitutes terrorist activity that he was supporting? What exactly do you say he did?\" presses Martin. \"I think you can see it on TV,\" says Edgar. \"He is a legal permanent resident. So what is the standard [for deportation]?\" asks Martin. \"Is any criticism of the government a deportable offense?\" she follows up, over and over. This is a really good example of a journalist actually doing their job and trying to get legitimate answers from the administration.\n\nFive-year anniversary of COVID-19 national emergency being declared: A dark day in our nation's history. How is Gavin Newsom commemorating it?\n\n When Charlie Kirk brings up the French Laundry incident, you can see Newsom's animal instinct for comms kick in 1) Jokes: \"I can't help you with a reservation\" 2) Concedes: \"We couldn't have this conversation without that conversation\" 3) Disarms: \"Dumbest bonehead move of my… pic.twitter.com/lRFlnmx1wO — Lulu Cheng Meservey (@lulumeservey) March 12, 2025\n\nLook, his political reflexes may be smooth—and there's a lot of speculating about whether he's aiming to step into the Democratic Party breach and run for president—but the little weasel must be put in his place (and a more adept, ferocious interviewer than Charlie Kirk could have done so; I volunteer as tribute). His hypocrisy is no small matter—and I say is because I'm not over it, and I don't think you should be either, and he's still actively in a position of power and probably seeking more of it. From a political standpoint, I don't think Newsom's shtick will play well—cities in his state have descended into crime and disorder; his COVID-19 record is abysmal; his taxes are insane—for the rest of the country. But, ugh, I guess, \"watch this space,\" as they say. He's trying to transform himself into just a likable guy with a podcast. He's running.\n\nAnyway, if you want to go down the COVID remembrance rabbit hole, I highly recommend this National Review article by Jeffrey Blehar: \"I cannot summon memories of that era without becoming furious at what I suffered through, without reliving the sense of utter betrayal from all authority we experienced during that period. I have never felt more despairingly abandoned, and in fact actively oppressed, by every level of government than in those dark years.\"\n\nScenes from New York: How did pot legalization in New York go so terribly wrong? New documentary out, from me.\n\n \"Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would block a Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown on Saturday and urged the GOP to accept a Democratic plan to provide funding through April 11 instead,\" reports Bloomberg. \"Schumer's declaration Wednesday raised the stakes in an ongoing game of chicken between congressional Republicans and Democrats and appeared to heighten the risk of a shutdown at a time financial markets are hyper-sensitive to new disruption.\" \"A majority of Americans believe President Donald Trump is being too 'erratic' in his moves to shake up the U.S. economy, as his imposition of tariffs against some of the nation's top trading partners hammers stock markets,\" finds a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. \"In last year's campaign Donald Trump and J.D. Vance rightly ran against the speech excesses of the Democratic Party, with Vance saying views on censorship constituted the \"biggest difference\" between Trump and Kamala Harris, and Trump upon inauguration naming censored figures like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to high office. The administration initially acted like it understood the gravity of the situation, with Vance confronting Europe over its civil liberties crackdowns. They seemed to know what they wanted to achieve on this issue,\" writes Matt Taibbi. \"That operation is now hanging by a thread. Trump is suddenly blowing it on the speech in a big way, with two big categories of screw-ups: pandering to Israel, and reaching into the same emergency-power cookie jar that foreign counterpart-jackasses like Keir Starmer and Olaf Scholz and Thierry Breton have recently raided, in efforts to suppress populist movements like Trump's own. Once he jumps on this bandwagon, we're all screwed, because there's nowhere left to run.\" Full thing is worth a read. \"The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump's new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants,\" reports Bloomberg.

More immediately, he is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed Witkoff's arrival in Russia for the sensitive engagement. The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of the anonymity.\n\nThe visit to Moscow comes after Ukraine on Tuesday agreed to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. The U.S. administration hopes the Kremlin will quickly sign on as well.\n\nWitkoff, who turns 68 on Saturday, is at the forefront of complex negotiations on Gaza and Ukraine from a perch that did not require Senate confirmation.\n\nSome things to know about Witkoff:\n\nHe's got a successful visit to Moscow already in the books\n\nWitkoff flew to Russia for talks last month that led to a prisoner swap that freed Marc Fogel, an American history teacher the U.S. had deemed wrongfully detained.\n\nFogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. His family and supporters said he had been traveling with medically prescribed marijuana. Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, was released to Russia in the prisoner swap.\n\nWitkoff developed a rapport with his Russian interlocutor, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, during those successful negotiations, according to retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIn perhaps a sign of diplomatic polish, Witkoff gave much credit to an important Trump ally, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for bringing Fogel home.\n\n“He was a cheerleader for this rapprochement where the two leaders would come together, and that’s what happened, so thank God,” Witkoff said. “Sometimes you don’t get a good result. Here we got a very good result. Mark Fogel is the evidence of that.”\n\nHe helped Trump score a big Mideast win before Inauguration Day\n\nJust weeks after his victory over Kamala Harris in November and before he was inaugurated, Trump dispatched Witkoff to the Mideast to begin work with Joe Biden's team on winning a hostage and temporary ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump praised Witkoff, who shuttled between Tel Aviv and Doha, for helping seal the agreement that's led to a weekslong ceasefire and 33 hostages being freed from Hamas captivity in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nWitkoff, in turn, deflected praise to Trump, suggesting that the deal would have never come to fruition without him coming to power.\n\nThe way to freeing the remaining 59 hostages, of whom Israel has declared 35 to be dead, could be an even tougher negotiation.\n\nThe first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended last month with no clarity on what comes next since the agreement’s second phase has not yet been hammered out. A fragile truce holds for the moment.\n\nIsrael is now pushing what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal.\" It would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.\n\nIsrael has made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.\n\nTrump and Witkoff became longtime friends after a deli shop encounter\n\nWitkoff, who runs a real estate development and investment firm, is a longtime friend and golf partner of Trump. He played a less visible role during Trump's first term, serving on the board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nWitkoff first met Trump in the 1980s, when he worked for a real estate law firm that handled a deal for Trump, himself a real estate developer, according to testimony Witkoff gave in the president's civil fraud trial in 2023.\n\nWitkoff testified that a few years later, he ran into Trump at a deli. Trump didn't have money with him and asked Witkoff to order him a ham and Swiss cheese sandwich. Years later when they met again, Trump remembered the sandwich and the two became friends, Witkoff said.\n\nHe's been more than a friend. Witkoff has donated millions to Trump's political causes over the years. He also partnered with Trump on the president's family cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nHe's been with Trump in business and golf, including a harrowing outing\n\nWitkoff started off as a real estate attorney who went on to found a management company that focused on residential buildings in New York City. In 1997, he founded his namesake real estate firm, Witkoff, where he currently serves as chairman and chief executive officer. He's now Florida-based, like Trump, and has golfed with him there.\n\nWitkoff was on the golf course with Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September during the second attempt on Trump’s life last year. He spoke to Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity afterward, relaying some details about how it unfolded and how Secret Service agents pounced on Trump to protect him.\n\nWitkoff unofficially helped on the campaign\n\nHe was among Trump's handpicked speakers at the Republican National Convention in July, along with his son Zach Witkoff, who works at the family real estate firm.\n\nThe elder Witkoff spent much of his RNC speech describing the comfort that Trump has provided him and his family as they've grieved the death of his adult son Andrew, who died of an opioid overdose in 2011.\n\nWitkoff last month told hostage families that the loss of Andrew has helped him understand the importance of bringing home the dead hostages still being held by Hamas so their family and friends can properly grieve them.\n\n“I am a member of that club that's buried a child,” Witkoff said. “It's a bad club.”\n\nWitkoff addressed the Madison Square Garden rally Trump held in October and spoke about how New York had changed since he grew up. He argued Trump could fix it.\n\nWitkoff let Trump use his private plane at times during the campaign and he helped Trump make peace with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after a bitter divide stemming from the Republican governor's failed 2024 presidential campaign. Witkoff helped set up a meeting between Trump and DeSantis at his Shell Bay Club in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, he named Witkoff as one of the two co-chairs of his inaugural committee, along with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who is now leading the Small Business Administration.\n\nTrump then gave Witkoff a much bigger job, naming him as his special envoy to the Middle East. His weighty job portfolio has since become even bigger.","summary":"Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow on Thursday for high-level talks aimed at ending Russia&amp;#39;s invasion of Ukraine, the latest high-profile assignment for the real estate magnate turned White House foreign policy fixer.

The U.S. administration hopes the Kremlin will quickly sign on as well.\n\nWitkoff, who turns 68 on Saturday, is at the forefront of complex negotiations on Gaza and Ukraine from a perch that did not require Senate confirmation. \n\nSome things to know about Witkoff:\n\n He's got a successful visit to Moscow already in the books \n\nWitkoff flew to Russia for talks last month that led to a prisoner swap that freed Marc Fogel, an American history teacher the U.S. had deemed wrongfully detained.\n\nFogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. His family and supporters said he had been traveling with medically prescribed marijuana. Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, was released to Russia in the prisoner swap.\n\nWitkoff developed a rapport with his Russian interlocutor, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, during those successful negotiations, according to retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIn perhaps a sign of diplomatic polish, Witkoff gave much credit to an important Trump ally, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for bringing Fogel home.\n\n“He was a cheerleader for this rapprochement where the two leaders would come together, and that’s what happened, so thank God,” Witkoff said. “Sometimes you don’t get a good result. Here we got a very good result. Mark Fogel is the evidence of that.”\n\n He helped Trump score a big Mideast win before Inauguration Day \n\nJust weeks after his victory over Kamala Harris in November and before he was inaugurated, Trump dispatched Witkoff to the Mideast to begin work with Joe Biden's team on winning a hostage and temporary ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump praised Witkoff, who shuttled between Tel Aviv and Doha, for helping seal the agreement that's led to a weekslong ceasefire and 33 hostages being freed from Hamas captivity in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. \n\nWitkoff, in turn, deflected praise to Trump, suggesting that the deal would have never come to fruition without him coming to power.\n\nThe way to freeing the remaining 59 hostages, of whom Israel has declared 35 to be dead, could be an even tougher negotiation.\n\nThe first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended last month with no clarity on what comes next since the agreement’s second phase has not yet been hammered out. A fragile truce holds for the moment.\n\nIsrael is now pushing what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal.\" It would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. \n\nIsrael has made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.\n\n Trump and Witkoff became longtime friends after a deli shop encounter \n\nWitkoff, who runs a real estate development and investment firm, is a longtime friend and golf partner of Trump. He played a less visible role during Trump's first term, serving on the board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. \n\nWitkoff first met Trump in the 1980s, when he worked for a real estate law firm that handled a deal for Trump, himself a real estate developer, according to testimony Witkoff gave in the president's civil fraud trial in 2023. \n\nWitkoff testified that a few years later, he ran into Trump at a deli. Trump didn't have money with him and asked Witkoff to order him a ham and Swiss cheese sandwich. Years later when they met again, Trump remembered the sandwich and the two became friends, Witkoff said.\n\nHe's been more than a friend. Witkoff has donated millions to Trump's political causes over the years. He also partnered with Trump on the president's family cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\n He's been with Trump in business and golf, including a harrowing outing \n\nWitkoff started off as a real estate attorney who went on to found a management company that focused on residential buildings in New York City. In 1997, he founded his namesake real estate firm, Witkoff, where he currently serves as chairman and chief executive officer. He's now Florida-based, like Trump, and has golfed with him there. \n\nWitkoff was on the golf course with Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September during the second attempt on Trump’s life last year. He spoke to Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity afterward, relaying some details about how it unfolded and how Secret Service agents pounced on Trump to protect him. \n\n Witkoff unofficially helped on the campaign \n\nHe was among Trump's handpicked speakers at the Republican National Convention in July, along with his son Zach Witkoff, who works at the family real estate firm.\n\nThe elder Witkoff spent much of his RNC speech describing the comfort that Trump has provided him and his family as they've grieved the death of his adult son Andrew, who died of an opioid overdose in 2011. \n\nWitkoff last month told hostage families that the loss of Andrew has helped him understand the importance of bringing home the dead hostages still being held by Hamas so their family and friends can properly grieve them.\n\n“I am a member of that club that's buried a child,” Witkoff said. “It's a bad club.”\n\nWitkoff addressed the Madison Square Garden rally Trump held in October and spoke about how New York had changed since he grew up. He argued Trump could fix it. \n\nWitkoff let Trump use his private plane at times during the campaign and he helped Trump make peace with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after a bitter divide stemming from the Republican governor's failed 2024 presidential campaign. Witkoff helped set up a meeting between Trump and DeSantis at his Shell Bay Club in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, he named Witkoff as one of the two co-chairs of his inaugural committee, along with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who is now leading the Small Business Administration. \n\nTrump then gave Witkoff a much bigger job, naming him as his special envoy to the Middle East. His weighty job portfolio has since become even bigger.","summary":"Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow for high-level talks","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-moscow-b2714470.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/13/13/Witkoff_62303.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 13:01:45","author":"Michelle L.

If you think you know how corrupt the state’s leading politicians are, it’s worse than that. Sticky-fingered pols pushing woke policies have turned the Golden State into fool’s gold.\n\nThat’s the title of a new book out March 11 by two investigative reporters—Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics, and the Government Accountability Institute’s own Jedd McFatter. Fool’s Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All exposes the shocking truth behind California’s fall from grace, and how progressives want to do it to the rest of the nation. The book exposes the corruption of California’s leading Democratic lights—Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Adam Schiff, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nJedd and Susan join Peter Schweizer and Eric Eggers on the most recent episode of The Drill Down to name names and share what they found. “The book makes a perfect gift for all the California lefties in your life,” Eggers quips.\n\n“Why don’t we start with the head honcho, Gavin Newsom,” says Schweizer.\n\n“Everything about Governor Newsom is performative, not performance based,” says Crabtree, who is a California resident. “Everything has been handed to him on a silver platter, from his college admission to his winemaking career to his political rise. He is basically just performing, making it up as he goes along. That’s why he can say that he cares about the California wildfire victims.”\n\nHer book shows how much Newsom has taken from Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the state’s largest and most troubled utility company. “So, PG&E is one of several utilities in California that have a monopoly… They’re in bed with the California Democrats. They’ve given $2.5 million to Gavin Newsom, and they are responsible for the most deadly wildfire in the state’s history (the ‘Camp Fire’ that killed 85 people).”\n\nNewsom’s wife took $700,000 from the utility for a personal crusade. “His wife was so close to PG&E that she produced documentaries that promote transgender ideology,” Crabtree found. “And they came with a curriculum that she sold to 5,000 schools across the country. So, they’re exporting their values to the rest of the country, and they made a tidy little profit of $1.4 million.” PG&E gave money to her films and even held a screening in the downtown San Francisco skyscraper that is their headquarters.\n\nBut nothing beats the “monument.” McFatter tells the hosts that story.\n\n“Around 2015, there were some new articles that came out that talked about this bronze bust that was coming of Gavin Newsom. Gavin shrugged it off. He said he didn’t really know who was behind it,” McFatter says. “But what we found was that in 2016, the ‘behested payment system’ for California shows that Gavin Newsom actually solicited tax-exempt funds from three different organizations to help fund either the creation, installation, or maintenance of his own bronze bust. And two of the companies that donated money were his own actual companies. So, in that sense, he partially funded his own statue.”\n\nSchweizer asks why this kind of behavior and incompetence isn’t challenged or doesn’t get people riled up.\n\nCrabtree says, “I’ve talked about this with so many people, and it’s a great question, Peter. First of all, the legacy media out here cozies up to the Democratic establishment and is part of the problem… It’s basically one-party rule.”\n\n“There’s one-party rule because there’s been so much immigration into the state that now it’s basically a two-to-one ratio between Democrat registered voters and Republicans,” she says, noting that Donald Trump did better this time. “Trump got 6 million votes to 9 million for Kamala Harris, but still not enough.”\n\nFor more from Peter Schweizer, subscribe to The DrillDown podcast.","summary":"If you think you know how corrupt California is, it’s worse than that.
