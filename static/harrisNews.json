Trump's targeting of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official in Trump's first term, and Chris Krebs, a former top cybersecurity official, came as the president has sought to use the powers of the presidency to retaliate against his adversaries, including law firms.

Trump also on Wednesday retaliated against another law firm, Susman Godfrey, as he seeks to punish firms that have links to prosecutors who have investigated him or employed attorneys he sees as opponents. Although Trump has ordered security clearances to be stripped from a number of his opponents, including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, the president's order Wednesday directing the Justice Department to broadly investigate the actions of Taylor and Krebs marks an escalation of Trump's campaign of retribution since he returned to power.

Taylor, who left the Trump administration in 2019, was later revealed to be the author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed in 2018 that was sharply critical of Trump. The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret “resistance” to counter Trump's “misguided impulses,” and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump's first White House. Taylor later published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election. Trump said Wednesday that Taylor was “like a traitor” and that his writings about “confidential” meetings were “like spying.” “I think he's guilty of treason,\" he said. Taylor responded by saying Trump had proved his point. “Dissent isn't unlawful. It certainly isn't treasonous. America is headed down a dark path,\" he wrote on X. Trump named Krebs the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but became angered with him after he declared the 2020 election that Trump lost to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate. Krebs did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday. Trump has falsely claimed he was cheated out of reelection in 2020 by widespread fraud, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where he disputed his loss all affirmed Biden's victory. Judges, including some he appointed, rejected dozens of his legal challenges. Susman Godfrey, the firm Trump targeted in an order Wednesday, represented Dominion Voting Systems in a lawsuit that accused Fox News of falsely claiming that the voting company had rigged the 2020 presidential election. Fox News ultimately agreed to pay nearly $800 million to avert a trial. The order bars the firm from using government resources or buildings, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf. Trump has issued a series of orders meant to punish firms, including by ordering the suspension of lawyers' security clearances and revoking federal contracts. He's succeeded in extracting concessions from some who have settled, but others have challenged the orders in court.

Trump said at the time that he had “never even heard of” the official, who worked with his administration to put kids in cages during an immigration crackdown and ban travelers from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\n“I think it’s a very important case, and I think he’s guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said at the Oval Office on Wednesday. “But we’ll find out.”\n\nTaylor said in an X post that he saw the move coming.\n\n“Dissent isn’t unlawful,” he wrote. “It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”\n\nThe president also took aim at Krebs, a former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who staunchly defended the integrity of the 2020 elections from Trump’s claims of fraud.\n\nTrump fired Krebs in 2020 for debunking his false claims of a “rigged” election. CISA said at the time that the 2020 polls were “the most secure in American history”—a phrase that Trump apparently hasn’t forgotten as he mockingly repeated it in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\n“This guy is a wise guy,” Trump said of Krebs. “He said, ‘We’ve proven this is the most secure election in the history of our country.’ Now, this was a disaster… He’s a fraud. He’s a disgrace.”\n\nKrebs’ response to his firing in 2020 was brief: “Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow. #Protect2020.”\n\nThe executive orders against Taylor and Krebs were the latest development in Trump’s crusade against his political enemies. T\n\nhe president previously issued similar orders targeting law firms linked to investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot and to Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty/ReutersPresident Donald Trump’s revenge tour isn’t over yet.\n\nShortly after hitting pause on his market-crashing tariffs Wednesday, Trump signed a fresh wave of executive orders targeting the next names on his long list of political enemies: Miles Taylor and Christopher Krebs.\n\nThe orders stripped security clearances for both men, who were prominent antagonists within the administration during Trump’s first term, and ordered the Justice Department to investigate their “egregious behavior” and “malign acts.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-self-soothes-by-ordering-doj-probes-into-old-enemies/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/PVZZ42E6R5BSFPODRUNTJCGMMA.jpg?smart=true&auth=083bb2b47255c9df364d17c10afa2207089f03de452e956067f4134c1614caca&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 23:04:53","author":"Julia Ornedo","authors":["Julia Ornedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.58},{"id":309508876,"title":"Stop paroling New York cop killers: Letters to the Editor — April 10, 2025","text":"The Issue: The slew of violent criminals released by former Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer. \n\n“‘We stabbed Karen Bass a little bit. We stabbed Susan Rice a little bit. We stabbed Stacey Abrams a little bit,” one adviser said of the effort four years earlier. ‘We stabbed Gretchen Whitmer.’”\n\nThe book did not delve into the specifics Harris took to undercut her opponents as they all vied for the vice presidential nomination. \n\nBut any steps Harris took to undermine those women didn’t damage their relationships enough to stop them from backing her in the 2024 election. \n\nBass endorsed Harris, and both Whitmer and Abrams appeared at Harris campaign events in 2024. Additionally, Rice also defended Harris in July after Rep. Ted Burchett, R-Tenn., described Harris as a “DEI hire.” Rice described the comment as “incredibly insulting,” in an interview with CNN. \n\nHarris, who previously served as a senator from California, has signed with CAA Speakers, which represents high-profile celebrities. CAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\n“Fight” chronicles how President Donald Trump secured the White House for a second term. Allen and Parnes conducted interviews with more than 150 political insiders for the book, according to the book’s description.\n\nThe book also details how former President Barack Obama remained wary of supporting Harris in the 2024 election to replace Biden, amid concerns about his mental fitness. Likewise, the book shares that Obama doubted Biden’s political abilities as the race dragged on.","summary":"‘We stabbed Gretchen Whitmer,' one Harris advisor reportedly said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/media/kamala-harris-launched-dark-arts-operation-for-vp-spot-in-2020-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-aigrje7g1-1744231445237.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744217087&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EaXUSU01-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-09 20:46:18","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.15},{"id":309470972,"title":"George Stephanopoulos Privately Said Joe Biden Looked 'Heartbreaking Up Close' After Post-Debate Interview: New Book","text":"Multiple new books are detailing the final months of Joe Biden’s presidency and his historic decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election.In a new book about Trump's return to power titled Uncharted, author Chris Whipple quotes ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos as saying President Biden looked \"heartbreaking\" in his high-pressure post-debate interview.Another book claims White House advisers had plans in place for if Biden were to die in office.\n\n Multiple books about President Joe Biden’s time in the White House are making new claims about his mental decline and eventual removal from the 2024 Democratic ticket following a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\n While a physician claimed in February 2023 that Biden was a “healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,” concern about his health only continued to grow as he began seriously campaigning for reelection. \n\n The final straw for the Biden team was the campaign's first-and-only debate on June 27, 2024. While by-the-numbers reporting from NBC News showed that Trump attacked Biden more and also went off-topic more often, Biden’s performance was by far the more startling of the two. He rambled and spoke incoherently, raising major concerns about his ability to serve four more years in office.\n\n Following the debate, Biden sat down with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in an attempt to spin his image, with his team asserting that the high-stakes interview would restore confidence in his fitness for four more years.\n\n However, journalist Chris Whipple details in a new book, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, how the interview became yet another warning sign that his candidacy was in danger.\n\n “Stephanopoulos questioned the president gently, like a grandson,” Whipple writes of the ABC News sitdown. “Afterward, when I asked the ABC anchor by email for his impressions, he replied: ‘Heartbreaking up close.' ”\n\n Whipple previously told Politico that Biden's \"decline is a major part of the story\" when it comes to his book.\n\n “I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that,\" he shared. \"Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.”\n\n Less than a month after the debate, on July 21, Biden officially withdrew his candidacy for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket in his stead.\n\n In Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House — released earlier this month — authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes say the writing was on the wall for Biden's demise long before debate night put a spotlight on his frailty.\n\n In fact, the duo report that top aides to Vice President Harris “strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.”\n\n Her White House communications director, Jamal Simmons, reportedly went so far as to secretly create a “death-pool roster” of federal judges who could be called upon to swear Harris into the top office if Biden died.\n\n Simmons claims he never told Harris about the list, but left his plan with another of her aides when he stopped working for the VP.\n\n In another excerpt from Fight published by The Guardian, Parnes and Allen allege that top Democrats began having “hush-hush talks” as early as 2023 to plot how to handle Biden’s risky reelection bid, preparing the party to be ready for every possible scenario in which Biden was unable to continue his campaign.\n\n \"One veteran operative summed up the sentiments of Democrats who worried they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: ‘Well, at least she has a pulse,’ ” the book reads.\n\n May 20 will see the release of perhaps the most damning title yet about the Biden presidency: Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.\n\n The CNN reporters interviewed more than 200 people for their book and “found people post-election much more willing to talk candidly than they had been.”\n\n July 8 sees the release of Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf’s 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America. The trio’s book includes an interview with Trump himself, and involved Biden and Harris in the fact-checking process.\n\n “We spent more than a month fact-checking the manuscript, giving every person named the opportunity to respond for fairness and accuracy,” the authors said in a statement.\n\n In an Oval Office speech about his decision to withdraw his 2024 candidacy, Biden did not directly reference concerns about his physical health or mental acuity.\n\n He did, however, concede the fact that his years of political experience were not the boon they had once been in terms of his presidential duties.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​.\n\n “In recent weeks, it’s become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition,” Biden said.\n\n “So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he conceded. \"That’s the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.\"","summary":"At least four new books have promised to pull back the curtain on the Biden's cognitive decline and dramatic withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election","url":"https://people.com/biden-looked-heartbreaking-up-close-post-debate-interview-uncharted-book-11706428","image":"https://people.com/thmb/y3IKinGVlvu5d29qppNuv4U-JMA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/joe-biden-rose-remarks-election-of-donald-trump-110724-2-0d3fd331d7b34ea0b6015f6e87269679.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 20:20:04","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":309463726,"title":"Scott Sanders retires after shaking up Orange County’s justice system","text":"Public defenders are not usually household names, but many Orange Countians—especially those involved in law enforcement or the justice system—are well aware of Scott Sanders. He retired last month after 32 years in the public defender’s office. In the words of the current District Attorney Todd Spitzer, “he’s made the system better.”\n\nThat’s an understatement given Sanders’ outsized role exposing unconstitutional law-enforcement behavior. Sanders is known for his role in the Orange County “snitch scandal.” The U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in 2017 began a six-year investigation into allegations the county DA’s office and sheriff’s department for years used jailhouse informants to gather information about defendants.\n\nProblematically, Orange County’s law-enforcement officials didn’t disclose that information to defense attorneys, which is a violation of the law. “The informant controversy continues to undermine public confidence in the integrity of the Orange County criminal legal system,” DOJ concluded in a 2022 report. The revelations unraveled at least 59 criminal cases.\n\nDuring his research into a murder case, Sanders “stumbled on an organized effort by Orange County prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies to use jailhouse informants in a way that violated the rights of defendants, a clandestine ring that had illegally been kept secret for years from defense attorneys,” per a Register report. Prosecutors and police mocked him, but his instincts were correct.\n\nHad Sanders not been so dogged, it’s hard to believe anything would have been exposed—especially after former Attorney General Kamala Harris’ shameful failure to intervene. It takes tough-minded and relentless people to root out corruption and reform the government. Hopefully, others like Sanders will rise to meet future challenges.

I mean, so much so that this year people were, you know, they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing,’ Obama said in the podcast episode, released Tuesday.\n\n‘That this couldn’t be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?’ she continued. \n\nObama added ‘that’s what society does to us.’ \n\n‘We start actually, finally going, “What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?” And if it doesn’t fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible,’ Obama said. \n\nThe former first lady turned 61 on January 17 and spoke candidly to Bush about questions she’s asking about how she wants to spend the twilight of her life. \n\n‘So you know, now is the time for me to start asking myself these hard questions of who do I truly want to be every day,’ Obama said. \n\nShe said that looks ‘like whatever I want it to look like.’ \n\n‘And I still find time to you know, give speeches, to be out there in the world, to work on projects. I still care about girls’ education,’ Obama said. ‘We you know, the library is opening in a year from now.’\n\nThe former first lady acknowledged that there are ‘certain things I am and am not doing’ with President Obama’s presidential library, which is being constructed on Chicago’s South Side. \n\n‘But the interesting thing is that when I say no, for the most part, people are like, I get it, and I’m OK, right?’ she continued. \n\nMichelle Obama had appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August alongside her husband to stump for nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDuring her speech, she admitted that she struggled with coming to the DNC, as she had been mourning her mother Marian Robinson’s death, which occurred in May. \n\nThe former first lady made a handful of appearances on the campaign trail for Harris as well. \n\nBut she declined to fly to Washington for Carter’s funeral on January 9th, which was followed by Trump’s January 20th swearing-in. \n\nHer advisers told CNN she missed Carter’s gathering at the National Cathedral due to ‘scheduling conflicts.’ \n\n‘She’s actually still in Hawaii for an extended holiday vacation,’ the source said. \n\nHer 61st birthday was three days before inauguration. \n\nThe former president posted a picture of them together to mark Michelle’s special day. \n\nHowever the unflattering picture prompted more questions about the state of the Obamas’ marriage. \n\nThe former first couple also had to contend with baseless gossip that Barack was engaging in an affair with actress Jennifer Aniston. \n\nInTouch magazine had splashed the affair rumor on its cover in August, with Jimmy Kimmel asking Aniston about it on his late night show in October. \n\nThe A-list actress said the affair rumor was ‘absolutely untrue’ though laughingly said she ‘was not mad at it.’ \n\n‘I’ve met him once. I know Michelle more than him,’ Aniston said. \n\nWith that admission, Kimmel followed up with: ‘Is there a truth about you and Michelle that we should know?’ \n\n‘That is not true,’ Aniston replied.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMichelle Obama finally pushed back on the rumors that she and former&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Michelle Obama Addresses Rumors About Divorce from Barack first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/michelle-obama-addresses-rumors-about-divorce-from-barack/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/09/17/97091639-0-image-m-86_1744217156272.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 17:53:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":309448374,"title":"Biden's inner circle 'convinced themselves' he was capable to run for re-election, author Chris Whipple says","text":"Author Chris Whipple said Wednesday that former President Biden's inner circle \"convinced themselves\" that former President Biden was able to run for re-election, despite the evidence that Biden wasn't up to the job. Whipple explained that a lot of people have referred to the events leading up to former Vice President Kamala Harris taking Biden's spot at the top of the ticket as a \"cover-up\" orchestrated by the people closest to the president. However, Whipple argued that it was worse. \"The truth is actually stranger than that, and wilder than that. And it is that Biden’s inner circle, some of them you saw on camera just now, convinced themselves, in spite of all the evidence around them, they convinced themselves that Joe Biden could run for re-election and that he was capable of governing for another four years.

Klain said Biden was \"out of it\" and \"exhausted\" during debate preparation in June, according to Whipple's book. The author wrote that Klain \"was startled,\" adding, \"He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.\" \"In spite of all that, Ron Klain was fighting three weeks later to keep him in the race.

This is a guy who could do that. And yet he was a shadow of himself on the campaign trail. And that’s why they were hiding him,\" the author said.

During a stream with Digital Nas on Tuesday (April 8), the embattled rapper claimed that Frank Ocean attempted to talk him out of supporting the twice-impeached president prior to the 2016 election.\n\n “Frank Ocean p—y a– come over my house talking about Trump all day and how I shouldn’t support Trump,” he said. “N—a f–k you know about politics and n—a I’m your motherf—ing senior, OG, y’all used to come on tour with mea.”\n\n Ye continued: “None of you n—-s can tell me about politics n—a. F–k you think? You read a book and now you can tell me some s–t? None of these n—-s as talented. I’m the greatest motherf—ing artist that ever existed. They can just be slightly better at one thing cause they only do that one thing.”\n\n Billboard has reached out to Ocean’s reps for comment.\n\n Ye — who has faced continued backlash for his ongoing hate speech — hasn’t been shy about his support for Trump over the years. He originally had a pro-Trump rant during his Saint Pablo Tour in 2016 and met up with the president at Trump Towers in December 2016 for a photo op.\n\n He pulled up to the White House in 2018 while rocking a red MAGA hat, where he spoke about his appreciation for the president and met with Trump at the Oval Office. Ye kept the MAGA hat on throughout the year and even wore it during his appearance on Saturday Night Live.\n\n While Ye opposed Trump in 2020 during his own brief presidential bid, he came back to support Trump — who has since been convicted on 34 felony charges in his hush money case — for the 2024 election as DT defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\n Around the time of the alleged conversation between Ocean and Ye in 2016, they had been collaborative on the music side. Ocean helmed “Frank’s Track” on The Life of Pablo, while West had a cameo on Blonde‘s “White Ferrari.” Ocean hasn’t released a project since.\n\n However, West’s tune changed in March when he claimed during an explosive interview with DJ Akademiks that “Moon” from 2021’s Donda album was the end of his former collaborator’s time in music.\n\n “Like when I made, ‘Moon,’ it basically ended Frank Ocean’s career. He ain’t have a song since then.

But early in his career, as a teenager in the early 1970s, they hit a wall. “All them boys have wanted to do all kinds of genres, but when I was coming up, I got stuck with James Brown,” the bassist recalls with a laugh. “It’s hard to get out of that funk, you know?”\n\n Collins, now 73, was playing with Cincinnati’s Pacesetters in 1970, when Brown sent a Learjet to fly the band to a Columbus, Ohio, gig, abruptly replacing his own disgruntled road band. The Pacesetters, who’d been hanging around Brown’s King Records studio, knew his songs and could play any of them on demand. “I said, ‘Just call out whatever song you want to go into. We got you,'” Collins recalls. “That’s how we made it through that night — but after that night, we had about two weeks of straight rehearsal, every single day. Which we were used to anyway.”\n\n Collins and company scrupulously adhered to Brown’s funk orthodoxy for a year. Then, for a gig at the Copacabana in New York, Brown cut the band’s pay and forced them to wear jackets and ties, so they split. Collins went on to join another funk pioneer: George Clinton, whose alternating bands Parliament and Funkadelic were innovating a looser, more improvisational and funnier style that would help define Black music in the ’70s.\n\n In P-Funk, Bootzilla and the rest of Collins’ alter-egos found a receptive home. “By the time I got with George, I got a little more freedom — well, a lot more freedom — to do funk. And the name was Funkadelic,” he says, in an audio-only Zoom from his Cincinnati home, along with his wife and manager, Patti Collins. “So what am I going to do? Am I going to come there and play everything else but funk? No, you’ve got to bring the funk: ‘I’m up to my trunks in P-Funk.'”\n\n Collins — whose bass style “had sap flowing through it, it moved,” according to Brown’s biographer R.J. Smith — was part of a funky bass coalition in the ’70s, including Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone and the late Louis Johnson of the Brothers Johnson, which brought the instrument into the foreground. Collins had unlimited musical creativity, and a weird, say-anything persona that he capped with star-shaped shades, bright-colored suits and spangled ringleader hats. And he made several great albums with his solo outfit Bootsy’s Rubber Band, notably 1977’s Ahh… the Name Is Bootsy, Baby. But even then, he felt limited.\n\n “I just got caught, like, ‘OK, Bootsy’s thing is funk,’ so everybody levitated towards that — except me,” he says. “I wanted to play other music, but it was who I wound up with that solidified what I was going to be and what I’m supposed to be doing.”\n\n Collins’ Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, due April 11, allows all these musical detours and imaginary best friends to do whatever they want. In addition to straightforward funk (“The InFluencers,” with guest star Snoop Dogg, a vocal P-Funk adherent), Collins travels into guitar-shredding metal (“Barbie T & Me”), electronic dance music (the murmuring “I.Am.AI,” with competing robot voices) and hip-hop (“Bootdullivan is Soopafly”). Collins’ solo albums in recent years have been long and varied, unlike the Bootsy’s Rubber Band days, when he hit the studio, jammed with his bandmates and occasionally turned on the recording machines.\n\n “Those jams were just so long. You could only put so much on an album back in the day without it not sounding good,” he says. “I never thought we were going to be doing as many songs as I’m doing now, but that’s where technology has taken us.”\n\n On the Zoom, Bootsy and Patti Collins discuss a number of projects, beginning with Bootzilla Records, the pair’s indie label, distributed through Jay-Z‘s Roc Nation, which puts out Collins’ own albums as well as a roster of young artists he discovers online, such as singers Fantaazma and Myra Washington. Collins is also working on an album for guitarist Buckethead, with whom he collaborated in experimental-music bandleader Bill Laswell‘s band Praxis in the ’90s. He’s working with the Wooten Brothers, jazz, funk and bluegrass stars, on an album. And he’s in touch with his old P-Funk mate, Clinton, for the first time in years, discussing a tour.\n\n The two reconnected last summer, after then-Vice President Kamala Harris bought a George Clinton Funko Pop doll during a campaign stop, then asked reporters, “Do you know P-Funk? No. OK, well there are lessons to be taught. Bootsy Collins. Does everybody know who Bootsy Collins is? OK, there’s some education to be done, I can see that.”\n\n So what education needs to be done? Collins explains that P-Funk made great albums, performed on tour for thousands of fans and became influential for generations of best-selling artists from hip-hop stars like Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube to funk bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone, but never hit that multiplatinum megastar stratosphere. “Of course, we sold some gold and platinum records, but it wasn’t like Prince, it wasn’t like Rick James, it wasn’t like all the big boys that raised all that noise with all those records,” Collins says. “Funk was a bad word when we first brought it. Radio wouldn’t even touch us in the beginning. But it was something that the people stood up for and I would never forget that. And that’s what Kamala was talking about: ‘I’m going to have to educate y’all.'”","summary":"With a new album arriving, why everyone from the biggest fans to Kamala Harris is calling for a brighter light on Bootzilla.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bootsy-collins-more-than-just-funk-1235942522/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bootsy-Collins-cr-Joseph-Ross-press-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 16:35:55","author":"Dan Rys,Steve Knopper","authors":["Dan Rys","Steve Knopper"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.242},{"id":309448388,"title":"Harris launched 'dark-arts operation' against opponents for VP spot in 2020, new book claims","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris engaged in a \"dark-arts operation\" to undercut other potential running mates for former President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, according to a new book.

The Oscar-winning actress plays Danielle Sutton, a steely veteran, mother of two and president of the United States. When we meet the leader of the free world, she’s tensely battling with her 17-year-old daughter Serena (Marsai Martin) after the angsty teenager snuck out to party at a Georgetown bar. \n\n How Serena managed to outwit her Secret Service agents and end up on the late night news shows vexes Sutton, who’s trying to maintain a flawless and relatively low-key reputation as the first Black woman president of the North American nation. In that way, G20, directed by Patricia Riggen and streaming April 10 on Prime Video, feels like a relic of a timeline in which Vice President Kamala Harris’ future in the Oval Office seemed all but assured. The film weaves the social and political pressures faced by a Black woman ascending to the highest office into a bumpy story about how she’s eventually thrust into an explosive global crisis. \n\n Riggen, working from a screenplay by Caitlin Parrish, Erica Weiss, Logan Miller and Noah Miller, struggles to balance the tonal requirements of each thread, which results in a film that’s slow to get going. But once the principal heroes and villains have been established and the perfunctory narrative throat-clearing is out of the way, G20 finds its groove as a solid popcorn action flick. \n\n In interviews about G20, Davis has said she did the movie because she wanted to star in something popular. While this film doesn’t shy away from heavy themes, the whole operation hinges on the actress’ confident portrayal of the kind of action hero usually played by white male movie stars. It’s essentially her Air Force One. (To be fair, Davis isn’t unfamiliar with this genre: She did lead an army of women warriors in precolonial West Africa in Gina Prince-Bythewood’s The Woman King.) And while one does wish that Davis had a less schmaltzy and more coherent story to work with here, G20 manages to deliver where it matters. The stunts (coordinated by Grant Powell) are relatively inventive and appropriately balletic, and the film features a gallery of supporting characters worth rooting for.\n\n After a reporter questions Sutton’s ability to protect the nation if she can’t even manage her kid, the president decides to take the whole family — husband Derek (Anthony Anderson), daughter Serena and son Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) — with her to the G20 summit in Cape Town, South Africa. They are accompanied by the president’s friend and longtime security detail Agent Manny Ruiz (Ramón Rodríguez) and U.S. Treasury Secretary Joanna Worth (Elizabeth Marvel). \n\n This year’s conference is a big deal for Sutton because she needs to recruit other nations to join her efforts to give micro-loans to farmers in Africa, a step she believes will play a significant role in ending world hunger. There are plenty of doubters, though, including British Prime Minister Oliver Everett (Douglas Hodge), and key players she needs to convince like Elena Romano (The White Lotus season two‘s Sabrina Impacciatore), the new head of the IMF. \n\n The world’s most powerful leaders arrive in Cape Town with relatively little fanfare, but that changes later when the heads of state are held hostage in the hotel’s conference room by a rogue group, led by Rutledge (Antony Starr), a former U.S. army officer, determined to short the market. They are functionally crypto bros — with a bit of an anarchist spirit — who use artificial intelligence and deep fakes to convince workers around the world to back bitcoin currency. They want the people to rise up against ineffective leadership and recognize that they are being brainwashed into paying for endless wars. Rutledge makes some fair points, but too bad they’re tainted by an insatiable greed. \n\n During the early moments of mayhem — in which Rutledge and his global team of mercenaries breach the hotel’s maximum security system and hack into its surveillance framework — Sutton and Manny manage to escape the conference room. They are followed by Oliver, Elena and Han Min-Seo (a scene-stealing Meewha Alana Lee), the first lady of South Korea. Elsewhere in the hotel, Serena, Demetrius and Derek dodge their armed captors and find a way to escape. \n\n G20 takes place almost exclusively in this hotel and its events happen over the course of a single night. The tight framing is helpful for a film that can wobble under the demands of its various plot points, some of which end up competing for attention. At first, Sutton’s goal is to find a way out of the hotel, but it soon becomes clear that she is the one the mercenaries are after. Her position as U.S. president makes her critical to the plan to crash the global market, and in order to lure her back to the conference room Rutledge starts killing her colleagues. That plan adds tension to the relatively flimsy stakes of the film, turning a straightforward escape plot into a more gripping game of cat and mouse. Sutton must reverse course and now try to find a way to save her fellow leaders, her family and the world. \n\n It’s no small task, but Davis navigates it with believable conviction.

Gretchen Whitmer backed the idea behind President Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs Wednesday morning, but argued that levies should be “used like a scalpel.”\n\nWhitmer, seen by many as a possible contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, told an audience in the nation’s capital that “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs,” the application of which has sent the stock market into free fall.\n\n“Here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” the 53-year-old said. “We do need to make more stuff in America. More cars and chips. More steel and ships. We do need fair trade.”\n\nWhile Whitmer — whose campaign efforts for Kamala Harris in 2024 included a cringe-inducing video of a “Dorito Communion” — said the tariff approach has to be “done right,” she also admitted under questioning from journalist Gretchen Carlson that “I haven’t really thought about” how her duties would be different from Trump’s.\n\n“I don’t know how I would’ve enacted them differently,” the governor said. “I haven’t really thought about that. What I have thought about is that tariffs need to be used like a scalpel.”\n\nTrump’s all-encompassing reciprocal tariffs “couldn’t have come at a worse time,” Whitmer argued, citing inflation and higher costs of living.\n\n“You can’t just pull out the tariff hammer and swing at every problem without a clear, defined end goal,” she said, pitching the solution as a bipartisan project spanning several presidential terms that brings “friends” together against our adversaries to bring manufacturing back to America. \n\nTrump, 78, imposed a 10% base tariff at 12:01 a.m. Saturday and hit “worst-offender” countries with higher rates at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, including a whopping 104% total tariff on China after Beijing retaliated against the US.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Trump had directed his economic team to pursue negotiations with foreign countries to get optimal, “tailor-made” trade deals for the US.\n\nWhitmer’s bipartisan messaging is in line with her approach post-Harris loss. \n\nThe Michigan governor, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, has been coy about her political plans, but has said the country is ready for a female president.\n\n“Lots of men have run for president and lost. And no one concludes that people don’t want a male president,” she said in January.\n\n“So for anyone to state that it’s about gender probably betrays that they’ve got their own agenda at stake, as opposed to really looking at what happened in this last election.”","summary":"\"I don't know how I would've enacted them differently,\" Whitmer said Wednesday. \"I haven't really thought about that.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/us-news/gretchen-whitmer-says-i-understand-trump-tariff-motive-but-prez-has-gone-too-far/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102176617.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/y7vFipVR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-09 15:31:35","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":309401302,"title":"Trump's assassination suspect tried to buy anti-aircraft missile","text":"Federal prosecutors have revealed new explosive details in the case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate US President Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in September, 2024. In a court filing on Monday, authorities said Routh not only staked out Trump on the green with a semi-automatic rifle but also attempted to acquire military-grade weapons, including an anti-aircraft missile, to shoot down Trump’s plane.According to court documents, Routh tried to purchase a Stinger missile and a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) from someone he believed to be a Ukrainian arms dealer, reported CBS News. In messages exchanged in August 2024, he wrote, “Send me an RPG or Stinger and I will see what we can do.” He also added, “I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected.”According to The Guardian, Routh also scouted Palm Beach International Airport, where Trump regularly flew in and out during the campaign, supporting the prosecution’s claim that the weapons were intended to target Trump’s plane. Prosecutors called his attempts a “substantial step taken in furtherance of his plot,” and described the alleged plan as “squarely within the realm of an attempt on his life.”Court filings state Routh also tried to acquire a .50-caliber rifle from a contact at a Florida gun show, an even more powerful version of the semi-automatic SKS-style rifle he allegedly carried to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A Secret Service agent spotted the weapon protruding from the shrubbery approximately 300-500 yards from where Trump was playing. Routh fled the scene without firing and was arrested later that day nearly 50 miles away.According to the New York Post, Routh left behind a loaded rifle, a digital camera, and two backpacks, one of which reportedly contained food and supplies. Prosecutors now say he had also corresponded with a Mexican smuggler named “Ramiro” on WhatsApp to plan his escape across the border following the alleged assassination attempt.Routh’s defense team has filed a motion to suppress an eyewitness identification they say was improperly influenced by police. The witness was shown a single photo of Routh after his arrest, which the defense argues created a risk of “irreparable misidentification.”Routh has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including attempted assassination of a presidential candidate. His trial is scheduled to begin on 8 September 2025 in Florida, before Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.The case comes in the shadow of another assassination attempt in July 2024, when a separate gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. That assailant was shot dead by Secret Service. Trump went on to defeat Kamala Harris in the general election later that year.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/send-me-an-rpg-or-stinger-donald-trumps-assassination-suspect-tried-to-buy-anti-aircraft-missile/articleshow/120132436.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-120132449/120132449.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 15:24:03","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":309394146,"title":"Elizabeth Warren Trots Out One Of Her Favorite Talking Points About Corporations. CNBC Host Isn’t Buying It.","text":"CNBC’s Joe Kernen scoffed at Democrat Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday as she tried to convince the panel that corporations are “price gouging” in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nWarren, who has repeatedly spewed the “price gouging” talking point, said that companies are raising prices because of their worries about the costs of the reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on April 2, which he deemed “Liberation Day.” Kernen pointed out that inflation and the cost of goods, such as eggs, have come down since Trump reentered office in January.\n\n“There are businesses that are already saying quite publicly, yup, they’re worried, so they’re raising prices now. And this is actually one of my most serious concerns about the tariffs.,” Warren said. “Once everyone starts talking about price increases and remember, this started last Friday with Jerome Powell, saying that he’s very concerned that we’re gonna see inflation. That prices are gonna go up across the board for everything that consumers buy. That creates the environment for businesses to be able to say ‘oh, well we’ll just go ahead and increase our prices now, we’ll increase our prices more than the cost of the tariffs,’ and so you get the one two punch of passing along costs from the tariffs, but also price gouging.”\n\n“Remember our last conversation, this is like part two,” Kernen responded. “Remember our last conversation about price gouging. So now you have another way to say that corporations are doing that. But egg prices came down, inflation came down, it seems like the corporations only gouge when you say they’re gouging and they’re unable to at other times.” (RELATED: ‘Why Are You Interrupting?’: Peter Navarro Spars With CNBC Hosts On Whether Trump’s Tariffs Will Actually Work)\n\nThe Massachusetts senator previously sparred with Kernen on price gouging in August, where she accused him of talking over her as she attempted to defend former Vice President Kamala Harris’ introduced ban on so-called price gouging on groceries. She further joined other Senate Democrats to accuse McDonald’s of price gouging after Trump made a campaign visit at the chain restaurant in October.\n\nThe senator introduced S. 3803, the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2024, on Feb. 26, which intended to impose a national price gouging ban.\n\nWarren cited Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who stated that prices went up during Trump’s first term after he had placed tariffs on certain countries. She claimed that when Trump placed tariffs on imported washing machines, domestic manufacturers raised the prices of their washers and driers simply because they could.\n\n“So I know you don’t want to listen to me on this, but listen to Jerome Powell on this,” Warren said. “The example he gave Friday was from the last time that Trump’s tariffs went into effect. And he said there was a tariff on washing machines, no surprise, the price of washing machines went up. But the shocking part is the price of driers went up as well even though there was no imposition of tariffs on those. You tell me what that is except for price gouging.”\n\n“I’m trying to figure that out. If you have a clothes line, unless you have to dry, though, senator … we had that at my house growing up,” Kernen said. “Did you? Yeah, I loved the smell.”\n\n“I love the way you’re changing the subject here. That is an example of price gouging, I think it’s time for you to eat that,” Warren said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found in May that corporations were not gouging during former President Joe Biden’s administration, and instead raised prices to meet the demands in the early stages of the post-pandemic economic recovery. The report further found that the high government spending during the Biden administration had a significantly higher contribution to inflation than corporations raising prices.\n\nAfter inflation plagued the Biden administration, the prices of consumer goods have largely improved since Trump took office. The price of eggs, which soared 58% in comparison to 2024, plummeted from $8.16 in early March to $3.25 as of Wednesday.\n\nInflation slowed in February as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the price of everyday goods, increased 2.8%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report released in March. The Producer Price Index, a wholesale inflation measurement, also substantially slowed in February in comparison to the previous month.\n\nEconomists expect that inflation also eased in March partly due to the decrease in energy and gasoline prices, according to Morning Star.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tariffs have them questioning their faith","text":"Credit: Ben Shapiro\n\nBen Shapiro last year decried Donald Trump’s tariff talk as a negotiating tactic.\n\n“I’m going to chalk this one up the bull----ing... do I take seriously the idea that, without congressional legislation, he is going to be able to levy a 20 per cent tariff on everything coming into the country? No, I don’t,” he insisted during a Free Press debate just before the election. “He’s a wheeler dealer, he tends to use tariffs as a piece of leverage.”\n\nYet just six months later, the podcaster appears to be eating his words.\n\nMr Shapiro is just one of an army of content creators, alongside the likes of Joe Rogan and Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy, who helped Mr Trump appeal to millions on his path to election victory in 2024.\n\nBut some loyal foot soldiers of the Maga cavalry may now be losing faith in their commander-and-chief after his controversial tariff policy wiped trillions from the global economy.\n\nRight-wing influencers who hosted the then presidential candidate on their shows and social media channels in an attempt to boost his popularity with young voters are now questioning his economic policies and urging him to backtrack.\n\nWhile some podcasters have been tight lipped on the financial impact of the sweeping economic changes, others have described losing up to $20 million (£15.7 million) in the wake of Mr Trump’s introduction of sweeping global tariffs on what he branded “liberation day”.\n\nAmong those who have broken ranks with Maga to criticise Mr Trump’s policy is Mr Shapiro, who suggested his tariffs were “probably unconstitutional” and “pretty crazy”.\n\nThe Daily Wire co-founder, who boasts 15 million followers across YouTube and X, has been a dedicated Maga supporter who fundraised for Mr Trump’s 2024 campaign and interviewed him on his podcast in October.\n\nBut this week he used his hour-long episode of The Ben Shapiro Show to criticise Mr Trump’s economic policy and throw his weight behind Elon Musk, who has reportedly urged the president to abandon his tariffs.\n\n“The president’s vision of international trade is, I’m sorry to say, mistaken,” Mr Shapiro said.\n\nSupporting Mr Musk, who has in recent days dissented against the administration and called for a “free-trade zone” between the US and Europe, Mr Shapiro said: “Musk is right. Musk happens to be 100 per cent right about this.”\n\n“Musk himself suggested that he wants a zero tariff situation, which again, this is the good explanation for why you would do the tariff game,” Mr Shapiro said.\n\n“I urge the president to do precisely what Musk is saying here. Go to zero with all these countries. Go to zero.”\n\nWhile Mr Shapiro has not disclosed whether his own net worth has suffered with the economic downturn in the past week, he has previously hosted podcast episodes in which he discusses investing in the stock market and financial literacy.\n\nThe roiling markets saw as much as $10 trillion wiped off global stocks in three days.\n\nOne Maga influencer who has been frank about the financial implications tariffs have had on his portfolio is Dave Portnoy, who criticised Mr Trump for playing golf while he saw $20 million wiped from his net worth.\n\nMr Portnoy, who owns media firm Barstool Sports, has supported Mr Trump in the past three presidential elections and interviewed the Republican leader at the White House in 2020.\n\nThe millionaire also said he had been tapped for a role in the Department of Commerce in this administration, but declined after he was told he would have to hand the running of Barstool Sports to someone else.\n\nMr Portnoy has in recent days lamented the battering his net worth has taken in the wake of Mr Trump’s tariffs.\n\nOn Friday the “bro” influencer said he had lost $7 million (£5.5 million) - which on Monday he said had ballooned to $20 million.\n\nCredit: @donwinslow\n\nIt is not known what his current loss stands at after stocks markets were buoyed on Tuesday after Mr Trump said a deal between the US and China “will happen”.\n\n“The stock market crashes on 9/11, yes. The stock market crashed [during] Covid, yes.\n\n“But this is a decision that one guy made that crashed the whole stock market. That’s why we’re calling it Orange Monday and not Black Monday,” Mr Portnoy said on Monday.\n\n“I didn’t love seeing him on the golf course playing his course championship and being like, ‘I’m a very low handicap.’ I didn’t love that,” he said, referring to comments the president made on Air Force One over the weekend, after taking Friday off to attend a golf tournament and dinner in Florida.\n\n“The stock market is getting crushed. I’ve lost 20 per cent of my net worth. And you’re out on the golf course.”\n\n“In my mind, Donald Trump just cost me $20 million with whatever he did. Maybe don’t be on the golf course,” he said. “Because I’m curled up in a ball in bed sweating.”\n\nLast month the Barstool founder also criticised the Trump administration over the Signal leak, calling for somebody to “go down” for mistakenly adding a journalist to a group chat discussing an imminent strike on Houthi rebels.\n\nHowever, Mr Portnoy added: “Do I like it? No. Am I crying, ‘Woe is me, I wish I voted for Kamala?’ No. Do I wish this didn’t go down like this? Yes,” Mr Portnoy said.\n\nOne influencer who waded into the Maga-sphere during the last election to support Mr Trump also announced he had lost at least $10 million (£7.8 million) in the market downturn.\n\nVideo game streamer Adin Ross, 24, gave Mr Trump a personalised Tesla Cybertruck and a Rolex after he appeared on his channel for an 80-minute interview.\n\nIn recent livestream Mr Ross said he had lost “eight figures” following the tariffs, to which his friend DJ Akademiks replied: “You over here like, damn, Kamala, come back to me.”\n\nMr Ross added: “It’s bad, I’m not gonna lie to you. It’ll get better, but it’s bad, though.”\n\nCredit: X/@ClutchRodgersss\n\nMr Trump was also berated by the wife of one podcaster who gave Mr Trump a platform ahead of the election over the hit to their investments following the downturn.\n\nMr Trump appeared on the Flagrant podcast, which is hosted by Akaash Singh and Andrew Schulz, weeks before voters went to the polls in November 2024.\n\nIn a video shared on her TikTok account earlier this month, Mr Singh’s wife Jasleen questioned whether her husband is “happy” the stock market is crashing.\n\n“Isn’t that what you wanted, because you interviewed Trump?”, she said.\n\nIn the clip Mr Singh said he did not vote for Mr Trump and they would have hosted Ms Harris had they been given the opportunity.\n\n“I’m not talking to you,” Ms Singh said, adding: “There goes our investment portfolio, you d---.”\n\nEven Joe Rogan, undoubtedly the most influential podcaster to host and back Mr Trump ahead of the election, has broken ranks with the Republican leader in recent weeks.\n\nRogan spoke to Mr Trump in a three-hour-long interview shortly before the election last year.\n\nThe podcast, which has more than 57 million views on YouTube, is viewed as a key turning point with young, male voters, a demographic which shifted towards Mr Trump in 2024.\n\n“Why are we upset at Canada? This is stupid, this over tariffs. We got to become friends with Canada again, this is so ridiculous”, Rogan said on his show last month.\n\n“I can’t believe there is anti American, anti Canadian sentiment going on. ‘It’s the dumbest f------ feud... and I don’t think they should be our 51st state.”\n\nCredit: YouTube/ JRE Clips\n\nThe podcaster also criticised the deportation of a makeup artist to El Salvador’s mega-prison, saying it was “horrific” that “people who aren’t criminals are getting lassoed up and deported”.\n\nWorld leaders are scrambling to make a deal with Mr Trump to relieve the punitive tariffs.\n\nBut if the economic slump continues, even the Republican leader’s most loyal podcast followers may begin to experience buyer’s remorse.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/maga-influencers-helped-elect-trump-093000035.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VdpEXfvV_6XvvwlcL0aqFQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/7620cdfe6e4e12100e2a1d1d696babb6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 13:18:58","author":"Susie Coen","authors":["Susie Coen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.158},{"id":309306174,"title":"Hands Off protests: Darcy cartoon","text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The West Side Market corner block in Cleveland and other parts of Northeast Ohio were sites of Saturday’s nationwide ‘Hands Off’ protests against the Trump Administration’s cuts and changes to the U.S. Government.\n\nHad nearly 100 million eligible Americans not been ‘Hands Off’ polling booths Tuesday November 5, 2024, voting to stay home instead, it’s likely there would be no need to protest Saturday April 5, 2025, because there’d be no Trump-Musk administration.\n\nThe ‘Hands Off’ mantra/slogan comes from the caution warning signs.

The fictional historically Black college (or HBCU), Hillman, would go on to become a byword for Black excellence. “The influence of kids wanting to go to school, period, I think is very powerful,” one of the stars of the series, Jasmine Guy, said while touring HBCU campuses with her former castmates in 2024, 35 years after the sitcom ended. “Because they could see themselves there.”\n\nHillman College is credited with driving record levels of enrollment at actual HBCUs in the 1980s and 90s, and remains a source of inspiration for Black creatives to this day. The actor-screenwriter Lena Waithe had the fabled campus in mind when she launched her production company, Hillman Grad. “I want to call it something that is close to my heart, and that is the world of A Different World and what that show represented for me and so many other people,” she said.\n\nFour decades later, that fantasy world lives on and finds itself reckoning with the reality of a second Donald Trump administration hellbent on rolling back diversity programs and gutting the Department of Education. On TikTok, the hashtag HillmanTok has become a free online space where Black scholars share their expertise in subjects that the administration is trying to excise from libraries and school curricula. Anyone who scrolls to their content on TikTok and sticks around for the lesson is part of the class. “I’m mindful of the weight of this particular teaching and this particular time,” says Leah Barlow, a liberal studies professor at North Carolina A&T, the country’s largest HBCU. “Honestly, it feels a little ancestral.”\n\nLast fall, Barlow posted an introductory two-minute TikTok video for her African studies class; 250,000 users subscribed to the class channel overnight and within a week it hit 4m views. “I thought it was going to be a trend for a short time, and then we’d move on to the next thing,” says Barlow, who posted the video on the same day Trump retook office and rescinded a federal TikTok ban.\n\nBut then a sixth-grade math teacher named Cierra Hinton seized on the enthusiasm and started the hashtag HillmanTok. She encouraged Black educators to post instructional videos under the banner, and was inundated with hashtagged submissions. Like Black Twitter and Black Lives Matter, another digital social justice movement was born – the world’s first crowd-sourced HBCU. In an emotional response video, Hinton took a measure of satisfaction in helping “people come together and build something that is bigger than we ever imagined, something that means so much”.\n\nHillmanTok class subjects run the gamut from US history to mathematics to culinary arts. There are even electives on African American food studies and Stem careers. “I am finally about to post the syllabus,” Carlotta Berry says in the greeting for her Engineering 101 HillmanTok course. “You can learn asynchronously by watching any of my videos.”\n\nThe HillmanTok educators aren’t limited to real-world academics like Berry, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana. Shannan E Johnson, a former creative executive at the Syfy channel, has a course on screenwriting. The music journalist Touré has a course on the prehistory of hip-hop. “This is actually a reprise of the class I did 20 years ago at NYU,” he joked. “We’re overenrolled, as usual.”\n\nJust as A Different World regularly dealt with weighty subjects such as war, homelessness and the Aids epidemic at the risk of losing advertiser support, HillmanTok also offers culturally urgent lessons on resistance and restorative justice. “People have always been trying to limit and marginalize the impact and effect of Black education,” says Jelani Favors, the director of North Carolina A&T’s Center of Excellence for Social Justice. “But it was those teachers opening up their classroom doors, pouring into young idealists and finding ways to unlock their potential to engage in the deconstructing of Jim Crow and white supremacy.”\n\nThis is all happening against the backdrop of a Black college enrollment gap in which Black men account for 26% of the student body. All the while Maga donors add insult to injury by trashing the value of HBCU education overall. “Howard was not Harvard,” the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said in a dig at the former vice-president Kamala Harris’s scholarship at Howard University, the most prestigious HBCU. “You couldn’t even point this out [when she was running]. This is probably a racist thing to say.”\n\nThat’s just the start of the slights against HBCUs, which were founded to provide educational opportunities for Black students at a time when it was illegal or impossible to attend college in the US. A 2023 investigation by the Biden administration found that HBCUs had missed out on more than $13bn in federal funding for more than three decades because state governors blocked the funds. North Carolina A&T, which has a 14,000-student enrollment, was owed more than $2bn alone. HBCUs could well end up suffering more under Trump, who has made a U-turn from allocating $250m in funding to freezing educational grants and loans – which is how most HBCU students cover tuition. Last month, he signed an executive order to close the Department of Education – a critical lifeline for HBCUs, which have a much harder time fundraising than predominantly white institutions.\n\nThat HillmanTok is poised to become a resource for a Black student population that could find itself locked out of the traditional college experience makes it more relevant than just another Khan Academy, YouTube University or MasterClass. Inevitably, that momentum faces new headwinds from the rush to capitalize on the Hillman name – not unlike the Black Lives Matter movement did at the end. Some HillmanTok supporters have taken exception to attempts to sell merchandise and live events under the name. What’s more, as a number of trademark claims have been filed for the name, Black TikTok users have raised concerns about a white business interest winning control.\n\n“Anytime something looks like it’s going to make some money or turn into a movement, you see this,” says the Howard University law professor Nicole Gaither, who adds that the case for each filing also holds potential ramifications. It just really depends on how the US Patent and Trademark Office is going to view this. “Lena Waithe has Hillman registrations that are related to entertainment services, but she also has education services related to manners and etiquette. And she sells apparel,” Gaither aded.\n\nWhile that plays out in the background, Barlow remains strictly committed to the work. Last month TikTok and the United Negro College Fund hosted an event in Washington to connect HillmanTok instructors with Capitol Hill lawmakers and bring awareness to inclusive education and Black history preservation. While there, Barlow conducted TikTok interviews with the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock and the representative Jasmine Crockett for her class. Crockett implored her students to “take advantage of this moment and realize we don’t have a million Leahs running around. Please value her and value your education.”\n\nHillmanTok continues a tradition of Black self-determination through education that dates back to the flouting of anti-literacy laws during slavery. “We always find a way, regardless of what is happening – we, meaning Black people,” says Barlow. “We have always been resilient, autonomous and used agency to get information where it needs to go.”\n\nThe Hillman brand wasn’t always such an easy sell. Where The Cosby Show was largely written and produced by white people for white audiences as a showcase for Black respectability, A Different World boldly entrusted young Black creatives with the task of relating the cultural experiences that young Black students were having in real time. A Different World faced bitter critical reception when it debuted. One newspaper reviewer called it “a greed-motivated sitcom” in a slam of the show’s creator, Bill Cosby – who patterned the college after the women’s HBCU Spelman College, where he was once a major benefactor.\n\nAfter that rough first season, control over the sitcom was passed to the Fame alumna Debbie Allen (sister of The Cosby Show matriarch Phylicia Rashad) – who not only brought her own college experience at Howard into the production process, but also an army of Black writers and consultants. She empowered actors to give feedback and introduced clauses into their contract that freed them up to write and direct episodes, adding to the show’s diverse perspectives. For a kicker, Allen enlisted Aretha Franklin to record the theme song.\n\nAlso in the middle of that first season, Bonet became pregnant with her first child, Zoë, with her then husband Lenny Kravitz. Cosby, scoffing at the cultural optics of Denise being portrayed as an unwed mother in college, had Bonet written off the series and reabsorbed into The Cosby Show. “I thought that show just wasn’t going to come back because she was and is the star,” Guy said. But after reconfiguring around the romance between Whitley (Guy) and Dwayne (Kadeem Hardison), A Different World became a ratings colossus alongside The Cosby Show and a mainstay in Black households for generations.\n\nAmong others, the sitcom introduced the world to Jada Pinkett Smith and the Oscar winners Halle Berry and Marisa Tomei – who took the role playing Bonet’s white roommate after Meg Ryan passed. (It certainly worked out for the both of them.) And unlike with The Cosby Show, the disgraced Cosby’s involvement has not dinted A Different World’s popularity over the years. (He only appears briefly in the pilot.) Last fall, the cast reunited for a national HBCU tour to spark enrollment and scholarship fundraising and found that many of the students who remain inspired by the show had been born long after its initial 144-episode run.\n\nIn February, A Different World finally made its debut on Netflix – six months after the streamer announced the development of an Allen-produced sequel that would focus on the Hillman experience of Whitley and Dwayne’s daughter, with the pilot to begin shooting over the summer. It remains to be seen whether this new version of the series will address Magaworld’s assault on Black education. It wouldn’t be the same show if it didn’t. “The issues we were dealing with then,” said the series co-star Dawnn Lewis, “we’re still dealing with in some shape or form today.”\n\nHillmanTok roll call: five to follow\n\n @amfamstudies Clip highlights from North Carolina A&T’s Leah Barlow from her actual African American studies course.\n\n @toureshow The music journalist offers a deep rewind on the prehistory of hip-hop.\n\n @dr.clo.flo The University of Oklahoma education studies professor Christy Oxendine unpacks the history of US education.\n\n @drdre4000 The Holy Cross chemistry professor Andre Isaacs puts the fun in functional groups.\n\n @iamalawyerinreallife The Atlanta defense attorney Danielle Obiorah shows civil servants how to protect themselves against Doge cuts in Federal Employee Rights 101.","summary":"A riff on the university setting of A Different World, the world’s first crowd-sourced HBCU is expanding online\n\nIn 1987, the Cosby Show spinoff A Different World made its US TV debut and followed the elder child, Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet), as she studied at her parents’ alma mater. The fictional historically Black college (or HBCU), Hillman, would go on to become a byword for Black excellence. “The influence of kids wanting to go to school, period, I think is very powerful,” one of the stars of the series, Jasmine Guy, said while touring HBCU campuses with her former castmates in 2024, 35 years after the sitcom ended. “Because they could see themselves there.”\n\nHillman College is credited with driving record levels of enrollment at actual HBCUs in the 1980s and 90s, and remains a source of inspiration for Black creatives to this day.

Build it higher instead.\n\nThe soapbox expression is rooted in Chicago, the city where Abraham Lincoln was nominated to run for president, Barack Obama held a 2008 victory celebration and Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe current “Hands Off” movement may be the latest public pushback, but Chicago parks have a storied history of free speech and protest. The most famous incident came during the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention when Grant Park hosted contentious demonstrations against war, racism and the imperial presidency of Richard Nixon. The fierce protests were the voice for resistance, reason and change. Television cameras caught protesters, police reaction and overreaction and eventually the Chicago Seven trial, which included such notables as Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Tom Hayden.\n\nPublic libraries, media, schools, and community parks are vital to preserving the power of the people, especially these days when even the Smithsonian is under assault. The 1968 riots were essential, but the first time our public parks made a difference was a century ago at a storied Chicago park that has a longer, equally profound and decidedly charming contribution to free expression and dissent: Washington Square Park.\n\nWith the Trump administration openly declaring war on our national parks, museums, libraries, free press, lawyers, Canada and even Chicago, the importance of all our community venues, especially the city’s very first public park, is heightened. Washington Square Park got its start in 1842 when James Fitch, Orasmua Bushnell, and Charles Butler of the American Land Company donated three acres of land at 901 N. Clark St., just a few blocks west of Michigan Avenue. The space soon attracted numerous free thinkers, poets, anarchists and crackpots who tackled labor, women’s rights, Communism, the flat earth and other pressing or fringe topics. It often drew crowds of 2,000 or more, and by the early 1900s it had acquired the unofficial, now politically dubious moniker, Bughouse Square, harkening to its often vocal, quirky patrons who gave speeches, rants, lectures and sermons, often on top of soapboxes.\n\nDuring these years, Chicago was also teeming with journalists, thinkers and influential authors. In 1900, there were nine general circulation newspapers competing for readers.\n\nThe era produced Pulitzer Prize-winners Carl Sandburg and muckraker Upton Sinclair who wrote “The Jungle” after researching the city’s ruthless meatpacking industry; and prolific screenwriter Ben Hecht, who began at the Chicago Daily News and co-wrote “The Front Page,” a classic, comical account of the early Chicago criminal courts newsroom that opened in Times Square in 1928.\n\nAs Washington Square Park became one of the most celebrated outdoor free speech venues in America, it may have gotten a fortuitous lift from, of all people, baseball icon William Wrigley Jr., who made a fortune selling boxes of soap before his successful foray into chewing gum and baseball. Some of those boxes may have become early podiums for local speechmakers, reinforcing Chicago’s “soapbox” traditions. Literally. \n\nToday Washington Square Park is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The ashes of Chicago’s literary great Studs Terkel are buried there. And up until a few years ago, it was also the site of the Newberry Library’s annual Bughouse Square Debates that celebrated the park’s freewheeling legacy.\n\nFrom book bans, to cancel culture to the arrests of pro-Palestinian activists, the First Amendment is under attack. Even so, free expression, for now, is still hanging by a welcome thread evidenced by the millions of Hands Off protesters. So far, the courts, the press and even the U.S. Senate have held up, albeit sometimes barely. Those who would deny free expression, free enterprise and even a secure ballot box, know little of the groundbreaking cranks, free thinkers and soapbox lecturers who came long before them. \n\nVisitors and naysayers alike would do well to stroll west of the Magnificent Mile to experience the legacy of our real and metaphorical soapboxes in the little park that roared for so long, so peacefully, and in the best traditions of American discourse.\n\nEldon Ham is a faculty member at IIT/Chicago-Kent College of Law, teaching sports law and justice.

Except, Maybe, for the Most Unlikely One of All.","text":"Janet Simmelink—69, retired, and like many people in her milieu, visibly agitated—recently lingered on the outskirts of Denver’s Civic Center Park on a colorless evening, politely tolerating my questions. She told me she’d never particularly liked the man she’d now come to hear speak—the man a stunning 34,000 people had come to hear, in fact, in a desperate bid to address Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic transformation of America. To do something that the Democratic Party, which she had long supported, was clearly failing to do.\n\nShe didn’t support the man in 2016, when he first became a breakout who, however fleetingly, seemed like he had a long-shot chance to transform America himself. She also didn’t support him in 2020, when he tried again. So I asked Simmelink if the version of herself 10 years ago would be surprised to find her at a Bernie Sanders rally.\n\n“Quite surprised.”\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10?\n\n“A 9,” she laughed.\n\nSimmelink described herself as a pragmatist—she didn’t back Sanders in those primaries because, in her words, “he wasn’t that effective as a senator.” What changed? It’s simple: In the new era of Trump, Simmelink feels like she no longer has a choice: “He’s the crotchety old guy,” she said. “He’s the only one willing to do something.”\n\nFor three months now, Sanders has been headlining his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, a series of campaign-style political rallies headlined by the senator and his protégé, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The two politicians wrapped up a suite of dates in the Midwest in February, and in late March, took on a crammed Southwest itinerary. The tour aims to galvanize the wounded Democratic base. By the time I touched down in Denver to see them for myself, they had already received an audience of 11,000 in the municipality of Greeley, 60 miles north. Now, a far bigger crowd awaited.\n\nThe 34,000 people who came to see Sanders speak that night weren’t just the largest congregation Sanders has ever hosted. The gathering was among the city’s largest political events this century, second only to a Barack Obama rally in the summer of 2008. At the twilight of his career in public service, Sanders has become something he’s never been before: The lifelong independent has transformed into a genuine leader of the Democratic Party—one of its lonely ringleaders providing a political alternative in the face of Trump 2.0.\n\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt that the second Trump administration, and its association with a newly MAGAfied tech elite headlined by Elon Musk, has made Sanders’ convictions more legible, his fears more cogent, and, indeed, his appeal accessibly broad. Sanders’ enduring opposition to a takeover of the government by the ultrarich has been vindicated, in the worst possible way.\n\nThat’s probably why the Fighting Oligarchy tour is populated by loads of people who never pulled the lever for Sanders. In fact, they might outnumber those who did. Of those who RSVP’d to the tour, “at least half” aren’t members of the mammoth email bank the senator accumulated during his presidential bids, Sanders said. “I think some of them are Republicans, some of them may be conservative Democrats,” Sanders told reporters the morning after the Denver event. “But they’re all looking around and saying, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ”\n\nSanders is here to reassure them that they aren’t crazy—and that maybe he’s been the one with the answers all along.\n\nThey’re showing up for it in droves. According to a poll conducted by NBC, two-thirds of Democratic voters want the party to take the fight directly to the Republicans, rather than broker a pact with their colleagues across the aisle. They aren’t getting that from the nominal Democratic leadership in D.C. Sure, Cory Booker made Senate history last week with a new record for how long any American senator had stood on the chamber’s floor and spoken, clocking in at 25 hours and 5 minutes—a rare sign of life in the chamber. And some members of Congress joined the louder and louder protests that broke out across the country last weekend as Trump continued to sledgehammer nearly every corner of American life. But no one is quite pulling off what Sanders is. What I saw in Denver—and later in Arizona, a state that went to Trump by more than 5 points—suggested that the moment Sanders has long sought may be here.\n\nFor the length of his career in national politics, Bernie Sanders has been described as a thorn in the establishment’s side. That’s certainly how party leaders saw him when he secured more than 22 million votes across both of his bids for president. That translated to 43 percent of the primary share in 2016, and 26 percent in 2020. During the 2020 Nevada primary, in a state Kamala Harris lost last year, Sanders nearly beat out the numbers posted by Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar combined.\n\nThose metrics make him a very popular politician. And yet his rise helped create a schism between mainstream Democrats and progressives that’s at least in part to blame for thrusting the Democrats into their ongoing identity crisis and leaving the opening for Trump. No matter how close he got to the Oval Office, Sanders has long been understood to be fundamentally external to the party’s overarching project—for better or worse.\n\nSome of that divisiveness was self-inflicted. In 2016, when the country was first getting to know this senator from Vermont, he branded his campaign as a “political revolution,” promising a comprehensive remaking of the American social order by tugging the party further left than it’s ever gone before, with a platform centered on a sweeping redistribution of wealth. Sanders was running against two forces at once: an increasingly unhinged MAGA front, and the sclerotic Obama-era technocrats, themselves a political hierarchy that was about to go extinct, though nobody quite knew it yet. The approach accentuated his differences with neoliberal doctrines—socialized medicine, tax hikes on the rich, deep cuts to the Pentagon budget—and more importantly, it convinced his voters that the only way to effect lasting change within the Democrats was not through reconciliation but by defeating them. His ideas brought him incredibly loyal fans—but the way they championed his ideas also created some nasty intraparty debates that proved fatal when November rolled around.\n\nSome rivals, like Hillary Clinton, have never forgiven him for the consequences of that shake-up. And as anyone who lived through it can remember, one of the primary attributes of the rise of Sanders was the reality that so many of his champions never seemed especially interested in establishing a détente with other voters in the party—and more than that, they could be more annoying than convincing.\n\n“To the pragmatists out there … get this through your fucking head,” said prominent Bernie supporter Will Menaker shortly after the first election of Trump: “You must bend the knee to us. Not the other way around. You have been proven as failures, and your entire worldview has been discredited.” Sanders had his own spin on this notion. In 2020, he posted: “I’ve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can’t stop us.”\n\nThe establishment did, in fact, stop Sanders. Hardcore supporters of the senator chalk his defeat up to a perceived Democratic conspiracy. In the days before Super Tuesday, Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden, solidifying momentum around its chosen candidate, and he cruised to victory from there.\n\nBut even before that downfall, this combination of arrogance, intensity, and failure created the “Bernie Bro” pejorative. The term was first coined by journalist Robinson Meyer in a 2015 Atlantic essay, and it described a sweaty coterie of white men harboring a veiled exasperation for the Clinton-voting normies in their wake. “The Berniebro is someone you may only have encountered if you’re somewhat similar to him,” Meyer wrote. “White; well-educated; middle-class.” The term caught on, and later dispatches from the campaign trail assailed the perceived jingoism of male Bernie supporters more acutely. A reporter at Mashable called them a “sexist mob,” singling out two demented Facebook comments to make her point.\n\nExactly how white and male Bernie supporters are remains a point of contention, but the stereotype was sharpened by a renaissance in leftist alternative media, which bloomed into vibrancy shortly after the first Trump victory. The most successful was the podcast Chapo Trap House, founded by three Bernie backers who were notoriously unencumbered by the eggshells-walking purity promulgated by establishment Democrats. The show never sought an alliance with its cadres in the greater left-of-center field. Chapo’s oozing hatred for Clinton, specifically, was pungent—and at times, arguably verged on chauvinistic. “She never really cracked the glass ceiling,” joked Felix Biederman, one of the show’s hosts, in a quote circulated by a leering New York Times feature published when Sanders was inches away from the nomination. “She more like fell down the glass staircase.” Bernie supporters were largely portrayed as toxic men who hated Hillary, and little more than that.\n\nIf you remember the vicious primaries of 2016 and 2020, I can tell you it was almost otherworldly to witness all flavors of Democrats united under this charge on the 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour in Denver. College kids in T-shirts printed with elegiac silhouettes of firebombing revolutionaries shared breathing space with graying boomers in moldering Kamala merch. A grandmother in full suffragette cosplay posed for photos. A scraggly crust punk wore a jacket patched with an upside-down American flag. A woman with tears in her eyes showed me the frilly pink pussyhat she originally acquired in 2017. There was a time, not long ago, when these people belonged to rival factions, bifurcated by both politics and taste—the establishment and the radicals, the institutionalists and the militants, the Resistance Libs and the Bernie Bros, flaming each other online into eternity.\n\nBut in this confused juncture of history, whether they realize it or not, they’ve found common ground. It is the coalition Sanders always wanted: a cross-section of humanity who, regardless of how much theory they’ve read, have settled on an enemy.\n\n“A few years ago, when I used the word oligarchy, people didn’t know what I was talking about,” Sanders said in his speech, noting how at the inauguration, the president was flanked by three of the richest men on the planet. “They know what I’m talking about now.”\n\nWhen I look back at that Atlantic piece today, I can see it asks the exact wrong question at every turn. “The Berniebro seems to have taken Sanders’s rhetoric that America is trapped in a number of deep, unprecedented crises to heart,” Meyer wrote in 2015. “The Berniebro always writes with an urgent, anxious seriousness when discussing national politics.” This was one of the traits that made them so irritating. In retrospect, can you blame them?\n\nIronically, in 2025, the Democratic Party should be dying for anything resembling the Bernie Bros. Young men across racial lines have been unilaterally captured by the GOP. And in that sense, regarding a highly engaged contingency of progressives so flippantly was a humongous mistake. One of the enduring axioms of the Bernie movement is that when its creeds are explained on their virtues alone, anyone—no matter the retrograde views they might hold—can become amenable to the cause. The most illustrative example of this dynamic might be a clip from The Adam Friedland Show, where the socialist comedian and podcaster convinces Dave Portnoy, of Barstool Sports fame, to endorse Medicaid for All. But when the party moved past Sanders and prostrated itself on the Altar of Late-2010 Norms, it lost touch with that protean blob of unaligned masculinity.\n\nPerhaps Democrats piously believed that the party could survive without them. Unfortunately, the blob proved to be much larger, and more influential, than anyone realized. The Republicans swooped in, and the rest is history. Of the voters who supported Sanders in the 2016 election, as many as 12 percent of them eventually pulled the lever for Trump.\n\nThis is where I must admit that I was one of those careful liberals. I didn’t vote for Sanders in 2016, and was essentially undecided through the early months of 2020. Meanwhile, my friends—who were by then fully on board with Bernie—relished one of the only happy political moments of their lives as he blitzed through the early primaries. I have always shared the same big ideas and a similar lack of faith in the ossified Democratic aristocracy as Sanders, but I still could never get my arms fully around the senator.\n\nI’ve never been able to come up with a great answer for why that is the case. There was just something about the Sanders coalition that felt too prickly, too online, and too brusquely dude-ish, all beyond the pale for my priggish liberal sensibilities in the mid-2010s. For a project ostensibly built around empathy—one committed to the unifying catharsis of class solidarity—I found the loudest Bernie backers to be surprisingly spiteful to those who might have been personally moved by a different candidate, or who could not totally conceptualize what a radical change in the status quo might mean to them. It was as if they believed that they had already convinced everyone worth convincing, thus deeming a huge collection of American voters as counter to their revolution. That attitude left someone like me—many people like me, it turned out—standing on the sidelines. Ultimately, my suspicions of Berniedom were rooted in how it felt, rather than what it stood for. But now, in 2025, when the Sanders cause is more pressing than ever, I am willing to admit that I feel pretty stupid about that.\n\nIn Denver, I detected a similar attitude in Terri Landers, another 69-year-old, who was with her daughter, Morgan Wiener, under the shade of leafless branches near the rally. Neither of them have ever been die-hard Bernie people—until this precise moment.\n\n“I’ve started to get those texts from the Democrats again asking for money, and it’s like, ‘This is your job! What are you doing? We elected you to do something!’ ” Wiener said. “None of our elected representatives are doing anything. I mean, our governor supported RFK Jr.”\n\n“In hindsight,” Landers added, “Bernie was right. … And maybe this time, we need to pay attention.”\n\nThe crowd at Civic Center Park was full of people like Landers. This audience didn’t resemble the brawny, toxic Sanders cabal the media warned about for so long. There were more women than men, and as in many of the recent protests that have been rising around America, most of them skewed toward retirement age. Yes, the field was pockmarked with a smattering of alpha-wave Bernie Bros—the young, college-educated progressives who might get a little uppity online about their favorite Vermonter—but they, too, have largely shed the bitterness imbued by the previous campaign failures. “I’m here because Bernie is filling the space in the right way, and AOC is going to run for president in 2028,” said one twentysomething legal assistant, and a dude, who was especially thrilled to be interviewed.\n\nThe big tent is working this time around. Consider John, a red-in-the-face Englishman in a Broncos cap, who, despite being a naturalized citizen, refused to give me his last name out of fear of deportation. (I wasn’t sure if he was joking. I don’t think he knew either.) John described himself as someone who skews conservative. He was a fan of McCain, Romney, and the rest of the pre-crisis GOP. I’ve encountered never-Trump Republicans in the past, but I pointed out to him that by being at this rally, he was throwing his support behind a self-described socialist.\n\n“But it’s about the person. Bernie and AOC, they’re not corrupt,” he told me. “Bernie is rising to the top, in my eyes, because I’m seeing all this corruption that’s going on at the top of the Republican Party, all the robber barons. I relate to him more.”\n\nOddly, there is more vigor behind the eyes of a recent conservative convert than some of the longtime Sanders supporters I speak to at this rally, some of whom regard the festivities as evidence of a lost cause. “This should have been happening before the election. This should have been happening years ago,” said Corrie Van Horne, a therapist who counts herself as an early Bernie booster. She sat on the patchy grass and grasped at the sense of melancholy that pervades the Fighting Oligarchy tour. It’s easy to see where she’s coming from. The Sanders coalition has been freshly energized, but given the way so many of our fellow citizens are parading toward fascism, will it ever have another chance to thrive?\n\nGreg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who spoke on the Fighting Oligarchy tour, is more hopeful. He told me that the paralyzing risk-management that has infected the liberal mainstream for far too long might finally be ending. “The Democrats who didn’t vote for Bernie in 2016 or 2020 never questioned his moral leadership,” he told me. “Oftentimes, they were making a strategic choice.” He hopes that what has changed now is that American civic dynamics have shifted to the point where meaningful progressive legislation is both good policy and good politics. “It’s the only way the Democratic Party can survive and grow. That’s been Bernie’s pitch for a long time,” Casar said. “The problems he’s been describing have become so bad, and so publicly undeniable, that people who didn’t vote for him are going, ‘Damn, maybe he was right about all this.’ ”\n\nAnd for what it’s worth, in 2025, the Bernie movement has finally found a salient rallying cry—one that goes beyond policy ideas and scratches at a more elemental dissatisfaction stoked by liberals and leftists alike, no doubt one that was exacerbated this past summer as the party faced down the reality of its past-his-prime president who had failed to adequately account for his reduced abilities, and was seemingly enabled by his staff. Before the senator’s appearance, Ocasio-Cortez warmed up the crowd by rattling off all of her talking points: more affordable housing, more humane health care, the abolishment of Citizens United. But the biggest cheer of the night, by far, came when she aimed inward. “We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us,” said the congresswoman. A park full of constituents went wild.\n\nThe next morning, I’m in Arizona, planning to catch the final event on this leg of the Fighting Oligarchy tour. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are scheduled to speak at a high school football stadium at 11:30 a.m. It’s the octogenarian’s fifth event in three days, and he seems to be drooping a little in the desert heat. Sanders rolls up his sleeves to his elbows and rams through the exact same speech he’s given on every stop of the tour—providing material context for the roots of our discontent, urging the audience to keep up the fight, while never mincing words about just how far his vision is from the crucible of Washington.\n\n“The oligarchs have unlimited amounts of money. They own the media, they have tremendous power over the political process,” Sanders proclaims, his voice noticeably hoarser than it was yesterday. “So we need you involved in the process, every step of the way. At the end of the day, 99 percent is a hell of a bigger number than 1 percent.”\n\nIt leaves me with a sensation I rarely experience for political figures, especially ones with such a complicated history. Watching Bernie on stage—his face growing steadily pinker, with sheet-white hair pouring out from the baseball cap protecting his bald spot from the sun—it is impossible not to feel some grief for the man. Nobody in America would be more justified to rejoice in the pratfalling of the Democratic Party. If Sanders wished to spend the last few summers he has left on this earth relishing in schadenfreude while the country burns, I don’t think anyone could blame him. At 83, he is in all likelihood too old to try again for the White House in three years (though I suspect some people here would try to fight me if I said that out loud). And yet here he is, sloughing off yet another weekend for the cause—ignoring all evidence to the contrary that a better world is possible.\n\nSanders’ new profile in the early days of Trump 2.0 is clearly breaking through. On Wednesday, Anderson Cooper will host him at a prime-time town hall on CNN, at which he’ll answer questions from anxious Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike.\n\nLike the Denver rally, the 23,000 supporters in Tucson have exceeded expectations. Originally the event was scheduled for the school’s smaller basketball arena, but it was moved outside once the RSVPs came pouring in. The audience is of a similar makeup to what I’d found the day before—hardcore leftists and adrift liberals alike are bobbing around in the dark, hoping to uncover a path forward.\n\nA college kid has been waiting to vote for Sanders her whole life. A Gen Xer who is more skeptical of progressive causes, she is here because she’s “just really pissed off.” An older gentleman tells me that he has some issues with Sanders’ college-debt relief proposal, but currently has bigger fish to fry. A software developer adds that everyone in his office but him voted for Trump, and if the United States is going the way of the fascists, he at least wants his objections to be immortalized in the public record.\n\n“The Democratic Party is in shambles. They lost to a freaking Nazi party! And then they’re just like, ‘Good game everybody, we’ll get them next time,’ ” he says. “I guess I’m a reformed neoliberal dude.”\n\nOutside the gates—where the line winds around the block—someone is hawking bootleg “Bernie 2020” T-shirts. They are an exact replica of the merch Sanders sold during the campaign. The senator still thinks his movement can win. And at long last, he might be right.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/one-unlikely-sensation-given-rattled-094000158.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/._lPeaGaW2KOP_IhRt8Oxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ4MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/slate_773/33e84f4a703364d2c9fb39587776013c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 09:40:00","author":"Luke Winkie","authors":["Luke Winkie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":309302070,"title":"One Unlikely Sensation Has Given Rattled Americans Hope for Life After Trump. I Went to See It for Myself.","text":"Janet Simmelink—69, retired, and like many people in her milieu, visibly agitated—recently lingered on the outskirts of Denver’s Civic Center Park on a colorless evening, politely tolerating my questions. She told me she’d never particularly liked the man she’d now come to hear speak—the man a stunning 34,000 people had come to hear, in fact, in a desperate bid to address Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic transformation of America. To do something that the Democratic Party, which she had long supported, was clearly failing to do.\n\nShe didn’t support the man in 2016, when he first became a breakout who, however fleetingly, seemed like he had a long-shot chance to transform America himself. She also didn’t support him in 2020, when he tried again. So I asked Simmelink if the version of herself 10 years ago would be surprised to find her at a Bernie Sanders rally.\n\n“Quite surprised.”\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10?\n\n“A 9,” she laughed.\n\nSimmelink described herself as a pragmatist—she didn’t back Sanders in those primaries because, in her words, “he wasn’t that effective as a senator.” What changed? It’s simple: In the new era of Trump, Simmelink feels like she no longer has a choice: “He’s the crotchety old guy,” she said. “He’s the only one willing to do something.”\n\nFor three months now, Sanders has been headlining his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, a series of campaign-style political rallies headlined by the senator and his protégé, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The two politicians wrapped up a suite of dates in the Midwest in February, and in late March, took on a crammed Southwest itinerary. The tour aims to galvanize the wounded Democratic base. By the time I touched down in Denver to see them for myself, they had already received an audience of 11,000 in the municipality of Greeley, 60 miles north. Now, a far bigger crowd awaited.\n\nThe 34,000 people who came to see Sanders speak that night weren’t just the largest congregation Sanders has ever hosted. The gathering was among the city’s largest political events this century, second only to a Barack Obama rally in the summer of 2008. At the twilight of his career in public service, Sanders has become something he’s never been before: The lifelong independent has transformed into a genuine leader of the Democratic Party—one of its lonely ringleaders providing a political alternative in the face of Trump 2.0.\n\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt that the second Trump administration, and its association with a newly MAGAfied tech elite headlined by Elon Musk, has made Sanders’ convictions more legible, his fears more cogent, and, indeed, his appeal accessibly broad. Sanders’ enduring opposition to a takeover of the government by the ultrarich has been vindicated, in the worst possible way.\n\nThat’s probably why the Fighting Oligarchy tour is populated by loads of people who never pulled the lever for Sanders. In fact, they might outnumber those who did. Of those who RSVP’d to the tour, “at least half” aren’t members of the mammoth email bank the senator accumulated during his presidential bids, Sanders said. “I think some of them are Republicans, some of them may be conservative Democrats,” Sanders told reporters the morning after the Denver event. “But they’re all looking around and saying, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ”\n\nSanders is here to reassure them that they aren’t crazy—and that maybe he’s been the one with the answers all along.\n\nThey’re showing up for it in droves. According to a poll conducted by NBC, two-thirds of Democratic voters want the party to take the fight directly to the Republicans, rather than broker a pact with their colleagues across the aisle. They aren’t getting that from the nominal Democratic leadership in D.C. Sure, Cory Booker made Senate history last week with a new record for how long any American senator had stood on the chamber’s floor and spoken, clocking in at 25 hours and 5 minutes—a rare sign of life in the chamber. And some members of Congress joined the louder and louder protests that broke out across the country last weekend as Trump continued to sledgehammer nearly every corner of American life. But no one is quite pulling off what Sanders is. What I saw in Denver—and later in Arizona, a state that went to Trump by more than 5 points—suggested that the moment Sanders has long sought may be here.\n\nFor the length of his career in national politics, Bernie Sanders has been described as a thorn in the establishment’s side. That’s certainly how party leaders saw him when he secured more than 22 million votes across both of his bids for president. That translated to 43 percent of the primary share in 2016, and 26 percent in 2020. During the 2020 Nevada primary, in a state Kamala Harris lost last year, Sanders nearly beat out the numbers posted by Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar combined.\n\nThose metrics make him a very popular politician. And yet his rise helped create a schism between mainstream Democrats and progressives that’s at least in part to blame for thrusting the Democrats into their ongoing identity crisis and leaving the opening for Trump. No matter how close he got to the Oval Office, Sanders has long been understood to be fundamentally external to the party’s overarching project—for better or worse.\n\nSome of that divisiveness was self-inflicted. In 2016, when the country was first getting to know this senator from Vermont, he branded his campaign as a “political revolution,” promising a comprehensive remaking of the American social order by tugging the party further left than it’s ever gone before, with a platform centered on a sweeping redistribution of wealth. Sanders was running against two forces at once: an increasingly unhinged MAGA front, and the sclerotic Obama-era technocrats, themselves a political hierarchy that was about to go extinct, though nobody quite knew it yet. The approach accentuated his differences with neoliberal doctrines—socialized medicine, tax hikes on the rich, deep cuts to the Pentagon budget—and more importantly, it convinced his voters that the only way to effect lasting change within the Democrats was not through reconciliation but by defeating them. His ideas brought him incredibly loyal fans—but the way they championed his ideas also created some nasty intraparty debates that proved fatal when November rolled around.\n\nSome rivals, like Hillary Clinton, have never forgiven him for the consequences of that shake-up. And as anyone who lived through it can remember, one of the primary attributes of the rise of Sanders was the reality that so many of his champions never seemed especially interested in establishing a détente with other voters in the party—and more than that, they could be more annoying than convincing.\n\n“To the pragmatists out there … get this through your fucking head,” said prominent Bernie supporter Will Menaker shortly after the first election of Trump: “You must bend the knee to us. Not the other way around. You have been proven as failures, and your entire worldview has been discredited.” Sanders had his own spin on this notion. In 2020, he posted: “I’ve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can’t stop us.”\n\nThe establishment did, in fact, stop Sanders. Hardcore supporters of the senator chalk his defeat up to a perceived Democratic conspiracy. In the days before Super Tuesday, Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden, solidifying momentum around its chosen candidate, and he cruised to victory from there.\n\nBut even before that downfall, this combination of arrogance, intensity, and failure created the “Bernie Bro” pejorative. The term was first coined by journalist Robinson Meyer in a 2015 Atlantic essay, and it described a sweaty coterie of white men harboring a veiled exasperation for the Clinton-voting normies in their wake. “The Berniebro is someone you may only have encountered if you’re somewhat similar to him,” Meyer wrote. “White; well-educated; middle-class.” The term caught on, and later dispatches from the campaign trail assailed the perceived jingoism of male Bernie supporters more acutely. A reporter at Mashable called them a “sexist mob,” singling out two demented Facebook comments to make her point.\n\nExactly how white and male Bernie supporters are remains a point of contention, but the stereotype was sharpened by a renaissance in leftist alternative media, which bloomed into vibrancy shortly after the first Trump victory. The most successful was the podcast Chapo Trap House, founded by three Bernie backers who were notoriously unencumbered by the eggshells-walking purity promulgated by establishment Democrats. The show never sought an alliance with its cadres in the greater left-of-center field. Chapo’s oozing hatred for Clinton, specifically, was pungent—and at times, arguably verged on chauvinistic. “She never really cracked the glass ceiling,” joked Felix Biederman, one of the show’s hosts, in a quote circulated by a leering New York Times feature published when Sanders was inches away from the nomination. “She more like fell down the glass staircase.” Bernie supporters were largely portrayed as toxic men who hated Hillary, and little more than that.\n\nIf you remember the vicious primaries of 2016 and 2020, I can tell you it was almost otherworldly to witness all flavors of Democrats united under this charge on the 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour in Denver. College kids in T-shirts printed with elegiac silhouettes of firebombing revolutionaries shared breathing space with graying boomers in moldering Kamala merch. A grandmother in full suffragette cosplay posed for photos. A scraggly crust punk wore a jacket patched with an upside-down American flag. A woman with tears in her eyes showed me the frilly pink pussyhat she originally acquired in 2017. There was a time, not long ago, when these people belonged to rival factions, bifurcated by both politics and taste—the establishment and the radicals, the institutionalists and the militants, the Resistance Libs and the Bernie Bros, flaming each other online into eternity.\n\nBut in this confused juncture of history, whether they realize it or not, they’ve found common ground. It is the coalition Sanders always wanted: a cross-section of humanity who, regardless of how much theory they’ve read, have settled on an enemy.\n\n“A few years ago, when I used the word oligarchy, people didn’t know what I was talking about,” Sanders said in his speech, noting how at the inauguration, the president was flanked by three of the richest men on the planet. “They know what I’m talking about now.”\n\nWhen I look back at that Atlantic piece today, I can see it asks the exact wrong question at every turn. “The Berniebro seems to have taken Sanders’s rhetoric that America is trapped in a number of deep, unprecedented crises to heart,” Meyer wrote in 2015. “The Berniebro always writes with an urgent, anxious seriousness when discussing national politics.” This was one of the traits that made them so irritating. In retrospect, can you blame them?\n\nIronically, in 2025, the Democratic Party should be dying for anything resembling the Bernie Bros. Young men across racial lines have been unilaterally captured by the GOP. And in that sense, regarding a highly engaged contingency of progressives so flippantly was a humongous mistake. One of the enduring axioms of the Bernie movement is that when its creeds are explained on their virtues alone, anyone—no matter the retrograde views they might hold—can become amenable to the cause. The most illustrative example of this dynamic might be a clip from The Adam Friedland Show, where the socialist comedian and podcaster convinces Dave Portnoy, of Barstool Sports fame, to endorse Medicaid for All. But when the party moved past Sanders and prostrated itself on the Altar of Late-2010 Norms, it lost touch with that protean blob of unaligned masculinity.\n\nPerhaps Democrats piously believed that the party could survive without them. Unfortunately, the blob proved to be much larger, and more influential, than anyone realized. The Republicans swooped in, and the rest is history. Of the voters who supported Sanders in the 2016 election, as many as 12 percent of them eventually pulled the lever for Trump.\n\nThis is where I must admit that I was one of those careful liberals. I didn’t vote for Sanders in 2016, and was essentially undecided through the early months of 2020. Meanwhile, my friends—who were by then fully on board with Bernie—relished one of the only happy political moments of their lives as he blitzed through the early primaries. I have always shared the same big ideas and a similar lack of faith in the ossified Democratic aristocracy as Sanders, but I still could never get my arms fully around the senator.\n\nI’ve never been able to come up with a great answer for why that is the case. There was just something about the Sanders coalition that felt too prickly, too online, and too brusquely dude-ish, all beyond the pale for my priggish liberal sensibilities in the mid-2010s. For a project ostensibly built around empathy—one committed to the unifying catharsis of class solidarity—I found the loudest Bernie backers to be surprisingly spiteful to those who might have been personally moved by a different candidate, or who could not totally conceptualize what a radical change in the status quo might mean to them. It was as if they believed that they had already convinced everyone worth convincing, thus deeming a huge collection of American voters as counter to their revolution. That attitude left someone like me—many people like me, it turned out—standing on the sidelines. Ultimately, my suspicions of Berniedom were rooted in how it felt, rather than what it stood for. But now, in 2025, when the Sanders cause is more pressing than ever, I am willing to admit that I feel pretty stupid about that.\n\nIn Denver, I detected a similar attitude in Terri Landers, another 69-year-old, who was with her daughter, Morgan Wiener, under the shade of leafless branches near the rally. Neither of them have ever been die-hard Bernie people—until this precise moment.\n\n“I’ve started to get those texts from the Democrats again asking for money, and it’s like, ‘This is your job! What are you doing? We elected you to do something!’ ” Wiener said. “None of our elected representatives are doing anything. I mean, our governor supported RFK Jr.”\n\n“In hindsight,” Landers added, “Bernie was right. … And maybe this time, we need to pay attention.”\n\nThe crowd at Civic Center Park was full of people like Landers. This audience didn’t resemble the brawny, toxic Sanders cabal the media warned about for so long. There were more women than men, and as in many of the recent protests that have been rising around America, most of them skewed toward retirement age. Yes, the field was pockmarked with a smattering of alpha-wave Bernie Bros—the young, college-educated progressives who might get a little uppity online about their favorite Vermonter—but they, too, have largely shed the bitterness imbued by the previous campaign failures. “I’m here because Bernie is filling the space in the right way, and AOC is going to run for president in 2028,” said one twentysomething legal assistant, and a dude, who was especially thrilled to be interviewed.\n\nThe big tent is working this time around. Consider John, a red-in-the-face Englishman in a Broncos cap, who, despite being a naturalized citizen, refused to give me his last name out of fear of deportation. (I wasn’t sure if he was joking. I don’t think he knew either.) John described himself as someone who skews conservative. He was a fan of McCain, Romney, and the rest of the pre-crisis GOP. I’ve encountered never-Trump Republicans in the past, but I pointed out to him that by being at this rally, he was throwing his support behind a self-described socialist.\n\n“But it’s about the person. Bernie and AOC, they’re not corrupt,” he told me. “Bernie is rising to the top, in my eyes, because I’m seeing all this corruption that’s going on at the top of the Republican Party, all the robber barons. I relate to him more.”\n\nOddly, there is more vigor behind the eyes of a recent conservative convert than some of the longtime Sanders supporters I speak to at this rally, some of whom regard the festivities as evidence of a lost cause. “This should have been happening before the election. This should have been happening years ago,” said Corrie Van Horne, a therapist who counts herself as an early Bernie booster.

Though some estimates from February predicted the film to make upwards of $85 million domestically in its opening weekend, \"Snow White\" opened in the U.S. and Canada to only $43 million in ticket sales. It then suffered a 66% drop at the box office in its second weekend. This past weekend, the new \"A Minecraft Movie\" opened with $163 million, while \"Snow White\" made just $6 million. In Peter's opinion, star Rachel Zegler is largely to blame for the movie's collapse. In the months leading up to the \"Snow White\" premiere, Zegler's outspoken politics gave her and the upcoming movie some unwanted attention. She posted the message, \"Free Palestine,\" on X, and in another post on Instagram she wished that Donald Trump supporters \"never know peace.\" She would later apologize for the latter comment, but not before some damage had already been done. ‘SNOW WHITE’ STAR RACHEL ZEGLER APOLOGIZES FOR PROFANE POST WISHING TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘HAVE NO PEACE’ \"I know people try to argue that like Gal Gadot and, you know, the other people were part of the criticism, but I feel like Rachel Zegler was very much at the center of it,\" Peter told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. \"She was very polarizing. She told people, you know, if they didn't vote for Kamala Harris, she didn't want their support. And I think they heard that message loud and clear. And so they didn't want to come and support her.\" \"And I think what, you know, somebody like Rachel Zegler, and I know she's young, but I think what she fails to realize is it's like, even if she does want to polarize her audience and there's a fraction of the community that she doesn't want supporting her, those are still people that have kids and their families, and they're going to want to take their kids to be part of the magic that is Disney,\" he continued. \"And I feel like she definitely lost that message and turned a lot of people off.\" \"I mean, the fact that she attached the promo of the trailer for Snow White with her free Palestine comment, Disney very much doesn't like to get political at all,\" he added. \"They want to make sure that the magic of Disney is a welcoming community for everyone. So, I mean, I know a lot of people want to give her a pass, but I think a big part of why the movie bombed was because she's the face of the film.\" SON OF ‘SNOW WHITE’ PRODUCER CRITICIZES ‘IMMATURE’ RACHEL ZEGLER FOR HURTING FILM Peter suggested though that Disney was partly at fault for not \"training\" Zegler enough for her press tour. \"And maybe that's Disney's part. Disney's failure to not prepare her for, you know, media training enough, but I just feel like at some point we need to hold her accountable to, like, at least understand how, if you're going to want to pursue a career in Hollywood, and you're going to want to attach yourself to a big brand like Disney, you're going to kind of have to play by their rules if they're paying you millions of dollars to be part of this film.\" Jonah Platt, son of \"Snow White\" producer Marc Platt, claimed in a now-deleted Instagram comment that his dad was forced to take time away from his family to deal with the Zegler fallout. \"Yeah, my dad, the producer of [an] enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to fly across the country to reprimand his 20-year-old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for,\" he wrote. FIVE CONTROVERSIES THAT ROCKED DISNEY'S ‘SNOW WHITE’ REMAKE BEFORE ITS RELEASE Peter regretted that Disney, as of late, appeared to be straying from the classic love story formula.

But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party. In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools. Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices. “Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning. “Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said. Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues. “The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024. “We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.” Trusting Trump Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for. “I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina. Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them. “This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican. “There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.” Some criticize Trump’s moves But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.) “I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.” David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country. But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support. “I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added. Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement. “It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.” Seeing a potential exit strategy Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020. “Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued. Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children. “I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.” “I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.” Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.” Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long. “If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.” And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions. David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign. “And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said. Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” “Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him. Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election. “I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said.","summary":"As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-voters-are-prepared-trust-tariffs-are-signs-cracks-coalition-rcna200095","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250407-donald-trump-tariff-poster-ew-356p-ce9475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 09:00:00","author":"Alexandra Marquez,Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman,Shannon Pettypiece","authors":["Alexandra Marquez","Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman","Shannon Pettypiece"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":309245158,"title":"Pierre Poilievre is boasting about his rallies. But does size indicate success?","text":"At a news conference in Edmonton on Tuesday, it was Pierre Poilievre who decided to ask the media a couple questions, specifically about the size of the crowd at his rally in the city the night before.\n\nBefore a Globe and Mail reporter was able to ask her question — whether the size of his rallies matter — Poilievre was inquiring to her how she liked his campaign event.\n\nHe has asked reporters this question before, at other events that have drawn thousands of people. \n\nThis time, in reference to the Edmonton event which the campaign said may have drawn around 15,000 people, the Conservative leader also asked when was the last time Canada had a rally that big.\n\n\"I think to have 10 to 15,000 people at one political rally, this is a movement like we've never seen because people want change,\" Poilievre said. \"They want to put our country first for a change.\"\n\nPoilievre's comments about his rallies, it seems, are to indicate his campaign's momentum, despite polling that shows the Conservatives trailing the Liberals.\n\n'Not a good measure of political support': Analyst\n\nBut the size of a political rally may not be indicative of wide-scale support or predictive of electoral success, some analysts say.\n\n\"Crowd sizes are not a good measure of political support,\" said Nathaniel Rakich, the former senior elections analyst with the now-defunct political analysis website FiveThirtyEight.\n\nPolls, Rakich said, really are the best indicator of how a campaign is faring.\n\n\"Polls are scientific. They take a representative sample of the population and measure support among that. Crowd sizes are not scientific,\" he said.\n\nRakich said there is some recent data that calls into question the value of crowd sizes as a measure of candidate support.\n\nThe Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC), a joint project of Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut, collected data on U.S. political crowds. It compared the average size of the crowds at rallies featuring then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite his boasts to the contrary, Trump's crowds were actually much smaller than Harris's, according to CCC. Although Harris had a much shorter time to campaign, CCC looked at the size of six of her rallies, which it said ranged from 10,000 to 15,000, for an average size of about 13,400.\n\n For Trump, who had been campaigning longer than Harris, the CCC looked at the crowd sizes of 28 of his rallies. His average crowd size was about 5,600.\n\nYet despite the smaller crowd sizes, Trump won.\n\nRakich said Harris's numbers could have been attributed to people just wanting to learn about the unknown candidate. And he said there may have been an urban-rural divide, where Harris's rallies tended to be in cities able to draw larger crowds.\n\n\"If you've never been on a national campaign, it's easy to believe that crowd size at a rally has any influence over anything,\" Ian Brodie, who was chief of staff to former prime minister Stephen Harper, recently tweeted in response to a comment about Poilievre's crowds.\n\nMeanwhile, political columnist Chantal Hébert pointed out on X that as far back as 1979, Pierre Trudeau spoke to around 20,000 people at a rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, just a few weeks before his Liberals would lose to Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives.\n\nRakich said it's certainly not bad to have big crowds; they can create good media narratives and fundraising opportunities.\n\n\"But the point is, it's not determinative. If you have someone who's leading by 10 points in the polls, it would be a huge upset for that candidate to lose because the polls are scientific and polls don't miss by that much,\" he said.\n\n\"It wouldn't be unusual for the candidate with the bigger crowd sizes to lose.\"\n\nPeople who don't attend rallies 'end up deciding elections'\n\nÉric Grenier, a polls and elections analyst who writes The Writ newsletter and runs CBC's Poll Tracker, said Conservative crowd sizes do show the organization's strength and skills, and that Poilievre's base is motivated and enthusiastic.\n\n\"That's about it,\" he said. \"It's the people that don't attend rallies who end up deciding elections.\"\n\nGrenier said adding up all the people at Poilievre's campaign rallies would amount to about one per cent of everybody who is going to vote for the Conservatives.\n\n\"The fact that one per cent of Conservative voters will go to the rallies and 0.5 per cent will go to Liberal rallies doesn't really say that much to me,\" he said.\n\nPoilievre's leadership race showed he could excite a big swath of people and get them to go to these events, Grenier said.\n\n\"It's not clear that those are people that are swing voters,\" he said. \"They're people who are enthused to vote for Pierre Poilievre.\"\n\nAs for the Liberals, Grenier said it's not clear whether their campaign is putting in the logistical effort to attract thousands of people to their rallies.\n\n\"[In] part because they might not be able to do it. But they also might not be trying,\" he said.\n\n\"These are not just organic things where Pierre Poilievre is showing up in a field and people are just migrating there.\"","summary":"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been boasting about the size of his political rallies.

They normalise things. And I thought, this is a fun popcorn movie – but it’s also going to help normalise something.’\n\nRiggen praises the UK – which is represented in G20 by Douglas Hodge’s reluctant ally, Prime Minister Oliver Everett – for having ‘normalised its powerful women centuries ago’.\n\nComment nowWhich is your favourite action film?Comment Now\n\n‘But that’s not the case in other countries, for instance, in the United States. So let’s put them in movies, let’s help people see them like a normal thing, and then we’ll get a woman elected one of these days.’\n\nThe Mexican filmmaker, who is known for her work on TV shows including Jack Ryan, as well as Disney Channel movie Lemonade Mouth and 2016 Jennifer Garner drama Miracles from Heaven, also notes that she signed up for G20 ‘years ago [and] it has nothing to do with the political situation of the present moment’.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBut it is striking that, had the US election gone the other way, America would currently be governed by its first female president, former VP Kamala Harris, who also identifies as South Asian American and Black.\n\nHow Viola Davis got fit to play an action hero\n\nOn the poster for G20, Davis’s toned biceps are front and centre, with her taking the traditional pose of the determined action hero at the centre, holding a gun.\n\nAs well as Riggen herself being a fan of Davis’s ‘inspirational’ arms (‘I feel that Viola’s arms should become a trend – they really are outstanding!’), it was deliberate that she was positioned as the traditional, and legitimate, action star – in the mould of a Dwayne Johnson or a Will Smith or a Tom Cruise – every step of the way.\n\n‘Any action hero in a movie does a lot of things: they have to be super-fit, they have to handle weapons, they have to be able to fight. And Viola already had the experience of The Woman King, so she was coming in, very fit, very muscular,’ Riggen explains.\n\n Davis took on additional weapons training for the role, where she plays the traditional action hero (Picture: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime)\n\n G20 also sees the Oscar-winner’s character balance family life (pictured with Anthony Anderson, who plays First Gentleman, Derek Sutton) in a story running alongside the budget-busting action scenes (Picture: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime)\n\nFor Fences and Widows actress Davis, the training for G20 was weapons-based, ‘knives and pans, anything that we could get our hands on in this hotel for her to fight [with]’ because Riggen’s priority was also that it felt real.\n\n‘I like movies in which I believe what I see. I don’t believe it, I’m not engaged in the movie,’ the director states. ‘And I feel Viola is absolutely believable, that she can take any of these guys, so [that’s] a testament to her.’\n\nPutting a female stamp on action with G20\n\nRiggen also knows that her partnership with Davis as a producer on G20, and two women being in charge of the movie, fundamentally changed it – ‘because we get all the toys and all the tools and all the budget to do a big action [movie] but at the same time, we also care about story and characters’.\n\nAnd Riggen is coming at this as big fan – and consumer – of the action genre.\n\n‘Sometimes action movies have a lot of action, but I don’t really care about them. In fact, you use the fight or the chase to go and get some food in the in the kitchen instead, and then it’s like, “Call me when it’s over so I can follow the story again”,’ she points out.\n\n Director Patricia Riggen (pictured) wants to ‘normalise’ things such as a Black female US president with G20 (Picture: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime)\n\n ‘Sometimes action movies have a lot of action, but I don’t really care about them.’ (Picture: Phillip Graybill)\n\n‘In this case, both Viola and I really wanted to still have a powerful story with really strong characters and moments, so that the female audience would also be engaged in the movie – and I think we accomplished it.’\n\nWorking with married couple Davis and Tennon – who pops up onscreen too in G20 as CIA Director Mikkelson – was a dream collaboration for Riggen ‘because then we’re all fighting for the same things’.\n\nIt was also a huge positive to have Davis as the star and producer with her accumulated power in terms of unlocking budget and advocating for important – if costly – parts of G20.\n\n‘In a movie, it’s a push and pull. For us, for me, it’s all about doing the most I can, basically spending the most I can, because you want the best action scene, you want the most time, you want everything. And the studio’s job is to limit and keep the movie on budget,’ says Riggen.\n\n Riggen worked alongside Davis, who was also producer on the film, and know that two women being in charge changed the film (Picture: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime)\n\nIdentifying preserving the bombastic action scenes as where she, Davis and Tennon put up the ‘biggest fight’, Riggen recalls: ‘It was like, we must have the Beast – the presidential car – we must have it flipped, we want to have a missile to destroy it.’\n\nThere’s also a dramatic helicopter scene at G20’s thrilling climax that the filmmaker mentions too as a vital element of the movie.\n\n‘Some things are very important for the quality of the movie, so if you have your star fighting with you and having the authority to protect the movie, that’s a really wonderful thing.

Tariffs of 20 percent have been placed on goods from the European Union, which has yet to announce any retaliatory measures but is expected to do so later in the day on Wednesday.\n\nKL notes that this will plunge the world economy into a level of economic isolationism not seen since the Great Depression and mark the end of globalisation.\n\nThe business outlet claims that smaller, export-driven countries like Finland are in a particularly difficult position.\n\nOne of the economies that relies heavily on international trade is Singapore, which has a population roughly the size of Finland.\n\nSingapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that it's not enough to just sit back and hope for the best, but to prepare for difficult times and new shocks.

It's scary,\" Shriner told HS.\n\nNeither Shriner nor his wife Stacie Linek had been abroad before landing at Helsinki Airport.\n\n\"I have never been happy with any president in my entire life. [Barack] Obama was the best, but even he promised more than he delivered. It seems like presidents and politicians only care about their own well-being,\" said the 41-year-old Shriner.\n\nAs soon as Democrat Kamala Harris' loss in the US presidential election was confirmed, so was Shriner's decision to accept a job offer from Finland.\n\nHe was working in Detroit as an IT consultant and received an offer in the same field from a Finnish firm.\n\nThe move was also a good fit for his wife. Linek works for the international art auction house Sotheby's, HS writes, and is able to work in Helsinki as a subcontractor for the company.\n\nShriner said that the US is plagued by many things: excessive materialism, authoritarianism, the socio-economic situation and immigration policy.\n\n\"We will never go back to the US,\" he told HS.\n\nShriner and his acquaintances were horrified to follow a presidential campaign website, project2025.org, which listed the things that would change with Trump.\n\nThe couple now live in Katajanokka and do not miss their home in the United States.\n\n\"I enjoy Helsinki. There are parks and nature nearby, you can walk to places, unlike in Detroit, where you have to drive everywhere,\" Shriner said.\n\nBefore moving to Finland, the couple knew little about Finland.\n\n\"The forest, lakes, rally and computers. It all sounded good,\" Shriner told HS.\n\nThe couple had been intimidated by Finland's cold winters and high taxes, but the winters are familiar to Michigan residents and the taxes were a pleasant surprise.\n\n\"Here, after expenses, you end up with more money than in the US. Society in Finland offers so much; public transport, infrastructure, healthcare, for example.

My goal is to learn the language better so I can say it in Finnish.\"\n\nFinnish defence spending increase a White House win\n\nMeanwhile, tabloid Iltalehti notes that the White House included Finland in its weekly list of \"wins\" under Donald Trump’s administration, though its claim appears to stretch the truth.\n\nIn the update for week 11, the White House stated that Trump continued to promote \"peace through strength\" around the world, citing a pledge from Finland to increase its defence spending to three percent of GDP.\n\nTo support the claim, the White House links to a Wall Street Journal article reporting Finland’s aim to raise defence spending to at least three percent of GDP by 2029.\n\nThe announcement from the Finnish government came just three days after President Alexander Stubb visited Trump in Florida at the end of last month.\n\nHowever, the article makes no mention of Trump receiving a pledge from Finland, nor does it credit the former president with influencing the decision.\n\nInstead, it quotes Stubb as saying the move reflects changes in Finland’s security environment. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) has also emphasised that the spending increase is driven by Finland’s own defence needs.\n\n this link here","summary":"The impact of US President Donald Trump's policies dominates Finnish newspaper headlines on Wednesday morning.","url":"https://yle.fi/a/74-20154825?origin=rss","image":"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_156,w_5120,h_2880/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1743664181/39-144529367ee33f24aa1f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 06:17:39","author":"Matthew Schilke","authors":["Matthew Schilke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":309320210,"title":"Column: Cory Booker's Blab-a-Thon Underlines 'Fact Checker' TILT","text":"On April 7, Facebook pulled the plug on the censorship of “independent fact checkers,” replacing it with a “Community Notes” approach, like Elon Musk’s X uses.

It builds evidence-based records that can withstand political pressures.”\n\nFact check? False. Poynter’s PolitiFact routinely demonstrates that its so-called “line on reality” is a party line. It doesn’t “withstand political pressures.” It’s a political pressure group seeking to damage Republicans.\n\n The latest glowing exhibit is Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). In his “historic” 25-hour speech on the Senate floor in protest of President Trump, PolitiFact plucked out one innocuous claim and ruled it “True.” Booker said, \"The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.\" It’s true. The Conference Board measurement has dropped since Trump won.\n\nBut what about the other 25 hours of statements? Were they entirely factual? Don’t count on PolitiFact for a ruling, because they are in the tank for Cory Booker. He’s received five “True” ratings in a row dating back to 2019.\n\n In 2020, they gave him a “True” for stating the Senate is \"dominated by millionaires\" and that he is \"not one of them.\" In 2019, he was ruled “True” for claiming \"In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined.\"\n\nIsn’t it obvious that Booker bumbled – that marijuana possession is not a violent crime?\n\nOverall, PolitiFact has granted Booker 22 ratings as “True” or “Mostly True” (11 of each), and just eight that were “Mostly False” or “False.” There are zero “Pants on Fire” ratings. So he’s in the “green zone” 64.7 percent of the time, and he’s Code Red just 23.5 percent of the time.\n\nCompare this to the page of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). He’s received 160 “fact checks” over the years, and only 31 of them are “True” or “Mostly True” (19.4 percent). He’s been flagged on the “False” side 107 times (66.9 percent). That includes eleven “Pants On Fire” ratings. Notice these percentages are dramatically opposed to Booker’s, which demonstrates the political tilt of PolitiFact. \n\nIt's true for the Democrats as a whole. Three Democrat senators have one solitary “Pants On Fire” demerit in the PolitiFact archives: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Whip Dick Durbin, and Kirsten Gillibrand. No Senate Democrat has more than one. Every other Democrat senator has zero. That's right: Bernie Sanders has none. Elizabeth Warren has none. (Former senator Kamala Harris has none.)\n\nIn fact, 18 Democrat senators (if you include Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats) have absolutely no ratings anywhere on the False side of the meter. Seven have zero ratings whatsoever: Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Peter Welch of Vermont, as well as Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, and then rookies Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, and Andy Kim of New Jersey.\n\nAdd up all the Trues and Falses (excluding “Half True” ratings), and the Senate Democrat caucus has a “Truth-O-Meter” ratio of 330 to 165 (66.8 percent in the True lane). As a category, they’re the opposite of Ted Cruz.\n\nSo when Holan claimed only “politicians who want to create their own realities are fighting hard against fact-checking,” she was making the classic Stephen Colbert argument: Reality has a liberal bias. This is why most Americans don’t trust biased “fact checkers.”","summary":"On April 7, Facebook pulled the plug on the censorship of “independent fact checkers,” replacing it with a “Community Notes” approach, like Elon Musk’s X uses.

That would be a good one. I’d like that.’\n\nAn Overton Insights survey of 1,100 registered voters, however, claimed that he might not love it so much, as Obama leads the dream head-to-head 53 percent to 47 percent over Trump.\n\nObama notably would dominate Trump among moderate and independent voters, taking 59 percent of independents and 61 percent of moderates.\n\nTrump’s predecessor would also take 10 percent of his own 2024 voters, whereas he would only swipe 3 percent of Kamala Harris voters.\n\nThe current president added: ‘I know people are asking me to run and there is a whole story about running for a third term. I don’t know. I never looked into it. They do say there’s a way you can do it, but I don’t know about that.\n\n‘But I have not looked into it,’ he continued. \n\nRight now, no Constitutional law allows Trump or Obama to run again in 2028.\n\nJust three days into Trump’s second term, Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, sent out a proposal to amend the 22nd Amendment to open the door for a Trump third term. \n\nOgles’ Constitutional amendment would allow for Trump to run for a third term – but prohibit Obama from doing so, because the Democrat had already served two consecutive terms. \n\nThe other former two-term living presidents, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, also wouldn’t be eligible if this amendment was passed. \n\n‘No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive term,’ the text of the Ogles’ Amendment read. \n\nThere’s an incredibly high bar to pass a Constitutional amendment – as two-thirds of both the House and Senate would need to sign on – as well as three-fourths of the state legislatures. \n\nWith the current nearly 50/50 split in the country of Republicans and Democrats it’s extremely unlikely an amendment of this kind would pass – especially one that only aims to allow Trump to serve thrice. \n\nYet the topic of a Trump third term again came up over the weekend, when the president talked to NBC Meet the Press host Kristen Welker by phone recently. \n\n‘A lot of people want me to do it,’ the 78-year-old president said.\n\nA chant of ‘four more years’ broke out at the White House last week during the president’s Greek Independence Day event. \n\n‘But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration,’ he continued. ‘I’m focused on the current.’\n\nWhen asked why he’d want another term, the president responded, ‘I like working.’ \n\n‘I’m not joking,’ he continued. ‘But I’m not – it is far too early to think about it.’ \n\nHe was then asked if he’d been presented with plans on how to serve a third term. \n\n‘There are methods which you could do it,’ he said. \n\nHe was asked about those comments on board Air Force One Sunday as he traveled back to Washington, D.C. \n\n‘I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, you’ve got a long time to go,’ Trump said. \n\nObama, a longtime rival of Trump, has never expressed any interest in running for a third term.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA new poll suggests that Donald Trump should be careful what he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump vs. Obama: What Are Their Chances in a Hypothetical Third Term Showdown? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-vs-obama-what-are-their-chances-in-a-hypothetical-third-term-showdown/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/09/00/97060251-14585533-A_new_poll_suggests_that_Donald_Trump_should_be_careful_what_he_-a-2_1744153995991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 02:44:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":309152612,"title":"The Democrats’ ‘Black Monday’ that never happened","text":"Let’s not forget their doomsday predictions during the 2024 presidential election in which Democrats warned that if Trump won the election, democracy would be over. Trump did win, democracy didn’t end, and, in fact, the left-wing political party wound up winning multiple special elections in the country since Trump’s victory. \n\nIn 2017, regarding the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), perhaps the Democrat’s grandest doomsdayer, claimed the legislation would eventually devastate the middle class and that only wealthy and affluent people would benefit. As history has shown, this was not true. Pelosi was wrong and just fearmongering. \n\nIn 2018, during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats predicted that if confirmed, society would regress and it would be detrimental for women. Then-Sen. Kamala Harris predicted that Kavanaugh on the bench would present an “existential threat to the health care of hundreds of millions of Americans.” Much like many of the things Harris predicted, she, too, was wrong.\n\nAnd who could forget the Democrats’ scare tactics regarding voter reform laws in Georgia in 2022? They claimed the legislation was an act of voter suppression, targeting disenfranchised people and making it more difficult to vote. And then, in the first election after the new legislation went into effect, the state set a record for early voting numbers. None of the left-wing pearl-clutching hysterics was true. It was all a lie meant to frighten citizens.\n\nThere’s also the Democrats’ history of doom, gloom, and incorrect assertions that happened during the pandemic, similar to their inaccurate forecast of a “Black Monday.” For example, while the country was reeling from COVID, Democrats provided a long list of hysterics that ultimately proved untrue, including the efficacy of wearing masks to stop COVID spread and claims that the COVID vaccine would prevent people from getting sick and spreading the virus. \n\nThe so-called “Black Monday” that Democrats were anticipating and salivating over during the weekend never came to fruition. Sure, the country’s markets have trended downward for the last week. Unquestionably, the markets were better before Trump’s tariff announcements a week ago than today. However, the doomsday prognostications and predictions of a devastating stock market crash on Monday did not happen. It was the latest example of the left-wing performative political hysteria that continues to plague this country. \n\nIn fact, the stock market fared much better than Democrats said it would. And not only did a “Black Monday” not happen, but the Nasdaq increased, going from 14978.03 at opening to 15603.26 at Monday’s closing. This isn’t to say everything is good with markets. It’s not, and saying so would be almost as egregious as the Democrats’ forecast for impending financial doom. After all, the Dow Jones did drop, albeit less than 1% (0.91% decrease at Monday’s close), and the S&P 500 also decreased. Things could undoubtedly be better. But they are also a far cry from the Democrats’ predicted Armageddon.\n\nFurthermore, this was only one day. On Tuesday, there were more decreases in the market. However it was still nothing of the kind of meteoric collapse that Democrats predicted, let alone predicted for Monday. \n\nVolatility is extremely high, and market conditions are expected to worsen before they improve. The drama surrounding the tariffs and the subsequent retaliation from China’s government sent international markets into a tailspin. This is in no way a victory lap. Market fluctuations and downward trends can have significant economic consequences on people’s individual finances. \n\nHowever, the outright irresponsibility and hyperbolic, hysterical predictions that the Democrats made over the last week, and for which they hoped, should result in some form of condemnation and, more importantly, accountability. \n\nDisagreeing with political policy or opposing economic agendas and presidential actions is one thing. It is another to yearn for a president’s policies to fail, hoping it would cause financial turmoil. Democrat antics were dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible. They played political roulette with the finances of the country’s people — and continue to do so. Regardless of one’s opinions on Trump’s tariffs, he is doing it because he thinks, rightly or wrongly, they will benefit the country in the long term. Democrats, meanwhile, are acting purely out of selfish and disingenuous motives. \n\nSince voters rejected the Democratic political platform in November, they’ve resorted to clamoring for the country to suffer from economic ruin, hoping it would lead to voter anger and dissatisfaction and a path for their return to political power in the next election. They consider voters’ financial strife collateral damage in their thirst for political power, influence, and prestige.","summary":"Over the last week, Democrats throughout the country have been essentially praying for the stock market to crash and the economy to tank. Once again, Democrats did their best to scare people into thinking they were going to lose their life savings and experience financial ruin due to President Donald Trump’s policies.

Markets had assumed the tariffs would remain targeted, and lost trillions of dollars in when they found out Trump threatened nearly the entire world. \n\nAnd billionaires who are heavily compensated via their company’s stocks saw massive hits to their personal portfolios because of the shifts, including one Trump ally that lost $130 billion. \n\nSome billionaires, including ones who recently voted for Trump, are now speaking out against the administration or the policies. \n\nHere are some of America’s highest earners who have talked about the negative consequences of tariffs: \n\nThe richest man in the world, Tesla CEO, X owner, and SpaceX founder broke with the President over tariffs after losing $130 billion in net worth. \n\nElon Musk, who spent millions of dollars on the 2024 campaign to get Trump back into the White House, has started to mouth off at some of the President’s closest advisors over tariffs. \n\nHis criticism has taken aim a Peter Navarro, one of the architects of the tariff policies, calling the fellow Trump ally, ‘dumber than a sack of bricks,’ on X.\n\nMusk also said he wants the US and Europe to shift into a tariff-free environment. \n\nWarren Buffett \n\nBuffet rarely speaks about politics and did not endorse any candidates during the 2024 election. \n\nHowever, the oft-silent and iconic investor offered his criticism of tariffs in a rare statement in March, weeks before Trump launched his tariff policies. \n\nHe pointed out that American consumers, already dealing with a record-level of inflation, are likely to see even higher prices at the store. \n\n‘They’re an act of war, to some degree,’ he said in an interview on CBS News. \n\n‘Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the tooth fairy doesn’t pay ’em!’\n\nJamie Dimon \n\nThe JPMorgan Chase CEO, who quietly supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, has become one of the most prominent anti-tariff voices in recent days.\n\nThe billionaire was under consideration for advisory roles right after the election. \n\nBut in his annual letter to his staff, the CEO just said he doesn’t believe tariffs are a prudent economic policy. \n\n‘Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,’ Dimon wrote during his yearly address.\n\n‘If the Western world’s military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time.’ \n\nKen Griffen\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager who founded Citadel has said Trump’s tariff policy amounts to a tax on low-income families. \n\n‘It isn’t right to tell a middle-class or economically challenged family making $50,000 a year “it’s going to cost you 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent more for your groceries, for your toaster, for a new vacuum cleaner, for a new car,’ Griffen said at an event, according to Bloomberg. \n\nGriffen also criticized the consistent talking point coming out of the Trump administration that tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. \n\n‘Even if the dream of jobs coming back to America plays out, that’s a 20-year dream,’ he said. \n\n‘It’s not 20 weeks. It’s not two years. It’s decades.’ \n\nBill Ackman\n\nTrump ally Bill Ackman recently begged the presidentto pause the tariff program in a long X post. \n\n‘By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner,’ he wrote. \n\n‘If, on the other hand, on April 9th, we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt.’\n\nAckman has since rescinded parts of the post, saying they were ‘misinterpreted.’ \n\nHe said he remains a Trump loyalist. \n\nLoeb, a billionaire hedge fund manager and CEO of investing firm Third Point, has also spoken out against tariffs on X. \n\nThe Trump supporter who previously expressed his support for ‘America First’ policies retweeted a popular post that criticized Trump for changing his policies on a whim. \n\n‘For now [the economy] is all in the head of 1 person,’ the popular post said. ‘Who can change his mind at any time.’\n\nLoeb responded with one word: ‘exactly.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLike many voters, billionaires seemed to have shifted to the right in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Billionaires Opposing Trump&#8217;s Tariffs: &#8220;They&#8217;re Like Acts of War&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/billionaires-opposing-trumps-tariffs-theyre-like-acts-of-war/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/20/97055131-14585095-image-a-37_1744140877292.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 01:41:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":309171434,"title":"Trumpian delusion","text":"PRELIMINARY judgement on any new US administration usually involves waiting for at least 100 days before holding it to account. That arbitrary measure seems particularly inappropriate in the context of the revived Trumpocracy.\n\nOn the 75th day after the formal resurrection of Donald Trump, hundreds of thousands — possibly millions — of Americans poured into the streets to demonstrate their resentment against a variety of measures, ranging from sweeping tariffs against almost every nation (and a few uninhabited islands), to expanding curbs on free speech, the depletion of the federal workforce, the incarceration and threatened deportation of students for opposing Israel’s genocide, and the cruel immigration crackdown that, inter alia, is filling prisons in El Salvador.\n\nTrump has been a big fan of tariffs for decades, but restricted them chiefly to China during his first term. This time, it’s some of the world’s poorest nations that have been hit hardest. The idea is to ensure that any country exporting goods to the US must import an equivalent amount of American products. Manufacturing in the US, mind you, has declined for several decades, and its working class has suffered most. A substantial proportion of it opted for Trump because the Democrats — under Clinton, Obama and Biden — offered no viable alternative.\n\nTrump wouldn’t have emerged as a feasible alternative in 2016 had the Obama administration not managed to conclusively dash the hopes it had nurtured in 2008. And he might not have re-emerged eight years later had the Democrats not relied upon a superannuated veteran of the establishment to safeguard its dubious interests. Joe Biden’s limitations were evident long before he demonstrated his unsuitability for office in a presidential debate with Trump. Not all leading Democrats hailed Kamala Harris as the alternative, but other options were no longer available. \n\nIn both 2016 and 2020, the Democratic establishment had come down hard on Bernie Sanders for seeking the party’s presidential nomination. Both times, many Democratic voters begged to differ, and in 2016 some of them saw Trump as a better option than Hillary Clinton. Four years later, the supposed anti-Trump triumphed, but Biden’s 36-year record in the Senate was pretty dismal, and he won few laurels as president. His legacy will include whole-hearted backing for the genocide in Gaza, and equally vehement support for stretching the war in Ukraine. \n\n There’s worse to come, with little resistance.\n\nDomestically, his initiatives were compromised as much as his senatorial record. There were some worthy efforts to revive the post-pandemic economy and promote greenish initiatives. The latter did not amount to much, and while the economy showed considerable improvement on paper, the benefits barely trickled down to most voters, all too many of whom succumbed to the Trumpian delusion of making America great once again through antediluvian measures. The idea that a president in thrall to dysfunctional billionaires would champion the interests of the proletariat has inevitably been exposed as a cruel fantasy. Tariffs that protect local industries have been a part of the economic playbook for centuries, but it could take decades to revive America’s capacities as a manufacturing state, and in the long interim the poorest consumers will pay the biggest price.\n\nOther nations will also suffer, which is why so many of them are willing to kowtow to the richest and militarily most powerful nation in human history, whose brutality abroad matches its lack of empathy at home. In what kind of world is it acceptable to ignore homelessness and the incapacity of even people who have employment to dread the idea of seeking out a doctor when they desperately need one? Countries equally aligned to capitalism offer an alternative that America has never seriously contemplated since the Reagan-Thatcher era.\n\nWith the exception of Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, plus a few Democrats, the supposed opposition remains largely reticent about offering meaningful resistance to Trump’s clearly authoritarian and potentially fascist agenda. America has not been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by its economic partners, but that has effectively been its attitude towards the rest of the world since the end of World War II, enhanced by the collapse of the socialist alternative in 1989-91.\n\nAmerican hegemony over the past 80 years undoubtedly plays into Trump’s blighted vision of a world that kowtows to whatever Washington prescribes. With the possible exception of China, that assumption has been ratified by acolytes and hangers-on eager to be sucked into the Trump-verse, with the obsequious EU and several other nations offering zero-for-zero tariffs to the US. Boycott, divestment and sanctions might be the best riposte to Israel’s godfather, but which nation will dare to hurl the first stone? \n\nmahir.dawn@gmail.com\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025","summary":"PRELIMINARY judgement on any new US administration usually involves waiting for at least 100 days before holding it to account.

Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, also wouldn't be eligible if this amendment was passed. \n\n'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive term,' the text of the Ogles' Amendment read. \n\nThere's an incredibly high bar to pass a Constitutional amendment - as two-thirds of both the House and Senate would need to sign on - as well as three-fourths of the state legislatures. \n\nWith the current nearly 50/50 split in the country of Republicans and Democrats it's extremely unlikely an amendment of this kind would pass - especially one that only aims to allow Trump to serve thrice. \n\nYet the topic of a Trump third term again came up over the weekend, when the president talked to NBC Meet the Press host Kristen Welker by phone recently. \n\n'A lot of people want me to do it,' the 78-year-old president said. \n\nA chant of 'four more years' broke out at the White House last week during the president's Greek Independence Day event. \n\n'But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration,' he continued. 'I'm focused on the current.'\n\nWhen asked why he'd want another term, the president responded, 'I like working.' \n\n'I'm not joking,' he continued. 'But I'm not - it is far too early to think about it.' \n\nHe was then asked if he'd been presented with plans on how to serve a third term. \n\n'There are methods which you could do it,' he said. \n\nHe was asked about those comments on board Air Force One Sunday as he traveled back to Washington, D.C. \n\n'I don't want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, you've got a long time to go,' Trump said. \n\nObama, a longtime rival of Trump, has never expressed any interest in running for a third term.","summary":"A new poll breaks down how a hypothetical battle for a third term between Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama would play out.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14585533/donald-trump-barack-obama-odds-winning-presidency-term.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/22/97059879-0-image-a-4_1744148115405.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/31/4546005981107171332/1024x576_MP4_4546005981107171332.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:39:25","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

That document allowed them to work while they waited to hear whether their asylum requests were being accepted or denied. So, they could work as an illegal, knowing it would take YEARS before their case was heard. The immigration department mailed them a social security number. No interview.

They just want to help people, especially the poor and downtrodden. When you ask them about illegal immigration, they will tell you that these are just poor people looking for a better life for themselves and their families. That’s why they were perfectly okay with a wide-open southern border and letting millions of people into the country. It was all about compassion. However, as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to dig into the twisted story of America’s finances, we are finding out that the compassion ruse is just that, another Democrat party scheme.”\n\nThe report said, “Antonio Gracias is a DOGE official. He was recently interviewed on the ‘All In’ podcast and told the real story on illegal immigration during the Biden administration that Democrats told us was absolutely not happening.\n\n“Gracias said that potentially millions of illegal immigrants who came into the country during the Biden administration have valid Social Security numbers. What Gracias describes is nothing short of an organized racket to import as many people as possible.”\n\nThe report noted there was “no identification verification process” in place.\n\n“The result: around 1.3 million illegal immigrants now receive Medicaid paid for by you, the taxpayer, and voilà, as an illegal immigrant, you will be grateful enough to keep voting Democrat in perpetuity.”\n\nGracias even explained that illegals had, in fact, voted in U.S. elections.\n\n“We looked at voter rolls and we found that thousands are registered to vote in friendly states. And we looked even further in those friendly states and found that many of those people had actually voted. It was shocking to us. If I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it … it is shockingly bad. Included on those voter rolls were criminals and those who had names that matched ones on the federal Terror Watch List,” the report confirmed.","summary":"'MILLIONS received drivers licenses, some registered to vote and DOGE said some actually did vote'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/keep-voting-democrat-in-perpetuity-illegal-aliens-gifted-with-medicaid-benefits-and-social-security-numbers-under-biden/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/joe-biden-video-screen-big-brother-1984.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:12:26","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":309115040,"title":"18 slang words and phrases we can thank (or blame) Gen Z for","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nCulture & Life\n\n18 slang words and phrases we can thank (or blame) Gen Z for\n\nYounger Americans have put their stamp on our language with these neologisms\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'Rizz' is one of Gen Z's go-to words\n\n(Image credit: Josie Elias / Getty Images)\n\nDavid Faris \n\n8 April 2025\n\nEach new generation puts its mark on language in culture, in part by inventing words and phrases. Sometimes those new contributions to language describe new concepts or developments, but often they put a new spin on our understanding of existing ideas. Generation Z, commonly defined as those born between 1997 and 2012, is no exception, churning out a seemingly endless stream of new or altered language in ways that frequently puzzle their elders. If you feel like you need a glossary to stay up to date, you are in good company.\n\n\"Big yikes\" is a phrase used in response to \"something that's really embarrassing, disturbing, or shocking,\" said Reader's Digest. Using it \"expresses a strong sense of cringe, awkwardness or disapproval,\" said the International Center for Language Studies.\n\nAn adjective that means \"amazing, fantastic, lovely and cool,\" the word \"bussin'\" is commonly traced to a 2021 Tik Tok trend, said Today. \"It can also be used as a verb, in the form of \"buss,\" said Parents, and like so many words on this list, \"it actually has origins in African American Vernacular English.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

A high school student named Gaby Rasson is credited with inventing the term in 2013, and it is most frequently applied to dated fashion like skinny jeans and \"outmoded trappings of the millennial lifestyle,\" said Vogue.\n\nAnother word that Gen Zers will reach for when they want to lob an insult, \"cringe\" means something that is embarrassing for someone else, a someone who typically is not aware that what they are saying or doing is problematic or dated. It can be applied to a wide range of situations, including a \"superstitious email chain from your mom\" or accidentally double-tapping an old picture in the middle of a deep dive into someone's Instagram,\" said Bustle.\n\nInside the contested birth years of generations\nGen Z is embracing underconsumption\nGeneration Z: done with democracy?\nA term for \"a cool or sexy trend/style,\" said Parade, \"drip\" refers to a person's overall look. If someone is looking particularly good, you can also say that they are \"drippin.\" It \"isn't a new slang term, but it has experienced a renaissance in hip-hop over the past few years,\" said Genius.\n\nA \"flex\" is a \"showcase of accomplishments and self-promotion,\" said Forbes. The term is generally reserved for situations in which a person unnecessarily communicates information that makes them look good or highlights an achievement, similar to a \"humblebrag.\"\n\nA way of referring to a makeover or transformation, \"glow up\" can also mean to \"go from the bottom to the top to the point of disbelief,\" said Her Campus. A trend that has emerged in response has been to \"glow down,\" which means to remove the \"desire for physical improvement from the center of your life,\" said The Cut.\nHits different\nWhen they want to say that something is \"significantly better than usual or is way better,\" members of Gen Z will reach for the phrase \"hits different,\" said Urban Dictionary. It is for situations in which a song, article of clothing or food \"appeals to you in a unique way,\" said BBC. For example, we're hoping this article hits different than other efforts to document Gen Z slang.\n\nA catch-all term that applies to someone experiencing anxiety or depression, \"menty b\" is an abbreviated version of \"mental breakdown.\" It has \"become shorthand for something less than a full meltdown,\" said The Wall Street Journal, although some people worry that its overuse risks trivializing the kind of deeper emotional distress that is on the rise for younger people, driven by worries over, for example, climate change and elections.\n\nA word that expresses disappointment, \"mid\" refers to \"things that are essentially average or slightly below,\" said The New York Times. \"It is one of Gen Z's favorite insults,\" said Politico, and young people seem to take particular delight in aiming it at the bad taste of their elders.\n\nUnlike some of Gen Z's other slang innovations, \"no cap\" isn't an abbreviation or appropriation of existing language. It means \"no lie\" and \"​​often follows an unbelievable statement or serious question,\" said Bustle. And \"if you say someone is 'capping,' then you are saying they are lying,\" said USA Today.\n\nAn adjective that refers to someone who is desperate for attention or positive reinforcement, \"pick-me\" is most frequently \"used to describe a girl who does everything for external, mostly male validation,\" said CNN. Because of the term's negative connotations, it has generated backlash for being \"problematic and misogynistic and has even given rise to an anti-pick-me trend on social media.\"\n\nOxford's 2023 Word of the Year, \"Rizz\" is simply a \"shortened form of 'charisma'\" that \"emerged out of internet and gaming culture,\" said The New York Times. The word \"comes from Black cultures, as most American neologisms do\" said Vox. Someone with a great deal of charisma can be called a \"rizzler.\"\n\nWhen people want to say that something is cracking them up, they can remark that it is \"sending me.\" The phrase is \"the Gen Z equivalent of LOL,\" said Fortune. And while \"there is no official confirmation of where the phrase originated,\" said The Daily Dot, its frequency of use rose in the \"late 2010s.\"\n\nMeaning to be a fan or enthusiast of something, \"Stan\" has its roots in an Eminem song \"about a man who was pushed to the edge when his idol wouldn't answer his fan mail,\" said NPR. While it originally had somewhat negative connotations, today it \"can describe any fan, regardless of dedication,\" and does not necessarily imply obsessiveness, said USA Today.\n\nAnother word that is essentially just an abbreviation for a longer one, \"sus\" is short for \"suspicious\" or \"suspect.\" The neologism is traced to the \"online game \"Among Us,\" in which players try to determine who is an imposter working to sabotage their progress,\" said Business Insider. Like \"mid,\" it has emerged as a top-tier barb wielded by Gen Zers.\nUnderstood the assignment\nIf you do what you are expected to do, you have \"understood the assignment.\" It is \"a popular way to praise someone who is going above and beyond to do a good job,\" said Yahoo. It can also be a way of making a comparison, like someone on the political left saying that voters who cast a ballot for Kamala Harris in 2024 despite reservations about her position on the war in Gaza \"understood the assignment.\"\n\nA vibe is \"the overall atmosphere or feeling of a situation, person or place,\" said Forbes. The word is typically modified to be a phrase, including the \"vibes are off\" as a way of saying that someone does not feel good about a situation or development. Especially in its use as a verb to mean \"to kick back and hang out, or to get along,\" the usage is novel, said Oprah Daily.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDavid Faris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nDavid Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics.

The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing. This was typical bulls**t. [Harris] had to fake surprise and enthusiasm.\"Harris then seemed to take a swipe at the couple for the act by expressing her shock when the couple called her up \"together.\"\n\nAs rumors started to swirl the couple sleep in \"separate bedrooms\" – it seems possible, by Harris' reaction, that it was well known in the political world before it hit the media.Amid all the rumors, the couple continue to share social media tributes for each other to celebrate Valentine's Day and birthdays. \n\nIn addition, Michelle still continues to pursue her podcast career, which isn't as successful as fans predicted it would be.\n\nAt the time of publishing, Michelle's new podcast IMO — co-hosted with her own brother Craig — is ranked at #34 on Spotify.On a recent episode, the former First Lady took a brutal swipe at her husband.\n\nFamous author and podcaster Jay Shetty asked Michelle if she \"would you be attracted to a guy who's not financially sound when you meet him?\"\n\n\"Uh, I married one,\" the former first lady said.\n\nShe added: \"I left my corporate firm when I met Barack. I had somebody who was like, 'I got your back. The risks you think you're taking, they aren't that crazy, and I'm here to help you.'\"Michelle continued: \"That's when I said, 'I would rather have that in a partner than a higher income. I would rather have somebody who is ready to do some hard things with me. But that meant I had to be ready to do some hard things with him\"\n\nThe couple met in 1988 when Barack took a job at a Chicago law firm for the summer, where Michelle was already working on marketing and intellectual property law.","summary":"The secretly divorcing' Obamas aren't just reportedly calling it quits with their marriage, they are also done with politics months after the embarrassing election loss.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/barack-michelle-obama-divorcing-done-politics-living-separate-bedrooms/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Cx8IqObQD/0x0/obama-divorce-rumor-1-1744143130716.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 22:48:39","author":"Lauren McIver","authors":["Lauren McIver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":309351268,"title":"Stephen A. Smith Suggests Growing Influence Of Bernie Sanders And AOC In Democratic Party Fuels His Potential 2028 Bid","text":"ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith suggested Tuesday that the increasing influence of Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic Party helped open his mind to a potential 2028 presidential run.\n\nSmith said Monday at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show that, although he was not interested in pursuing the presidency, he would remain flexible based on the condition of the country and his chances of winning. On “The Stephen A. Smith Show” Tuesday, he said that he believed it was necessary for him to “speak up at the NAB conference” because Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez would not be ideal stewards of the Democratic Party. (RELATED: Tim Walz Is Still Trying To Explain How Badly His Party Failed In 2024)\n\n“See, when I think about the Republicans, I think the Republicans are asking us, particularly Trump, ‘Trust me.’ And by the way, he’s in a position to do it because he won the popular vote. He won the Electoral College vote. He won every swing state. He won both houses of Congress,” Smith said. “He’s got a majority, 6-3, in the Supreme Court. I mean, damn. Americans didn’t just give it to him. He took it because he recognized what the left wasn’t doing. They were preoccupied with nonsense. You want to ask why Stephen A. Smith felt the need to speak up at the NAB conference?”\n\n“Let me ask y’all this question: We’re supposed to leave it to Bernie Sanders and AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? We’re supposed to leave it with individuals that will tell you that it’s perfectly OK to tax 70% of your money? Not that they gave out that number. I’m just speculating because of how socialistic they are in their thinking,” Smith added. “We’re supposed to say that that’s OK? Y’all OK with that? You OK with going to work and making $100 and walking home with $30? You sure about that? Are you cool with it? Just tell me. Because these are the kind of questions that we have to ask ourselves. That is why I spoke up.”\n\nAlthough Smith said that he is an independent, he indicated on a February episode of his show that he would likely run as a Democrat.\n\nSmith garnered 2% support in a January poll by McLaughlin & Associates that requested participants choose their preferred candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Kamala Harris led the field with 33% support.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez have traveled the nation on the Vermont senator’s “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, speaking to crowds about how to combat “the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power” in the U.S. When asked to name the Democratic leader they believe “best reflects the core values” of the party, 10% of Democrats selected Ocasio-Cortez, while 8% chose Sanders, according to a CNN/SSRS poll published March 16.\n\nBoth Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have floated tax rates of 70% or more on wealthy Americans.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Smith says he is no longer dismissing the idea of running for president in 2028. And you shouldn't either. As we explained on Monday, Smith could be the exact type of useful idiot the Democrat Party is looking for in four years. Currently, the betting site Kalshi gives Smith a 5 percent chance of earning the Democrat nomination. That's not bad for someone who made his name following around Allen Iverson and arguing about whether LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan. Still, Smith's potential viability says more about the state of the Democrat Party than it does him. Other potential candidates for the party in 2028 include Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Wes Moore. Not a single one of them solves the chief issue that ails the Democrat Party, which is its disconnect with ordinary, working Americans. Blue-collar voters matter, too. They really matter in terms of winning an election. But while Smith's odds are currently competitive with the pack in terms of a potential primary, polling data suggests he is less viable in terms of a general election. For example, Overton general election data found Smith trailing Vice President JD Vance by nine points in a hypothetical 2028 race. By comparison, Vance and Harris are polling at 39 percent each. Imagine Smith on a debate stage with Vance. Debating about whether Kirk Cousins is a franchise quarterback with Ryan Clark and Mina Kimes is one thing. Debating policy with Vance is another. Ask Tim Walz. Overton didn't test polling data to see how Smith would hypothetically fair against other potential GOP candidates. Granted, the market gives Vance a 44 percent chance of winning the nomination. Tulsi Gabbard and Donald Trump Sr. are tied for second, with a 10 percent chance each. Look, only a fool would make a prediction three and a half years out. Yet the prediction here is that if Smith enters the race, he will lose badly. The most likely primary winners are Vance and Newsom. Bill it America First vs. Make America California. Still, it's nice to hear that Stephen A. is leaving the door open, as he put it, to consider running the most powerful country in the world.","summary":"Debating about whether Kirk Cousins is a franchise quarterback with Ryan Clark and Mina Kimes is one thing.

Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced the Nuclear Family Priority Act on Tuesday to restrict chain migration by eliminating visa eligibility for extended family members of migrants, telling Breitbart News that “it’s past time we restore order and put the American people first.”\n\nBanks is joined by Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ), who has reintroduced a companion bill in the House after previously introducing it in the 118th Congress. \n\nThe legislation would end visa categories for extended, non-nuclear family members, limit sponsorship to immediate family only, reduce baseline caps on family-sponsored visas, and address special cases involving immigrants with parents in the U.S., the senator’s office stated.\n\n“The bill supports President Trump’s efforts to curb illegal immigration and ease pressure on the immigration system,” Banks’ office added.\n\nCrane told Breitbart News that “Unrestricted chain migration has allowed for the inexcusable exploitation and abuse of our immigration system.”\n\n“I’m proud to introduce this bill that will help restore the rule of law, prevent our nation from being overburdened, and bolster our national security,” the congressman continued. “I’m grateful to Sen. Jim Banks for leading this bill in the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to advancing this common sense legislation.”\n\nBanks’ latest move to combat mass migration comes soon after he introduced the End Unaccountable Amnesty Act in January to restore congressional oversight over immigration policies and tighten the requirements for the use of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), immigration parole, and the handling of unaccompanied alien children (UAC).\n\n“The Biden administration exploited current law to grant legal status to millions of non-citizens, overwhelming communities in Indiana and across the country,” Banks said at the time. “Our schools, healthcare systems, and public services are struggling with this massive influx.

Jeff Hurd explains his rare break with Trump over tariffs","text":"JEFF HURD, COLORADO’S ‘ACCIDENTAL POLITICIAN’ WHO IS TAKING OVER BOEBERT’S OLD HOUSE SEAT\n\nHurd, a lawyer, told the Washington Examiner in an interview that his decision to challenge Trump was a matter of following the Constitution. \n\n“I think most folks recognize the importance of this issue for us as an institution, for Congress, and the importance of Article 1, giving Congress this branch that legislative power, and the need to make sure that we look at that carefully and ensure that any exercise of authority by the executive branch is authorized by the legislative branch,” Hurd said on Tuesday. “That’s what the Constitution says, and I would say that regardless of who the president is.”\n\nThe Trade Review Act of 2025 is modeled after the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which gives Congress the ability to check the president’s power to wage war. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) first introduced the legislation in the Senate and the White House said Trump would veto it.\n\nDespite the opposition from Trump and lacking support from House GOP leadership, Hurd and Bacon moved forward this week with their bipartisan bill and plan to win over more House GOP co-sponsors. \n\nHurd, who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which was once held by Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), was not included on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s target list released Tuesday the after the Cook Political Report included his seat as “in play” but “likely Republican.” \n\n“One of the things I said when I was running for office was that my top two priorities were the Constitution of the United States and making sure that I take care of the 3rd Congressional District. And I think this legislation is consistent,” Hurd told the Washington Examiner.\n\nHurd noted he has heard from many constituents concerned about the tariffs — specifically from agriculture producers. \n\nBacon represents a highly targeted seat, with the Cook Political Report naming it the “toughest district on paper,” as former Vice President Kamala Harris won the greater Omaha area by almost 5 points. The Nebraska Republican remains on the DCCC’s target list and has won reelection since 2017 by appealing to Independent and Democratic voters.\n\n“This is less about the actual tariffs laid by the Trump Administration, some of which I support because they are reciprocal, but more a commitment to uphold the Constitution,” Bacon said in the press release. “Congress has the power of the purse. Our Founders created checks and balances for a reason.”\n\nTrade Review Act of 2025 would give Congress the authority to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval. It requires a joint resolution of approval to extend the tariffs before 60 days pass. Overall, the bill increases congressional oversight on the executive branch’s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE — Since taking office three months ago, freshman Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-CO) has shied away from breaking with President Donald Trump, aside from condemning his Jan. 6 pardons. But that changed after Trump announced his sweeping &#8220;Liberation Day&#8221; tariffs that would impose new duties on about 90 countries without any congressional approval.
