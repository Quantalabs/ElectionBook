Their qualifications are irrelevant, just as they’ve been irrelevant for men. The same standard will apply to the general staff of all militaries. \n\nI understand there will be considerable pushback to this idea from all sides. From the feminists, who might argue that I am appropriating the legacy trauma of women everywhere.\n\nFrom the Andrew Tate acolytes, who will argue treachery to a non-existent brotherhood.\n\nFrom the centrists, who will accuse me of flagrant populism and suggesting I have hopped aboard a bandwagon — or a fallopian flotilla — all in the name of ingratiating myself to the sisterhood.\n\n To all of them, I simply say: This isn’t working\n\nThe manscaping of society has gone on for far too long and the results of the masculine monopoly have proven to be much too disastrous for humankind, for the planet, for the arts, culture, and academia.\n\nThe only thing men have not ruined all by themselves is sport — both the watching of it and the playing of it. That, and drinking silently in pubs.\n\nLiterally every other thing has been tainted to some degree by an inglorious arms race between men intent on one thing: Winning a big micky contest.\n\nThe cost of that megalomaniac pursuit has been catastrophic. War. Famine. Drought. Climate change. Kanye. And now, in the case of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, a break-up so unedifying they make Kim Kardashian look like Grace Kelly.\n\nWomen themselves are not entirely blameless. Maggie Thatcher didn’t exactly woo the working class with a mother’s touch.\n\nKamala Harris may have proven slightly less duplicitous a president than Donald Trump, but she was too incompetent to defeat him.\n\nLiz Truss, Suella Braverman, and Priti Patel were nearly as bad as Boris Johnson, which is a quite the reach.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen displays all the empathy of a data centre, and I wouldn’t trust Giorgia Meloni as far as I could throw her.\n\n Closer to home, the nuns — as a collective — did considerable damage, especially to women\n\nDespite all of this, I still think men have had the reins for long enough. All its brought us is disaster.\n\nAs of this year, only 13% of the world’s nations are led by women. Historically, only about one third of United Nations member states have ever had a woman serve as head of government.\n\nAccording to UN figures, women hold just 23% of ministerial positions globally in 2025. The same study notes women are more often assigned portfolios related to social affairs, while defence, foreign affairs, and finance remain predominantly the purview of men.\n\nIn terms of wealth, women constitute approximately 13.3% of the world’s billionaires. According to Forbes’ rich list published this year, out of 3,028 billionaires globally, only 406 are women.\n\nLet’s put the diversity, equity and inclusion argument to one side for a moment. Clearly, that was beyond our abilities to properly implement, probably because it was men responsible for it.\n\nPerhaps we don’t even need to try that hard. Perhaps we should just seek to put the best people in the jobs with the most power. Perhaps, after many millennia of evidence, men are not those people. Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out.\n\n“Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth. I love your majesty according to my bond; no more nor less.” So said Cordelia, the youngest of King Lear’s daughters, when the narcissistic monarch sought some sycophancy before dividing up his kingdom.\n\nCordelia the character was, of course, a work of Shakespeare’s imagination. However, she endures in my mind as the antithesis of what we have come to expect from Trump, Putin, Biden, Boris Johnson, Churchill, Blair, Kennedy, Clinton, Netanyahu, Musk, Bezos et al.\n\n If we flipped it entirely, we should really let the children be in charge.\n\nWe’d eat nothing but Nutella with every meal, but you’d be guaranteed wars would quickly end, the hungry would be fed, and there’d be no such thing as genocide.\n\nWhat is absolutely certain is that they could not do any worse.","summary":"Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out, writes Colin Sheridan","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41646655.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9305/4652506_5_seoimage1x1_a3405101438743348c3060dbc4e420db.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:00:00","author":"Colin Sheridan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Colin Sheridan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":328916196,"title":"Trump breaks silence on escalating feud with Elon Musk and teases his next move","text":"President Donald Trump finally took questions on his stunning public feud with Elon Musk, after laying low for most of Friday – while repeating his threat to probe a litany of Musk contracts.\n\n'We’ll take look at everything,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. 'It’s a lot of money.\n\nHe continued: 'It’s a lot of subsidy … so we’ll take a look… only if it’s fair… only if it’s to be fair for him and the country… '\n\nThe line on subsidy suggests Trump will continue to push to go after tax credits for electric cars such as the Musk-owned Tesla. That language features in the House-passed 'big, beautiful bill.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of their feud, Trump and his allies have said Musk turned on the bill because it cuts the subsidies. Musk has said he doesn't need them anyway.\n\nAt another point Trump disavowed knowledge of calls for probes of Musk – after his longtime ally Steve Bannon, a Musk adversary, said Musk should be probed or even deported.\n\n 'I had no idea there were any… I’ll let them speak for themselves … I have no idea,' Trump said. \n\nIt had been 24 hours since he addressed his extraordinary break with his former 'first buddy' who used to accompany him to Mar-a-Lago and who Trump invited to cabinet meeting and hosted the office along with Musk's child, 'little X.' \n\nAt times Trump appeared to want to tamp down the talk of the feud – despite escalating it with threats and ignoring advice to set up a phone call to settle it.\n\n'Honestly I’ve been so busy working on China… working on Russia… working on Iran.. I’m not thinking about Elon musk .. I just wish him well,' Trump said.\n\nAnd he won't be demanding Musk return the gold colored key he presented him with in the Oval Office just days ago.\n\n'No I don’t take things back,' Trump said.\n\nHe dodged a question about dumping his new $80,000 Tesla. 'I hope he does well with Tesla,' Trump answered. \n\nTrump held his events – including signing an executive order on drones in the U.S. – behind closed doors. Then, he toured a golf course at Joint Base Andrews in a golf cart while trailed by aides and Secret Service agents.\n\nHe ignored shouted questions about his relationship with the world's richest man while leaving the White House. \n\nIt wasn't until he boarded Air Force One en route to his Bedminister, New Jersey golf club that he finally spoke about the simmering feud that has driven down Tesla's stock price and prompted speculation about big changes in the space industry as well as talk that Musk's billions in government contracts could be under threat. \n\nOn Thursday Trump and Musk took part in a spectacular public spat, which included cameos by dead serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and anti-Semitic rapper Kanye West. \n\nThe fallout between Trump and Musk - who were political allies for a little less than a year - started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans' 'big, beautiful bill,' arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, on Thursday, when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, he was asked about Musk's recent criticism. \n\nFrom there the dam broke. \n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX's government contracts.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disburbed him.' \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX. \n\n'He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I'm sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,' Trump continued. 'We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat.' \n\nMusk posted to X as Trump's Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote. \n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised. \n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued. 'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.' \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man - him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican's campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk's help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.' \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n'Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,' Musk claimed. \n\n'Such ingratitude,' the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n'Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,' Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went 'CRAZY!'\n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts. \n\n'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!' Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n'This just gets better and better,' he wrote. 'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station - and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n'Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,' West wrote.\n\nAnd Musk threw the Epstein bomb. \n\n'@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nEpstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n'Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,' Musk added. \n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.' \n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.' \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk's Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.'\n\n'The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,' Leavitt added. \n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.' \n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.' \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk's Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nA source familiar pointed out to the Daily Mail that 'everyone knows President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club.'\n\n'The Administration itself released Epstein files with the President's name included. This is not a new surprise Elon is uncovering. Everyone already knew this,' the source continued. \n\nThe source also mused, 'If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hangout with him for 6 months and say he \"loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?\"' \n\nIt was less than a week ago that Trump gave Musk a golden key and a DOGE send-off from the Oval Office.","summary":"The president stayed out of the public eye Friday amid the stunning feud with Elon Musk, only speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to his New Jersey golf course.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14789033/Trump-breaks-silence-feud-Elon-Musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/06/23/99127245-0-image-m-44_1749249468218.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/06/5857904361905016685/1024x576_MP4_5857904361905016685.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-06 22:56:22","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":328931592,"title":"Stephen A.

But a week into June, many of its heroes have yet to post about it on X. \n\nNine superstars of the Left, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and former President Barack Obama, have not posted about Pride Month on X. When June rolled around in previous years, these Democrats did not hesitate to issue statements in support of their gay and trans constituents. \n\nThe Obamas and Clintons have been mute as well. Both couples poured in the effort campaigning against President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, catering particularly to LGBTQ+ groups. But neither the former presidents nor their politically involved wives have publicly acknowledged Pride Month on their X accounts, either personal or official. \n\nThe same can be said of former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden. The former president, despite his health problems, has posted multiple times on X in June, but not about Pride Month. On June 4, Biden wished his wife a happy birthday, and on June 2, he posted about the tragic terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado. \n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was prompt to post a June 1 message the last two years. Her 2024 post featured a picture of Warren wearing a large, rainbow feather boa that she proudly acknowledged, saying, “This month, we celebrate the progress we’ve made toward building a more inclusive nation for our LGBTQ+ community and we renew our fight to create a world where everyone is truly equal. And yes – this is a new boa!” \n\nBut the progressive who regularly posts about reproductive rights and has been lauded a “gay icon” by those on the Left has failed to make any acknowledgment on social media of the biggest celebration of the LGBTQ community. \n\nAnother strange absence is Pete Buttigieg. Under Biden, Buttigieg served as the first openly gay Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate in U.S. history. But the staunch advocate for LGBTQ rights has been silent, both on X and Instagram. \n\nOther prominent left-wing figures, however, have taken to X about Pride Month. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., all posted about Pride Month on June 1 or 2. AOC posted a promotional video on X featuring drag queens and gay couples, who made comments like, “Trump has to go down, man. We got to do everything in our power to stand up and show that we are all in solidarity.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris posted on June 6.\n\nThe list of prominent Democrats who have not posted about Pride Month, despite a history of doing so more quickly in years past, is indicative of a broader vibe shift.

The post on X, his social media platform, landed fast and took off like one of Musk's rockets: \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\"Musk—once ridiculed by Trump for leading companies that made \"driverless cars that crash\" and \"rocketships to nowhere\"— slapped a red MAGA hat on his profile photo, lit up X with pro-Trump memes, and used his platform's reach to carpet-bomb swing states with political propaganda dressed as engagement. By sundown, Trump's digital war room was headquartered on X, and Musk looked like the unofficial campaign manager.Ten months later, he detonated that alliance in real time.Every political strategist in Washington could see it coming. Musk, the richest man in the world, doesn't share power. Trump, the most unrelenting figure in American politics, doesn't forgive disloyalty. Their mutual dependency—money for clout, platform for power—was a high-speed arrangement that seemed destined for a crash.For almost three years, Musk used X, formerly Twitter, to help rebuild Donald Trump's public image and support his 2024 presidential run. He reinstated Trump's account that had been banned after January 6, shared meme after meme mocking Democrats, chatted with MAGA influencers and hosted live conversations with Trump and others. Within months, Musk had reshaped the platform's algorithms to favor a content ecosystem that amplified Trump's message, according to social media researchers.\"A lot of the far right returned to Twitter because all of a sudden it looked like a safe space,\" said Giulio Corsi, a researcher at the University of Cambridge in Britain who has been studying X's recommendation system.His findings were blunt: inflammatory posts, particularly those containing false or misleading links, surged in reach. \"Tweets expressing right-leaning political bias see heightened amplification compared to the baseline model,\" Corsi wrote in a case study examining 2.7 million posts on X in early 2023.But the platform's bias wasn't just anecdotal. A Wall Street Journal analysis found that new users interested only in non-political topics were still bombarded with Trump-aligned content, and that pro-Trump accounts appeared twice as often as those favoring Vice President Kamala Harris during last year's presidential election.The Washington Post also reported that Republican congressional accounts received billions more views than their Democratic counterparts, further illustrating Musk's platform as a potent, asymmetric political tool.Blurred LinesMusk's hands-on management of X's internal mechanics blurred the line between owner and political actor. During the 2024 election cycle, Musk took his control to new political heights, according to Hamed Qahri-Saremi, associate professor of information systems at Cleveland State University.\"We are seeing social media platform owners as active political actors, not just neutral hosts that used to be the norm,\" Qahri-Saremi told Newsweek. \"Musk's influence on social media primarily stems from two channels: his structural control as the owner of X, which gives him gatekeeping power over policies, algorithms, and norms—and his personal activity, where he promotes specific narratives and amplifies particular users.\"It worked—for a while. After Musk endorsed Trump on X last summer, the platform's energy shifted almost immediately in MAGA's favor. Posts praising Trump surged. Once Joe Biden bowed out, content attacking Kamala Harris—including a viral AI-generated image of her in communist regalia—wasn't just allowed; it was spread by Musk himself.That shift was reinforced by Musk's overhaul of how information is verified on the platform. He ended Twitter's partnerships with professional fact-checkers, replaced them with \"Community Notes\"—a crowdsourced system run by anonymous users and algorithms—and removed the traditional verification badges that once signaled a user was who they claimed to be. As a result, misinformation and political propaganda spread more easily, especially from verified accounts who could pay for reach.\"Other major platforms, such as Meta, subsequently adopted similar practices earlier this year, resulting in significant shifts in fact-checking content on social media platforms,\" Qahri-Saremi said. \"Third-party, professional fact-checking does not exist on these platforms as it once did.\"Pull The Plug?He hasn't muted Trump—not yet. But if Elon Musk wanted to, he could do it with a keystroke.As the biggest account on X, with more than 220 million followers, Musk's reach is immediate and absolute. His posts fill the feeds of users who do not follow him. Some who have actively blocked him report that they still see his musings. His Thursday barrage of attacks on Trump—accusing him of lying, reposting calls for impeachment, and floating a Jeffrey Epstein connection over the course of about 40 posts—racked up tens of millions of impressions in a matter of minutes. On X, that means they were likely seen by the majority of active users, whether they followed him or not.That scale matters. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, 59 percent of X users say they rely on the platform as their primary source of news. With a global user base exceeding 500 million, that gives Musk a direct pipeline to shaping how vast swaths of the internet experience political reality.And unlike Trump—who posts mainly on Truth Social, where the reach is narrower and engagement smaller—Musk controls not just the content, but the code. He can dial engagement up or down, signal boosts with a single retweet, or let critics vanish into algorithmic limbo without ever banning them outright.\"He has structural control,\" said Qahri-Saremi. \"That gives him gatekeeping power over speech norms, algorithms, and who gets seen.\"It wouldn't be the first time Musk reprogrammed the ground beneath his rivals' feet. Kamala Harris began her sprint toward the general election last fall, her campaign claimed posts supporting her began vanishing from timelines. Pro-Harris accounts reported sudden drops in engagement, unexplained suspensions and disappearing trending topics.Musk did not answer their questions at the time. He has denied manipulating the algorithm for political reasons, but now that X is a private company under his full control, that algorithm is a black box visible only to him and the coders who work for him. The code itself remains perhaps Musk's most potent weapon for control of the modern attention economy — should he decide to use it against the sitting president.","summary":"Musk used X—formerly Twitter—to help rebuild Trump's public image and support his presidential run.

Johnson told RadarOnline.com it may be tough for Trump to move forward with a lawsuit.\n\nHe explained: \"Defamation of character must be based on a false public comment that has a detrimental effect that can be quantified by way of legal damages. \n\n\"A public figure can only sue if there is actual malice in the mind of the person making the defamatory remarks. Simply put, it cannot be a mistake but has to be knowingly false, which, many times, is a tough standard to overcome.\"\"It would be unprecedented if a sitting president filed suit for defamation while in office,\" Johnson added.\n\nThe battle between the two egos erupted after Musk called out Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" noting it will increase the debt and branding it a \"disgusting abomination.\"\n\nMusk then posted 2013 tweets from Trump, in which the reality star criticized Republicans, the budget, and the country's balance.\n\n\"Where is the man who wrote these words?\" Musk asked. \"Was he replaced by a body double!?\" The 53-year-old then claimed: \"The Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!\"Musk Destroys Trump On XThe billionaire also claimed Trump would have failed to beat Kamala Harris in the November election \"without\" him.\n\n\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election,\" he wrote. \"Dems would control the house and Republicans would be 51-49 in the senate... such ingratitude.\"\n\nTrump admitted he was \"disappointed\" with their fallout, \"because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people.\"\n\nHe added while in the Oval Office: \"He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the (electric vehicle credits) mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair.\"Friendship Over?Musk then accused Trump of lying, and raged: \"False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"\n\nAny hopes of a reconciliation between the two were dashed by Trump, as a senior White House official revealed he is \"not interested in Elon call,\" especially after Musk suggested a \"new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.\"\n\nTrump hit back on Truth Social, and claimed: \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave. I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\"\"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!\" he added.\n\nThe pettiness between the pair has not subsided as Trump is not only being encouraged to seize control of SpaceX from Musk, but is said to be getting rid of his Tesla.","summary":"Donald Trump may have a case for a defamation lawsuit after his former friend Elon Musk accused him of being in the Epstein files.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit-crazy-epstein-files-rant/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/qyUt6q8HI/0x0/trump-musk-1749234480597.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 19:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":328879694,"title":"High-profile Paul Weiss attorney defects to Big Law firm fighting Trump","text":"Damian Williams, one of the most prominent federal prosecutors in the country, is walking away from the law firm that struck a deal with Donald Trump — and joining one that's suing him.Williams is leaving Paul Weiss five months after returning to the firm to work for Jenner & Block, a law firm actively challenging the Trump administration in court.Jenner & Block announced the move Friday. Williams will serve as co-chair of both the firm's Litigation Department and its Investigations, Compliance, and Defense Practice. The high-profile defection is a blow for Paul Weiss, an elite law firm that was the first to broker an agreement with President Donald Trump in March. As part of the deal, Paul Weiss said it would devote $40 million in pro bono hours toward Trump's political priorities. After it was announced, Trump rescinded an executive order that would have, among other sanctions, stripped Paul Weiss employees of security clearances and cut off government contracts.Eight other firms have since made similar deals with the White House. Four — including Jenner & Block — opted to sue instead. All four have won court rulings blocking Trump's orders.\"Jenner & Block fearlessly advocates for its clients and provides outstanding strategic counsel through their most difficult challenges,\" Williams said in a press release. \"I've seen firsthand how this firm expertly tackles the toughest cases and lives its values.\"\"I'm excited to join a team with an extraordinary depth of legal talent that doesn't shy away from hard fights — and delivers results that matter,\" his statement continued.Williams isn't the only notable attorney to leave Paul Weiss in recent weeks. Karen Dunn, a prominent litigator who helped Kamala Harris prepare for her 2024 presidential debate with Trump, left along with three other top lawyers last month to start a new boutique law firm.Williams previously served as the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York, one of the most powerful perches in the Justice Department. Williams brought criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and now-former Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.Before that, Williams worked at Paul Weiss between 2009 and 2012 and clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens on the US Supreme Court and Merrick Garland on the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.In Paul Weiss' January announcement about his return, Williams praised the firm's \"devotion to pro bono.\"\"Damian is a transcendently talented lawyer who has led many of the government's highest-profile prosecutions and investigations,\" Paul Weiss's chair Brad Karp said at the time. \"He will be an exceptional addition to our already outstanding team of white collar and regulatory lawyers and a leader in the national legal community.\"A representative for Paul Weiss didn't respond to a request for comment Friday.","summary":"Damian Williams was at Paul Weiss for just five months before joining Jenner & Block, which won a court ruling blocking a punitive Trump order.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-weiss-attorney-damian-williams-defects-for-jenner-block-2025-6","image":"https://i.insider.com/6843340085e81483682b9fa7?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 19:17:58","author":"Jacob Shamsian","authors":["Jacob Shamsian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.075},{"id":328893554,"title":"Report: Chinese Hackers Breached U.S. Telecoms Earlier than Previously Known","text":"Corporate investigators have reportedly discovered evidence that Chinese hackers infiltrated an American telecommunications company in the summer of 2023, suggesting that China’s attackers penetrated the U.S. communications system far earlier than publicly known.\n\nBloomberg reports that corporate investigators working for an unnamed U.S. telecommunications firm have uncovered that Chinese state-backed hackers had breached the company’s systems in the summer of 2023, nearly a year before the publicly disclosed Salt Typhoon espionage campaign targeting multiple US telecom providers. The discovery, which has not been previously reported, raises questions about the timeline of China’s foothold in the American communications industry.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the matter and an unclassified report seen by Bloomberg News, the investigators found that malware used by Chinese state-backed hacking groups had been present on the company’s systems for seven months, starting in the summer of 2023. The report, sent to Western intelligence agencies, does not name the compromised telecommunications company.\n\nThe 2023 intrusion predates the well-publicized Salt Typhoon campaign, which the US government has attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. In the Salt Typhoon breaches, hackers infiltrated multiple major US telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon Communications, siphoning personal data of millions of Americans and targeting the phones of high-profile individuals such as then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe malware used in the 2023 breach, known as Demodex, is a rootkit that provides hackers with deep and secretive access to infected machines. Several cybersecurity companies have linked Demodex to Chinese hacking groups targeting telecommunications companies and governments in Southeast Asia. The malware has also been tied to the Salt Typhoon attackers and other hacking groups.\n\nIn the 2023 breach, hackers gained access to the computers of IT administrators at the targeted U.S. telecommunications company. The investigation revealed that the malware remained on the firm’s systems until late winter of 2024. Demodex is designed to leave few digital traces, making it challenging to determine the full extent of the hackers’ activities once inside the breached machines.\n\nThe Chinese government embassy in Washington emphasized the difficulty of determining the origins of hacks and accused the US and its allies of being responsible for cyberattacks on China. The embassy spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, called on the relevant party to “stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.”\n\nRead more at Bloomberg here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"Corporate investigators have reportedly discovered evidence that Chinese hackers infiltrated an American telecommunications company in the summer of 2023, suggesting that China's attackers penetrated the U.S. communications system far earlier than publicly known.\n\n\nThe post Report: Chinese Hackers Breached U.S. Telecoms Earlier than Previously Known appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/06/06/report-chinese-hackers-breached-u-s-telecoms-earlier-than-previously-known/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Chinese-hackers-at-work-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 18:51:39","author":"Lucas Nolan","authors":["Lucas Nolan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":328870568,"title":"Trump’s Past Support for the LGBTQ+ Community Turns to Perceived Threat, Activists Claim","text":"WASHINGTON – When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.\n\nIn previous years, he altered the guidelines of his own Miss Universe contest to permit a transgender participant. He supported Caitlyn Jenner’s choice to use any restroom she preferred at Trump Tower and became the first president to appoint an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.\n\nHowever, upon his return to office this year, Trump has initiated what activists describe as an extraordinary attack on the LGBTQ+ community. This aggressive stance by the White House stands in stark contrast to the World Pride festivities happening nearby in Washington, which include a parade and gathering this weekend.\n\n“We are currently experiencing the darkest era since the peak of the AIDS crisis,” said Kevin Jennings, the head of Lambda Legal, a well-established advocacy group. “I am extremely worried that we will witness everything being revoked over the next four years.”\n\nTrump’s defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes. \n\n“He’s working to establish common sense once again,” said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.\n\nHarrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, “the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.” \n\n“The president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,” Fields said. \n\nPresidential actions were widely expected\n\nTrump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January. \n\nHis rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military. Trump has since banned them outright from serving. And although June is recognized nationally as Pride month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Trump has “no plans for a proclamation.”\n\n“I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” she added, making no mention of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n\nWilliams described Pride activities as a progressive catch-all rather than a civil rights campaign. “If you’re not in the mood to protest or resist the Trump administration,” he said, “Pride is not for you.”\n\nTrump declined to issue Pride Month proclamations in his first term, but did recognize the celebration in 2019 as he publicized a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality headed by Richard Grenell, then the U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the highest-profile openly gay person in the administration. (Grenell now serves as envoy for special missions.)\n\n“As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,” Trump posted on social media.\n\nTimes have changed where Trump is concerned\n\nThis time, there is no celebrating.\n\nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump named himself chairman of after firing members of the board of trustees, canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer’s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., at one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.\n\nTrump, who indicated when he took up the position that he would be dictating programming, had specifically said he would end events featuring performers in drag. The exterior lights that once lit the venue on the Potomac River in the colors of the rainbow were quickly replaced with red, white and blue.\n\nMultiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. \n\nInside the White House, there’s little second-guessing about the president’s stances. Trump aides have pointed to their decision to seize on culture wars surrounding transgender rights during the 2024 campaign as key to their win. They poured money into ads aimed at young men — especially young Hispanic men — attacking Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for supporting “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” including one spot aired during football games.\n\n“Kamala is for they/them.

You’re throwing trans people out of the military. That’s example No. 1.” \n\nHe points to the cancellation of scientific grants and funding for HIV/AIDS organizations, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s “petty and mean” order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which commemorates the gay rights activist and Navy veteran.\n\nJennings also said it doesn’t help that Trump has appointed openly gay men like Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to high-profile positions: “I would call it window dressing.”\n\nLess tolerance for the issues as time passes\n\nCraig Konnoth, a University of Virginia professor of civil rights, compared the U.S.’ trajectory to that of Russia, which has seen a crackdown on gay and lesbian rights after a long stretch of more progressive policies. In 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism.\n\nWilliams said Trump has made the Republican Party more accepting of gay people. First lady Melania Trump, he noted, has hosted fundraisers for his organization.\n\n“On the whole, we think he’s the best president ever for our community. He’s managed to support us in ways that we have never been supported by any administration,” Williams said. “We are vastly accepted within our party now.”\n\nTrump’s approach to LGBTQ+ rights comes amid a broader shift among Republicans, who have grown less tolerant in recent years.\n\nWhile overall support for same-sex marriage has been stable, according to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who think marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized as valid with the same rights as traditional marriage dropped to 41% this year. That’s the lowest point since 2016, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and a substantial decline from a high of 55% in 2021. \n\nThere’s been a similar drop in the share of Republicans who say that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, which has dropped from 56% in 2022 to 38% this year. Democrats, meanwhile, continue to overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and say that same-sex relations are morally acceptable.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from May also found that Trump’s approach to handling transgender issues has been a point of relative strength for the president. About half (52%) of U.S. adults said they approve of how he’s handling transgender issues — a figure higher than his overall job approval (41%). \n\nDouglas Page, who studies politics and gender at Gettysburg College, said that “trans rights are less popular than gay rights, with a minority of Republicans in favor of trans rights. This provides incentives for Republicans to speak to the conservative side of that issue.”\n\n“Gay people are less controversial to Republicans compared to trans people,” he said in an email, “so gay appointees like Secretary Bessent probably won’t ruffle many feathers.”\n\nColvin reported from New York.

Why?","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has directed his administration to investigate his predecessor Joe Biden’s actions as president, including whether any orders or pardons he signed with an autopen are valid amid recent reporting that has raised questions around Biden’s “cognitive decline.”\n\nThe move is the boldest yet in Trump’s campaign against his political rivals and the quest by Republicans to overturn Biden’s legacy, which has been marred by growing questions about his ability to run the country that Trump is further amplifying.\n\nTrump on Thursday called Biden’s alleged use of an autopen without his knowledge “the biggest scandal” in American political history, without providing any evidence.\n\n“It’s a very bad thing, very dangerous,” Trump said in the Oval Office, arguing that, “essentially, whoever used the autopen was the president.”\n\nPolitical experts say Trump’s investigation, which was ordered in a memorandum signed Wednesday, is baseless and breaks with decades of legal precedent.\n\n“There’s no evidence that any of the moves that (Biden) made as president, in legislation or negotiations with other countries or military actions or anything, were affected by cognitive decline,” said Matthew Lebo, a political science professor at Western University.\n\nBiden responded in a statement Wednesday night after Trump’s directive was issued: “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”\n\nAn autopen, a tool that automatically generates signatures, has been used by U.S. presidents dating back to Thomas Jefferson in the 1800s. Trump has used it himself, but said Thursday that he limits its use to personal correspondence.\n\nThe Justice Department under Democratic and Republican administrations has recognized the use of an autopen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades, and the president’s absolute pardon power is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 2005, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush’s presidency found that “the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it within the meaning of” the constitution after conducting a review of the autopen’s legality.\n\nTrump’s memorandum suggests Biden’s aides “abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline and assert” presidential authority.\n\nIt adds that there are “serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden’s awareness” of the executive orders, memorandums, judicial appointments, and pardons and commutations signed during Biden’s presidency.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice, told Global News in an email that “the issue is authority, not the physical act of signing or an ink signature.”\n\n“As long as President Biden authorized the use of the autopen, documents signed with an autopen are legally valid,” he said.\n\n“Trump or others who are challenging the pardons will have to establish that Biden did not authorize the autopen signatures or the pardons themselves. This would be difficult to do without Biden himself saying the pardons were unauthorized.”\n\nBiden pardoned several of Trump and Republicans’ top political targets, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, in the final days of his presidency.\n\nTrump has presented no evidence that Biden was unaware of the actions taken in his name. He said Thursday that he witnessed Biden’s decline first-hand at their sole debate of the 2024 election last June.\n\n“I was in a debate with the human mind, and I didn’t think he knew what the hell he was doing,” he said.\n\nThat disastrous debate performance pushed questions about Biden’s age and mental acuity to the forefront, ultimately leading him to withdraw from the presidential race three weeks later. He was replaced on the ticket by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Trump.\n\nThe debate came months after U.S. special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden’s handling of classified documents, concluded in a final report that a jury wouldn’t convict Biden because they would see him as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\nTrump’s memorandum cites that report, and further directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate any actions by Biden’s aides and White House staff to “cover up his inability to discharge his duties” and shield him from the public.\n\nRepublicans are also asking Biden’s top aides to testify about the final days of the last administration and “who was calling the shots,” the head of the U.S. Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, said in a statement Wednesday. Comer on Thursday subpoenaed Biden’s White House physicians to testify.\n\nSince the election, a growing number of Democrats have come forward to acknowledge Biden had declined in the final years of his presidency, and that his closest aides hid that fact from lawmakers, donors, party leadership and voters.\n\nIn a recently released book titled Original Sin, authors Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios wrote, “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.”\n\nBiden’s White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, who fiercely defended him against questions about his fitness for office, is set to release a new book in October that her publisher says will examine what led up to Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nLebo said questions about Biden’s decision-making still pale in comparison with Trump’s actions in the White House.\n\n“Biden had gaffes, but Donald Trump’s gaffes become policy,” he said.\n\n“It’s part of the authoritarian playbook to challenge everything done by the opposition as illegitimate.”\n\n— with files from Global’s Reggie Cecchini and The Associated Press","summary":"The move is the boldest yet in Trump's campaign against his political rivals and the quest by Republicans to overturn Biden's legacy.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11214663/trump-biden-investigation-autopen/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2194358329.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 18:34:37","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":328886060,"title":"Trump once opened the door to the LGBTQ+ community.

He said Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom at Trump Tower that she wanted. And he was the first president to name an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.\n\nBut since returning to office this year, Trump has engaged in what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community. The threat from the White House contrasts with World Pride celebrations taking place just blocks away in Washington, including a parade and rally this weekend. \n\n“We are in the darkest period right now since the height of the AIDS crisis,” said Kevin Jennings, who leads Lambda Legal, a longtime advocacy organization. “I am deeply concerned that we’re going to see it all be taken away in the next four years.”\n\nTrump’s defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes. \n\n“He’s working to establish common sense once again,” said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.\n\nHarrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, “the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.” \n\n“The president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,” Fields said. \n\nPresidential actions were widely expected\n\nTrump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January. \n\nHis rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military.

The first episode of the series documents Trump's \"first day\" on the job from the very beginning, as he requested to work the french fry cooker and learned the process. He walked through, step-by-step, dunking fries into hot oil, shaking the basket, pouring servings into the signature red McDonald's cartons and sprinkling salt over them. ART OF THE SURGE: BEHIND THE SCENES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ROAD BACK TO WHITE HOUSE It became an iconic moment on the campaign trail as the notorious New York City business magnate-turned-president performed a job many Americans have had at one point in their lives. He even greeted customers wrapped around the building at the drive-thru window. As one family took a Happy Meal from his hands he quipped with a smile, \"It's going to be the best you've ever had. It had better be. I made it myself.\" Customers passed on their messages of encouragement as the high-stakes faceoff with then-vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was merely two weeks away, with both teams in a mad sprint to the finish line. CUSTOMERS AT THE MCDONALD'S TRUMP VISITED APPLAUD HIM FOR MAKING ‘CONTACT WITH THE LITTLE GUY’ \"Make America great again!\" one driver said. Another, shaking hands with Trump, said, \"45-47, you've got this, sir.\" Trump paused, on occasion, to wave at the mass of fans cheering and holding \"Trump-Vance\" signs nearby. He told WTXF reporter JoAnn Pileggi that the crowd was smiling and upbeat because they wanted hope. Turning back inside the building, he faced the camera at one point and smiled as he noted how much fun he was having. OPINION: DEMOCRATS CAN'T BUY ANYTHING LIKE TRUMP'S GENUINE AUTHENTICITY \"I could do this all day. I wouldn't mind this job,\" he said. Trump's efforts were viewed by many as a mockery of a claim his opponent had worked for the fast food chain while in college. At one point, Trump even remarked, \"I've now worked for 15 minutes. Fifteen more than Kamala.\" As his team departed on his personal plane, Trump's deputy director of communications Margo Martin enthused about the day.

Presumably, Musk expected repayment of his loyalty in the form of favorable terms for his companies’ federal contracts and the occasional marketing event on the White House lawn. But Trump has been stiffing contractors for decades, and his obsession with optics was incompatible with his patron-supplicant’s unsettling behavior. On May 30th, at Musk’s stilted sendoff in the Oval Office, he sported a mysterious black eye and indulged in a very specific style of swaying on his feet—while clenched of jaw and dissociative of affect—that appeared less suited to the present-day White House than to a Slowdive concert circa 1991. (The Bluesky user News Eye added a reassuring caption to this queasily compelling footage: “It’s fine, he’s just got all your personal data.”)\nIn the course of Wednesday, Thursday, and into Friday, the Trump-Musk spat unfolded via press conference, Truth Social, and X (as @Fred_Delicious observed, “This is like kendrick vs drake but with two drakes”). Musk struck out harder but couldn’t land a blow, largely because his objections to the President—that Trump is fixated on tariffs that could be economically ruinous, that he advocates budgets that would drive up the deficit—were all common knowledge long before Musk told Joe Rogan that “if we don’t elect Trump I think we will lose democracy in this country.” With the Epstein allegations, Musk strained for the buzzy suspense of waiting for the Mueller report, or for Geraldo Rivera to open Al Capone’s vault: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” But Trump and Epstein’s association has been out in the open for nearly a quarter century; nineties-era footage of the gruesome twosome together at Mar-a-Lago, leering at a group of young cheerleaders, has been circulating since at least 2019. (“The Plan?” @theemmamont jokingly posted to X above a still of Nathan Fielder, in his “Nathan for You” persona, wearing a confident smile. “Spend millions to get a pedophile elected, and then tell everyone he’s a pedophile.”) On Thursday, when a reporter asked Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, about the Epstein allegations, she dismissed them as “an unfortunate episode from Elon.”\nTrump has kept the upper hand so far, partly because of the Presidential bully pulpit, and partly because he has remained relatively understated. He acknowledged on Truth Social that, before departing the Administration, “Elon was ‘wearing thin.’ ” (A white-phosphorus puff of insult by America’s preëminent insult comic—the faux-genteel restraint of the quotation marks is perfect.) “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote in another post. These views may well have bipartisan support. In a large recent poll by the market-research company AtlasIntel, fifty-seven per cent of respondents were found to have an unfavorable view of Musk.\nOf course, if a prominent individual in government with conservative or even reactionary views indicates their displeasure with Trump, that’s a signal to the Democratic Party that the center can hold, that a fanciful abundance of swing voters can be yet persuaded of the error of their ways. (This worked out great when, for example, Kamala Harris gave over several precious days of her short Presidential campaign to a right-wing former congresswoman.) Representative Ro Khanna, of California, espying an opportunity in the Trump-Musk fracas, urged Democrats to “be in a dialogue” with the lead assassin of DOGE. (Like movie dialogue? Or as some kind of literary device?) Representative Ritchie Torres, of New York, said, of Musk—who has spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and seemingly performed Nazi salutes in public—“I’m a believer in redemption, and he is telling the truth about the legislation.”\nAt the same time, a Democrat must not appear to be too captivated by significant and consequential public conflict between the two most powerful and destructive men in the country. Though A.O.C. quipped, “The girls are fighting, aren’t they?” and Chuck Schumer workshopped a Taylor Swift joke, perhaps the most statesmanlike Democratic response is simply to roll your eyes, as Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, did via X: “When 15 million Americans lose their health care and plunge into personal crisis, none of them are going to give a shit about a made-for-clicks twitter fight between two billionaires arguing about who gets the bigger share of the corruption spoils.” It’s difficult to parse the meaning of this statement, given that the two billionaires in question are the ones plunging us into crisis.\nAs is usually the case, it was the rightward and reactionary forces in our politics who knew what they wanted out of what they were watching, and how to put it into words. Before Thursday was out, Steve Bannon was urging Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act in order to “seize SpaceX tonight before midnight.” (“lol the socialist revolution has begun,” David Dayen, the editor of The American Prospect announced on X). Discussing Musk with the Times, Bannon said that the Trump Administration “should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately.” It’s likely that nothing will come of these stated desires, but they have value unto themselves for being clearly and forcefully articulated.\nTrump and Musk may kiss and make up by week’s end—they may be simply “in a dialogue” of their usual stupid bullshit. (Ye, for one, is hoping for healing: “Broooos please noooooo 🫂,” he lamented on X after the fight became public. “We love you both so much.”) Or the rift may persist: on Friday morning, Trump told ABC News that, despite reports that he had a call planned with Musk, he was “not particularly” interested in speaking with “the man who has lost his mind,” and a White House official stated that Trump intends to sell the red Tesla he recently purchased. And yet, no matter how this plays out, I understand exactly what these awful people want, what they believe, what motivates them. I can’t say that for the other side, which only knows appeasement, rapprochement, and performed disdain. All they can do is watch.\nThey could at least try to come up with better jokes. Or some oratory—or dialogue! Just some good writing, before it’s only robots doing it. During Napoleon’s doomed Russian campaign, as he was entering Moscow, the Russian Army set the city on fire, which accelerated his defeat and downfall. “Mountains of red, rolling flames,” Napoleon recalled, of seeing Moscow burn, “like immense waves of the sea. Oh, it was the most grand, the most sublime, and the most terrifying sight the world ever beheld.” ♦","summary":"The President has kept the upper hand so far, partly because of his bully pulpit, and partly because he has remained relatively understated.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-sublime-spectacle-of-donald-trump-and-elon-musks-social-media-slap-fight","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6843128f62d4fb6d8c2122e5/16:9/w_4960,h_2790,c_limit/Winter-Breakup16-9.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 17:07:43","author":"Jessica Winter","authors":["Jessica Winter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.142},{"id":328845716,"title":"AOC takes victory lap as Trump-Elon nuclear breakup confirms everything she and Bernie Sanders warned","text":"Rep.

And in a new interview, the country star shared what he really thought of the moment that sparked a social media rampage led by the president against one of the country star’s musical heroes.\n\n Speaking to Rolling Stone in an open-ended interview published Friday (June 6), Church made it clear that he thinks Springsteen — who made headlines for calling the White House “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” at his kickoff Land of Hope & Dreams Tour show in May — has the right “to say and do what he wants.” \n\n “I respect the hell out of somebody having the balls to do something like that,” he told the publication. “If you’re Bruce Springsteen, at 75 years old, if that’s what floats your boat, then you should do that. I was just ready to hear ‘Chimes of Freedom.'”\n\n Regardless of whether you agree with Springsteen’s comments, Church — who in 2011 paid tribute to the New Jersey rocker on Billboard Hot 100 No. 19 hit “Springsteen” — added that he thinks the passion behind the moment only elevated the show itself. “You could tell he wanted to get something off his chest,” said the “Heart on Fire” artist. “It added a little more, whatever that was … angst … and the show was fantastic. Best Springsteen show I’ve seen.”\n\n The topic of the E Street bandleader’s viral speech came up as Church was discussing his thoughts on America’s political landscape, which has been more fraught than ever since Trump returned to office in January. Following the Manchester show, the twice-impeached POTUS ranted on Truth Social that Springsteen was “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker,” later lobbing long-debunked accusations that the “Born in the U.S.A.” musician had participated in an “illegal election scam” for Kamala Harris.\n\n Meanwhile, Americans’ satisfaction with the economy under Trump has been dropping, while many people have been calling out the president’s administration for working to slash funding for programs supporting reproductive healthcare, LGBTQ rights and more. But as the divide between Democrats and Republicans deepens, Church told Rolling Stone that he thinks pledging unconditional allegiance to any one political party is “total bulls–t.”\n\n “I have a problem with the political system where I believe things on both sides, but if I have to pick a party, it means that I can’t believe some of those things,” he told the publication. “If I’m a Republican or I’m a Democrat, I have to be all Republican or all Democrat, and there’s no way those guys and girls believe that. There’s no f–king way.”\n\n Even so, Church doesn’t want to label himself as an “independent. “It sounds like I can’t make up my mind,” he said. “I bristle at that. But if you look at how broad these issues and topics are, I think there’s a small percentage of Americans that truly believe in 100 percent of a party’s platform. Most Americans go back and forth. I change my mind all the damn time.”\n\n The interview comes about a month after the release of Church’s new album, Evangeline vs. the Machine, which debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 in May. The North Carolina native also recently appeared on Morgan Wallen’s chart-topping new album, I’m the Problem, guesting on the song “Number 3 and Number 7,” which entered at No. 52 on the Hot 100 and No. 27 on the Hot Country Songs chart.","summary":"\"I respect the hell out of somebody having the balls to do something like that,\" the country star said of The Boss.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/eric-church-defends-bruce-springsteen-donald-trump-slam-1235991277/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/eric-church-acm-awards-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 16:12:50","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":328821916,"title":"Trump-Musk feud: Who deserves the most credit for president's resounding 2024 White House win?","text":"As the war of words between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk rages, it's sparked a new debate over how decisive the world's richest person was in helping Trump recapture the White House in the 2024 election. The president, speaking with reporters, argued, \"I think I would have won\" even without Musk's help on the campaign trail last year. Musk, firing back, argued that \"without me, Trump would have lost the election.\" While the once-strong alliance between Trump and Musk rapidly disintegrated on Thursday as the two traded barbs over the president's \"big, beautiful\" tax cuts and spending bill, the zingers also extended to other topics, including last year's presidential election. MUSK MAY SPEAK WITH TRUMP AIDES IN PUSH TO END FEUD WITH PRESIDENT Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, went all in for Trump last summer and autumn. He endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in July right after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS STAND FIRM AGAINST MUSK'S ‘KILL THE BILL’ ASSAULT ON TRUMP'S AGENDA Musk became the top donor of the 2024 election cycle, dishing out nearly $300 million in support of Trump's bid through America PAC, a Trump-aligned super PAC. Much of the money was used for get-out-the-vote efforts and ads in the crucial battleground states as Trump and Kamala Harris faced off for the presidency. Musk concentrated much of his efforts on Pennsylvania. He joined Trump for the first time on the campaign trail at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, then held five town halls in the Keystone State later in October. And Musk set up a war room of sorts in Pittsburgh. Trump, mentioning how Musk campaigned for him in Pennsylvania, pointed to his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who was co-chair of Trump's 2024 campaign. The president noted that \"Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway.\" MUSK'S FISCAL CONSERVATIVE EVOLUTION PUTS HIM AT ODDS WITH TRUMP Musk, apparently watching Trump's comments in real time, quickly fired back on X, which Musk renamed after buying Twitter. \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk wrote. \"Such ingratitude.\" Veteran Republican strategist John Brabender, who served as a media consultant to the 2024 Trump campaign, told Fox News Digital that \"Elon and many others played an important role in helping the president win states all across America.\" \"But the bottom line is there’s only one constant and one person who is most responsible, by far, and that’s President Trump. That’s who people voted for,\" Brabender added. Longtime Republican consultant Dave Carney, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns over the past few decades, said the president and Musk are both right. Carney, who steered Preserve America, another top-spending Trump-aligned super PAC, told Fox News that Trump \"might have won without the help, but you can't underestimate how important that help was.\" Pointing to Preserve America, Musk's America PAC and MAGA Inc, which was the main Trump-aligned super PAC, Carney said they all deserved \"a tremendous amount of credit\" and \"just made it easier\" for Trump to sweep all seven battleground states and win the White House. Carney also highlighted the Musk-aligned super PAC's \"unprecedented field effort, mail and other communications … to turn out these low-propensity Trump voters.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tom Eddy, the GOP chairman in Erie County, a longtime crucial swing county in the northwestern corner of battleground Pennsylvania, told Fox News that Musk \"helped Trump significantly. I really think so. He had money, and he had a name.\" But Eddy added that \"my gut feeling would be that Trump is basically saying, ‘Look. I won the election. These people helped me, but I won.’ That's what he's trying to bring across.\" In battleground Michigan, veteran Republican strategist Dennis Lennox pointed to Musk's comments and told Fox News \"it’s incredibly arrogant to say that, but it’s probably true.\"","summary":"Former allies President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trading fire over credit for the 2024 election win, with Musk highlighting his fundraising and campaigning in battlegrounds.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-musk-feud-who-deserves-most-credit-presidents-resounding-2024-white-house-win","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/musk-trump-handshake.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 15:42:24","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":328819278,"title":"Republican Gets Good Sign in New Jersey Governor's Race Poll","text":"Republican New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli received a potentially good sign about his favorability in a new poll of Garden State voters days ahead of the primary election.Newsweek has contacted Ciattarelli's and Representative Mikie Sherrill's campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersNew Jersey voters are set to head to the polls next Tuesday to pick party nominees for the gubernatorial race scheduled for November. The competitiveness of the election could hinge on which candidates prevail in the primaries, and the race has major implications for both parties.The election may indicate whether Democrats are winning back key voter groups that shifted right in the 2024 presidential race—such as young adults and Latinos—or whether Republicans can continue winning those groups even though President Donald Trump's approval has dropped since January.What To KnowA new poll conducted by SurveyUSA found that Ciattarelli, who is viewed as a strong favorite to win the GOP nomination next week, is viewed favorably by a similar percentage of New Jersey voters as Sherrill, the Democrat who has held a narrow but consistent lead in primary election polls. However, Sherrill is viewed unfavorably by a smaller percent of voters.The poll found that 40 percent of voters viewed Ciattarelli favorably, while 41 percent viewed Sherrill favorably. Meanwhile, 36 percent viewed Ciattarelli unfavorably, while 29 percent viewed Sherrill unfavorably.Twenty-five percent of respondents were unfamiliar with Ciattarelli, while 30 percent were unfamiliar with Sherrill. The poll surveyed 576 likely voters from May 28 to 30 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.Ciattarelli was the GOP's nominee in the 2021 gubernatorial race, when he came close to unseating Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, losing by about 3 percentage points. Independent polling on the general election hasn't been released, but Republicans are hoping to build on the increased support Trump saw in the state in November.While Joe Biden won the state easily in 2020, securing victory by 16 percentage points, Democratic support collapsed in the state last year. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by only 6 points—the closet margin since 2004.Shifts in heavily Latino areas in the north of the state, as well as eroding Democratic support in South Jersey, contributed to the shift.The latest head-to-head poll of the Democratic primary showed Sherrill leading the Democratic side with 28 percent of the vote, followed by Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Representative Josh Gottheimer each at 11 percent. Emerson College conducted the poll between May 11 and 13 among 386 likely voters. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.What People Are SayingDemocratic Representative Mikie Sherrill's campaign manager, Alex Ball, told Newsweek in May: \"New Jersey saw in the debate why Mikie Sherrill continues to lead in every poll: her lifelong commitment to service, strong record getting big things done and her ability to beat Trump Republicans at every turn. Republicans are afraid to go up against Mikie in November because she knows how to win and then deliver for New Jerseyans.\"Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli said on Fox & Friends First on Tuesday: \"We're in a very commanding position in the primary. We're not taking anything for granted. We'll finish strong over the last week; early voting does start today. We'll be up and down the state once again delivering our message that there's only one Republican who can win in November, and that's why I'm honored to have President Trump's complete and total endorsement. I really am. Having his faith, trust and confidence. He knows New Jersey is in play.\"What Happens NextAfter the June 10 primary, voters are set to head to the polls for the general election on November 4. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as leaning Democrat—meaning it is \"considered competitive,\" but the Democrats have \"an advantage.\"","summary":"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the top Democratic candidate are viewed favorably by a similar percentage of voters, a poll shows.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-good-sign-new-jersey-governor-race-poll-favorability-2081969","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2658134/jack-ciattarelli-poll-new-jersey-governor-race.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 15:29:13","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":328885220,"title":"Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on Defying ICE and Charting a New Course for Democrats","text":"In May, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka made headlines when he was arrested during a protest outside of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey and charged with trespassing. Baraka has staunchly opposed the reopening of the 1,000-bed detention center, called Delaney Hall, since Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a deal with the private prison company that owns it. The trespassing charge against Baraka was later dismissed, but he told supporters that he had been “targeted” by the Trump administration for speaking out. On Tuesday, he filed a lawsuit against Alina Habba, the interim US attorney for New Jersey, claiming that he had been maliciously prosecuted. \n\nThe encounter drew national attention at an opportune moment for Baraka, whose gubernatorial campaign has gained unexpected traction. An idiosyncratic figure, he is known for his radical political upbringing and his surprising success addressing violent crime in Newark. He is the son of Amiri Baraka, the firebrand poet and activist who spearheaded the Black Arts Movement, and Amina Baraka, also a central figure in the city’s Black cultural and political scene. Baraka followed in his parents’ shoes in both regards. In 2003, he performed a spoken word poem on HBO’s Def Poetry Jam. He was a school teacher and public school principal before becoming mayor in 2014. \n\nAs mayor, Baraka has been unapologetically progressive on most counts and shown an unusual willingness to experiment with policy. During his tenure, Newark conducted a guaranteed income pilot program, allowed 16-year-olds to vote in school board races, and, in an effort to boost homeownership, held a lottery that allowed residents to purchase city-owned properties for $1. Newark has seen significant decreases in most categories of crime since Baraka took office and, in 2022, homicides hit a 60-year-low. Baraka notably broke from the left in 2020, when he rebuffed calls to defund the police and described it as a “bourgeois liberal” stance that did little to address systemic problems. \n\nBaraka is perhaps the most interesting personality in a crowded Democratic primary to replace term-limited New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. He is running to the left of a field that includes Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop; US Rep. Josh Gottheimer; US Rep. Mikie Sherrill; former state Sen. Stephen Sweeney; and Sean Spiller, president of the state’s largest teacher’s union. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, pulled ahead of the pack with a 17-point lead in a recent poll. Baraka and a handful of other candidates were clustered around 11 percent. \n\nIt’s highly likely that the general election will also be competitive. President Donald Trump recently campaigned for former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, who is favored to win the Republican primary. And last November, Kamala Harris won New Jersey by only six points—a significant downturn from Biden’s 16-point victory in 2020. \n\nSo it is remarkable that Baraka has centered his campaign on a full-throated defense of immigrants. The positions that have cemented Baraka’s popularity in Newark may not play as well in a state-wide primary—or in the general election. New Jersey is mostly suburban and around 60 percent white. If he wins, Baraka would be the state’s first Black governor. \n\nEarlier this week, I traveled to Newark to interview Baraka. It was a sweltering afternoon, and the downtown business district was sedate. Outside of a Kenyan restaurant, an aide pointed to the city’s changing skyline as evidence of the success of the mayor’s housing agenda: There were several high-rise apartment buildings going up, each representing hundreds of affordable units. Inside, I met Baraka, who was wearing a gray suit and a floral tie. Though he is a commanding presence on the debate stage, he was soft-spoken and unhurried during our interview. He seemed a bit world-weary—the primary is in its home stretch. Early voting is already underway, and election day is this Tuesday. \n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. \n\nWhat was it like growing up in Newark with two very prominent artists and activists as parents? \n\nI grew up in the heart of the South Ward, and the block was filled with its share of folks who were prominent in our community. We always had people come over—artists and musicians and poets and community activists from around the world.\n\nIt was pretty different growing up in that kind of environment. Early on, we were a part of what was called the African Free School [an alternative community school founded by Baraka’s parents]. My parents were also involved in electing the first African American mayor of Newark [Kenneth Gibson] and in the 1972 National Black Political Convention. There was both positive recognition from the community, and people who didn’t like my father. He was always center stage, whether you wanted it to be that way or not. \n\nWhat your parents were doing was community activism, which is very different from running for public office. \n\nCompletely different. \n\nHow did you decide to get involved in electoral politics?\n\nI was a community activist when I was a teacher. We would always be marching and protesting down to City Hall. And I wondered, why are we coming here to this building? \n\nWhen I was 24, I ran for mayor. We raised $10,000 from fish fries and poetry readings. I remember debating [Newark Mayor] Sharpe James and William Payne [who later became a state assemblyman]. It’s like you’re in a fight and you get hit a couple of times, but you don’t get knocked out. You think, “Oh, I can handle this.”\n\nThat was my first foray into understanding what political power meant, as opposed to just having a defensive strategy. What does it mean to go on offense?\n\nOne of your platforms at the time was universal healthcare. Do you think that coming into office requires giving up on some of that progressive idealism and moderating? \n\nNo. I think that all of the things that we’re trying to do can get done. But they have to get done in this way. I just told somebody yesterday that I’m a Democrat because that’s the only weapon we have. The Democratic Party is the tool that we have to push the ideas we want to push, and organize the things we want to organize—right until something else is created.\n\nAll of the things that we’re trying to make happen—whether it’s universal healthcare or free education—that struggle is protracted, and it may take stages. But we have to do our part until other people can take it a little further than we can. There were no breakfast programs in schools until the Black Panthers started them, and public housing was an issue that came from the community. A lot of these things may start in a humble, small place and become more universal, more acceptable, through education and advocacy.\n\nHow do you strike a balance between meeting people where they are and persuading them on issues?\n\nI learned that early on. I lost a lot of races because I thought I was right and other people were wrong. It was actually me being wrong, because I could not unite what I was saying to the things that they thought that were important. \n\nMy mother used to say you can’t bring people to the community meeting if they’re hungry. You got to feed them first, and then they’ll come to the meeting. The reality is, we have to meet people’s needs in order to make them care about the things that we think are important. To talk to them about why they don’t have food in the first place, right? \n\nI think the Democrats have it a little backwards. They like to have these discussions without people eating. People have to eat first, then you can talk to them about billionaires who are taking their resources away. \n\nThis seems like a good time to turn to Delaney Hall and your sustained activism around the administration’s immigration agenda. Why has that been so central for you? \n\nI think what these people are doing is dangerous, and if we allow it to continue to happen, many of us will be in jeopardy. Our lives, our rights, our democracy will be in jeopardy. \n\nSo it’s more than just what the polls say. You’re not pushing for things simply because they’re popular. I would imagine that people’s sentiment prior to Trump’s re-election is completely different than what it is now. Across this country, people are coming out of their houses, videotaping and trying to stop ICE from kidnapping people off the street. \n\nAre you able to talk about your arrest and the lawsuit that was just filed?\n\nThe irony is that they keep saying that we tried to get arrested. Well, you don’t have to try to get arrested. They were itching to do that from the very sight of me.\n\nThey had no lawful reason to arrest me. Trespassing is a state charge that you get a summons for. You don’t get handcuffed, fingerprinted, have a mug shot taken, and be interrogated in a room. That doesn’t happen for a Class E misdemeanor, certainly not here in New Jersey. \n\nThese people violated my rights, and, more importantly, they violated the constitution of this country. They think they can do it arbitrarily, and nobody should say anything about it. So I don’t agree with that. I think somebody should say something about it.\n\nWhat’s the significance of the Trump administration potentially targeting an elected official?\n\nThey just don’t care. And that’s really the danger of it. The cameras, the videos, should give you some pause, but it doesn’t. They lied on TV. When I got out of the holding cell, I had to listen to these people saying all this stuff that didn’t happen: that we broke the law. That the Congresswoman [LaMonica McIver] assaulted people. That we slammed ICE agents, and we barged our way into this place. All of this was not true. I thought I was in The Twilight Zone. And so we just started dropping the footage everywhere, so they could see what these people are manufacturing—lies.\n\nI want to turn to the governor’s race. Affordability has been a common platform in the Democratic primary, but it was also one of the most persuasive issues that Trump ran on last November. Nationally, Democrats have had trouble convincing voters that they’re willing to prioritize affordability. How are you confronting that? \n\nI think the Democratic message is right. People want the message; they just don’t like the messengers. We’re now yelling and screaming at Donald Trump’s spending plan that’s given some billion dollars of tax breaks to the wealthy, but the Democrats have talked about doing the same thing. The party of working families has not helped working families. \n\nHealth care in New Jersey is too high. Insurance companies and hospitals are killing us economically, and nobody is reining them in. LLCs are buying up all these properties and driving our mortgages up artificially, and nobody is reining them in. Childcare costs are higher than people’s rent. We can’t solve these problems. We don’t have the will to, and so people lose faith in our ability to govern. \n\nDemocrats are mistaking other Democrats staying home for approval for Donald Trump. It’s not approval for Trump. It’s disapproval for you. \n\nYou’ve campaigned on your record as the mayor of Newark, but this city is demographically and geographically different from the rest of New Jersey. How do those accomplishments translate to statewide issues?\n\nThe issues are the same: housing, crime, the environment, access to education and opportunity. We have reduced people’s healthcare costs in Newark. We have created homeownership. We have reduced crime. \n\nIt’s a mistake to think there are Black problems and white problems. Black people have a specific and unique history in this country that causes us to experience problems disproportionately. Doesn’t mean that other people don’t have them. \n\nMaybe it’d be useful to talk specifically about affordable housing, which is an issue that can be very divisive in some of the suburban areas of the state. How are you talking to voters about your platform on that?\n\nWhen people think of affordable housing, they think of a 30-story housing project full of poverty and violence. That idea is fueled by prejudice and racism. But affordability is a problem for everybody in New Jersey. In order to drive your taxes down, drive your rents down, drive your mortgages down, you have to build more housing. That’s just simple supply and demand that you learn in capitalism. Nobody disagrees that we need to build more housing. They just disagree on how and where.\n\nWhen you’re out in the suburbs talking to those voters, who are predominantly white, are you trying to change the face of affordable housing?\n\nThe atmosphere has changed it for us. We just have to state it right. People know their children can’t afford to live here. They’re spending 30 or 50 percent of their income on rent. They’re living in their childhood bedrooms and attics and basements. When I say it, people laugh, because they know it’s true. \n\nThey know who these people are, right? I don’t have to change their face. It’s them. Your taxes are going up. You’re one month away from not being able to pay your mortgage, because it’s going up. It’s getting incredibly hard for you to sustain yourself. That resonates in everybody’s community, even in the suburbs. \n\nTo end on a lighter note, a video of you performing on HBO’s Def Poetry Jam has been featured in Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour. Did you know that was happening? \n\nI didn’t know that she was going to do that. I was shocked and humbled. I wrote that decades ago, fresh out of college. I would have never known—I didn’t even know Beyoncé when I wrote that. I don’t think there was a Beyoncé.","summary":"In May, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka made headlines when he was arrested during a protest outside of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey and charged with trespassing.

Plans for the merger became more complicated last October when Trump sued CBS News, which Paramount owns, and its news program, 60 Minutes.\n\nAt the heart of the lawsuit, in which Trump is seeking more than $25 million, is an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris the program aired before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argue that the editing of a long-winded answer the then-Democratic presidential nominee gave was “deceitful.”\n\nHarris was shown giving two different answers to the same question during a preview of the episode on Face the Nation and when the 60 Minutes episode aired later that day.\n\n60 Minutes fired back, calling Trump’s claims “false” and arguing that they edited the interview to be “more succinct.”\n\n“60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,” the program said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that Paramount has offered Trump a $15 settlement, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThis prompted Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ron Wyden of Oregon to write a letter to Redstone, warning the executive that Paramount “may be breaking the law.”\n\n“Paramount appears to be trying to settle a lawsuit that it has assessed as ‘completely without merit,’ and moderating the content of its programs in order to obtain approval of this merger. Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act,” the letter read.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/paramount-chair-shari-redstone-confirms-042317543.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/69caa3ad22f4772e353a8a907a3848c9","video":"","publish_date":"2025-06-06 15:06:00","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":328796046,"title":"‘I’m More Confident Now’: Sarah McBride Reflects on Trans Attacks in Congress","text":"On election night, as she endured the grueling hours between polling place closures and the first waves of results, Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.) declared that she was going to throw up.\n\n “It’s weird to know that you’re in a fork in your life as it’s actually happening,” McBride said, shortly before giddily announcing to her campaign staff that early results showed her overperforming former vice president and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. \n\n The unguarded moment will be revealed for the first time on Saturday, when State of Firsts — a new documentary from director Chase Joynt and producers Jenna Kelly and Justin Lacob — premieres at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. \n\n The documentary follows McBride over the course of her successful campaign to become the first openly transgender person ever elected to Congress, and the onslaught of Republican attacks against her after she won. \n\n “One of the things that wasn’t captured is that I was worried that I was going to underperform because I was trans,” McBride tells Rolling Stone ahead of the film’s debut. “Right before the polls closed, I said, OK, I think I underperformed by two points,’ and I would have been happy just to perform on par with other Democrats. For that not to have been the case was meaningful to me, given my expectations.” \n\n When the votes were fully tallied, McBride won the election handily despite targeted attacks against her identity as a transgender woman from her local opponents, and a national campaign vilifying transgender Americans by Donald Trump and the Republican Party. McBride’s historic victory in Delaware was one of the few highlights for Democrats on Election Night, as by the following morning Trump had soundly defeated Harris, and by the end of the week Republicans had seized control of both chambers of Congress. \n\n State of Firsts paints a picture of a woman caught in a tug of war between the laurels of historic achievement, the expectations of both her constituents in Delaware as well as the trans community, and the emotional terror of being a target of the GOP’s anti-trans vitriol.\n\n The documentary goes behind the scenes of McBride’s response to Republican efforts to ban her from using women’s bathrooms in the Capitol following her election. Before McBride even took her oath of office, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) — who in 2023 called herself “pro-transgender rights” — and Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) launched a public effort to have their newly elected colleague banned from using the women’s restroom and other sex-segregated spaces for women in the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would ultimately enforce such a rule. \n\n “If you would have asked me three months ago what bathroom I would use in the Capitol, I would have said, ‘Oh I’ll just use the women’s restroom,” or [that I would] “just go to the private bathrooms,” McBride recalls in the film during a venting session in her car. “And then the election happened, and Republicans maintained control of the House, and I started to think ‘they’re going to try to ban me from the restrooms.’”\n\n McBride emphasizes throughout the documentary that at different points in her life she has oscillated between the roles of advocate and activist — and considers them to be distinct. As a lawmaker, the congresswoman maintains that her role is not to become embroiled in public spats with Republicans hellbent on making an example of her, but to be the most effective member of Congress she can be. “A win for them is not me not using the restroom. A win for them is me fighting back and them turning me into a caricature. A win for them is undermining my effectiveness as a member of Congress,” she says to the camera in State of Firsts. \n\n McBride’s decision to abide by Johnson’s bathroom decree was not without controversy within the trans and LGBTQ+ community, but she stands by it. \n\n “I think there is actually something so powerful about seeing someone with dignity and calmness navigate a firestorm — because then it creates a really clear contrast between you and those who are coming after you,” McBride tells Rolling Stone. “I am more confident now than I was even then about my approach, about the rightness of my approach. I’m more confident now because I’ve seen the behavior dissipate and diminish. I’m more confident now because I’ve seen that my effectiveness has actually been enhanced by the way that I navigated this.”\n\n “I appreciate that when you are a ‘first,’ people viscerally feel your highs, and they viscerally feel your lows,” she adds about the public reaction to her colleagues’ attacks against her. “But I am confident that for both myself, my constituents, and all of the various communities I’m a part of that the approach that I have taken has maximized the positives for the long term, maintained my effectiveness, and enhanced my effectiveness.” \n\n The film is premiering during the first week of June’s Pride Month celebrations, which are taking place amid a palpable climate of anxiety as the Trump administration continues to attack the LGBTQ+ community. Earlier this week, reports emerged that the Pentagon had chosen to time the announcement of their decision to strip the USNS Harvey Milk of its name to coincide with Pride Month. \n\n State of Firsts director Chase Joynt, who is also trans, tells Rolling Stone that in his view “there’s never been a more important time to be telling trans stories and to be getting as close to issues, people, and politics as possible. I think that it has never felt more urgent to be creating work [and] creating media that can be considered as counter to the onslaught of misinformation and anti-trans legislation.” \n\n “My sincere hope is that through this portal, through this access, audiences emerge with greater understanding of not only trans rights and the specifics of what’s happening to trans people, but also the fact that we are dealing with issues that are so much more in excess of one community, one person, one moment or one time,” he adds. \n\n Joynt explains that he wanted to explore the complexities of being a “first” through the lens of McBride’s election. ”The history of trans representation is a history that positions one person as exceptional and away from that pack. There’s always that icon, that person to whom we’re looking, and it’s a fantasy,” he says, adding that the documentary would ideally allow viewers to grapple with the weight and expectations of being in such a position through the perspective of an aspiring candidate. \n\n McBride’s aspirations are a central theme of her story. Early in the film, her father recounts how as a child McBride was obsessed with the podium he used to teach classes at their church. When her parents got her a podium of her own, a young McBride would practice reciting famous American political speeches. “I just thought to myself, ‘Ooh, we’re in deep trouble here,’” her father tells the filmmakers, with her mother adding that while she was confident her daughter would win her election, the thought of her stepping onto the national stage under a Trump presidency “scares” her.\n\n McBride tells Rolling Stone that she would reassure that child — full of ambition, a fixation on Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1932 inaugural address, and a blissful ignorance of the many trials to come — that everything would work out. \n\n “It’s not always easy. It’s often two steps forward, one step back. It’s going to be painful. They’re going to be moments where you just want to disappear, that you want to go into hiding, that you wonder whether everything will work out,” she says. “But I wish I had known then — and there are times where I still have to summon this —that it was going to be OK.” \n\n “There are so many reasons for us to have hope from the historic progress that we are the beneficiaries of right now, the fact that we are all in so many ways, living in possibility,” McBride says. “What we celebrate this Pride Month is that for our community, we have a superpower — and the superpower is the power of our proximity. When we are proximate, when we are present, when we show up as the best versions of ourselves and the most authentic versions of ourselves, we have the capacity to open hearts, change minds and transform that which once seemed so impossible that it was almost incomprehensible.”","summary":"The new documentary State of Firsts chronicles the Delaware lawmaker's historic election win — and all that came with it","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/sarah-mcbride-interview-trans-lawmaker-state-of-firsts-1235357604/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/STATEOFFIRSTS-sarah-mcbride-film.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 14:30:00","author":"Nikki McCann Ramirez,Ryan Bort","authors":["Nikki McCann Ramirez","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":328805700,"title":"Beyoncé at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium review: A 5-star, 39-track riot","text":"“This is making me wanna get assless chaps,” said the person next to me as Beyoncé sashayed onto stage in her fourth pair of the night (all variations of leather, tassled, and sparkly). \n\nTaylor Swift may have nabbed the rights to the word, but Beyoncé is the true queen of eras. She was last at Tottenham Hotspur stadium exactly two years ago for her Renaissance tour, an ode to Black queer club culture which was all latex bodysuits and thumping dance anthems. \n\nBut the night club has become a honky tonk bar, and the Beyhive have switched out their cheap spandex for cowboy hats and denim cut-offs. The first night of Beyoncé’s six-date run at Spurs for the Cowboy Carter tour was an exercise in the singer’s ability to do whatever she wants, to an exceedingly high level. \n\nCowboy Carter made Beyoncé the first Black female artist to have a US country No 1, and netted her that long-awaited Grammy for best album. \n\nYet she has said that it is \"a Beyoncé album, not a country album.\" It’s all contradictions, a love letter to America and a critique of it, full of genre-bending songs and rich references to the black music which inspired country. \n\nThe show plays with those contradictions. Not many singers could get away with belting out the national anthem in a jumpsuit sequinned with the US flag. But just as quickly, the star-spangled outfit is whipped off and replaced by papier-mâché newspapered armour emblazoned with the words “America has a problem”. \n\nYou wonder how different the mood of this tour would be if Kamala Harris had won the election. There’s hints of what could have been when Beyoncé sings Freedom, a song off Lemonade which was the anthem to Harris’s presidential campaign video. \n\nThe stage is set with the insignia of the American south, but Beyified: rodeo bulls in shiny gold, a neon bar sign which says “kntry”, and a light up horseshoe which Beyoncé mounts, before it bears her high in the air and careers off around the stadium at a rather alarming pace. At points, you might be in a saloon bar in rural Texas (if not for the 60,000-strong audience wearing light-up wrist bands) before the dazzling pyrotechnics kick in, or a red velvet car descends from space.\n\nThis is a family affair. The show’s emotional high point is during Protector, a song about motherhood, when Beyoncé’s 7-year-old daughter Rumi shyly totters onto the stage in a white fur coat and snuggles into the crook of her mother’s arm as she is serenaded. \n\nBut the Carter child who steals the show is Blue Ivy, who is giving nepo babies a good name. She joins the back-up dancers throughout the show and looks well beyond her 13 years as she tosses her hair and struts down the stage in a cowgirl outfit. Blue clearly got that uniquely American polish from her mother. At one point the heavens open, but it’s far from a dampener on the mood. 'This rain feels so good!' says Bey, flashing one of her beatific smiles.\n\nBeyoncé’s pre-cowboy eras are sandwiched into the second half. Sasha Fierce and co rear their heads in a medley of greatest hits including Single Ladies, Love on Top and Irreplaceable. “Shall we do one more?” Beyoncé asks before singing a truncated If I Were a Boy, sending the audience of mainly millennial women into a tailspin of nostalgia. \n\nWhile her solo career is only slightly longer than Taylor Swift’s, Bey hasn’t quite captured the attention of younger Gen Zs in a similar way. No matter, though – it saves your ears from the tinnitus-inducing screams of tweenagers. The only disappointment is a slowed-down version of Crazy in Love which features warbling trumpets and doesn’t pack the punch of the original. \n\nThis is a show which spans a dizzying array of emotions and epochs. It is angry and hopeful, ironic and earnest. There are moments of high camp and operatic stillness; whomping production value paired with kitschy outfits. The three-hour, 39-track spectacle is a riot, and a testament to the three-decade career of a powerhouse who appears to be capable of just about anything.","summary":"The Cowboy Carter tour hits London and is a glorious spectacle where even the rain seems to worship Beyoncé","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tottenham-hotspur-stadium-live-review-b1231648.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/06/06/10/07/Cowboy-Carter-tour-3zsm7ik6.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 14:14:47","author":"Claudia Cockerell","authors":["Claudia Cockerell"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.324},{"id":328783378,"title":"Staggering list of allies Trump has burned through as president... as bitter Elon Musk fight escalates","text":"Elon Musk is the latest MAGA ally to join Donald Trump's ever-growing list of foes after their friendship publicly exploded in a bitter war of words.\n\nThe clash, which began over Musk's opposition to Trump's 'big, beautiful bill', saw the world's richest man call for the president to impeached after linking him to Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nTrump even suggested the Tesla CEO's multibillion-dollar government contracts should be ripped away.\n\nWhile the feud has left GOP splinters torn between sides, it should come as no surprise as the president has a long track record of turning his allies and aides against him.\n\nHis first Oval Office term saw top aides like Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci jump ship early on, followed by a slew of other key members of his administration.\n\nTrump's then Vice President Mike Pence delivered the final blow after the Capitol riot and publicly declared the president 'puts himself over the Constitution'.\n\nPolitical analysts have long warned Trump and Musk's bromance was doomed from the start, alleging how the pair have 'planet-sized egos destined to collide'. \n\nAfter months of buddying-up, Donald Trump and Elon Musk turned on each other Thursday in a huge public spat.\n\nThe falling-out had begun brewing days ago when Musk, who left his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency a week ago, denounced Trump's sweeping tax-cut and spending bill. \n\nThe verbal punches erupted on Thursday after Trump criticized Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then traded barbs on their respective social media platforms.\n\nIn a possible sign of cooling late Thursday night, however, White House aides had scheduled a Friday call between the two men in an attempt to broker peace.\n\nAnd, in a potential olive branch, Musk replied to a post on X, from billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, pleading for a reconciliation 'for the benefit of our great country' and warning that 'we are much stronger together than apart.'\n\nMusk's response was brief but telling: 'You're not wrong.'\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence hastily parted ways following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump wanted Pence to throw out Electoral College votes from swing states that President Joe Biden won as he presided over the joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 election.\n\nPence refused and Trump's supporters went after him - chanting 'hang Mike Pence' and erecting makeshift gallows outside the Capitol Building amid the riot.\n\nThe January 6 House select committee found that a Proud Boys informant had told the FBI that if members of the group had found Pence that day, they would have killed him.\n\nPence spoke out about the insurrection incident two years later, publicly slamming Trump: 'The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution. \n\n'Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States.'\n\nRETIRED GEN. JOHN KELLY\n\nDonald Trump and his longest-serving White House chief-of-staff parted ways in 2019 after months of reports that their relationship had deteriorated.\n\nRetired Marine Gen. John Kelly later publicly turned on his former boss, branding him a 'dictator' and likening him to Adolf Hitler. \n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Kelly claimed Trump was the 'definition of fascist' and that he did not have an understanding of American history or the Constitution. \n\nTrump's camp quickly dispute Kelly's wild remarks, saying the former political advisor 'has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated'. \n\nJOHN BOLTON \n\nDonald Trump pushed out John Bolton, his third National Security Advisor, in September 2019.\n\nBolton published a tell-all book about his time working for Trump in June 2020, ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump's Justice Department tried to stop publication of the book claiming Bolton needed to wait for the White House to review whether it contained classified information.\n\nAfter leaving government service it was revealed that Bolton had been targeted for assassination by Iran.\n\nTrump retaliated against Bolton again this year after his return to the Oval Office and even moved to have Bolton's Secret Service protection terminated.\n\nBolton also warned in March this year that Trump's 'bromance' with Elon Musk 'is almost over'. \n\nSEAN SPICER\n\nSean Spicer's six-month White House stint was part of Donald Trump's most turbulent time in office, as key figures waged war with one another and the media.\n\nThe former White House Press Secretary quickly became a household name when he blasted the press a day after Trump was sworn in.\n\nThe president was frustrated by comparisons that showed his inauguration crowd to be smaller than Barack Obama's and Spicer insisted it was 'the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.'\n\nThat set a pattern for a press secretary in an awkward position trying to defend some of Trump's most outlandish boasts.\n\nHe left as part of a wider shakeup of strategy that heralded the famously short tenure of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director.\n\nANTHONY SCARAMUCCI\n\nAnthony Scaramucci spent an infamous 11 days in Donald Trump's first White House as communications director.\n\nScaramucci was appointed as the White House Communications Director on July 21, 2017, and later that same day, Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned, reportedly over objection to his hiring.\n\nOnly a few days later, the newly minted Trump official found himself at the center of a P.R. crisis when he launched an expletive-laden rant on a phone call with a New Yorker reporter, which he thought was off the record.\n\nBy July 31, the president had dismissed 'the Mooch,' on the advice of his new chief of staff, John Kelly, who doubted that Scaramucci was credible enough for the role.\n\nWhen he was sacked, his total tenure of eleven days became tied for the shortest in the history of the position.\n\nScaramucci claims Trump fired him after he disagreed with him on national security policy. Trump has long rubbished Scaramucci's claims about him, suggesting that his former aide is bitter and that he has an ax to grind.\n\nThe former aide soured on Trump after his stint in the White House, and went on to support Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in the 2024.\n\nMICHAEL COHEN \n\nDonald Trump's former longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went from being the president's 'fixer' to one of his most vocal adversaries.\n\nCohen, who handled Trump's hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, has testified against Trump several times since the pair parted ways.\n\nHe spent three years in prison after pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, lying to Congress, and other charges - which Cohen claims he did for Trump.\n\nAfter serving his prison term, Cohen vowed to hold Trump accountable, branding him a 'racist', 'conman' and 'cheat'.\n\nCohen said he would 'continue to provide information, testimony, documents and my full cooperation on all ongoing investigations to ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds'.\n\nHe also predicted a fall-out between Trump and Elon Musk, doubling down on the claims on Sunday - just days before the pair's explosive online feud.\n\n'I said from the very start that this bromance was gonna come to an end,' Cohen told MSNBC. 'I'm gonna go one step even further, again, and I'm gonna say Trump will ultimately go after Elon's money next because it bothers him that he is the richest man in the world'.\n\nHe added: 'Yes, he used him for his money.'\n\nNIKKI HALEY \n\nDonald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations run against her former boss for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nNikki Haley resigned from her position as Governor of South Carolina in 2017 to serve as Trump's ambassador to the UN. \n\nShe stepped down from the role in December 2018, after holding the position for nearly two years. At the time she said she needed a break from public office.\n\nHaley and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship in recent years. During the 2024 GOP primary, Haley ripped into Trump as 'unhinged,' 'chaotic' and 'self-absorbed'. She also blasted his age and mental fitness.\n\nBut several months after she bowed out of the race, Haley announced she would be voting for the ex-president.\n\nREX TILLERSON \n\nDonald Trump tapped ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his Secretary of State during his first Oval Office term.\n\nHe served in the role from 2017 to 2018. Tillerson claimed Trump had not told him he was out of a job until three hours after publicly firing him in a tweet.\n\nThe former diplomat publicly denounced Trump in the months that followed and said the two men don't share the same 'value system'.\n\nHe described the president as someone almost entirely driven by impulse, who doesn't read, and who would ask him to break the law or breach treaties in his demands for immediate action. \n\nTrump hit back, branding Tillerson 'dumb' and 'lazy'.\n\nRETIRED LT. GEN. MICHAEL FLYNN \n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn served as Donald Trump's National Security Advisor during his first administration.\n\nFlynn resigned from his resigned in February 2017 after it was revealed he had misled officials about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. \n\nThe retired Army lieutenant general was charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI about his conversations before Trump took office with Kislyak, who was then Russia's ambassador to the United States, concerning US sanctions imposed on Russia under President Barack Obama.\n\nHe then reversed his guilty plea, allegedly government vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement, before the Justice Department stepped in to dismiss his case. \n\nTrump pardoned Flynn in November 2020, ending the yearslong prosecution in the Russia investigation.\n\nSTEVE BANNON\n\nDonald Trump's original political guru Steve Bannon was found guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022.\n\nThe War Room podcast host served as chief strategist during Trump's first term before the pair split acrimoniously in 2017, but he was also devoted to the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nHe was convicted in 2022 for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol attack. He received a sentence of four months in prison and a $6,500 fine.\n\nIn February this year, Bannon pleaded guilty in state court to defrauding donors to a private effort to build a wall on the US southern border, ending a case the conservative strategist decried as a 'political persecution.' \n\nHe must stay out of trouble for three years to avoid additional punishment, including possible jail time. \n\nHe also can't raise money or serve as an officer or director for charities in New York and can't use, sell, or possess any data gathered from border wall donors. \n\nBannon - whose influence during Trump's first term compared to 'First Buddy' Elon Musk in the second - last month weighed in on the pair's failing bromance.\n\nHe alleged Musk's attempts to gain access to secret briefings on war plans ultimately resulted in the end of his White House stint.\n\nBannon claimed the alliance ended the moment Trump was prevented from showing Musk the Pentagon's plans for a hypothetical war with China.\n\nHe labeled the Tesla billionaire as an elitist outsider and interloper in a political movement he helped shape from the ground up.\n\nALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN \n\nEx-White House communications advisor Alyssa Farah Griffin turned on Donald Trump after joining popular morning talkshow The View.\n\nShe quit her White House gig in December 2020 due to discomfort 'with the lies about the election'.\n\nFarah Griffin was among the Trump staffers found to have pleaded with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to have Trump call off the crowd on January 6.\n\nThe outspoken Republican voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, discussing her decision to do so on her talkshow. \n\nShe called January 6, 2021 a 'horrific' day, but added 'that was just kind of an encapsulation of who Donald Trump, the man, is.'\n\n'He is the person of the lowest moral character that I've ever worked for,' she said of her former boss.\n\nFarrah Griffin joined CNN as a political contributor in 2021, while also making several guest appearances on the View.\n\nThis lasted throughout the year and into 2022 until she became a permanent host - joined by longtime talker Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, and Ana Navarro.\n\nDuring her first year as host, she told her fellow members how members of her family had boycotted her 2020 wedding to husband Justin Griffin due to their differences with Trump, but held the ceremony anyway.\n\nShe won a Daytime Emmy for her work on the View last year, and is still an outspoken critic of the president-elect.","summary":"President Donald Trump has a long track record of turning his allies and aides against him.

Now, NCR is raving mad over Barron being, well, insufficiently distant to the president.\n\nWhen the president appointed Barron to the interfaith Religious Liberty Commission, NCR accused Barron of “negligence.”\n\n“While embracing the presidency of Trump, Barron has thus far said nothing on his vast and powerful Word on Fire media empire (nearly 2 million followers on YouTube) to address this administration’s wanton disregard for nearly every principle of Catholic social teaching,” wrote John Grosso at NCR. “Deportation of migrants? Crickets. Cuts to Medicaid and food security? File not found 404. Gutting of health care research? Cntrl alt delete.”\n\nHere’s the thing about a 2,000-year-old faith guided by a text that was started at least 3,000 years ago: Christian social teaching does not fulfill your contemporary political interest. And as Barron has explained, it outright opposes socialism.\n\nThe Biden administration, when it wasn’t cracking down on overall religious liberty on college campuses and within its own government, tried to co-opt Christianity in the form of the federal government’s financial takeover of Catholic Charities to import millions of migrants, including illegal immigrants, into the country. NCR didn’t just smear congressional critics of Catholic Charities on the border, including Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), as a “right-wing Catholic fringe.” NCR’s repeated editorial position was that any obstruction to a fully open border, from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s mealy-mouthed warning that migrants “not come” to former President Joe Biden’s belated expansion of Title 42, was an assault on Catholicism itself.\n\nSure, Catholic leftists can cherry-pick from Exodus or pretend that the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats was about 10 million illegal immigrants who traversed thousands of miles across multiple countries to catch a bus to Manhattan. But what about Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, the Venezuelans who illegally crossed Biden’s open border last year and then allegedly raped and murdered a 12-year old girl? Jesus also declares it better that someone is dragged and drowned to death in the sea rather than hurt a child.\n\nAnd what about Laken Riley? Both the New Testament and the Old Testament are very clear about murder! And the Apostle Paul is very clear that though a leader on Earth is still subservient to God, rulers on Earth should be a terror to evil.\n\nYes, Christian social teaching, both inside and outside of Catholicism, stands clearly against tyranny and firmly in favor of the Christian’s individual obligation to charity. Jesus seemed to encourage entrepreneurship and return on capital (see the Parable of the Talents) but frowned at exploitative business. The church wants us to give to the less fortunate without inviting unvetted rapists and murderers to prey on our most defenseless neighbors. But if you want to compare a progressive value-added tax to a flat income tax or contrast the virtues of carbon pricing with cap-and-trade, you’re looking in the wrong place.\n\nBISHOP ROBERT BARRON ON THE GROWING SECULAR LEFTIST THREAT\n\nThe fact that Barron is rejecting the reflexive partisanship du jour is precisely why his interview with Carlson is going viral. And frankly, Christians across the denomination ought to celebrate it. Even the Deist Founding Fathers understood a religious populace to be a virtuous one and that a virtuous people were necessary to maintain a free society. The traditional Catholics and the Catholic leftists trying to contort Christianity to fulfill their political persuasions won’t just fail in their own interests — they’re obstructing the church’s ability to evangelize to those who need to find the good news the most.\n\nOur heavily regulated credit cards are probably fine in the eyes of the Lord, and I would be surprised if Christ condemns enforcing a sovereign border and deporting the illegal immigrants convicted of a violent crime. But those who are adamant that they’re right really require God’s greatest gift of all: grace.","summary":"Tucker Carlson has long railed against credit card interest rates, repeatedly invoking historical prohibitions on usury as reason to ban current lending practices.

And Musk commented similarly on another post: 'Bannon is a communist r----d.' \n\nBannon, a vocal opponent of the richest man in the world, has called for Musk to be deported and urged President Trump to use the Defense Production Act to seize Musk's companies. \n\nThe influential right-wing podcaster has long been suspicious of Musk, arguing the self-made tech billionaire was cozying up to the president for his own interests and not because he was a true believer.\n\nTrump and Musk's bromace came to a deadly end on Thursday, complete with insults and threats playing out live on social media. \n\nThere are no signs of a cooling off period - in fact it seems to be spreading.\n\nMusk is now aiming his fire at those close to Trump, using an insult the president himself has fired at opponents. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump described rival Kamala Harris as 'retarded.' \n\nFor his part, Bannon hasn't held back either. \n\nHe's called on Musk, who was born in South Africa and became a naturalized American citizen, to be deported.\n\n'They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,' Bannon told the New York Times.\n\nAnd, on his podcast, Bannon called on Trump to seize the billionaire's companies. \n\n'President Trump, tonight, should sign an executive order calling up the Defense Production Act, and seize SpaceX tonight, before midnight,' he said.\n\nBannon's call to arms came after as Musk and Trump escalating their war of words on social media.\n\nTrump threatened to cancel Musk's billions in federal contracts. In response, Musk said that SpaceX would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nThe American space program relies on outside shuttles to reach the International Space Station.\n\nBut it's unclear Trump could actually seize control of Musk's empire.\n\nThe Defense Product Act - passed during World War II - allows the president to control domestic industries during emergencies by ordering companies to prioritize orders from the federal government. \n\nPresident Joe Biden used the act during the COVID pandemic to prioritize vaccine production. \n\nMusk is estimated to have nearly $3 billion in federal contracts. His companies also have taken a hit amid is war with Trump. Tesla shares fell 14% Thursday, losing about $152.4 billion in market value.\n\nBannon was also infuriated when Musk endorsed a tweet calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance.\n\nHe complained Trump treated Musk like a 'son' and went nuclear on him.\n\n'The president treated him almost like a son,' Bannon told Politico's Playbook. 'He invited his family to Christmas dinner. He let him sleep over. He let him walk in and out of meetings. The president went to the max informality to welcome this guy.'\n\nHe added: 'You're going to tell me we should allow some f***ing punk to sit there and say he should be impeached and JD should step in? F*** you, dude. We're going to go to f***ing war, and I'm going to rip your f***ing face off.","summary":"Elon Musk is spreading his war against Donald Trump to the MAGA loyalists of the president's.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14787533/elon-musk-steve-bannon-trump-slur-deport.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/06/14/99112797-0-image-m-19_1749216389593.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/06/7880121014945821433/1024x576_MP4_7880121014945821433.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-06 13:46:04","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":328876072,"title":"Acosta Displays Amazing Hypocrisy On Election Conspiracy Theories","text":"Even by his own standards, former CNN anchor turned Substack podcaster Jim Acosta displayed a stunning amount of hypocrisy on Tuesday when it comes to conspiracy theories about the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. On 2020, Acosta let former CNN colleague Michael Fanone go on a profanity-laden rant against Speaker Mike Johnson and fellow Republicans while he labeled actress Rosie O’Donnell an “international treasure” immediately after she spread conspiracy theories about 2024.\n\nAcosta, recording the show from the Lincoln Theater in Washington, put the ball on the tee for Fanone, “There is a plaque honoring January 6 police officers that’s still in a frigging broom closet in the basement of the Capitol. It’s insane. And you thought about this the other, I don’t know, for folks who missed this.”\n\nFanone replied that, “I’ve never really been one for awards or accolades, and I’ll tell you why, and it’s because the entire time I was a D.C. police officer, I don’t think I was ever presented with an award from any person who I felt that was worthy of presenting me with that award. And I think if there’s a lot of, like, working police officers out there, they probably know what I’m talking about, and so, like, my thoughts on the plaque was, like, listen, if Mike Johnson wants to be a petty bitch and he wants to withhold presenting me with a plaque, then, you know, Mike Johnson could take that plaque and shove it up his [sound drops] ass.”\n\nHe continued, “And I think that the vast majority of police officers that I talked to, the vast majority of officers that were there on January 6 that fought to preserve democracy, that fought to protect the Capitol, that fought to protect [sound drops]holes like Mike Johnson and his Republican [sound drops] colleagues.”\n\nAt that point, former aide to Vice President Mike Pence-turned Never Trumper, Olivia Troye, quipped, “Can I get a cocktail?”\n\nFanone then kept rolling, “They will tell you the exact same thing. They don’t want the plaque, they don’t care about the claque, they know what they did and they would do it again, but they don’t need to be honored or recognized by some piece of shit like Mike Johnson.”\n\nWhile Fanone portrays his anger as January 6-related, he has also claimed that history will “take a big shit on\" Troye’s former boss’s head. Additionally, he has compared Trump’s January 6 indictment to the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nLater in the show, O’Donnell called in from Dublin, Ireland, and Acosta again opened the floor, “There’s a reason why this independent media thing is taking off. There’s a reason why things like Substack, YouTube are taking off and why you were taking off, Rosie.”\n\nO’Donnell then put on her tinfoil hat, “Yes. Well, you know, all people want now after all the lies we’ve been told from Trump four years ago, and we were just getting out of the depression of that, and then he comes back, I believe unfairly. I believe Elon Musk did something. I believe no one has ever won every swing state. I believe the down ballot proof. I believe that he did not win this election because I was looking at how many people Kamala Harris had, and I just don’t believe it, and my friends say you have to believe it, but I don’t.”\n\nThe man who claims to care so much about facts and truth replied, “Well, something tells me if we were to have that election today, we would have a different result. There’s no question about it. Rosie O’Donnell, you are the best. You’re not a national treasure, you’re an international treasure, so thank you very much.”\n\nThe truth is neither the 2020 nor the 2024 election was stolen. If the media covered 2020 fairly, maybe the voters would have acted differently, but there was nothing fishy about the actual vote counts in either case, just as there was nothing suspect about 2000 or 2004. For Acosta, however, a journalistic commitment to the truth only goes one way.\n\nJune 3 was a bad day for podcasts. It was on that day that PBS’s Christiane Amanpour compare the U.S. to North Korea and when former ESPN and MSNBC host Keith Olbermann blamed Donald Trump for the anti-Semite who shouted “Free Palestine” while firebombing a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nHere is a transcript for the June 3 show:\n\nThe Jim Acosta Show\n\n7 Minutes, 47 Seconds\n\nJIM ACOSTA: There is a plaque honoring January 6 police officers that’s still in a frigging broom closet in the basement of the Capitol.

And MSNBC often features outspoken Never Trumper conservatives as guests, from attorney George Conway to ex-GOP strategists Tim Miller and Rick Wilson.\n\nScarborough and Conway's total disdain for Trump is no secret.

All three of Trump's U.S. Supreme Court appointees —Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch — were aggressively promoted by Leo and others in the Federalist Society, which Trump is now railing against.\n\n\"Trump’s venomous social media posts against Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society co-chairman and right-wing powerhouse, reads like a memoir of an ingenue taken advantage of in the big city by strangers,\" Blumenthal observes. \"'I was new to Washington,' Trump explained, 'and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real 'sleazebag' named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.'\"\n\nREAD MORE: MAGA infighting escalates as 'tech bro fascists' go to war with 'Christian nationalists'\n\nBlumental adds, \"Slowly, Trump has come to the realization that this Leonard Leo 'openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court.' Trump was revealing that Leo understood his power beyond his influence over Trump on appointments. 'Backroom hustlers must not be allowed to destroy our Nation!'…. Trump is enraged that his betrayers from the Federalist Society have claimed roles in the resistance. He has no loyalty to anyone or thing, but demands personal fealty, certainly now above any ideological litmus tests.\"\n\nREAD MORE:'He. Is. Lying.'

Newsom’s, she’d still likely have the inside track.\n\nEarly polls, such as an Inside California Politics/Emerson survey show her with a commanding 31% to 8% lead over former Rep. Katie Porter, who was in second, among likely voters.\n\nSimilarly, Harris’ 65% net-favorability among California Democrats is the highest among all candidates – declared or potential – tested in a Capitol Weekly survey, 16-points higher than Porter’s.\n\nHowever, Harris’ indecision can also be taken as her leaving the door open for another shot at the White House in 2028, turning off some key California Democrats. \n\nIndeed, last weekend, at a gathering of party insiders in Anaheim, a number of influential Democrats expressed exasperation – bordering on frustration – at the idea that Harris may run for governor as a “fallback option” per Politico.\n\nOne state party delegate told Politico that “We haven’t really heard from her (Harris) on California issues since Trump’s inauguration…I feel like California isn’t a consolation prize.”\n\nEchoing those concerns, another state delegate said, “My concern about Harris is that she would be using the position, if she won, as a placeholder for a second run at the presidency.” \n\nShe continued, “That would make me feel like I’m wasting my vote. I want a strong governor for at least four years.” \n\nPerhaps most tellingly, Lorena Gonzalez, the head of the powerful California Labor Federation, underscored the potential Harris fatigue. She told the magazine that she has “not heard much desire for Harris to clear the field.”\n\nWhile polling suggests that these concerns are a minority viewpoint thus far, it appears that, among party officials and Democratic activists, the feeling is growing.\n\nAs such, it’s entirely possible that the longer Harris refuses to announce a decision, the more likely it is that “Harris fatigue” spreads from party elites to mainstream voters.\n\nTo that point, two weeks ago in these pages, I referenced a poll which suggests that Democratic insiders’ views have already begun filtering down to the electorate. \n\nAs I wrote then, “Californians are split on whether they want Harris to run, with 50% saying yes, and 50% saying no.” \n\nThis was down from polling immediately after the 2024 election, which showed 46% of Californians wanting her to run, vs. 42% saying they did not.\n\nIn that same vein, I noted that Harris’ indecision has effectively frozen the race, particularly among donors.\n\nDavid Campos, vice chair of California Democrats, lamented that while other candidates actually showed up to the conference and engaged with voters and donors, fundraising remains stuck pending Harris’ decision. \n\nAll things considered, Harris faces an extremely unique set of circumstances which are likely contributing to her delaying a decision, but also contributing to tepid reactions about her potential candidacy. \n\nAfter being thrust into the role of presidential candidate in an entirely unprecedented fashion, Harris often struggled to sustain momentum on the campaign trail.\n\nMoreover, whether she runs for governor or decides to try her luck at the presidency once more, Harris will be forced to answer for her role in defending the mental acuity and abilities of former President Biden. \n\nThis is something Democratic candidates throughout the country will have to reckon with, but none of them were as close to Biden – nor defended him so vociferously – as Harris. \n\nInterestingly, Campos noted something else that could work against Harris, particularly if she had higher ambitions. He said, “people want to have a campaign, an election” and not a coronation. \n\nAs the data strongly suggests, her entry into the race would be a clearing event, reigniting complaints from the 2024 election that Harris was effectively crowned without a truly fair contest. \n\nThere were a considerable number of Harris supporters who were enthusiastic about the possibility of the former VP “coming home to lead our state” as one activist put it. \n\nThis sentiment is clearly reflected in polls which show Harris’ lead as steady and strong.\n\nAt the same time, it would be an equally sizable mistake to believe that Harris can keep voters waiting indefinitely. \n\nWhile Harris would undoubtedly be able to put together a – likely winning – campaign, the longer she waits to decide whether her ultimate goal is Sacramento or further east in Washington, DC, the greater risk of fatigue setting in.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Is Kamala Harris fatigue already setting in for California Democrats&quest;","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/06/05/is-kamala-harris-fatigue-already-setting-in-for-california-democrats/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LDN-L-2FIRES-0121-14-SR.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 12:05:32","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":328760658,"title":"Athletes Unlimited Softball League, with Kim Ng as commissioner, opens inaugural season in Rosemont","text":"Athletes Unlimited was already on Kim Ng’s radar when she arrived at then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in March 2024 for a Women’s History Month celebration.\n\nIn fact, as the senior vice president of baseball operations for MLB — a position she held for nine years before becoming the first woman to serve as a general manager in any of North America’s Big Four men’s professional sports leagues — Ng had taken a meeting in December 2019 with co-founders Jon Patricof and Jonathan Soros.\n\nShe came away so impressed that she encouraged MLB to keep tabs on Athletes Unlimited’s softball ventures.\n\nMore than four years later, Ng met Hilary Meyer, Athletes Unlimited’s senior vice president of impact, at Harris’ residence. Their conversation drew in Ng all over again.\n\n‘‘The timing of me and Athletes Unlimited and taking on this role [as softball commissioner] in a really 150% way, that wasn’t necessarily part of the plan,’’ Ng said in a conversation with the Sun-Times. ‘‘And it took me a long time to decide what I wanted to do. But when it really came right down to it, what made me come to Athletes Unlimited was that we don’t always get to choose our timing in life. And when you see the opportunities, you just have to grab them.’’\n\nOn Saturday, the Athletes Unlimited Softball League opens its inaugural season with a clash between the Talons and Bandits at 2 p.m. at the Stadium at the Parkway Bank Sports Complex in Rosemont. The other two teams in the league, the Volts and Blaze, will face each other in Wichita, Kansas, to round out the first-day action of the barnstorming season.\n\nEach of the four teams has a 24-game schedule, with at least 10 cities hosting games. Rosemont is the site for 11 games across four series in June and July, as well as for 18 AUSL All-Star Cup games in August — after the season ends.\n\nLeague leadership is charged with star power. Its advisers include softball legends Jennie Finch, Jessica Mendoza, Cat Osterman and Natasha Watley. Osterman is also a GM, along with Lisa Fernandez, Jenny Dalton-Hill and Dana Sorensen.\n\nThe talent on the field includes Odicci Alexander, the lights-out pitcher who had Women’s College World Series viewers across the country rooting for underdog James Madison in 2021; Montana Fouts, a perennial terror on the mound for Alabama in 2019-23 and the author of three solo perfect games; Bri Ellis, the 2025 Division I Softball Player of the Year at Arkansas and one of the greatest hitters in NCAA history; and many more.\n\nMLB last week announced a partnership with AUSL that includes a financial investment, game distribution on MLB Network and MLB.com and promotional support. ESPN is also a broadcast partner.\n\n‘‘The ability for anybody to watch our games — if you’re watching on linear and you’re just clicking through channels and you see softball during a time that’s not the College World Series — that, in and of itself, is tremendous,’’ Ng said. ‘‘And then all of the fans of MLB who are now able to access softball through MLB TV, that is just mind-boggling in Year 1.’’\n\nIf Athletes Unlimited sounds familiar, that’s because it made a splash with its format when it launched in 2020. Featuring women’s professional softball, volleyball, basketball and (later) lacrosse, the Athletes Unlimited model uses a points system and frequent redrafting of teams to crown an individual champion.\n\nEven as AUSL moves to a more traditional team format, aiming for each team to claim a city after its inaugural barnstorming season, it isn’t abandoning its roots. The All-Star Cup will use the original format.\n\nWhen Ng reconnected with Athletes Unlimited in 2024, she was open to a new challenge. She had declined the mutual 2024 option in her contract with the Marlins, citing a misalignment in vision with ownership, after helping to build them into a playoff team. She just hadn’t anticipated her next move to be developing a professional softball league.\n\nNg formally joined Athletes Unlimited as a senior adviser in June 2024, bringing her expertise from more than three decades in MLB, including front-office positions with the White Sox, Yankees, Dodgers and Marlins.\n\n‘‘Even my friends who are completely in tune with me and understand who I am and what I’ve fought for and who are very much girl dads and grow opportunity for women, I don’t think that even they quite understood what this whole league meant,’’ she said.\n\nNg, who played and coached softball at the University of Chicago, recounted a recent conversation with a friend who is the father of two girls. The impact of the league didn’t click for him until he saw how excited his daughters were, ready to jump on a plane to watch AUSL action in person.\n\n‘‘If Jennie Finch had had a pro career for 15 or 20 years, how much bigger would this sport have been?’’ Ng said. ‘‘As opposed to once every four years [in the Olympics]. That’s the difference: You can watch Aaron Judge for 20 years, Derek Jeter for 20 years, but you saw Lisa Fernandez once every four.’’\n\nNg will be in Rosemont this weekend, where she said she’s most looking forward to watching the women on the field embrace their roles as founding members. That’s a theme she emphasized in her first address to the players during orientation last week.\n\n‘‘You might think that AU is a place for you to play,’’ she remembers saying, ‘‘but I challenge you to think about it as a place that you should build.’’","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/2025/06/06/athletes-unlimited-softball-league-with-kim-ng-as-commissioner-opens-inaugural-season-in-rosemont","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0451e09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3452+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fe1%2F2ac8bea14a528d61617998f1391f%2Fkim-mg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 12:00:00","author":"Maddie Lee","authors":["Maddie Lee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.294},{"id":328763190,"title":"Donald Trump Is Trying to Tip New Jersey Red","text":"Okay, so this Donnie is the president, Donald Trump, and he’s really from Queens, or Florida, or maybe Washington, DC. But he spends part of the year at his New Jersey golf club: “Special place. You know that I stay there all the time. I live there a lot.” And he’s calling in to a political rally one week before the state’s gubernatorial primaries. Yet Trump, whatever his means of communication, can’t help but give off serious right-wing talk radio crank vibes.\n“The radical-left Democrats in the race are woke…lunatics who want New Jersey to be a haven for illegal alien gang members, human traffickers, dangerous criminals of all kinds, including murderers who have been let into our country by Biden and his group of people with their open-border craziness,” Trump says, his rant gaining speed, if not coherence. “And if you get four more years with somebody that you’ve been going through, I mean, it’s just so sad. Your taxes go up. You crush the middle-class families and cause mass exodus. And that’s happened. Mass exodus of jobs and businesses all throughout the state while they indoctrinate your children at a public school. It’s a terrible thing that happens to the children. You look and hear and all—it’s called transgender for all, and we’ve ended that. New Jersey’s economy will wither and die, and you’ll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime, and you sort of have that to a certain extent now.”\nThe beneficiary of this tirade is Jack Ciattarelli, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the New Jersey governor’s race. Ciattarelli, a former state legislator who lost by just more than three percentage points in 2021, has a commanding lead in the GOP primary largely because of his shift from Trump skeptic to Trump worshipper. “I’m so very grateful for his complete and total endorsement,” Ciattarelli gushes when Trump lets him get in a word. “Mr. President, thank you. I so very much appreciate your faith, your trust, your confidence. And I know none of us are surprised here, since New Jersey’s kind of your summer home, how in tune you are with the issues that matter to all New Jerseyans.”\nSucking up to Trump is standard in Republican politics these days. What’s less certain—and what’s likely to determine both the Democratic nominee next week and the winner in November’s general election—is just how big a role Trump ends up playing with New Jersey voters.\nThe crowded field of Democratic contenders to succeed incumbent governor Phil Murphy, who is term-limited after eight years in office, has come at the Trump problem from a variety of angles. Steve Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, has used a broad antiestablishment, policy-geek message to climb to second in recent polls, where he’s tied with Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Josh Gottheimer, a combative, centrist congressman.\nOf the six candidates, Baraka is the furthest left, ideologically, and the most strenuously anti-Trump, stylistically. He recently visited a new federal migrant deportation facility and was arrested by Homeland Security agents; Baraka is now suing the interim US attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, a close Trump ally.\nRegardless of whether Baraka intended to be detained, the confrontation earned him a bonanza of media attention. “I think he did a very smart thing by getting arrested,” says Julie Roginsky, a Democratic strategist who was the main architect of Murphy’s 2017 campaign before a bitter falling-out with his team. “It gave him a tremendous amount of national exposure at just the right time.” If Baraka wins, he will set up a polar general election contrast to the MAGA Ciattarelli.\nThe consistent Democratic front-runner, Mikie Sherrill, has so far pulled off a deft balancing act. The former Navy pilot was elected to Congress as part of the 2018 “blue wave” reaction to Trump’s first win. And during the current campaign, Sherrill has at times been dramatic in expressing her opposition to the president, appearing to wipe away a tear when speaking about immigration policy during a candidate forum at Rutgers University. “As a country, we’ve been really dedicated to the democratic ideals of delivering opportunity. That it doesn’t matter who your parents were or where you were born or how much money you have, but it’s what you can make of yourself,” Sherrill tells me just after shaking hands with voters at a diner in Hamilton Township while battling a migraine. “The Trump administration is trying to shut down those opportunities for people across the country and especially people here in New Jersey.”\nSherrill calls Trump “a huge factor” in the race, but she has been careful not to become a one-note anti-Trump candidate—regularly emphasizing, for instance, her plans to lower utility bills and housing costs. She has assembled formidable support from the state’s powerful county organizations; Sherrill has also come across as providing the closest thing to a continuation of Murphy’s agenda, a posture that could cut either way. “Anybody who wants to be governor is going to have to be strong and be willing to stand up to President Trump’s administration as they attack the things we care about here, willing to take them to court, as Jack Ciattarelli has vowed not to,” she tells me. “But at the same time, I think it’s incumbent upon the next governor to deliver for families, to drive down costs here.”\nSherrill has tried to avoid taking any positions that might come back to haunt her in a general election matchup with Ciattarelli, should she win the Democratic nomination next week.\n“For a Republican to win in New Jersey, Democrats have to screw up so much to make Democratic voters hold their nose and vote for a Republican candidate,” Roginsky says. “That’s what happened with Chris Christie in 2009, that’s what happened with Christie Todd Whitman in 1993. Then again, we’ve never had a Donald Trump before.” Registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, but the second-biggest bloc is independents, and last year Trump lost the state to Kamala Harris by just less than six points. Trump’s approval in the reliably blue state clocked in at 47% in a recent poll, which is just above the national average, and he has a particularly strong base in south Jersey.\n“I can’t imagine the Republicans believe they can win the governor’s race in Virginia—Trump has laid off half the state by now,” a New Jersey Democratic strategist says, referring to major cuts to the federal workforce. “So if they think they can win here, do they pour a hundred million dollars in crypto into the campaign? Ciattarelli is a good politician. For us, the message is going to boil down to: ‘We have to stop Trump here in New Jersey.’” Next week’s primary results should show who voters think is best equipped to not only lower their property taxes, but also stand up to the bully from Bedminster.","summary":"With the Garden State’s primaries just days away, the president is counting on Jack Ciattarelli for an off year GOP upset.

That represents a huge decline from 2008, the climax of the Barack Obama coalition, when the Democratic candidate won 62% of the young male vote against GOP challenger John McCain.Clearly, Democrats have a young man problem—and they've vowed to do something about it. Accordingly, the party is spending $20 million on a special multiyear effort called \"Speaking With American Men: A Strategic Plan.\" The project, The New York Times recently reported, will \"study the syntax, language, and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.\"Yes, really. Hold your laughter.It's true that leading Democratic figures could use some help on the \"syntax\" and \"language\" fronts. They might begin to right the ship, on that score, by ditching the infamous gobbledygook \"gaffes\" of Joe Biden and the \"unburdened by what has been\" word salads of Harris. But the rubber will meet the road for Democrats when it comes to the critical, elusive third category of concern for their new young male outreach effort: content.To paraphrase a venerable saying, one can put lipstick on a pig, but the pig, at the end of the day, is still a pig. And something big has to change for the Democrats. Nor is their problem limited to young men; the party's overall favorability ratings, in recent months, have hit record lows in public polling.Here, Democrats, is some (entirely) unsolicited advice on steps you might consider taking to become less catastrophically unpopular with young men—and many other Americans too.On the issue of sexuality and the human person, you might consider beginning your vaunted young male outreach efforts by deigning to properly define what exactly a \"man\" is—and, by extension, what a \"woman\" is as well. Indeed, your party's most recent Supreme Court nominee publicly struggled to crack this case. It is probably best, before attempting to devise pro-young-man public policy ideas, to familiarize yourselves with your target audience. The definition of \"man\" as it has existed since the Garden of Eden is a pretty good place to start.After successfully defining \"man\" and \"woman,\" you might consider not indulging recurring grievances levied against so-called toxic masculinity. It is generally a good idea, in political outreach, to not hold in dripping disdain the demographic group you are trying to reach. Sure, men have been killing each other since Cain slew Abel, but many of them have also been doing some pretty good things for humanity since around that same time period. One key to publicly rejecting misandry will be ditching support for \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" initiatives, which, along with also now being illegal, invariably take a pretty dim view of the heterogametic sex.On the issue of immigration, you might consider not opening up America's borders to, well, pretty much the whole world—but especially young males in search of economic opportunity in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Democrats might not have gotten this impression from the Harvard faculty lounge, but over half of Americans these days live paycheck to paycheck. Far too many young men struggle to provide for their families; indeed, many delay marriage in the first place because of finances. Flooding the zone with more wage competition may please the wokerati, but it won't help you regain credibility with American breadwinners.On the issue of environmentalism, you might consider not so conspicuously sacrificing American energy on the altar of climate alarmism. The young male voter simply wants a fair shot to make a decent living and provide safety and security for his family. The ham-handed restriction of hydrocarbon extraction does more than anything else to spike the price of every good or service. You might think that Trump's tariffs are a threat to price stability, but you'd be wrong—at least so far. The real threat to the fiscal well-being of the median American comes from the price of energy, from which all other prices flow. Maybe, just maybe, don't sacrifice all that on the altar of \"Mother Earth\"?The good news for Democrats is that there is a lot of potential upside from their efforts to reach young men. The bad news for Democrats is the same: There's so much to gain precisely because of how unpopular they currently are with that cohort.Josh Hammer is Newsweek senior editor-at-large, host of \"The Josh Hammer Show,\" senior counsel for the Article III Project, a research fellow with the Edmund Burke Foundation, and author of the new book, Israel and Civilization: The Fate of the Jewish Nation and the Destiny of the West (Radius Book Group).

The Red Scare of the subsequent decades, Pickard once told me, locked in a cultural suspicion of government intervention, in the media industry and beyond. There were experiments with public and educational broadcasting, culminating, in the late sixties and early seventies, with the establishment of NPR and PBS. But they came to rely increasingly on private funding, and they still do today.\nCritics of public backing for journalism have often argued that it represents a conflict of interest—a case of officials paying the piper to scrutinize their tune—and is vulnerable to the changing whims of politicians, especially if a tyrant comes along. Donald Trump’s new Administration has seemed determined to prove them right. Shortly after Trump’s Inauguration, Brendan Carr, the new chair of the Federal Communications Commission, suggested that NPR and PBS might illegally be airing commercials, and announced a probe; early last month, Trump signed an executive order bluntly demanding that they be defunded, decrying their supposedly radical coverage of everything from reparations to “queer ducks”; then, this week, the Administration sent a so-called rescissions package to Congress, asking lawmakers to repeal public-media funds that they had already approved. Trump has also sought to gut the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which funds news organizations that broadcast overseas, most notably Voice of America. These are very different entities than NPR and PBS—some have roots in the counter-propaganda operations of the Second World War and the Cold War, and all of them are still seen as tools of U.S. soft power—but they are designed to be editorially independent, and often do produce good journalism.\nWhen I reconnected with Pickard recently, he acknowledged that it’s understandable why, “at first glance,” Trump’s attacks appear to be “a perfect enactment of every liberal and libertarian’s worst nightmare for when you allow government to get involved in our media system.” And yet Pickard, who has advocated for greater government support for journalism, doesn’t see this moment in such terms. Indeed, if anything, it’s showing how public media institutions can sometimes stand up more strongly to authoritarians than their commercial counterparts. And below the federal level, a groundswell of state-based initiatives—albeit nothing, yet, to match the ambition of the Los Angeles Municipal News—have started to funnel support to local news, a sector in dire financial crisis, with jobs drying up, news deserts spreading, and private-equity vultures picking over the bones. The Trump era could even come to be remembered not for reinforcing the taboo around greater public investment in media but for catalyzing a move toward more of it.\nNow that Trump is trying to take away the broadcasters’ federal funding, it could plausibly be argued that their commercial revenue streams are protecting them. But the cuts would nonetheless be painful for NPR and PBS. And for the many local stations that operate in the wider public broadcasting network, and have ties to NPR and PBS, cuts do carry existential stakes. Some stations are much more reliant on direct federal funding, especially in rural areas where commercial media is less viable and where, as a result, public media is perhaps most vital, not only in its news output but in its provision of emergency alerts or educational services, such as connecting local schoolchildren with books and technology.\nAnd Trump’s executive order appears to be blatantly illegal—while critics think that the C.P.B. isn’t as protected from political influence as it could be, Congress did clearly establish the body as a private nonprofit beyond the reach of direct executive meddling. The C.P.B. has refused to enforce the order, and, last week, both NPR and PBS went to court to fight back. (Both suits also cite the First Amendment, which generally forbids the President from retaliating against speech he doesn’t like, be that about queer ducks or anything else.) Congress could claw back the funding. But past attempts to defund NPR and PBS—including in Trump’s first term—have failed, and public media has quite a wide base of support. (People tend to like Big Bird.) A few Republicans in both the House and the Senate—where the Party’s margins are fine—have expressed skepticism about legislating any cuts, though senior Republicans told reporters from NPR that they are confident the bill will pass when it comes up for a vote in the House next week.\nMore than anything, Trump’s attacks seem intended to demonstrate leverage—that he’ll use the tools available to come after journalism that displeases him. This applies regardless of how the journalism is paid for. Public funding is one potential source of leverage, but that leverage is far from total. Nor is it unique. Trump’s authoritarian designs have often been compared, including by Andrew Marantz in this magazine, to Viktor Orbán’s regime in Hungary. Orbán has gained a large measure of control over the media, but, as Matt Pearce, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who is now director of policy at Rebuild Local News, a public-policy advocacy group, noted to me recently, he did this, in no small part, by making it easier for outside allies to buy up and capture private companies. Nothing on this scale has happened in the U.S. (Yet.) But there have been some worrying signs. Jeff Bezos—the owner of the Washington Post, whose many other business interests are very dependent on the federal government—has interfered with his paper’s opinion pages in ways that have been widely interpreted as sucking up to Trump, and of which Trump has expressed explicit approval.\nThe most worrisome case is that of Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which is currently seeking F.C.C. approval for a merger; Trump has sued CBS News for supposedly defrauding the public in the way it edited an interview with Kamala Harris on “60 Minutes” last year, and, even though the complaint is absurd, CBS is poised to settle, a stance that appears to be linked to the merger. (Paramount has denied this.) Recently, Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” quit, suggesting that corporate bosses were meddling with the program, which has continued to cover Trump sharply; last week, Lesley Stahl, the veteran “60 Minutes” journalist, told David Remnick on The New Yorker Radio Hour that the majority of the staff saw Owens as “heroic” for standing up to the pressure and viewed his departure as a “punch in the stomach.” The pressure, Stahl added, “makes me question whether any corporation should own a news operation.”\nIn recent years, various states have passed, or at least considered, a range of measures to support local outlets, including tax breaks, fellowship programs for early-career journalists, and redistributing tech profits to newsrooms. New York, Illinois, and California each enacted one or some of these measures last year; there’s been movement in a similar direction, albeit to differing extents, in Connecticut, Maryland, Kansas, Hawaii, Washington State, and Oregon. (New York, meanwhile, just allocated four million extra dollars to public-radio stations in light of the federal threat.) These are mostly blue states, but such efforts have often had at least some bipartisan backing. And while popular perceptions of national media are sharply polarized, people generally trust their local news sources more—a bit like how “people hate Congress, but they kind of like their own Congressperson,” Pearce told me. Republican lawmakers in Oregon recently opposed a plan that would require Big Tech to pay for journalism that was shared on its platforms, he noted, but then counterproposed a tax-credit program for subscriptions to local news. “You have Republican leaders proposing public subsidies for journalism, out of recognition that there is a local-news crisis,” Pearce said.\nProgress in public support for media has a long way to go, and is not linear. State governments have less money than their federal counterparts, and some states have lately proposed cuts to their public broadcasters—red Indiana, but also blue New Jersey, both citing budgetary constraints. California and Google both scaled back their initial contributions under a deal, struck last year, to jointly pump millions of dollars into local news.\nThe decline of local news, however, has already made it clear that the private sector can’t be trusted to produce it at scale—and the Trump years, marked as they have been by polarized tumult, distrust, and disinformation, have made it clear that what local news offers is more necessary than ever. More broadly, “we’re seeing, spectacularly demonstrated before our eyes, all the limitations of a hyper-commercialized media system, in the ways that they fold so easily, they prematurely obey a would-be autocrat, and also the rise of these media and tech oligarchs,” Pickard told me. “This is what the market produces.” The Trump moment might be one of threat and chaos—but it’s also, as a consequence, one of possibility. Pickard stressed to me that the world’s strongest democracies all spend much more on public media than the U.S., and that any long-term “re-democratization” project must learn this lesson. “It’s hard to imagine any of this happening under Trump,” he said. “But Trump’s not gonna be in power forever.” ♦","summary":"Government-backed institutions sometimes stand up more strongly to authoritarianism than their commercial counterparts.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/can-public-media-survive-trump","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6841ff0463fd0b3005c14c38/16:9/w_2800,h_1575,c_limit/_TNY_FaultLines_250606_TrumpMedia_02%20(1).png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 10:00:00","author":"Jon Allsop","authors":["Jon Allsop"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049},{"id":328705598,"title":"As power shifts toward the executive branch, presidents matter more than ever","text":"The American presidency – the most powerful office in the world – is in some ways a vast group enterprise. Scores of aides oversee various departments, with hundreds of thousands of employees and billion-dollar budgets. The leader of the free world can seem like a kind of “chairman of the board,” sitting atop a massive government bureaucracy that can, and sometimes does, run itself.\n\nBut the past two occupants of the Oval Office have revealed pointedly how much the person behind the Resolute Desk really matters – perhaps now more then ever. As the balance of power in the federal government continues to shift toward the executive branch, the actions, or inactions, of the president himself can have a sharp impact on the country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s tariff policy is Exhibit A. His sharp shifts in strategy, which at times apparently even caught top aides off guard, have single-handedly roiled international markets, upended relationships with allies, and created economic uncertainty for businesses. While aides are working to negotiate trade deals and project a sense of stability, it’s clearly Mr. Trump and his lifelong enthusiasm for tariffs driving the policy – sometimes via late-night social media posts.\n\nIn the case of former President Joe Biden, an overly hands-off approach also proved impactful. Recent reporting about the president’s decline in office suggests that while Mr. Biden was engaged on foreign policy, certain domestic issues seemed to fall through the cracks – like the porous southern border, which the Biden administration did not get a handle on until late in his term.\n\nMr. Trump lit a fuse on the “Biden competency” discussion Wednesday, when he ordered an investigation into his predecessor’s actions as well as those of Mr. Biden’s staff. This includes determining whether certain actions were taken on his behalf without his knowledge, such as the use of an “autopen” to sign official documents, which the Trump administration says could throw their legality into doubt. In a statement, Mr. Biden called the claims “ridiculous and false.”\n\nBut the larger issues around the growing power of the presidency remain. Technically, Congress remains the Article 1 branch of government in the Constitution, with its powers enumerated before those of the president in Article 2. In reality, however, the legislative branch has ceded much power to the executive branch in recent years, as polarization has led to more party-line votes and greater gridlock. The courts, meanwhile, are slow and deliberative, and their rulings have no enforcement mechanism.\n\nIn this era of expanded executive power, the president’s team also carries outsize weight – as seen in the thousands of layoffs and departmental closings instigated by billionaire Elon Musk during his five-month stint at the Department of Government Efficiency. But it’s ultimately still the president who selects and directs those team members, for better or worse.\n\n“The presidency can’t really be run by a cabal of faceless bureaucrats,” says Chris Whipple, author of “Uncharted,” a book on the 2024 campaign. “The president matters.”\n\nLess influence on domestic than foreign affairs?\n\nPolling suggests that Americans have always seen their presidents as having a great deal of impact on the military and foreign policy, but less so on domestic issues, where Congress and local governments tend to play a role as well. Still, a new YouGov survey found that 60% of respondents now say the president has “total” or “a lot of” control over tariffs – an indication of how Mr. Trump’s actions are being perceived, and the degree to which he may be held responsible for the results by voters. Tariffs weren’t even a question in a preelection iteration of the YouGov poll, taken in July 2024.\n\nIn fact, under the Constitution, tariffs are within Congress’ purview, but under a 1977 statute, that power has accrued increasingly to the president. The issue is likely to land at the Supreme Court.\n\nIn President Trump’s second term, analysts say he’s pushing the boundaries of what’s legal and constitutional in carrying out his agenda. And the centrality of the man himself, a compelling and charismatic figure – love him or loathe him – has been made abundantly clear.\n\nThe president’s rapid-fire crackdown on immigration also highlights the importance that one person can play in American governance, as he has used emergency powers to secure the southern border, rounded up and deported thousands of unauthorized immigrants, and rescinded the protected status of certain migrants that was bestowed by his predecessor.\n\nBoth Mr. Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies are stress-testing the system of checks and balances established by the Founding Fathers, flooding the judiciary with cases that could shape American jurisprudence long into the future.\n\nIn his maximalist approach to executive power, Mr. Trump has filled key administration posts with a close eye for loyalty to his agenda. His inner circle is a more cohesive group than in the first term, says an aide who also served in the first Trump administration. This person expresses relief that people like John Kelly, the second of Mr. Trump’s four chiefs of staff in his first term, and other voices of internal dissent aren’t part of Trump 2.0.\n\nMr. Whipple points to the current Trump chief of staff, Susie Wiles, as particularly effective so far in helping him carry out his agenda.\n\n“The White House is no longer just a battlefield of internecine warfare and backstabbing,” says Mr. Whipple, also author of the 2017 book “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.”\n\nThe importance of internal debate\n\nOther observers, however, note that there are downsides to having a staff that often operates as cheerleaders and actively refrains from telling the president hard truths.\n\n“Most presidents in the past have recognized the importance of dissenting views and talking to people who disagree with him on various grounds ... because they don’t want to make a mistake,” says Terry Moe, a professor emeritus of political science at Stanford University. But Mr. Trump “thinks that he knows all kinds of things that actually he doesn’t know. And that people need to get in line.”\n\nThat suggests things like ego can also play a greater role. Last Friday, a reporter asked the president a question about “TACO,” an internet meme about the on-again-off-again tariff threats that stands for “Trump always chickens out.”\n\nThe president hadn’t heard the term before and took offense. “Nasty question,” he snapped. Then he recovered: “It’s called negotiation.”\n\nFormer President Biden also surrounded himself with aides who not only avoided telling the president what he didn’t want to hear but also, according to reporting in a new book, “Original Sin,” actively worked to hide the president’s mental and physical decline from the public.\n\nMr. Whipple’s book about the 2024 campaign comes to a somewhat different conclusion. “Biden’s closest advisers were lost in a fog of denial and delusion” themselves, he says. “They believed, many of them, that Biden could win [a second term]. They still believe it.”\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Biden boasts a record of accomplishment, from getting the country through the COVID-19 pandemic to making massive infrastructure investments to addressing climate change. But he was rarely exposed to the press for more than quick unscripted encounters for much of his term, and seemed increasingly trapped in a bubble.\n\nDespite their differences, both presidents share a common attribute: a fervent belief in himself. “I alone can fix it,” Mr. Trump famously said in his 2016 GOP convention speech, referring to a government that he said was letting down everyday Americans.\n\nMr. Biden, in his failed 2024 campaign, held to the view that he alone could defeat Mr. Trump, having beaten him in the 2020 election, according to multiple books examining last year’s race. Mr. Biden interpreted the Democrats’ better-than-expected 2022 midterm results as a vote of confidence in his leadership, blowing past his 2020 statement that he’d be a “bridge” to the next generation of Democratic leadership – strongly suggesting he’d be a one-term president.\n\nIn the end, the former president was forced from the race last July after a disastrous debate with Mr. Trump, effectively handing the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"The U.S. president can seem like a “chairman of the board,” atop a massive bureaucracy that often runs itself.

I don’t know if we will any more, I was surprised,’ Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president then suggested that Musk was angry – not over the bill ballooning the deficit – but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX’s government contracts.\n\n‘And you know, Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they’re having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,’ Trump said. ‘I know that disturbed him.’\n\nThe president had pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA over the weekend, and Trump claimed Musk – who had worked with Isaacman at SpaceX – recommended him for the job.\n\nBut, he said, he ‘didn’t think it was appropriate, and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat.’\n\n‘We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don’t have to appoint a Democrat,’ the president continued.\n\nMusk posted to X as Trump’s Q&A with reporters was ongoing, writing: ‘Whatever.’\n\n‘Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,’ he advised of Trump’s spending plan.\n\n‘In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!’ Musk continued. ‘Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.’\n\nFrom there, the spat became personal – with Musk claiming Trump would not have won the 2024 presidential election without his help.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican’s campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk’s help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn’t choose the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, ‘I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.’ \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n‘Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,’ Musk claimed. \n\n‘Such ingratitude,’ the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president. \n\n‘Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as president, but I will be around for 40+ years,’ Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from Trump ally Laura Loomer. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump claimed that the billionaire went ‘CRAZY!’\n\n‘Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!’ Trump wrote. \n\nAt that point, the president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla’s government contracts. \n\n‘The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!’ Trump wrote. \n\nThat only prompted Musk to taunt the president and say he would decommission the space ships that are taking NASA astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. \n\nHe also made an eye-popping claim that the president is ‘in the Epstein files,’ which he said is the ‘real reason they have not been made public.’ \n\nThe president had pledged to release the files related to serial child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released some pages – but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n‘Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,’ Musk added. \n\nTrump has not directly responded to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk’s Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: ‘This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.’\n\n‘The president is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,’ Leavitt added. \n\nA source familiar with the president also pointed out to the Daily Mail that ‘everyone knows President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club.’\n\n‘The Administration itself released Epstein files with the president’s name included. This is not a new surprise Elon is uncovering. Everyone already knew this,’ the source continued. \n\nThe source also mused, ‘If Elon truly thought the president was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hangout with him for six months and say he “loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?”‘ \n\nAs the feud continued on Thursday, Republicans were lining up behind either Musk or Trump – with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sharing a post praising the president’s spending bill and Steve Bannon claiming that Musk is an ‘illegal alien’ who should be deported.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he was trying to defuse the situation and was urgently ‘trying to call Elon now’ as Tesla shares dropped almost 15 percent.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSquad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has shared her thoughts on Donald Trump&#8217;s falling out with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: AOC Offers Amusing Commentary on the Feud Between Trump and Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/aoc-offers-amusing-commentary-on-the-feud-between-trump-and-musk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AOC-gives-hilarious-take-on-Trump-and-Musks-explosive-feud.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 09:14:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":328701316,"title":"MARK HALPERIN: Democrats try to construct a Frankenstein candidate while JD Vance gains momentum for 2028","text":"There are two truths about presidential candidates. One: There is no such thing as a perfect candidate. Two: It is very difficult to convince party elites that there are no perfect candidates. CHARLAMAGNE GRILLS ERIC SWALWELL ON HOW DEMS CAN BE TRUSTED AFTER THEY 'LIED TO US SO LONG' ABOUT BIDEN President Donald Trump’s second first 100 days are now behind him, and the Democrats are still struggling to recover after the trauma of the 2024 election. As former President Joe Biden focuses on treatment for his cancer diagnosis, fresh questions about the chronology of Biden’s decline in mental and physical health have further wafted Kamala Harris’ hopes of a second presidential or California gubernatorial bid off the political radar and out to sea. The Democrats have made it no secret they are in a desperate quest for the proper frontrunner/savior who can patch the torn fabric of their political and policy agenda, show enough leadership chops to unite both the Democratic Party and the country, and then go on to win back the White House in 2028. Former President Bill Clinton used to say of his own complicated story, \"If you want a perfect candidate, vote for somebody else.\" Yet back in 1992, despite myriad personal dramas, Clinton possessed many elements of the classic successful contender of that era: young but seasoned, a governor from a Southern state, folksy in style but gilded academically (Georgetown and Yale), respected for his brilliance within the party but able to relate to a broad swath of the voting public. PETER DOOCY, JACQUI HEINRICH SHARE SHOCK OVER KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DITCHING DEMOCRATS: 'SHE WAS WRONG' As always, at this stage of the cycle, the names of dozens of potential contenders from the out-party are being tossed about with the typical fervid combo of optimism, conviction, delusion and brio. But no potential candidate has yet broken out as an obvious frontrunner, let alone a great political athlete or generational talent such as Clinton or President Barack Obama. That is not to say that the Democratic field does not include highly intelligent, highly accomplished and highly skilled women and men. The potential contenders are an extraordinary bunch of American leaders. But none has all the necessary elements to take on the current White House or make a clear bid to win it all. Clinton, always good for a pithy remark, also has noted, \"you can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle.\" In 2028, if one could take a page from Dr. Frankenstein and turn that pig into an eagle, which attributes would the Democrats choose for their perfect model? PELOSI'S STOCK TRADING LEGACY HAUNTS DEMOCRATS AS JEFFRIES SLAMS GOP FRESHMAN'S 'THIEVERY' Let’s start with Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary under Biden and before that, the wunderkind \"Mayor Pete\" of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg, like Trump, has what one might call a \"go-on-anything confidence.\" Pete can appear on any television network, any podcast, any stage (from vast stadiums to slatted apple crates), in any state in America, and feel comfortable and poised with his audience. That trait is an essential component for 2028. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, whose good looks and stylish mien often are cited more as a disadvantage than an attribute, has a profound understanding of what is modern and urgent for today’s electorate. Newsom thinks tirelessly about America’s future, and what is important to the young and the old, growing families and hard-working tradespeople, and everyone in between. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the popular governor of a swing state, understands how to connect with voters in a battleground arena by focusing on economic concerns and remaining on the right side of cultural issues despite party pressure. Rahm Emanuel, former congressman, White House chief of staff, mayor of Chicago, and former ambassador to Japan, brings not just his famous rough-and-tumble uncompromising bravado, but an ability to raise massive amounts of cash. His fundraising power comes from the business community, where he made millions; from Hollywood, where his brother, Ari Emanuel remains an uber mover and shaker; and from decades of fundraising amidst America’s wealthiest Democratic communities. FETTERMAN DEFIES 'PUNITIVE' PUNISHMENT FOR BREAKING WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY DURING BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION Amy Klobuchar, senator from Minnesota, has a fierce determination and inner energy that will allow her to set goals and follow through with conviction. This is an essential combo required to win a modern political contest. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, has shown he can twist the old adage of former New York pol Mario Cuomo, who spoke of campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. Shapiro, on the other hand, is able to merge poetry and prose in his governance, achieving solid substantive goals while creating an atmosphere of aspiration and inspiration for his constituents. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, has the \"It Factor.\" Bright, charismatic, and always interesting, she commands attention whenever she speaks. (Or tweets, or comments, or posts, or poses). Gina Raimondo, Biden’s Commerce secretary and former governor of Rhode Island, is well-known, well-liked, and well-respected in the business community, which offsets a huge imbalance on the Republican side. A pro-business Democrat, Raimondo can speak the language of the business world, get its political support and earn its trust. DEMOCRATS WANT ICE AGENTS TO LOSE MASKS DESPITE SAFETY CONCERNS Ro Khanna, congressman from California, understands policy and how to connect it to the real lives of real people. Khanna is a stand-out in the Democratic Party who can envision viable policy ideas and can explain his plans plainly to the American people. Wes Moore, the governor of Maryland, has a powerful origin story and biography. After overcoming some early challenges, Moore thrived academically, served in the military, worked on Wall Street, authored several books, ran a leading nonprofit, and dedicated his life to service. He has shown a capacity to link lessons learned from his life experience to his policy goals. Meanwhile, over on the Republican side, the GOP already has their frontrunner. And with JD Vance, there currently is no assembly required. With just a few months as vice president under his (Rust) belt, Vance already has proven to be perhaps the most powerful and effectual vice president in history — yes, even including Dick Cheney, Al Gore and LBJ. Not only has Vance brilliantly managed to remain this close to the mercurial Trump without once stepping on his presidential toes, but he has forged solid bonds with fellow politicos (even those who initially looked askance when Vance was tapped for the ticket).

Glenn Youngkin. Clinton, always good for a pithy remark, also has noted, \"you can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle.\" Vance has an additional, and unique, advantage. Most vice presidents who are champing to step into the top spot only get the chance after slogging through eight long years as a second banana, and must fight for the job just as the country has grown weary of the current administration and are longing for a new dynamic. Some, such as George H. W. Bush, can slide into office riding the departing fumes of their popular boss, while others, such as Al Gore, fumble to seal the deal.

After one of the most notable spokespersons of their party has decided to turn their back, she’s drawing shocking criticism with her new book. \n\nKarine Jean-Pierre served as former President Joe Biden’s press secretary from 2022 to 2025, when he left office. Known for her fiery exchanges with reporters and politicians across the aisle, Jean-Pierre is prepping to release her new book titled “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.” But although it hasn’t dropped yet, it’s already faces criticism for one shocking reason.\n\nAccording to a press release for her book, Jean-Pierre is taking a step back from the Democratic party and planning to register as an Independent. “In a country obsessed with blind loyalty to a two-party democratic system, Karine Jean-Pierre… shares why Americans must step beyond party lines to embrace life as Independents,” the release read.\n\nThe motivation behind Jean-Pierre’s departure from the Democrats seems to stem from the treatment of Biden around campaign season. The former president faced bipartisan backlash after his mental and physical health was questioned while he was still in the race against Trump. As his press secretary, Jean-Pierre handled daily inquires about Biden’s mental state. But she said watching her party turn against Biden was the most shocking of all.\n\nIn a statement for Legacy Lit Jean-Pierre said, “I determined that the danger we face as a country requires freeing ourselves of boxes.” Now, she’s urging folks to look at the dangers of a bipartisan system, which America’s first president, George Washington, famously warned about centuries ago. \n\nAfter former Vice President Kamala Harris’ devastating loss to Trump, the Democrats were sent back to the drawing board in hopeful preparation for the 2028 election. But in the mean time, criticism from the former face of the Biden administration can’t be good for party morale. \n\nDemocrats came out with acute criticisms for her. Former aide to Joe Manchin III, Sen. Jonathan Kott, said he’s “sick and tired of Democrats not being proud to be Democrats and fighting for what we believe in.” He continued, according to the New York Times, “If you lost the will to fight, then get out of the party.”\n\nOn the flip side, Black folks online responded praising Jean-Pierre for finally waking up. “Karine Jean-Pierre is speaking for a lot of black women. You can call her newly declared political status a stunt but it’s not,” @2Strong2Silence said on X. “The 92 [percent] said they were centering themselves & declaring oneself free from a party that wants to chase white men is a start.”\n\n“See the way people are piling on Karine Jean-Pierre DESPITE the ACTUAL premise of her book & declaring herself Independent,” @darryn_briggs began. “This is PRECISELY the reason many of us KNEW it was dangerous for Kamala Harris to be the nominee.”\n\nAnother user, @Needle_of_Arya, said “between (how they’ve treated) Karine Jean-Pierre, Meghan Markle & Kamala Harris, we have only a taste of how deeply pervasive casual & knee-jerk misogynoir is in our society.”\n\nHer book is expected to release on October 21, 2025.","summary":"As the Democratic party continues to pick up the pieces from VP Harris' loss, news of the former press secretary's recent departure drew strong criticisms.\n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/why-karine-jean-pierre-is-bailing-on-the-democratic-par-2000044143","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06083334/2025-06-04T172225Z_365593737_RC2BVAAF1UHF_RTRMADP_3_USA-WHITEHOUSE-JEAN-PIERRE-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 09:00:00","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.481},{"id":328666576,"title":"Graham: Dems failing political math of Boulder attack","text":"Democrats have a math problem: “No Person Is Illegal” + “Free, Free Palestine” = Jews set ablaze by an antisemitic undocumented immigrant in Boulder, Colo.\n\nThe question now is whether the party can change the calculations with its current coalition.\n\nThe facts in the Boulder case aren’t contested. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is an Egyptian national who was in the country illegally when he turned his “improvised flame thrower” on peaceful activists supporting the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAlso not in dispute: The Democratic Party’s stance on the issues of border security and anti-Israel rhetoric. It opposes the former and has a discomfiting tolerance for the latter.\n\nDemocrats have spent decades burnishing their brand as opponents of immigration enforcement. They blocked President Trump’s first-term attempt to build a border wall, and they unanimously supported legislation to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens in the United States.\n\nOn the crime front, the vast majority of Democrats in Congress voted against the Laken Riley Act, passed in response to the gruesome murder of a Georgia college student killed by an undocumented alien who had previously been arrested on other charges and released. And Democrats continue to support sanctuary city policies across the country.\n\nAs for the party’s “Free Palestine” problem, the surge of antisemitism in the party’s coalition is hardly breaking news. Just ask Gov. Josh Shapiro, the popular Democrat who could have helped Kamala Harris carry the must-win state of Pennsylvania but whose standing as a practicing Jew and a supporter of Israel made him politically suspect in his party.\n\nDuring this year’s Passover season, an antisemitic assailant snuck into the governor’s mansion while Shapiro and his family slept and set the building on fire. The attacker cited Shapiro’s stance on Gaza as his motive, quoting language often heard among progressives.\n\nIn 2023, Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s chants of “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Shall Be Free!” led to a censure resolution by the House of Representatives. The slogan is a regular feature at anti-Israel rallies and appears in Hamas propaganda.\n\nWhile the censure resolution easily passed the House, only 22 Democrats voted in favor of it. An additional 188 Democrats voted in defense of Tlaib.\n\nNot surprisingly, the party has seen its support among Jewish voters slipping. In 2024, Fox News and the Associated Press exit polling found just 66% of Democrats voted for the Harris-Walz ticket, the lowest percentage since the Reagan era.\n\nBut the bigger problem is that typical Americans who tune in to politics only around Election Day continue to pick up the message that if you like undocumented aliens and hate Israelis, the Democratic Party is for you.\n\nThat is a simplistic and incomplete description of an entire political party whose nominee won 48% of the vote in the November election. However, most voters don’t do complexity and nuance. If Democrats keep holding “Free Palestine” rallies and suing to get undocumented immigrants with gang ties back into the country, voters will react.\n\nOn a recent episode of his 2Way program, veteran political journalist Mark Halperin said left-leaning reporters giving Democrats a pass on this math problem aren’t doing them any favors.\n\n“The dominant media is wrapping them in blue bubble wrap and leaving them completely vulnerable to reality.”\n\nSo, why aren’t Democratic leaders stepping up to address this problem within their ranks? Democratic operative Dan Turrentine, who also appeared on Halperin’s show, put it like this:\n\n“They’re afraid of their base. A lot of senators and governors have this super-progressive 15 to 20% of the electorate, and they’re like, ‘I don’t need the headache of going to war with them, so I say nothing.’ That was Kamala Harris’ principle during her campaign,” Turrentine said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democrats and their allies tried to give Harris cover on her role in the Joe Biden age cover-up and her extreme stance on transgender issues. New books about the Biden White House reveal that the press shrugged off the age issue. And when news outlets bothered to cover the transgender topic, it was to denounce Trump for even bringing it up.\n\nWhat happened? Democrats lost the House, Senate and White House.\n\nToday, many Democrats insist their party doesn’t have an undocumented immigration or antisemitism problem, that it’s all right-wing spin.\n\nIn 2026, they may be reminded of another political theorem: There is no education in the second kick from a mule.\n\nMichael Graham is the managing editor of InsideSources.com","summary":"Democrats have a math problem: “No Person Is Illegal” + “Free, Free Palestine” = Jews set ablaze by an antisemitic undocumented immigrant in Boulder, Colo.

In the last election, the Democrats were criticised for not understanding young American men. Speaking with American Men project came up in the $20 million (171.68 crore) budget spanning two years for studying young men's perspectives, and their initial findings revealed widespread disillusionment. The results of an initial round of research shared exclusively with POLITICO — including 30 focus groups and a national media consumption survey — found many young men believe that “neither party has our back,” as one Black man from Georgia said in a focus group. Participants described the Democratic Party as overly-scripted and cautious, while Republicans are seen as confident and unafraid to offend. The SAM project, despite becoming a target of criticism, positions itself as a research centre focusing on young men, who shifted towards Donald Trump in 2024. The initiative's leadership includes former NARAL president Hogue, Gen Z specialist pollster John Della Volpe, and former Texas Representative Colin Allred. Research revealed young men experiencing significant stress about modern masculinity in 2025. They expressed concerns about post-pandemic isolation and financial pressures, with traditional achievements appearing increasingly unattainable. Survey data showed only 27% of young men viewed Democrats favourably, compared to 43% for Republicans. The 2024 election saw Kamala Harris securing merely 42% of male votes, with particularly significant losses among Latino and Black men. Focus group participants highlighted contrasting perceptions: Democrats were associated with emotional sensitivity, whilst Republicans represented traditional provider roles. A Las Vegas participant criticised Harris's celebrity-focused campaign, preferring Trump's economic messaging. The project advocates for enhanced digital engagement through platforms like Discord and Twitch, suggesting Democrats must adapt their communication methods.

Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.’\n\nWhether Trump will accept the offer of a truce and that any damage in their relationship can be repaired, remains to be seen. \n\nOn his ‘War Room Live’ broadcast Bannon urged the president to seize SpaceX from Musk under the Defense Production Act – a national security measure dating back to the Korean War era – to seize control of the company. \n\n‘The United States government should take possession of it,’ Bannon declared. \n\nIn practice, seizing SpaceX which is a private company would prove difficult. \n\nWhile the Defense Production Act gives the president broad powers to prioritize contracts deemed necessary for national defense, expand productive capacity and supply of critical goods and materials and allocate resources like energy, materials, or services, it does not explicitly authorize outright seizure or nationalization of private companies.\n\nTrump could target Musk in other ways, such as targeting his contracts, clearances, and federal partnerships. \n\n‘Elon Musk is here illegally. He’s got to go,’ Bannon said, despite the fact that Musk, originally from South Africa, has been a naturalized US citizen for more than twenty years.\n\n‘They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,’ Bannon said in a phone interview on Thursday with The New York Times. \n\nOn his show, Bannon – who has long openly criticized the billionaire – called Musk an ‘unstable individual’ and a ‘national security issue,’ pointing to The New York Times report that charted the DOGE leader’s drug use. \n\n‘President Trump is a bull and Elon is a baby calf,’ Bannon also said. \n\nThe spat between Musk and Trump earlier broke out after the SpaceX boss voiced his opposition to the Republican-led ‘big, beautiful bill.’\n\nThe budget reconciliation bill will reportedly add trillions to the national deficit, a move that enraged Musk and prompted his departure from the Trump Administration.\n\nMusk had been overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had reported saving the US tens of billions of dollars on so-called wasteful government projects.\n\nDOGE’s goal had been to get that number into the trillions.\n\nFollowing his departure, a war of words broke out between Musk and the president over social media.\n\nSpaceX has been awarded over $17 billion in government contracts since 2015, according to ABC News. Much of that money comes from NASA and the Department of Defense.\n\nTesla has also received approximately $1 billion according to the latest figures from February.\n\nThe spectacular fallout between Trump and Musk – who were political allies for a little less than a year – started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill,’ arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThe fractures in their relationship were made plain for all to see.\n\nWhilst Trump was hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office he was asked about Musk’s recent criticism. From there, the dam broke. \n\n‘Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more, I was surprised,’ Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry – not over the bill ballooning the deficit – but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX’s government contracts.\n\n‘And you know, Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they’re having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,’ Trump said. ‘I know that disturbed him.’\n\nLast weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX.\n\n‘He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I’m sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn’t think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,’ Trump continued. ‘We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don’t have to appoint a Democrat.’ \n\nMusk posted to X while Trump’s Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n‘Whatever,’ the billionaire wrote. \n\n‘Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,’ he advised. \n\n‘In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!’ Musk continued. ‘Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.’ \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world’s richest man – him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican’s campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk’s help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn’t choose the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, ‘I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.’ \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n‘Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,’ Musk claimed. \n\n‘Such ingratitude,’ the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n‘Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,’ Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went ‘CRAZY!’\n\n‘Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!’ Trump wrote. \n\nTrump didn’t directly respond to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: ‘This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.’\n\n‘The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,’ Leavitt added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk seemed to attempt to de-escalate the escalating feud with Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Musk Extends Surprising Gesture to Trump Amid Worsening Relationship first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/musk-extends-surprising-gesture-to-trump-amid-worsening-relationship/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Musk-offers-stunning-olive-branch-to-Trump-as-bromance-disintegrates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 04:57:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":328638476,"title":"Paramount chair Shari Redstone confirms cancer diagnosis amid high-stakes sale linked to Trump’s $25 million ‘60 Minutes’ lawsuit","text":"Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone has confirmed her thyroid cancer diagnosis amid a high-stakes sale linked to President Donald Trump’s $25 million 60 Minutes lawsuit. \n\nThe diagnosis was made about two months ago, but hadn’t been revealed until a spokesperson for the media executive broke the news to multiple outlets on Thursday. \n\nRedstone was diagnosed after experiencing symptoms including fatigue. \n\nHer thyroid gland was removed, but some of the cancer cells had spread to her vocal cords, according to The New York Times, which first reported the diagnosis. \n\nRedstone’s spokesperson, Molly Morse, said the Paramount chair is being treated with radiation.\n\n“She and her family are grateful that her prognosis is excellent,” Morse said. \n\nIn the meantime, Redstone will continue to head Paramount.\n\n“While it has been a challenging period, she is maintaining all professional and philanthropic activities throughout her treatment, which is ongoing,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe news of Redstone’s diagnosis comes as Paramount works to close a merger with Skydance Media. \n\nSkydance agreed to acquire Paramount last July, which would leave the Redstone family without a stake in the company.\n\nBut the merger still requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Plans for the merger became more complicated last October when Trump sued CBS News, which Paramount owns, and its news program, 60 Minutes.\n\nAt the heart of the lawsuit, in which Trump is seeking more than $25 million, is an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris the program aired before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argue that the editing of a long-winded answer the then-Democratic presidential nominee gave was “deceitful.”\n\nHarris was shown giving two different answers to the same question during a preview of the episode on Face the Nation and when the 60 Minutes episode aired later that day. \n\n60 Minutes fired back, calling Trump’s claims “false” and arguing that they edited the interview to be “more succinct.”\n\n“60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,” the program said. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that Paramount has offered Trump a $15 settlement, citing people familiar with the matter. \n\nThis prompted Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ron Wyden of Oregon to write a letter to Redstone, warning the executive that Paramount “may be breaking the law.”\n\n“Paramount appears to be trying to settle a lawsuit that it has assessed as ‘completely without merit,’ and moderating the content of its programs in order to obtain approval of this merger. Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act,” the letter read.","summary":"“She and her family are grateful that her prognosis is excellent,” Redstone’s spokesperson said.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/shari-redstone-paramount-thyroid-cancer-b2764882.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/08/18/PARAMOUNT-SKYDANCE-FUSI%C3%93N_25246.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/d8sdFmsg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-06 04:23:17","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":328607860,"title":"Calls increase for Trump to take control of SpaceX from Elon Musk after disagreement","text":"Donald Trump is under pressure to take immediate control of SpaceX following Elon Musk’s threat to leave NASA astronauts stranded in orbit due to a heated dispute with the president.\n\nAmid a fiery exchange on Thursday afternoon, Trump retaliated against Musk’s escalating remarks by proposing that the businessman’s lucrative government contracts be revoked.\n\n“The simplest way to save money in our budget—billions and billions of dollars—is by ending Elon’s government subsidies and contracts,” Trump announced on Truth Social. \n\nMusk promptly fired back, with the SpaceX chief saying he would begin ‘decommissioning’ his company’s Dragon spacecraft in response.\n\nThe spacecraft is vital for ferrying NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and a fierce critic of Elon Musk, quickly weighed in during his ‘War Room Live’ broadcast on Thursday.\n\nHe urged the president to seize SpaceX from the billionaire entrepreneur and invoke the Defense Production Act – a national security measure dating back to the Korean War era – to seize control of the company. \n\n‘The United States government should take possession of it,’ Bannon declared. \n\nIn practice, seizing SpaceX which is a private company would prove difficult. \n\nWhile the Defense Production Act gives the president broad powers to prioritize contracts deemed necessary for national defense, expand productive capacity and supply of critical goods and materials and allocate resources like energy, materials, or services, it does not explicitly authorize outright seizure or nationalization of private companies.\n\nTrump could target Musk in other ways, such as targeting his contracts, clearances, and federal partnerships. \n\nSpaceX has various contracts embedded within US national security infrastructure including Pentagon satellites (Starlink military versions), not to mention NASA’s Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. \n\nNevertheless Bannon went further still, suggesting Musk be stripped of his security clearance and that all federal contracts awarded to the billionaire’s various enterprises be suspended pending a full-scale investigation.\n\nBannon then went on to demand Trump initiate deportation proceedings against Musk.\n\n‘Elon Musk is here illegally. He’s got to go,’ Bannon said, despite the fact that Musk, originally from South Africa, has been a naturalized US citizen for more than twenty years.\n\n‘They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,’ Bannon said in a phone interview Thursday with The New York Times. \n\nLater on his show, Bannon – who has long openly criticized the billionaire – called Musk an ‘unstable individual’ and a ‘national security issue,’ pointing to The New York Times report that charted the DOGE leader’s drug use. \n\n‘President Trump is a bull and Elon is a baby calf,’ Bannon also said. \n\nFollowing the disintegration of Trump and Musk’s relationship, the SpaceX CEO posted on X that he had decided to decommission his company’s Dragon spacecraft ‘immediately.’\n\nThe move was in response to Trump posting on Truth Social that he would consider terminating all of the US government’s contracts with Musk’s commercial space company.\n\nThe decommissioning of the Dragon capsule would leave NASA without a proven American spacecraft capable of sending and retrieving astronauts from the space station.\n\nThere are currently four NASA astronauts on the ISS. It is unknown if Musk would allow astronauts to return to Earth on board the Dragon capsule still attached to the station.\n\nJust two months ago, Musk’s Dragon spacecraft came to the rescue of astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were stranded on board the ISS for 286 days.\n\nNASA also has a contract with Boeing, who is working on fixing their Starliner spacecraft, but the project has been plagued with problems that have left the craft untrustworthy for carrying humans to space at this time.\n\nThe spat between Musk and Trump broke out after the SpaceX boss voiced his opposition to the Republican-led ‘big, beautiful bill.’\n\nMusk argues the spending bill add trillions to the national deficit – a move that enraged the billionaire amid his departure from the Trump Administration.\n\nMusk had been overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had reported saving the US tens of billions of dollars on so-called wasteful government projects.\n\nDOGE’s goal had been to get that number into the trillions.\n\nOn Thursday, tensions between the pair reached new heights, and a war of words broke out between Musk and the president over social media.\n\nMusk claimed that Trump is ‘in the Epstein files’ and also suggested Trump should be impeached and replaced with 40-year-old Vice President JD Vance.\n\nMoments before the Epstein charge, Trump had taken to Truth Social and said he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went ‘CRAZY!’\n\nThe president then found a new way of saving money in the federal budget, posting that he could cut ‘Billions and Billions of Dollars’ by ending the government’s partnership with both of Musk’s companies – SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nSpaceX has been awarded over $17 billion in government contracts since 2015, according to ABC News. Much of that money comes from NASA and the Department of Defense.\n\nTesla has also received approximately $1 billion according to the latest figures from February.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, is a reusable spacecraft designed to transport cargo and astronauts to the ISS.\n\nIt consists of a reusable capsule for the astronauts and an expendable trunk module, launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThere have been two main variants of the capsule: the Dragon 1, which only carried cargo and has been retired, and the Dragon 2, which carries astronauts and cargo to space.\n\nA third variant, Dragon XL, has been in development as part of NASA’s Lunar Gateway project, but it’s not yet operational.\n\nDragon XL would be capable of carrying cargo to a new base on the moon. It’s unknown if the project will be cancelled as part of Musk’s declaration to decommission the Dragon capsules.\n\nEarlier on Thursday Musk agreed with a posting on X that Trump should be impeached and replaced with 40-year-old Vice President J.D. Vance amid their fiery falling out. \n\nX User Ian Miles Cheong wrote: ‘President vs Elon. Who wins? My money’s on Elon. Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him.’\n\n‘Yes,’ Musk responded. \n\nHe also predicted that Trump’s tariff policy would create economic turmoil. \n\n‘The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year,’ Musk said. \n\nThe impeachment call comes after Musk made the eye-popping claim that the president is ‘in the Epstein files’.\n\nThe spectacular fallout between Trump and Musk – who were political allies for a little less than a year – started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill,’ arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, earlier in the day when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office he was asked about Musk’s recent criticism.

I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!’ Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n‘This just gets better and better,’ he wrote. ‘Go ahead, make my day …’\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would ‘begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.’\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station – and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n‘Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,’ West wrote.\n\nAnd Musk threw the Epstein bomb. \n\n‘@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,’ Musk wrote. ‘Have a nice day, DJT!’ \n\nJeffrey Epstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n‘Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,’ Musk added. \n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail’s request for comment. \n\nTrump didn’t directly respond to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk’s Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: ‘This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.’\n\n‘The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,’ Leavitt added. \n\nTrump didn’t directly respond to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk’s Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nA source familiar pointed out to the Daily Mail that ‘everyone knows President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club.’\n\n‘The Administration itself released Epstein files with the President’s name included. This is not a new surprise Elon is uncovering. Everyone already knew this,’ the source continued. \n\nThe source also mused, ‘If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hangout with him for 6 months and say he “loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?”‘ \n\nIt was less than a week ago that Trump gave Musk a golden key and a DOGE send-off from the Oval Office.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is under pressure to take immediate control of SpaceX following&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Calls increase for Trump to take control of SpaceX from Elon Musk after disagreement first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/calls-increase-for-trump-to-take-control-of-spacex-from-elon-musk-after-disagreement/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-urged-to-immediately-SEIZE-Space-X-from-Musk-after.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 04:13:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25}]}
