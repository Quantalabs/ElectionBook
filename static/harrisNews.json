But it really got going when AI-generated images and video that memeified the stories went viral. Early this week, even before former President Donald Trump shocked debate viewers Tuesday night with talk of immigrants “eating the pets,” the topic gained momentum because high-profile accounts, including tech billionaire Elon Musk’s, shared the cartoonish images made with artificial intelligence. Using various AI apps including Musk’s Grok service and a Chinese-owned app, people made cutesy and sometimes racist images and videos in seconds in order to push the idea that Trump would protect animals while Vice President Kamala Harris would not. And once those images and videos were shared and reshared, some of them piled up tens of millions of views and made their way to Trump’s own social media accounts. Some of the images shared by social media users were openly prejudiced, showing Black people chasing after cats. In one often-shared example, an AI-generated Trump is seen running through a field with a cat under each arm while two shirtless Black men run after him. This year, many AI experts worried that realistic deepfakes would be a major threat to public discourse because of the ability to create believable audio or video of presidential candidates, but for the most part, the election has being shaped by obviously fake, AI-made joke images, pumped out quickly to accompany various lines of attack, real or not. These images and videos often create a more engaging and shareable post — regardless of whether they’re based in truth. A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media, said the images show how meme-making has been further democratized. “You no longer have to know a little bit of Photoshop,” he said, referring to the popular photo-editing software made by Adobe. “That certainly has sped up the memeification of this ‘eating cats and dogs’ trope,” he added. “Whereas it might have taken a little bit longer or it might have spread a little less far without AI, I think AI is allowing it to spread much more quickly at scale.” Bauer said that in this case, AI was particularly useful because Trump is famously not a fan of pets, so there are relatively few real photographs of him with animals. Unlike all other recent presidents, he didn’t have a pet in the White House. The claims about Haitian immigrants abducting and eating household pets are baseless, but they’ve had real-world consequences including in Springfield, Ohio, the epicenter of the rumor mill. Local schools and government offices have been targeted by bomb threats, and some Haitian immigrants have said they’re scared for their safety. But cat-related memes have a unique and long-standing power on the internet: from Grumpy Cat to “I Can Has Cheezburger?” “Encoding the demonization of immigrants into cute cat content causes people who aren’t necessarily open to demonizing immigrants to get in on the game,” Bauer said. “Who doesn’t like a cute cat, right?” The memes of AI-generated pets were notable for their variety. There were cats holding military-style rifles to defend themselves, cats holding up political signs, cats and ducks sitting side-by-side, AI-generated humans holding cat-related signs and cats and ducks being cuddled by Trump. And it came as a tsunami, with countless videos and images being uploaded starting last weekend on social media platforms such as Reddit, X, TikTok and Instagram. Some of the videos and images had captions to explain the meme: “Donald Trump saving the kittens of Springfield, Ohio,” one post on X said. Others were more subtle, with text such as “Save them!” Still others had no explanation. Pro-Harris AI-generated images related to pets appeared to be relatively rare, but social media users did share some such as one with Harris holding a dog and a sign saying “Dogs for Harris.” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an anti-hate nonprofit organization, said the memes revealed who likes to have fun at the expense of racial minorities. “The reactions from racists is delight. The reaction from most normal people is confusion or outright anger and opposition, depending on how immersed they are in arcane internet culture,” Ahmed said. He said the memes were also a warning sign about the state of media. “We can’t afford for our democracy to be reduced to fake images driving discourse,” he said. Late last Sunday on X, far-right activist Jack Posobiec posted an AI image of Trump running with a cat and a duck in his arms chased by a group of Black men. That post had 1.3 million views as of Friday. He also posted a six-second video of Trump carrying a cat with a group of zombies after him, which got 3.5 million views. Posobiec did not respond to a request for comment. On Monday morning, several accounts on X posted yet another AI image of Trump being chased by Black men, this time holding two kittens. The image made its way to the account @LibsofTikTok on Tuesday in a post that received 4.8 million views. That image also eventually made it onto late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s show, after the presidential debate. The @LibsofTikTok account did not respond to a request for comment. An X account belonging to House Judiciary Committee Republicans had perhaps the most widely viewed post Monday: an image of Trump chest-deep in water hugging both a duck and a cat. It had more than 87 million views as of Friday. Committee Republicans did not respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., printed out that post on a large display board and showed it at a committee hearing where he asked Republicans, “My God, are you OK?” Trump himself ended up posting several of the AI images to his feed on his social media app Truth Social on Tuesday and Thursday. They included an image of Trump sitting in a private jet, surrounded by animals. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. “Anyone with access to generative AI can spin up dozens of these images in no time at all,” said Alice Marwick, director of research at the nonprofit research organization Data & Society. Marwick compared the images and videos to a kind of instant comic book, with bright colors, extreme detail and an easy-to-consume message. And for most people, AI-generated content is still a novelty, adding to its appeal. “They have this incredibly wide reach and huge viral potential,” she said. But, she added, “in order to read that image, you need to have this sense of immigrants as dangerous.” Marwick said the whole episode is in some ways a continuation of the strategy that Trump and his allies used in 2016 to catapult him into the White House initially. “Since 2016, we’ve been sort of working in a meme economy in politics,” she said. Consumers now have a wide array of AI image generators to choose from to create pictures with a simple text command, and while many of them have rules in place to guard against election misinformation — such as not allowing people to make images of Harris or Trump — some AI image generators have no such rules. At least two of the widely viewed AI videos of Trump and animals were made using the software of Chinese AI startup MiniMax, according to watermarks on the videos. One of them, posted on X on Sunday afternoon, was a video of Trump kissing and nuzzling a duck on the back of the head with the caption, “I love you. I would never let the Haitians eat you.” It had 2.4 million views as of Friday. MiniMax and X did not respond to requests for comment on their services allegedly being used to create such images.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe rumor mill about immigrants attacking household pets got its start in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How AI-generated images of cats and ducks fueled the pet-eating gossip first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-ai-generated-images-of-cats-and-ducks-fueled-the-pet-eating-gossip/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240913-springfield-ohio-ONETIMEUSEmn-1500-7af2a2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 00:52:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.031},{"id":256432746,"title":"Harris wants war with Russia – Trump","text":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has asserted that an election victory for his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, would ultimately lead to war with Russia, warning of an impending “nuclear Holocaust.” During a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday, Trump expressed concern about a potential nuclear conflict due to the “incompetent people” in Washington, claiming he is the only one capable of preventing a global war. “You’re going to end up in World War III. You’re going to have a nuclear Holocaust if we’re not careful. These people have no idea what they’re doing,” he warned supporters, promising to keep Americans “out of World War III.” “I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will settle the war in Ukraine… I will resolve that as president-elect,” he continued, arguing that “a vote for comrade Kamala Harris is a vote for war with Russia.” Trump claimed that Harris aims to reinstate military conscription to “draft your child and put them in a war that should never have happened.” The former US president insists that the conflict in Ukraine would not have escalated if he had been in office at the time. Throughout his reelection campaign, he has repeatedly claimed he could stop the fighting “in 24 hours,” though he has not specified how. Earlier this week, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, shed light on a possible peace proposal, suggesting it would likely involve creating a demilitarized zone around the current line of contact and guaranteeing Ukraine’s neutrality to Moscow, which aligns with one of Russia’s main objectives. Harris, however, contends that Trump would abandon Ukraine, asserting that her efforts, along with the supply of ammunition, have ensured the country remains “independent and free” to this day.","summary":"Donald Trump has warned that casting a ballot for Kamala Harris equates to voting for a war with Russia \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604035-harris-war-russia-trump/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66e6246185f54060b2595ba4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 00:24:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":256432658,"title":"Tim Walz Advises Men Listen to Smart Women Like ‘Fellow Cat Owner’ Taylor Swift: ‘Help Us Beat the Smallest Man in the World’ | Video","text":"Tim Walz offered a “life hack” while speaking in Superior, Wisconsin on Saturday. “Here’s my life hack for all the guys out there: surround yourself with smart women and listen to them, and you’ll do just fine. That includes my fellow cat owner, Taylor Swift, too, by the way.” “It’s really great to have all of these women help us beat the smallest man in the world, Donald Trump,” he added, giving a nod to Swift’s “Tortured Poets Department” song “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.” Fan speculation around the song’s original subject was split between those who believed it was her ex Matty Healy of the 1975, or her prior longtime romantic partner, actor Joe Alwyn. The singer’s endorsement of the Harris-Walz campaign shortly after Tuesday night’s debate has been a boon to voter registration, which increased by 400-500% in the two days that followed. Both the Harris and the Trump campaigns have launched merch related to the singer since her endorsement. The Harris-Walz campaign debuted friendship bracelets on sale for $20 that quickly sold out (though more are available for pre-order); Trump’s campaign returned fire with Eras Tour-themed T-shirts that read “Make America Great Again,” covered with images of Trump styled after Swift’s own tour poster. Swift endorsed Harris and Walz moments after the first presidential debate concluded and wrote in part, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate Tim Walz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” Swift concluded, signing her message, “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.” You can watch Swift perform the song Tim Walz referenced on the Eras Tour below","summary":"Kamala Harris' running mate included the sly reference to a tune from the pop star's \"Tortured Poets Department,\" \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\"\n\n\nThe post Tim Walz Advises Men Listen to Smart Women Like ‘Fellow Cat Owner’ Taylor Swift: ‘Help Us Beat the Smallest Man in the World’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/tim-walz-taylor-swift-cat-smallest-man-who-ever-lived-trump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tim-walz-swift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 00:17:07","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.364},{"id":256432810,"title":"Britney Spears' ex Sam Asghari sparks dating rumors with a mystery woman in Beverly Hills one year after divorce","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 15th 2024 1AM 6°C 4AM 6°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have tense conversation as they reunite for the FIRST time amid divorce at Beverly Hills Hotel with their children Losing the sick pervert father she thought was her protector and drifting apart from her desperately traumatised mother... the tortured diary of the Monster of Avignon's daughter Revealed: The scathing claims from US staff on Meghan's 'Duchess Difficult' behaviour that has left aides 'terrified' The problem with Harry in royal circles?

Per TMZ, the 30-year-old actor got handsy with his female companion, smacking her butt at one point. According to the outlet, the Iranian-American model also placed his hand on the woman's back while they strolled with the dog Britney gifted him after their engagement in 2021. Sam and Britney, 42, dated for several years after meeting on the set of her Slumber Party music video. They tied the knot in June 2022. In August 2023 news broke that the couple was headed for divorce. It was finalized this past May.

He joked, 'Right now, I’m dating a very high-maintenance girl and, you know, I have to get her nails done and take her to the dog park and feed her good food and get her really nice treats.' The star continued, 'That is what I’m focused on at the moment. And [a] career is something that’s going to require 100 percent of your time, and I’m really putting all that effort and putting all of my mindset towards acting… [and my] producing career.' 'It deserves that type of work ethic, and watching my sisters do such an amazing thing at pursuing their dreams makes me inspired. Watching them work 100 percent makes me realize it’s going to take 100-and-something percent to reach my goals, the Jackpot! star noted. He emphasized, 'My goals are always the opposite of my personality. That’s gonna require a lot of time, so I’m not really focusing on [dating] at the moment.' Meanwhile, Britney has been in an on-and-off relationship with Paul Soliz, whom she met while he was doing maintenance work at her home. In a since-deleted Instagram post in July, Spears captioned she was 'Single as f***!!!' and declared, 'I will never be with another man as long as I live!!!' Earlier this year it was announced that a film adaptation about the singer's life, based on her memoir The Woman In Me, is in the works at Universal.

In her memoir, Britney recalled the journey of her rise to fame as a teen music artist and the pressures she faced in the entertainment industry as a young star. The book, published in October 2023, made headlines for its candid glimpse inside her romance with Justin Timberlake. She shocked readers as she revealed the NSYNC crooner urged her to have an abortion because he 'wasn't ready' to be a father. She also took aim at her parents Jamie and Lynn for their role in her controversial conservatorship, which began in 2008 after her infamous mental breakdown. The legal arrangement was lifted in November 2021, after Britney, Asghari and her fans all advocated for her freedom.

She did an invite-only pit stop instead. Hundreds of supporters chanted “Ka-ma-la” when the vice president arrived Friday at the Johnstown airport. Driving a road lined with Trump signs on her way into town, Harris spoke for 30 minutes at local bookstore, Classic Elements, intending to show her support for small businesses. Later in the day, she rallied in Wilkes-Barre, about 200 miles to the northeast. But in Johnstown, both the airport and bookstore were by invitation only – to the chagrin of voters who wanted to hear what the vice president could offer their left-behind city. “She’s hiding from most of the people,” Ed Luce told The Post. “She needs to convince a lot of the working poor people.” Johnstown used to be a union Democratic stronghold. After a 1977 flood destroyed the mines and mills, high-paying union jobs disappeared and the city gradually flipped red. Trump won the surrounding county with over 67% of the vote in 2016 and 2020. Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes are critical to victory this November. “Old school Democrats are what the Republicans are now,” said Jim Ardary, referring to the values of hard work and love of country. He spent his Friday keeping Trump protesters from disrupting Harris’s bookstore event. An Obama-Trump voter, he’s excited about Trump’s recent proposal not to tax overtime pay. “I still believe the Democrats are the working man’s party,” Greg Dadura, vice president of United Steelworkers Local 2632, told The Post. He cited the Democratic Party’s support for union organizing and how Trump encouraged Tesla CEO Elon Musk to fire striking workers. Still, Trump has the votes of many of Dadura’s union members, and workers who couldn’t get a union job after the Johnstown flood. “The way the economy was going, I ended up out on the road doing industrial weed control,” said Luce, 63. An Obama-Trump voter, Luce is weighing whether to vote Trump or Harris – or at all. After Tuesday’s debate, Luce thought Trump might drop out. As for Harris’s performance, “I wasn’t persuaded,” he said. “Harris needs to show more of what her policies are. I still don’t know what she’s gonna do,” wishing she’d articulate how she’d raise wages and improve healthcare. This might have been Luce’s opportunity to hear Harris, if he was invited to one of her events. Donald Trump rallied in Johnstown on Sept. 4. More than 6,000 people squeezed into the Cambria County War Memorial, with a line stretching back almost two miles. They just had to register beforehand and get in line. When the indoor venue reached capacity, thousands more watched Trump on a jumbotron outside the memorial-turned-hockey rink. “She could have gone down to the War Memorial like Trump did,” Luce told The Post, but understands “city folks get scared out in the country.” A shooter tried to assassinate Trump July 13, just 1.5 hours away in Butler, Pennsylvania. “Knowing it’s MAGA land, she had some balls coming,” AJ Hasley, a veteran and cook, told The Post, but he felt insulted by Harris’s invite-only events. “If you’re campaigning, your job is to get your word out to as many people as possible,” Hasley said. “To do invite only, it makes me think she only cares about the rich people, the people going to give money to her campaign.” Hasley, 39, hasn’t voted before. He plans to cast his first-ever ballot for Trump, but said, “I really don’t know that much about [Kamala]. I wouldn’t have minded to watch her talk.” “I just don’t think it’s fair,” Arriana Dixon, a server who plans to vote for Harris, told The Post. With securing the border on the top of her mind, she said, “I would have liked to see her.” “We didn’t even get a chance,” Phyllis Champine told The Post. She proudly wore a homemade Kamala Harris blouse when Trump came to Johnstown. Though Champine, 72, didn’t even get a glimpse of Harris as she waited outside the bookstore, she said, “Being near her was good enough for me.” Still, “we all believe she’s coming back,” she said. “We want her back.”","summary":"Donald Trump rallied thousands in Johnstown, Pennsylvania but now Kamala Harris is visiting deep red Pennsylvania to win the swing state's 19 electoral college votes.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/14/us-news/kamala-harris-rallied-democrats-in-maga-land-pennsylvania-but-shut-out-the-working-poor/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89684303.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/f6Tqbnyr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-15 00:01:46","author":"Ethan Dodd","authors":["Ethan Dodd"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":256432130,"title":"Critics pan Kamala Harris' TV interview, bewildering answers: 'Talk is cheap'","text":"The backlash continued to mount following Vice President Kamala Harris' televised interview Friday, with critics calling out her unwillingness to give clear and specific answers. In her first solo sit-down TV interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris seemed to filibuster to avoid direct answers. One example came when the interviewer, Brian Taff of the Philadelphia ABC affiliate, asked for her \"specific\" plans to bring down prices for Americans. \"Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid,\" Harris responded. \"My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager. \"I grew up in a community of hard-working people, you know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. And I try to explain to some people who may not have had the same experience. You know, a lot of people will relate to this.\" HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN' Critics have slammed Harris on social media, saying she gave confusing answers to a number of questions. \"Kamala Harris did her first local sit down interview after prepping for 53 days and it was a nightmare[.] She couldn’t even name 1-2 things she would do to bring down inflation,\" Karoline Leavitt, Donald Trump's press secretary wrote in post on X following the interview. California state Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones told Fox News Digital if Harris was to be elected president, the entire nation would suffer. \"Kamala Harris has spent decades in public office, with a track record defined by rising costs and inflation. During her tenure in California, prices soared, and the affordability crisis has only worsened since she became Vice President,\" Jones said. \"Talk is cheap, and while she promises to lower costs, her actions have repeatedly resulted in the opposite. \"Californians struggled under her leadership, and now the entire nation is bearing the brunt. America simply can't afford a Harris presidency.\" Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson also added that Harris's answers made no sense. \"Kamala Harris: \"My focus is very much about what we need to do over the next 10-20 years to catch up to the 21st century around, again, capacity, but also challenges.\" What does this even mean?\" Johnson wrote in a post. on X. Harris' answer resembled the response she gave during the ABC News presidential debate against former President Trump on Tuesday, when she was asked by moderator David Muir whether Americans are economically \"better off than they were four years ago.\" \"So I was raised as a middle-class kid,\" Harris told Muir. \"And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.\" DREW BARRYMORE CALLS HER VIRAL 'MOMALA' HARRIS INTERVIEW THE ‘SCARIEST CONVERSATION I’VE DONE’ Although Harris drew praise from the pundits for her debate performance, her sometimes unresponsive answers there foreshadowed Friday's sit-down, particularly on economic matters. In the debate, Harris went on to tout the same proposals without answering whether Americans are better off now than they were four years ago. \"Kamala Harris was very clearly and directly asked: Are the American people better off now than they were 4 years ago? She could not say yes because the answer is no — the American people are worse off today because of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s policies,\" former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard posted on X following Tuesday night's debate. TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 49 INTERVIEWS SINCE LAST MONTH COMPARED TO ONLY 10 FOR HARRIS-WALZ Harris and running mate Tim Walz have only done 10 nonscripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far, while Republican presidential nominee Trump and vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 49 interviews. Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump took questions at a news conference on Friday in California, his third extended presser in recent weeks.

The nation’s first Black vice president talked with Pennsylvania voters about supporting small businesses, building more housing and expanding the child tax credit. She said the country “needs a president of the United States who works for all the American people.” What she did not do was spend time talking about her race or gender or the prospect that she would be the nation’s first Black and South Asian woman to be president if she defeated Republican Donald Trump. As Harris courts voters, she embodies her identity as a woman of color rather than making it an overt part of her pitch, choosing instead to emphasize her policies and resume. She will be making her case to minority voters in a number of key settings in the coming days. She is scheduled to speak on Saturday night at a Washington awards dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, conduct an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and attend an online rally Thursday headlined by Oprah and involving groups such as “Win with Black Women,” “White Women: Answer the Call,” and ”South Asians for Harris.” Harris, throughout her career, has been “many different firsts, and has never really led with that as a descriptor,” said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris’ winning campaign for California attorney general in 2010. “Her life story and her identity and her background and her job experience have all been critical parts of her campaigns,” he said. But he added that “becoming the first — that has never actually been part of her core rationale for why she should be elected a office. It just happens to be a important result of her elections.” Harris’ identity, too, is evident in how she chooses to engage with voters. A member of a historically Black sorority while attending Howard University, Harris spoke this summer in Houston at the annual assembly of another sorority, where she told the women “it is so good to be with you this evening, and I say that as a proud member of the Divine Nine. And when I look out at everyone here, I see family.” It’s a different approach from Hillary Clinton’s in her 2016 Democratic campaign for president, when she put front and center her potential to break the glass ceiling. Harris’ aides and allies say with no time to lose in a compressed campaign this year, it is perhaps more valuable to focus on voters rather than herself. North Carolina’s Crystal McLaughlin, who attended a Harris rally in Greensboro this past week, acknowledged Harris’ candidacy as an important “historical moment” but added that what is more important is to look at “who wants to do what’s right.” Still, she said Harris’ identity matters even if it is not the focus on her campaign. “It’s important, not only for Black young girls, but for girls period,” said McLaughlin, 53, who is Black. “If you can see it, you can actually be it.” So far, it’s been Trump who has brought up race in the campaign, falsely claiming that Harris belatedly “turned Black.” During the presidential debate this past week, he again said he had read she was “not Black” and then she was. Harris did not mention herself once in her response, saying instead: “I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people.” After Biden dropped out of the race in July, polling indicated that Black Americans were more excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee. In late July, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll showed that about 7 in 10 Black adults said would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee. That was a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt that way about Biden. Another AP-NORC poll conducted in August found that about half of Black adults said that “excited” would describe their feelings “extremely” or “very” well if Harris was elected president. Only about 3 in 10 had said the same about Biden in March. Although Black Americans overwhelmingly identify as Democrats and about 9 in 10 Black voters supported Biden in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast, there are some signs that older Black voters may be more supportive of Harris than younger Black voters are. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 9 in 10 Black voters over age 50 were supporting Harris, compared with three-quarters of Black voters 18 to 49. Civil rights organizations focused on mobilizing Black voters say they have seen an uptick in enthusiasm and engagement since Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. The NAACP has been circulating messaging with allied groups that its researchers believe will especially resonate with Black voters, including protecting the rights of Black Americans and appealing to their responsibility to vote. On economic questions, the civil rights group is urging organizers and campaigns to listen to Black voters’ concerns. “Black voters want policy solutions,” said Phaedra Jackson, vice president of unit advocacy and effectiveness at the NAACP. But she added: “Representation matters. Folks are excited to see a Black women vying for the highest office in the land” and they care more about institutions when they are represented within those institutions. The NAACP has focused much of its voter turnout efforts in battleground states where they believe issues like voter suppression will be a potential issue come November. At a packed fundraiser with a predominantly Black audience ahead of Saturday night’s black-tie gala, Harris gave a version of her standard campaign speech, placing added emphasis on the importance of fighting back against what she called a “full-on attack on the freedom to vote.” She also called out efforts to divide Americans, “create fear” and “pit the people of our country against each another.” “This is what we’re up against,” she said. At the Greensboro rally, John Spencer, a 58-year-old geographer from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he wants Harris to stay focused on her plans for the future rather than her race and gender. Identity, unlike policies, is something you can tell just by looking at her, he said. He said Harris’ positions matter more to him because he said they will ultimately impact his 11-year-old daughter Leah, who attended the Greensboro rally with him. When Harris takes a stage, said 66-year-old Sheila Carter, the Democratic presidential candidate’s identity is “self-explanatory.” Discussion about her race and gender are secondary to what she offers as a candidate, said Carter, a Black retiree from Durham, North Carolina, who attended the rally. “You see who she is,” Carter said. “And as she says, ‘Why bother to even address whether or not I’m Black or Indian or whatever? I am who I am. You see it, I see it, the world sees it.‘” ___ Seminera reported from Greensboro, North Carolina.

Lochel’s Bakery in Hatboro is tracking the sales of their red Trump cookies and blue Harris cookies, as customers from all over the US place orders in favor of their choice of candidate. Bakery owner, Kathleen Lochel, has been sharing the progress of her sweet experiment on social media, noting earlier today that ‘political cookies are sold out for Saturday.’ As of Friday morning, the small business had sold a grand total of 5,200 Trump cookies compared to just 500 Harris cookies. ‘I think that people support Trump all over,’ Lochel told Fox & Friends First. The bakery claimed: ‘In Pennsylvania almost all of the shipping has been red. We have only shipped seven packages of blue in the state of Pennsylvania.’ Lochel said she came up with the idea when brainstorming ‘out-of-the-box’ ideas during tough times brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. ‘We saw this in 2020 as well,’ the shop-owner said of the greater amount of red cookies sold. ‘A third of that number is being shipped across the United States, we’re seeing people from all over get these cookies now. ‘They’re telling us stories, a lot of people are upset right now with the cost of things and are venting to us, but we stay neutral to things and we love all.’ Lochel has hosted the confectionary poll since 2012, predicting the outcome of three of the last four elections with her winning streak coming to an end following the 2020 election, Fox29 reported, adding that a baker friend of hers, based in Minnesota, has copied her indulgent election-prediction idea. Ahead of the last presidential election, Lochel’s Bakery sold a total of 31,804 Trump cookies and only 5,750 Biden cookies. The butter-based cookies are dressed in either red-and-white or blue-and-white sprinkles with a ‘Trump 2024’ or ‘Harris 2024’ banner running through the center. Sugar addicts can get six of the ‘famous election cookies’ for $30 – or $5 a piece. Getting its start in 1942, the small-town shop has had a rich history. The third generation bakery originally opened in Philadelphia but was eventually closed in 1995 due to a catastrophic fire. Lochel’s reopened in 2005 after a stint working in conjunction with a neighboring bakery, Piazza’s Bakery, according to the shop’s website. All of the family-run bakery’s products are made from scratch, daily, by Lochel, her brother and other skilled bakers. The Hatboro-based shop prides itself on their ‘hard to find’ offerings including German Apple cake, Springerle cookies and Stollen. Lochel plans to sell the candidate cookies through the November 7 election. Following the September 10 debate, Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a five-point lead over Donald Trump among registered voters, recent polling shows. The two candidates met for the first time on Tuesday in the ABC News debate in Philadelphia and spent more than an hour and a half tussling over abortion, the economy and foreign policy.

Comment now After publicly tamping down calls for another debate with the vice president, Trump delivered an unambiguous rejection of the idea on Thursday. 'When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, “I WANT A REMATCH.” Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate,' Trump wrote. 'She and Crooked Joe have destroyed our Country, with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked and unvetted, and with Inflation bankrupting our Middle Class,' he added. The former president continued, 'Everyone knows this, and all of the other problems caused by Kamala and Joe - It was discussed in great detail during the First Debate with Joe, and the Second Debate with Comrade Harris.' 'KAMALA SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!' Trump concluded.

The nation’s first Black vice president talked with Pennsylvania voters about supporting small businesses, building more housing and expanding the child tax credit. She said the country “needs a president of the United States who works for all the American people.” What she did not do was spend time talking about her race or gender or the prospect that she would be the nation’s first Black and South Asian woman to be president if she defeated Republican Donald Trump. As Harris courts voters, she embodies her identity as a woman of color rather than making it an overt part of her pitch, choosing instead to emphasize her policies and resume. She will be making her case to minority voters in a number of key settings in the coming days. She is scheduled to speak on Saturday night at a Washington awards dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, conduct an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and attend an online rally Thursday headlined by Oprah and involving groups such as “Win with Black Women,” “White Women: Answer the Call,” and ”South Asians for Harris.” Harris, throughout her career, has been “many different firsts, and has never really led with that as a descriptor,” said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris’ winning campaign for California attorney general in 2010. “Her life story and her identity and her background and her job experience have all been critical parts of her campaigns,” he said. But he added that “becoming the first — that has never actually been part of her core rationale for why she should be elected a office. It just happens to be a important result of her elections.” Harris’ identity, too, is evident in how she chooses to engage with voters. A member of a historically Black sorority while attending Howard University, Harris spoke this summer in Houston at the annual assembly of another sorority, where she told the women “it is so good to be with you this evening, and I say that as a proud member of the Divine Nine. And when I look out at everyone here, I see family.” It’s a different approach from Hillary Clinton’s in her 2016 Democratic campaign for president, when she put front and center her potential to break the glass ceiling. Harris’ aides and allies say with no time to lose in a compressed campaign this year, it is perhaps more valuable to focus on voters rather than herself. North Carolina’s Crystal McLaughlin, who attended a Harris rally in Greensboro this past week, acknowledged Harris’ candidacy as an important “historical moment” but added that what is more important is to look at “who wants to do what’s right.” Still, she said Harris’ identity matters even if it is not the focus on her campaign. “It’s important, not only for Black young girls, but for girls period,” said McLaughlin, 53, who is Black. “If you can see it, you can actually be it.” So far, it’s been Trump who has brought up race in the campaign, falsely claiming that Harris belatedly “turned Black.” During the presidential debate this past week, he again said he had read she was “not Black” and then she was. Harris did not mention herself once in her response, saying instead: “I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people.” After Biden dropped out of the race in July, polling indicated that Black Americans were more excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee. In late July, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll showed that about 7 in 10 Black adults said would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee. That was a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt that way about Biden. Another AP-NORC poll conducted in August found that about half of Black adults said that “excited” would describe their feelings “extremely” or “very” well if Harris was elected president. Only about 3 in 10 had said the same about Biden in March. Although Black Americans overwhelmingly identify as Democrats and about 9 in 10 Black voters supported Biden in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast, there are some signs that older Black voters may be more supportive of Harris than younger Black voters are. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 9 in 10 Black voters over age 50 were supporting Harris, compared with three-quarters of Black voters 18 to 49. Civil rights organizations focused on mobilizing Black voters say they have seen an uptick in enthusiasm and engagement since Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. The NAACP has been circulating messaging with allied groups that its researchers believe will especially resonate with Black voters, including protecting the rights of Black Americans and appealing to their responsibility to vote. On economic questions, the civil rights group is urging organizers and campaigns to listen to Black voters’ concerns. “Black voters want policy solutions,” said Phaedra Jackson, vice president of unit advocacy and effectiveness at the NAACP. But she added: “Representation matters. Folks are excited to see a Black women vying for the highest office in the land” and they care more about institutions when they are represented within those institutions. The NAACP has focused much of its voter turnout efforts in battleground states where they believe issues like voter suppression will be a potential issue come November. At a packed fundraiser with a predominantly Black audience ahead of Saturday night’s black-tie gala, Harris gave a version of her standard campaign speech, placing added emphasis on the importance of fighting back against what she called a “full-on attack on the freedom to vote.” She also called out efforts to divide Americans, “create fear” and “pit the people of our country against each another.” “This is what we’re up against,” she said. At the Greensboro rally, John Spencer, a 58-year-old geographer from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he wants Harris to stay focused on her plans for the future rather than her race and gender. Identity, unlike policies, is something you can tell just by looking at her, he said. “Ideally in this country, a politician should be judged about their positions and not about anything other than who they are and their character and their positions,” said Spencer, who is white. He said Harris’ positions matter more to him because he said they will ultimately impact his 11-year-old daughter Leah, who attended the Greensboro rally with him. When Harris takes a stage, said 66-year-old Sheila Carter, the Democratic presidential candidate’s identity is “self-explanatory.” Discussion about her race and gender are secondary to what she offers as a candidate, said Carter, a Black retiree from Durham, North Carolina, who attended the rally. “You see who she is,” Carter said. “And as she says, ‘Why bother to even address whether or not I’m Black or Indian or whatever? I am who I am. You see it, I see it, the world sees it.‘” ___ Seminera reported from Greensboro, North Carolina.

The agency faces “serious questions about processing facility operations, lost or delayed election mail, and front-line training deficiencies,” which have shown no improvement “despite repeated engagement” with USPS headquarters, according to 33 secretaries of state and state election directors. The election officials sounded the alarm in a letter emailed Thursday to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Nevada, along with California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington state, and the District of Columbia, use exclusively mail-in ballots. If a “higher than usual” number of ballots are marked “undeliverable,” it could disqualify otherwise eligible voters, as could the mishandling of mailed ballots, the election officials cautioned. “In some cases, this has resulted in misdelivery of ballots such that voters are disenfranchised,” the group, which was led by Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and New Mexico state elections director Mandy Vigil, wrote. “We implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action to address the ongoing performance issues with USPS election mail service. Failure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election process,” they wrote. Problems with how the Postal Service handles mail-in ballots came to the forefront during the 2020 presidential election, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused slow downs and increased the number of voters who turned to mailing it in. Postal Service election mail chief Adrienne Marshall rejected the warnings of trouble ahead come November. “We are ready to deliver. We were successful in 2020 delivering a historic volume of mail-in ballots; also in 2022 and will do so again in November 2024,” she said in a statement emailed to The Post, vowing to give the state election officials “detailed information” about the agency’s plans to make election mail move promptly. DeJoy promised over the summer to delay certain changes until after the election in a bid to avoid slowing election-related mail, including shift of northern Nevada mail processing from Reno to a facility in Sacramento, California. The letter arrived the same day the 290,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers announced its endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. The pro-union pols are willing “to address the unique challenges facing the Postal Service and our members,” Letter Carriers union president Brian L. Renfroe said in a statement. Voters can rely on his members to get the job done for the 2024 elections — including Trump supporters, he said. “All Americans can rest assured that our nation’s letter carriers can — and will — carry out their duties this election with the same integrity, responsibility and devotion to mission they exhibit as they deliver for the American people during election season and every other day,” Renfroe promised. “To suggest that they would do anything less is to demean America’s postal employees — many of whom, it’s worth noting, are wearing their second uniform in service to this nation.”","summary":"The United States Postal Service might not be able to deliver when it comes to the 2024 race for the White House, election officials have warned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/14/us-news/mailbox-mayhem-state-officials-worry-about-usps-handling-of-mail-in-ballots/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2020-whitehall-ohio-postal-workers-89462751-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/f6Tqbnyr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-14 23:23:08","author":"Mark A.

That result can be seen in multiple national polls showing an average of 57% of voters gave the edge to Harris, compared to only 34% who say Trump won. Panels of voters assembled by CNN and The Washington Post show similar results. But according to Trump and some of his most ardent supporters, the fix was in. More than 67 million viewers watched Harris take Trump to task while he yelled fake stories about migrants eating pets, and the right wasted no time before floating several conspiracies to “prove” why their candidate lost. 1. Biased moderators The earliest of the conspiracies began forming while the debate unfolded, as commentators like former Fox News host Megyn Kelly fumed on social media. “These moderators are a disgraceful failure and this is one of the most biased, unfair debates I have ever seen. Shame on you ABC,” she wrote. The apparent sin committed by moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis of ABC News? Fact-checking Trump. Because the journalists corrected Trump’s most blatant lies, conservatives began accusing them of being part of a “three-on-one” attack on Trump. The morning after the debate, Trump complained to Fox News that it was a “rigged deal” and argued that ABC should have its broadcast license pulled for comparing his rhetoric to reality. 2. Harris received the questions in advance Trump baselessly claimed that Harris received the debate questions in advance, which appeared to explain—in his mind—how the vice president was so prepared to counter him. “She seems awfully familiar with the questions,” Trump told Fox News. As the sitting president and a former senator and state attorney general, Harris has a long history of being prepared for major events in her professional life. As The Washington Post reported, she spent four days before the event ensconced in a rigorous “debate camp.” That, and not a fact-free claim that she received a heads-up on the questions, likely explains her superior performance. 3. Harris used an earpiece If she didn’t receive the questions ahead of time, conservative activists have now argued that the vice president wore a device in her ear that allowed some offstage figure to transmit the answers to her. This allegation, which was promoted by Trump traveling companion Laura Loomer and others, plays on conservative tropes alleging that Harris lacks intelligence. In reality, Harris wore a pair of South Sea Pearl Earrings from the Tiffany Hardwear collection. 4. Bright lights! Conservative activist and serial misinformation poster Matt Wallace posted a video compilation showing a closeup of Trump’s eyes during the debate. In a companion post, he claimed—without a shred of evidence—that ABC News “set up distractive lighting aimed at Trump’s podium” that made him look left to right during the broadcast. In reality, television broadcasts use high intensity lights so that cameras can pick up the images of what is being shown, or else viewers wouldn’t be able to see anything. 5. Witchcraft? According to Lance Wallnau, an activist on the religious right who describes himself as a Christian nationalist, Harris won her debate via witchcraft. “She can look presidential,” Wallnau said in a video stream. “That’s the seduction of what I would say is witchcraft. That’s the manipulation of imagery that creates an impression contrary to the truth, but it seduces you into seeing it. So that spirit, that occult spirit, I believe is operating on her and through her.” 6. The sorority connection The New York Post, which is owned by Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, published a story highlighting the fact that Harris and debate moderator Davis are alumni of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. In its story, the Post compiled complaints about the specious connection from conservative social media posters, including one who said the sorority membership “is relevant with respect to potential bias.” The sorority’s official website notes there are more than 1,074 Alpha Kappa Alpha chapters with over 360,000 members in 11 countries and every state within the U.S. Harris went to Howard University and graduated in 1986, while Davis attended the University of Virginia and graduated in 1999. The likelihood that two Black women were both members of the same sorority is not as earth-shattering as the Post appears to believe. Conservatives love conspiracy theories and tend to push them in response to the success of Democratic politicians. Right-wingers amplified the birther conspiracy about President Barack Obama and pushed the existence of a “death list” in connection to the rise of former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The false stories about Harris put her in presidential company, which is probably not what the right intended.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris won Tuesday’s debate against GOP nominee Donald Trump.

The claim was shared by Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Donald Trump Jr., and others on X.Dayton Police Chief Kamran Afzal said in a statement, \"We stand by our immigrant community and there is no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets. Seeing politicians or other individuals use outlandish information to appeal to their constituents is disheartening.\" The new claim followed baseless allegations that Haitian immigrants were abducting and eating pets in Springfield, a city less than 30 miles from Dayton. Former President Donald Trump repeated the claim in Tuesday night's debate, despite city officials saying there was no evidence of this happening. On Saturday, Vance doubled down on the claims that immigrants were eating pets, sharing the new allegation on X. \"Kamala Harris and her media apparatchiks should be ashamed of themselves,\" Vance wrote. \"Another 'debunked' story that turned out to have merit.\"New claim Christopher Rufo, a conservative writer and activist published the new claim on Substack and the allegations are based on a video originally posted to social media in August 2023. CBS News confirmed the original video was first posted to social media in August 2023 by a man who lives in Dayton, Ohio. CBS News reached out to the man for comment but did not hear back on Saturday afternoon.The video shows what appears to be animal carcasses on a grill. The man filming the footage alleges, without evidence, that they are cats. \"What is this they got on the grill?\" the man says in the video. When two cats appear near the grill, the man jokes that the cats \"better get missing — looks like his homey's on the grill!\" Rufo said he spoke to the man who filmed the video, and the man believes the carcasses were cats. Rufo said he worked on the story with IM-1776, an online magazine, and one of their reporters visited the building where the incident was alleged to have happened. The reporter spoke to neighbors, who said that African immigrants lived in the building. Neighbors told the reporter they believed the people who owned the grill were also African immigrants, although the residents' origin or identity wasn't verified by CBS News.The new allegation also prompted backlash and skepticism, with many users saying the carcasses look more like chickens. CBS News has reached out to veterinary experts for their opinion on what type of carcass is on the grill. Dayton Mayor Jeffrey J. Mims, Jr. also issued a statement, calling the claim \"totally false and dangerously irresponsible of politicians aiming to sow division and fear.\" Mims said there had been \"absolutely zero reports of this type of activity.\"","summary":"Sen.

It was only recently made available after a lobbyist for the cannabis industry came across the conversation amid listening through hours of tapes, as The New York Times reports. “Let me say, I know nothing about marijuana,” he said. “I know that it’s not particularly dangerous, in other words, and most of the kids are for legalizing it. But on the other hand, it’s the wrong signal at this time.” Though he publicly argued that drug abuse was “public enemy number one,” he privately questioned during the meeting the extreme punishments Americans were subjected to for marijuana crimes. “Penalties should be commensurate with the crime,” Nixon said during that Oval Office conversation, noting a 30-year sentence in a cannabis case he recently learned about and added, “The penalties are ridiculous.” “I have no problem that there should be an evaluation of penalties on it, and there should not be penalties that, you know, like in Texas that people get 10 years for marijuana. That’s wrong,” Nixon said. Despite Nixon’s reticence over the harsh criminalization for marijuana, he instituted the federal government’s drug classification system, and he designated marijuana among the substances believed to be most abused and deemed as having no proven medical value. Since then, its categorization has led to mass incarceration, disproportionately affecting Black people who are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, per analysis conducted by American Civil Liberties Union. Nixon’s decision also hampered progress on research over the therapeutic potential of marijuana through the last five decades. Nixon’s newly discovered remarks come as the federal government is reconsidering marijuana’s placement as a restricted Schedule 1 drug, which includes heroin and LSD. In May, the Department of Justice said that the attorney general was circulating a “proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III.” The Drug Enforcement Agency has scheduled a public hearing for after the presidential election, on Dec. 2, to consider various viewpoints on the proposal. Meanwhile, both primary presidential candidates have appeared to advocate for loosening marijuana policies. In an interview with Rolling Stone published in June, prior to Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, the vice president discussed her comments that marijuana should not be a Schedule 1 drug. “I stepped on a couple of toes when I made the public statement, ‘Can we move on with this? Do the analysis on the [drug] schedule. Move it. Change it.’” Though Donald Trump appointed a slew of anti-pot crusaders to his cabinet, last month he acknowledged that a ballot measure that would legalize recreational marijuana in Florida appeared inevitable. Without quite endorsing it, he suggested he supported the decriminalization of marijuana. “Someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other States,” he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, via The Times. “We do not need to ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana.”","summary":"“Most of the kids are for legalizing it.

Those registrations in question will now remain “inactive” until names, addresses and citizenship status are confirmed, Minnesota Public Radio reported, and additional checks will be made to ensure eligibility criteria is met in time for November’s contentious presidential election. “The Office of Secretary of State has worked with [Minnesota Driver and Vehicle Services] to add additional quality assurance to the process to catch and correct the instances of human error,” Secretary of State Steve Simon said. “Moving forward, DVS is using two distinct staff areas to double-check all documentation at DVS before applicant files are sent to be registered to vote,” the Democrat said. The verification changes will include notifying flagged individuals that, if they are eligible, they will need to register to vote online, at their local election office, or in-person at their polling place on Election Day, according to reports. Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by just over 4 points in Minnesota — the home of her VP pick, Gov. Tim Walz, according to polling results released this week. Republican state lawmakers raised questions about the automatic voter registration system earlier this month — demanding to know the exact number of problematic registrations and whether any of those people were able to vote in the August primary election. They also called on state public safety leaders to provide additional answers about its screening process. “The election is 52 days away, and early voting begins on September 20. Minnesotans want to trust our elections are secure and fair,” Republican leaders in the Minnesota Legislature said in a statement. Officials say they are not aware of anyone illegally voting as part of the system. An analysis of automatic voter registrations through the DMV in Oregon found more than 300 non-citizens had been registered to vote since 2021 — which violates federal law in the US — and at least two had cast ballots in recent elections, officials revealed this week. Minnesota grants driver’s licenses to residents regardless of immigration status, though officials have said there are sufficient safeguards against illegal voting as part of the process.

In addition, a poll by YouGov, released following the debate, found that more voters saw Harris as the winner (54 percent of respondents favored Harris and 31 percent Trump).However, Trump has repeatedly claimed that he had the better debate performance.\"...Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday night.It is unclear what polls Trump is referring to.On Friday, Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican and Trump ally, to social media to point towards ABC News' TikTok videos of both nominee's closing statement.\"The media is attempting to manufacture an image for Kamala Harris as some popular woman who has taken the country by storm. In reality, outside of DC newsrooms no one really cares,\" Boebert wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter, on Friday.According to ABC News' TikTok page, in which Trump's and Harris' closing statements were uploaded three days ago, video of the former president's closing statement has 24.7 million views with 1.7 million likes as of Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, a video of the vice president's closing statement has 4.7 million views with over 220,000 likes.In response to the amount of TikTok views, in an emailed statement to Newsweek, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung, took aim at Harris, stating, \"Everybody knows Kamala Harris has nothing to offer America, which is why President Trump has all the momentum and the people of America standing with him as he returns to the White House.\"Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment.In his closing statement, Trump questioned why Harris has not implemented any of the policies she proposed during Tuesday's debate during her three-and-a-half-years in the White House.\"They've had three and half years to fix the border. They've had three and a half years to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do.\"The former president said Harris believes \"in things that the American people don't believe in,\" as he spoke about fracking and fossil fuel.Trump said international leaders come to him and share that they don't know what's going on with the United States. He spoke about the wars happening between Russia and Ukraine as well as in the Middle East, pointing toward the potential for a third World War. Trump also brought up immigration.\"We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision,\" Trump said. \"We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline.\"In her closing statement, Harris contrasted a choice between the future and the past.\"I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country: one that is focused on our future and one that is focused on the past,\" she said. \"We're not going back, and I do believe the American people know that we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward.\"Harris said she believes in what the country can do together and ensure everyone has the respect deserved.\"I will be a president that protects our fundamental rights and freedoms,\" Harris said. \"I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a DA, attorney general, senator and now vice president. I've only had one client: the people.\"She said she never cared if a victim or witness was a Republican or Democrat, calling for a similar sentiment in the next president.\"I intend to be a president for all Americans,\" Harris said.Meanwhile, shortly after the debate, the Harris campaign immediately challenged Trump to another one, with Fox News inviting both nominees for another showdown.However, Trump has rejected her proposal. When asked by Newsweek why Trump won't debate Harris again, Cheung, previously said via email on Saturday afternoon, \"Like President Trump said, he totally dominated Kamala Harris on the debate stage and because she was so thoroughly defeated, she begged for another one because she lost so bad.\"","summary":"During the debate, Trump and Harris clashed over abortion, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and immigration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-closing-debate-statement-trounces-kamala-harris-remarks-tiktok-views-1953968","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471551/donald-trump-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 22:27:19","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":256429592,"title":"This Week in Texas: Afghan withdrawal report, 2024 presidential debate reaction, and new polling","text":"In the latest episode of This Week in Texas, ABC13 weathered another storm.

An emailed threat said bombs had been planted in the homes of Springfield's mayor and other city officials, said Karen Graves, a city spokesperson. A second email said that bombs would be detonated at locations including Springfield City Hall, a high school, a middle school, two elementary schools, a local office of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles and a licensing bureau.

The district's messaging to families continues to be one of gratitude for their patience and understanding as our Wildcat Family navigates these events.\" The threatening emails referenced an influx of thousands of Haitian immigrants into the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 72 kilometres from the state capital of Columbus.

Trump's comments echoed similar claims made by his campaign, including his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and other Republicans, including one that immigrants are eating fowl snatched from public parks. In March, unsubstantiated rumours started circulating that three Haitian men were seen in a Springfield park grabbing a duck and a goose. In recent days, a sign was posted at the park saying \"Please Do Not Eat The Ducks.\" Workers on Friday removed the unauthorised sign, which looked professionally made, said Brad Boyer, deputy director of the National Trails Parks and Recreation District. In an interview with NewsNation on Friday, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said the claims are \"just untrue,\" and cast the city in a negative light.

What specifically will he do to lower grocery and other prices ? I'm curious.\"For Harris' part, she has proposed a crack down on price-gouging from companies to lower the cost of Americans' grocery bills.Gaetz, a Trump ally, responded on X on Friday, \"Lower energy costs by increasing production.\"He was referring to Trump's policy of increasing oil production in the United States.\"I make this pledge to the great people of America, I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump said in July at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee. \"We will drill, baby, drill.\"Cuban responded to Gaetz's post on Saturday mid-morning, asking, \"Matt, What's the break even price below which it's un profitable to drill in the USA ?\"The break-even price for oil is the price at which an oil producer can make a profit by drilling a new well or the price needed for an oil-exporting country to balance its budget. A balanced budget is when revenues are equal to expenditures.Cuban's post has received 1.7 million views as of Saturday evening.When reached for comment by Newsweek, Gaetz's office referred to the congressman's reply post to Cuban on Saturday evening, in which the congressman asked artificial intelligence (AI) to answer the Shark Tank star's question.\"The breakeven price for drilling oil varies greatly depending on the specific location and the technology used. Some areas in the United States, particularly in the Permian Basin, have breakeven prices as low as $20-$40 per barrel due to the combination of rich resources and advanced drilling techniques. Other areas, particularly ones with more complex geology or more stringent regulations, can have breakeven prices over $60 per barrel,\" Gaetz's post read, in part.Gaetz also said that Harris wants to ban fracking in Pennsylvania, a claim the vice president denied during her debate against Trump on Tuesday night. This is a change in Harris' position from just a few years ago when she called for a fracking ban in 2019 when she was running for president in the 2020 election.Fracking, meanwhile, is a way to extract gas and oil which involves injecting water, sand and/or chemicals into a well to break up underground bedrock.Newsweek reached out to Cuban via email for comment on Saturday evening.According to data collected by Dr. Valerie Thomas, Anderson-Interface Chair of Natural Systems Professor at Georgia Tech, the Trump presidency's best year for oil production was 2019, in which 12.3 million barrels of oil was produced per day. Meanwhile, the Biden administration oversaw the production of 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023.The Biden administration, however, is also working toward a clean energy future. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which President Joe Biden signed in August 2022, over 3.4 million American families benefited from $8.4 billion in IRA tax credits to lower the cost of clean energy and energy efficiency home upgrades and over 250,000 Americans claimed the IRA's electric vehicle (EV) tax credits, saving roughly $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, gas prices are falling across the U.S. with the national average gas price at $3.24 per gallon as of Thursday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). This represents a decrease from last month's average of $3.44 per gallon for regular gas and an even larger drop from September of last year, when prices were at $3.84 per gallon.","summary":"Cuban asked the congressman about his knowledge of the oil industry after Gaetz suggested former President Donald Trump would lower energy costs if reelected.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-matt-gaetz-energy-costs-oil-social-media-post-takes-off-1953962","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471544/mark-cuban-matt-gaetz.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 22:14:51","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.159},{"id":256429190,"title":"A wild election week","text":"WASHINGTON (AFP) – Joe Biden tries on Donald Trump’s hat, Trump gets roasted for dogs and cats jibes, and a Republican governor leaps to the rescue in a lobster-eating-contest gone wrong. It’s been another weird week on the United States (US) election trail. Here are some of the highlights: At a gathering of mostly pro-Trump supporters in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, a grizzled man in suspenders and red ‘TRUMP’ hat handed Biden a baseball cap and asked him to sign it. The president obliged, as he and the man exchanged light-hearted banter about their advancing age. The 81-year-old president then looked at the ‘TRUMP’ hat on the man’s head and said, “I need that.” When the man handed it to him, people in the crowd shouted, “Put it on! Put it on!” Biden replied, “I ain’t going that far!” – but then he did briefly don it. “I’m proud of you now”, the voter shouted as the crowd roared in laughter. A White House spokesman later said Biden put the Trump hat on as a sign of national unity as Americans were commemorating the terror attacks of 2001. A bizarre moment in Tuesday’s televised debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris came when the Republican former president, railing against immigrants, mentioned a fabricated story about Haitians in an Ohio town eating people’s pets. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs…, eating the cats, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said, as a clearly bemused Harris looked on. An ABC moderator jumped in to say the network had contacted Springfield’s city manager, who said the report was baseless. Trump’s comment prompted a glut of gleeful mockery on the internet, including Olympian Gabby Thomas dancing to ‘Eating the dog, eating the cat’ in one TikTok video. But in a darker reflection of the political strategy behind Trump’s comment, there has been a spate of threats against Haitians and local schools and government buildings in Springfield. Nothing like a captive audience. Football fans at stadiums in several of this election year’s battleground states could hardly help but notice planes flew overhead bearing anti-Trump banners.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/a-wild-election-week/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P16-C_15092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 22:10:39","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":256429150,"title":"Ex-RNC Chair Tells MAGA to 'Shut the Hell Up' With Taylor Swift Criticism","text":"In a heated rebuke to conservative critics of pop superstar Taylor Swift, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele urged MAGA supporters to \"shut the hell up\" about the singer's recent presidential endorsement and political engagement.Steele's comments, made on MSNBC's The Weekend, highlight the growing tension between Swift's immense cultural influence and right-wing attempts to downplay her impact on the political landscape.The ex-chairman's frustration with the conservative response to her was palpable as he continued, \"The fact that the Republicans and MAGA are triggered by this speaks volumes. They're trying to play it down like, oh, well, most of her fans are under 18. No. This struck a chord. It hit a raw nerve.\"Swift, whose fanbase spans generations and crosses party lines, recently made tidal waves in the political arena with a decisive endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and a targeted push for voter registration.In an Instagram post following the September presidential debate against former president Donald Trump, Swift announced her support for Harris, praising her as \"a steady-handed, gifted leader\" who could accomplish more by leading with \"calm and not chaos.\"Newsweek contacted Swift's press contact via email on Saturday for commentThe hitmaker's endorsement was comprehensive, touching on Harris' running mate Tim Walz and his record on LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and women's bodily autonomy. Swift also encouraged her followers to register to vote and consider early voting options, providing links to relevant information.The impact of Swift's voter registration push appears to be substantial. According to Steele, \"406,000 people clicked on that link. Now we don't know if 406,000 people registered, but they went to that link, they clicked on it, and that tells you, at least she has the power to draw their attention to doing the Democracy thing.\"These political moves sparked immediate backlash from conservative pundits and MAGA loyalists, who attempted to minimize the significance of Swift's civic engagement push.Most notably, Vance dismissed Swift's endorsement just hours after the debate, saying most Americans would not be \"influenced by a billionaire celebrity.\" Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked the Republican VP nominee about the endorsement, saying many women voters could be swayed by Swift.\"I don't think most Americans, whether they like her music, are fans of her or not, are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from their interests and the problems of most Americans,\" Vance responded.The lawmaker's comments soon backfired and were met with widespread derision after many social media users called out that Trump was also a \"billionaire celebrity.\"Steele, however, is having none of it. \"No one is mad at Kid Rock, no one's mad about any of the folks who showed up as entertainment at the Republican National Convention,\" he says, drawing attention to the apparent double standard in criticizing Swift's endorsement.The former RNC chair emphasized that Swift's voter registration message was nonpartisan, stating, \"She didn't say this is who I'm supporting. She said y'all here's a link, you go register to vote for who you want to support.\"\"Y'all just need to shut the hell up about Taylor and just deal with the fact that you ain't got that,\" Steele concluded, throwing down the gauntlet to MAGA critics who continue to rail against Swift's massive influence.","summary":"Michael Steele defends Swift's voter push and tells MAGA critics to \"shut the hell up\" as 406,000 click her registration link.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ex-rnc-chair-michael-steele-taylor-swift-maga-shut-hell-1953973","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471552/kamala-harris-taylor-swift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 22:09:27","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.034},{"id":256429152,"title":"Most Republicans Think Trump's 'Eating the Pets' Debate Remarks Are 'Weird'","text":"A majority of Republicans view former President Donald Trump's statement about Haitian immigrants \"eating the pets\" during his Tuesday debate with Vice President Kamala Harris as \"weird,\" new polling shows.Trump's remark was based on social media rumors, which lack evidence, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. City officials have discredited these claims, saying there are no reports of any immigrants in the community killing or eating pets as alleged.Regardless, many Republicans, including Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance, have promoted the claims. The former president repeated the claim during Tuesday night's debate, leading to a fact-check from the ABC News moderators.\"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs—the people that came in,\" Trump claimed about Haitian immigrants. \"They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.\"What the Poll ShowsNew polling by Data for Progress published on Friday shows that a clear majority of voters viewed the statement as \"weird.\" That included majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents.Among GOP respondents, 44 percent said the comment was \"very weird\" while an additional 25 percent said it was \"somewhat weird\"—for a total of 69 precent describing the statement as \"weird.\" Among Democrats, the total was 91 percent and among independents it was 77 percent.Looking at all voters combined, 64 percent described the remark as \"very weird\" and 16 percent said \"somewhat weird,\" for a total of 80 percent.

Her post detailed the disappearance of a neighbor's cat and included her neighbor's suspicions that their Haitian residents were involved in the incident.According to NewsGuard, an organization dedicated to combating internet misinformation, Lee was one of the first to spread the baseless rumor on social media, the screenshots of which were widely shared. The neighbor, identified as Kimberly Newton, reportedly got the information about the alleged incident from a third party, as per NewsGuard's findings and reported by NBC News.\"I'm not a racist,\" Lee told NBC News, adding that her daughter is half Black and she herself is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ+ community. \"Everybody seems to be turning it into that, and that was not my intent.\"Amplifiers of the rumor on social media also shared a video of a woman who was arrested for allegedly killing and eating a cat. While that video was from Ohio, it was captured in Canton, which is over 170 miles from Springfield. The woman, Alexis Ferrell, was also a U.S. citizen, not an immigrant.Ferrell remains jailed with a bond of $100,000.

But just a few weeks later, Harry Styles and Olivia Dean got a taste of Spain as they were spotted at the Kalorama festival in Madrid. The As It Was singer and rising neo-soul star were spotted watching Sam Smith at the Spanish showcase. And in a sweet moment, Harry was seen resting his head on Olivia’s shoulder during Sam’s emotional track I’m Not The Only One. But it appeared that the pair were all partied out, as they discreetly hugged pals and said their goodbyes during the middle of Sam’s raunchy song Unholy. It came after Olivia performed at the festival and played her hit song Dive along with her new track Time. An insider said: “Harry loves festivals and enjoyed his time with Olivia in Madrid. It was the perfect weekend after Olivia put on a stunning performance, and they both loved watching their favourite artists together.” A source close to Olivia told Biz on Sunday the pair were good friends. Harry broke up with Canadian actress Taylor Russell in May after I revealed they were dating last year. Olivia rose to fame earlier this year when she was nominated for Best New Artist, Artist of the Year and Best Pop Act at the Brit Awards. The singer, who went to London talent academy the Brit School, revealed that her three nods at the awards were a “full-circle moment” in her life. On Friday, Harry was pictured flexing his fashion muscles with a surprise appearance at London Fashion Week. The former One Direction star was spotted in the front row with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at designer SS Daley’s show. After the glamour of the fashion world, Harry joined mum Anne Twist to watch his sister Gemma Styles talk about her new self-help book, Why Am I Like This? at Bush Hall in West London in the evening. Half the world is on guest list to Oasis THEY are the hottest tickets in town, but some lucky A-listers may get on the guest list for next year’s epic Oasis reunion concerts. I’m told Liam and Noel Gallagher hope to sort out gig passes for close friends and family. Kate Moss, The Beckhams, The Stone Roses, Chris Moyles, Happy Mondays, Bob Mortimer, Peter Crouch and Johnny Marr are all in with a chance of being hooked up, a music insider tells me. My source said: “Even though the gigs are almost a year away, plenty of high-profile pals are being lined up to attend. “These nights are going to go down in history and there will be plenty of celebs there. It will be as rock ’n’ roll as it was back in the day.” Yesterday some fans were outraged after the final ballot sale for the band’s last Wembley gigs descended into chaos. Tickets for the two farewell shows – on September 27 and 28 – went on sale yesterday at 8.30am via Ticketmaster. Only fans who received a ballot code by 9pm on Friday had a chance to buy, with a limit of two tickets per person. Officially priced from £74.25 to £206.25, including fees, tickets were released in three 90-minute blocks throughout the day. Despite efforts to avoid the dynamic pricing controversy that plagued last month’s general sale, fans faced frustration. Many reported technical glitches on Ticketmaster. One posted on Reddit: “Getting this message after getting the code and getting through the queue . . .  ‘Something went wrong . . . An error occurred and we could not reserve your tickets’.” Banks gets full credit AZEALIA BANKS delivered a stunning performance as she kicked off her Back To The Union Jack tour in London. The US rapper wore a denim co-ord for her show at the O2 Academy Brixton on Friday, part of a series of eight UK concerts. Earlier this week, the 212 hitmaker defended Taylor Swift after she received an unpleasant tweet from tech billionaire Elon Musk. In an online post, Taylor had publicly backed Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US presidential election and referred to herself as a “childless cat lady”. But bizarrely, Elon respond-ed: “I will give you a child.” Azealia tweeted that Tay should “sue him for loads of cash and level up to be the most un-defeatable richest woman in the history of music”. All hail, girl power. D.C. give taste of future FONTAINES D.C. gave their London supporters an exciting taste of what to expect at next summer’s Finsbury Park headline show. The quintet, fronted by Grian Chatten, played two back-to-back sets, treating adoring fans to new material accompanied by some back-catalogue classics such as Boys In The Better Land and Jackie Down The Line. Undoubted highlights included the instantly well received Favourite and a massive closing rendition of Starbuster, both from their latest album Romance. The Fontaines’ change in musical direction and reinvented image has led to a great summer for them, with a critically acclaimed Friday night slot on Glastonbury’s Park Stage and headline-worthy performances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. Chappell kicks off tour CHAPPELL ROAN puts her best foot forward on the first date of her dazzling UK tour. The American singer-songwriter looked sensational in a pearl-encrusted bodysuit and cowboy boots at Manchester Academy on Friday night. She played songs from her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, which included Hot To Go! and Red Wine Supernova, to her adoring fans who sang every line. It comes after Chappell, real name Kayleigh Amstutz, performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in a medieval warrior costume in New York earlier this week and scooped the gong for Best New Artist. Niall's hop-py birthday with Lewis NIALL HORAN enjoyed a low-key birthday bash – ringing in his 31st alongside Lewis Capaldi at an Irish boozer in South West London. The pair, who are close friends and have released music and a documentary together, appeared in good spirits as they enjoyed pints at the Hop Pole pub in Wandsworth on Friday night. An onlooker said: “They were chatting to everyone and appeared really chilled and like any other punters. “Someone said it was Niall’s birthday but they didn’t sing to him. “A few fans asked for pictures and they happily posed for them. “There was no fuss around them, though, they weren’t like your average celebs and they seemed really normal. “They were in there for about three hours before heading off. “They were jolly but weren’t worse for wear.” Another regular said that they often see the pair, both right, in The Hop Pole together and Lewis has previously broken into song during drinking sessions. They said: “They come in here fairly regularly with friends. They are sort of local celebrities. Lewis has a house nearby, as does Niall, and they both like the Hop Pole as it serves one of the best pints of Guinness in London.” I hope Niall enjoyed a pint on the house. Heidi's boobed HEIDI KLUM shows off her wild side as she hits the red carpet in California. The German supermodel revealed some sideboob in a skimpy diamanté leopard-print mini- dress at People magazine’s 50th anniversary party at The Chain House, LA, on Friday night. Earlier in the night, America’s Got Talent judge Heidi hosted the Fifth Emmy Nominees Night for the Hollywood Reporter magazine and American screen actors’ union SAG-AFTRA. Heidi certainly knows how to party. Duncan in flight fumble DUNCAN JAMES has revealed he joined the Mile High Club on a flight home from America during the hard-partying early days of his band Blue. He was speaking to Laura Hamilton on travel podcast the Mile Fly Club, run by video production firm Studio Bolt. Duncan told her: “We’d gone out to LA and we had partied with all the Virgin Atlantic cabin crew and she was quite naughty. “Anyway, she said to me, ‘Oh, I have to show you the crew restroom’. “So she took me to the back of the plane, where there was this little door that led you downstairs and there was a crew room where there’s bunk beds. “So we had a little play because you could get into the little bunk bed and close the curtain.” Wild.

The Channel 5 mystery drama also features former soap faves Shayne Ward, Catherine Tyldesley and Claire Sweeney. A source said: “Matt is buzzing about the new role.

Both medical centers have resumed normal operations after police and hospital security found nothing suspicious during their search. “The safety protocols we have in place for these instances allow us to work quickly with local law enforcement to investigate threats thoroughly and ensure the safety of our patients and staff,” Kettering Health Springfield said in a statement. The other alleged target was Mercy Health’s Springfield Regional Medical Center, which went into lockdown after officials heard of the alleged bomb threat around 6am. “One of our most important responsibilities is the safety and security of our patients, visitors, associates and physicians,” a spokesperson for the Springfield Police Division said. Springfield has endured bomb threats targeting schools, city buildings, and other local institutions after the Ohio town was thrust into the spotlight earlier this week when former President Donald Trump brought up a racist conspiracy during the presidential debate that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating the pets in the community. “They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” he said on Tuesday as Kamala Harris’s expression flitted between shock and amusement. Local authorities had already debunked the lies even before Trump peddled the narrative on the debate stage, with Springfield police saying there is no credible evidence to support the allegations.","summary":"The Ohio town was thrust into the spotlight earlier this week when former President Donald Trump claimed that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating the pets in the community","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/springfield-ohio-bomb-threats-lockdown-hospitals-b2613003.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/21/2024-09-12T175844Z_1986612032_RC24Z9AZIBNS_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-MIGRATION-SPRINGFIELD.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 22:02:17","author":"Andrea Cavallier","authors":["Andrea Cavallier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":256429030,"title":"A political war is heating up in the Philippines.

But it was just the terrible things that happened to these three young ladies, and then, of course, the one young man, the son … his mom talked about one time he used fentanyl and it took his life, and he was — it was a good young man — 15-year-old freshman in high school,” he said. “It’s just powerful stories that underscore what happens when you have an open border. And I tell everyone, literally, we went from a secure border to no border, and you’re seeing it play out,” he said, noting that some of the illegal migrants who have come into the country are on the terrorist watch list. All of this has resulted in “terrible crime that happened to the families that we had testify this week … and others around the country.” “And then, of course, you got the situation where you have the stress on your education system, your health care system, your housing market, like we have in Springfield, Ohio, where you have what some estimates are 20,000 Haitians come into a community of 60,000,” he said. “So this is what happens when you don’t have a border, when you have a commander-in-chief and an administration who simply will not enforce the law,” he explained, emphasizing that Harris is at fault, as she and Biden let millions into the country. “[They] let 10 million people come in the country — 10 million migrants, 99 on the terrorist watch list. Many of them have done terrible things like you heard from this past week in our hearing, and she was the border czar,” he said of Harris, explaining that they stopped deciding requests for temporary parole on a case-by-case basis and just opened it up instead. “Instead, what they said is, we’re going to just open it up for categories of people. And so for Cubans, for Haitians, for Venezuelans, and people from Honduras, they just let them come in — 300,000 from Cuba, 20,000 of them are in Springfield, Ohio. So this is the failed policy that are impacting, again, not just border communities, but every community,” he said, noting that Harris can say what she wants, but the American people “have eyes” and “can see what’s going on.” When asked how this can be turned around, Jordan said it all comes down to the election and electing former President Donald Trump. “It’s that simple. Look, we have to win. If we don’t take the Senate, we don’t win the White House and keep the House, they’ll do more of this. … Everyone understands that you cannot just bring in — in a short period of time — 20,000 people into a community of 60,000 and not impact, as you said, the education system, the healthcare system, the housing market,” he said of the news out of Springfield, Ohio. Jordan said he received a call from a friend in that community this week who told him that there are issues with car accidents “because so many people can’t drive, and they’re not trained to drive, yet they do.” “This is what happens when you have an administration who takes the position that this administration took from day one, day one,” he said, noting that the Biden-Harris administration dismantled the secure border by ceasing work on the wall, nixing Remain in Mexico, and adding parole authority for certain countries and allowing those people to come in. “You do those things, you are going to get 10 million. You are going to get what we have now in our country, and the impact it has on our community, and the American people said ‘enough.’ And then when they come in, all the benefits they get with your tax dollars, with American tax money, that’s what’s so frustrating to the American people,” Jordan said. “Again, I think this starts to get through to the voters, and I think it’s why President Trump’s gonna be our next president.” – News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe American people are witnessing the consequences of an open border under&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Americans are observing the outcomes of an unsecured border, says Jim Jordan first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/americans-are-observing-the-outcomes-of-an-unsecured-border-says-jim-jordan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Exclusive-Jim-Jordan-Americans-Are-Witnessing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:58:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":256429018,"title":"Ohio woman behind pet-eating rumours spread by Donald Trump admits claims are false","text":"An Ohio woman whose Facebook post sparked harmful rumours about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield – accusations repeated by former President Donald Trump at Tuesday’s debate – has admitted the claims are false, saying she regrets how they have spiralled into a political frenzy. “It just exploded into something I didn’t mean to happen,” Erika Lee, a Springfield resident of four years, told NBC News. Lee, a 35-year-old hardware store worker, said she had no actual first-hand knowledge when she took to a local Facebook group to pen a post about a missing pet. She wrote that her neighbour, Kimberly Newton, told her that “her daughter’s friend had lost her cat”. “One day, she came home from work, as soon as she stepped out of her car, looked towards a neighbour’s house, where Haitians live, and saw her cat hanging from a branch, like they’d do a deer for butchering and they were carving it up to eat,” read the since-deleted post, per screenshots shared online. “I’ve been told they are doing this to dogs, they have been doing it at Snyder Park with the ducks and geese.” Trump: Illegal aliens are eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio. pic.twitter.com/As1hgA0P6G — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 11, 2024 According to NewsGuard, a media watchdog that monitors for misinformation on the web, Lee’s post was likely the first to tout the unfounded pet-eating claims. “I’m not sure I’m the most credible source because I don’t actually know the person who lost the cat,” Newton, Lee’s neighbour, told the outlet in response to questions about the rumour she passed along. She told NewsGuard the cat’s owner was actually “an acquaintance of a friend” – and that friend was the person who told her the rumour, which they in turn had heard from a separate source. “I don’t have any proof,” she added. Other posts parroting the pet-eating claims have since popped up online, including one from Ohio senator and Republican US vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance. On September 9, he shared a post on X that read: “Months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” The following day, Trump brought up the fourth-hand gossip during his first presidential debate with US Vice-President Kamala Harris, which was broadcast to 67 million people. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs – the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said Tuesday. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” Officials in the Ohio city have pushed back on the pet-eating rumours in the days since, with City Manager Bryan Heck emphasising “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” But the fallout has still been severe. On Thursday, Springfield City Hall was evacuated due to bomb threats and several schools in the area were forced to close following similar threats on Friday. Lee told NBC News she never imagined her Facebook post would spiral so out of control. She added that she does not harbour any ill will toward the Haitian community and lamented the fact that her post had become fodder for conspiracy theories. “I’m not a racist,” she said, adding that her daughter is half black and she herself is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community. “Everybody seems to be turning it into that, and that was not my intent.” Lee said she has since pulled her daughter from school and now fears for her family’s safety given the mania surrounding the claims. She added that she is also worried for the Haitian community, who she had no intention of villainising. “I feel for the Haitian community,” she said. “If I was in the Haitians’ position, I’d be terrified, too, worried that somebody’s going to come after me because they think I’m hurting something that they love and that, again, that’s not what I was trying to do.”","summary":"Republicans have parroted Erika Lee’s accusations, prompting bomb threats in Springfield and causing Haitian migrants to become targets.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3278563/ohio-woman-behind-pet-eating-rumours-spread-donald-trump-admits-claims-are-false","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/15/bbcda283-cb29-43ed-8cde-8781b523d3db_78f9bad3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:50:33","author":"Tribune News Service","authors":["Tribune News Service"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":256428480,"title":"Swift endorsement turns more voters from Harris than it attracts: poll","text":"It might not be such a “Love Story” after all. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, may turn more voters away than it attracts. A new post-debate poll from YouGov released Saturday found that 8% of voters said the pop superstar’s nod is either “somewhat” or “much more likely” to convince them to cast their ballot for the Democrat. But a whopping 20% said they are “somewhat” or “much less likely” to vote for former President Donald Trump’s opponent now that Swift has spoken. Most of the respondents, 66%, said Swift’s endorsement made no difference on how they will vote in November. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice,” the Grammy-winning artist shared in an Instagram post with her 283 million followers shortly after Tuesday night’s debate. “Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.” She called Harris “a steady-handed, gifted leader” who could lead with “calm and not chaos.” The majority — 32% of the online poll’s respondents — think the move will have a positive effect on Harris’ campaign, while 27% said they don’t think it’ll have an effect either way. Forty-one percent — nearly 460 people — said the “Shake it Off” singer shouldn’t speak publicly about politics. Thirty-eight percent said she should make public endorsements. Sixty-six percent of the poll’s participants said they are not Swifties, while 28% reported being a fan and 6% identified as a big fan. The majority of “big fans” were women, and registered Democrats. Swift’s endorsement led to flood of traffic to the voter registration website vote.gov into Wednesday afternoon, according to reports. A spokesperson said 337,826 visitors visited vote.gov after clicking a custom link Swift shared on Instagram. Overall, while 46% of people thought Harris won the debate to 19% for Trump, just 6% said it caused them to reconsider their vote, while 76% said it has not, according to YouGov.","summary":"It might not be such a \"Love Story\" after all.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/14/us-news/more-voters-to-vote-against-harris-than-for-after-swift-endorsement-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89673126.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1wtWfXCC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:47:32","author":"Deirdre Bardolf","authors":["Deirdre Bardolf"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":256428296,"title":"Critics claim Kamala Harris delivered incoherent responses during ABC interview","text":"During an interview with an ABC affiliate, Kamala Harris faced criticism for giving vague answers and dodging questions, earning the label of serving “word salad” from critics. In her first solo media sitdown since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris was accused of saying little of substance. One critic, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn), pointed out Harris’ disconnect from everyday Americans when she responded to a question about inflation by talking about neighbors’ lawns. Malliotakis highlighted this as an example of Harris being out of touch with the concerns of the public. “But worse, is that she has no plan to fix it because she’s the one who broke it.” In an almost 11-minute interview with anchor Brian Taff of Philadelphia-based Action News 6, Harris went on a series of cringe-worthy rants, particularly after the initial question on how she planned to reduce prices in the U.S. Critics were unimpressed with her evasive responses during the interview. “Well, I’ll start with this: I grew up as a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard,” said Harris, before moving on to greener pastures — but not the economy. “I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn. You know? And, um, and I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity,” the vice president added. She never said how she’d tackle inflation, but instead highlighted her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and provide tax breaks to new small businesses. Harris’ answers are “perfect example[s] of why her handlers are concerned about her doing interviews,” said Republican political consultant Rob Ryan. “When asked a basic question about the economy, she once again regurgitated the same story from the debate about growing up in a middle-class setting with a working-class mother.” “At best, it was a disjointed response showing no real empathy or understanding of the issue and only repeating the lines that were drilled into her during debate prep, offering no real solutions.” When asked how she’s different from President Biden, Harris also said a lot of nothing. “Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden, and I offer a new generation of leadership.” She then vowed to “invest in areas that need a lot of work,” without specifying any. “My focus is very much on what we need to do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st Century,” Harris bizarrrely added. Harris also skirted the question when asked why ex-President Donald Trump appeals to so many Americans. Instead, she spent time speaking in circles before painting the Republican presidential nominee as divisive. “I, based on experience and, uh, and, a lived experience, know in my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of us as Americans have in common so much more than what separates us,” Harris said. “And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans — and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” she said. Perhaps, the veep’s clearest answer came after being asked about the country’s gun-violence epidemic. Harris, a licensed gun owner, said she won’t take “anyone’s guns away” and supports the Second Amendment, but would beef up background checks and ban “assault weapons.” “They’re literally tools of war,” Harris said. Harris did the interview with ABC affiliate three days after the network’s moderators came under fire for refusing to fact-check the veep during her presidential debate while fact-checking Trump five times.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDuring an interview with an ABC affiliate, Kamala Harris faced criticism for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Critics claim Kamala Harris delivered incoherent responses during ABC interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/critics-claim-kamala-harris-delivered-incoherent-responses-during-abc-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala-Harris-served-word-salad-in-ABC-interview-critics.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:45:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":256428914,"title":"Residents of Springfield, Ohio, React to Influx of 20,000 Haitians","text":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio—They live on separate sides of Springfield, but Rhonda Zimmers and Melissa Skinner noticed gradual changes to their neighborhoods in this Ohio city midway between Dayton and Columbus, starting around three years ago. “Longtime residents who I used to see were no longer there. They moved out, and Haitian migrants moved in. They didn’t speak English. I started to see a lot of foot traffic on the streets. And you could see a dozen or more people coming and going from the houses. It was clear there were a lot of people living in the houses,” Zimmers told The Epoch Times. Skinner, who serves with Zimmers on the city’s Board of Zoning Appeals, observed a similar transition in her neighborhood. “We used to know everyone, and mostly everyone got along, but then we started seeing more turnover on our street. We no longer knew many of our neighbors,” Skinner said. “It used to be a quiet and peaceful place to live. Now, we have several houses where several Haitian families are living in a home intended for one family. And sometimes we get harassed by people who are yelling at us in a foreign language. We have to be more cautious. This is not the Springfield I once knew,” Skinner said. A blue-collar city that saw many of its factories shut down decades ago, Springfield’s population declined to less than 60,000—until the last few years. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian migrants have arrived here over that span. Residents have voiced concern and frustration over safety issues and a strain on resources. City leaders have acknowledged that changes must be made to effectively accommodate its residents and the migrants. The conversation was mostly confined to Springfield and Clark County until the presidential debate earlier this week. At an Aug. 27 city council meeting, some residents alleged that Haitians were killing cats, dogs, ducks, and geese for food. Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), former President Donald Trump’s running mate, said that his office had been inundated with those claims. Vance wrote on X that “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” Early in the Sept. 10 presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump said, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” City officials and police said they had not received reports of Haitians eating animals. In a statement on Sept. 10, a Springfield police spokesperson said, “In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” Outside of Ohio, many Americans had never heard of Springfield until Trump’s comments. Now, residents told The Epoch Times, it is drawing national attention for the wrong reasons. “The animal reports are good for media clickbait, but the real story here—what has created a crisis—is how the residents are being negatively impacted,” Zimmers said. “This wasn’t put to a vote. We didn’t ask for this, and our city leaders did not put proper infrastructure in place to prepare for the migrants and to address the challenges it would cause for the residents who are U.S. citizens,” Skinner said. In 2023, the U.S. State Department urged U.S. citizens to leave Haiti amid widespread violence and unrest after the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moise, in 2021. The country is currently listed by the U.S. Embassy as “Level 4–Do Not Travel” because of crime, kidnappings, poor health care infrastructure, and unrest. Springfield had a small Haitian population before 2021, when illegal border entries began to break records. A shortage of entry-level and blue-collar workers made the city an ideal destination, especially because of its low cost of living compared to major metro areas. While companies needing to fill vacant positions welcomed the surge of Haitian migrants, challenges escalated in the city. Kyle Koehler, a former state representative in the district that represents Springfield, is a candidate for state Senate in the region that covers three counties, including Clark, where Springfield is located. The cultural differences between residents and migrants have resulted in tension, he said. “They don’t understand the laws; they don’t understand some of our customs. We don’t understand some of their customs, and that clash and the overwhelming amount of people that have come at one point has really caused some issues,” Koehler said. In a recent campaign speech, Koehler said that the Haitian migrants in Springfield receive between $600 and $1,600 a month on debit cards through the Refugee Cash Assistance program. They can also access public assistance programs available to U.S. citizens. “As of this month, our local Job and Family Services has registered over 20,000 Haitian refugees in our county and city. Springfield, which had a steady population of 58,000 … now has an additional 20,000 new residents in and around Springfield—20,000 people in just under four years,” Koehler said. He said that Springfield’s public school system now has more than 1,600 non-English speaking students. “Our Federally Qualified Health Care (FQHC) called Rocking Horse is overwhelmed with the increase in Haitians that are automatically qualified for Medicaid services. City, county, and state leaders are overwhelmed with complaints that they can do very little about fixing,” he said. Before arriving in Springfield, Haitian migrants had little or no health care services. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced earlier this week that he is dedicating $2.5 million toward expanding primary care access for Springfield residents. He has directed the Ohio Department of Health to work with the Clark County Health Department and other health care providers. “We will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,“ DeWine said at a Sept. 11 press conference. ”The federal government has not demonstrated that they have any kind of plan to deal with the issue. We will not walk away.” Part of DeWine’s plan includes the creation of a school-based health clinic in the Springfield City School District, increasing support for vaccinations and health screenings through the local health department. Also, allocating additional funds to the Clark County Department of Job and Family Services for translation services, providing funding to Clark State College for services to teach English to Haitians, as well as providing driving simulators, and offering driver education classes targeted to the Haitian community, and working with the Springfield School District. DeWine implored the federal government to provide more resources. “These dramatic migrant surges impact every citizen in the community—the moms who have to wait hours in a waiting room with a sick child, everyone who drives on our streets, and the children who go to school in more crowded classrooms,” the governor said. “The federal government does not have a plan to give any support to the communities impacted by surges, and we have absolutely no indication that a plan is coming in the near future.” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost recently said he is ordering an investigation into ways to halt what he describes as “extreme population growth” attributed to migrants moving to Springfield. “The problem is not migrants; it is way, way too many migrants in a short period of time,” he said. “The problem is a massive increase in the population without any communication or assistance from the federal government.” The immigration debate among residents, local officials, and migrants reached a breaking point last summer when 11-year-old Aiden Clark was killed in a traffic accident that involved a Haitian migrant. The boy was aboard a school bus that collided with a minivan that crossed over the dividing line driven by 36-year-old Hermanio Joseph. Joseph was sentenced to nine to 13-and-a-half years in prison for first-degree felony involuntary manslaughter and fourth-degree felony vehicular homicide. Nathan Clark, Aiden’s father, chastised conservative politicians for using the child’s death for political gain. “My son, Aiden Clark, was not murdered. He was accidentally killed by an immigrant from Haiti,” Clark said at a recent city council meeting. “They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members,” he said. “However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed, to mention Aiden Clark of Springfield, Ohio.” Last December, a day after her 71st birthday, Springfield grandmother Kathy Heaton was killed when a car driven by a Haitian migrant struck her while she was gathering her garbage cans. Prosecutors decided that the driver of the car, 38-year-old Robenson Louis, wouldn’t be charged. At a city council meeting earlier this week, Mandy Heaton, Kathy’s daughter-in-law, said the decision left their family “devastated.” Louis was operating a car with expired license plates. On Sept. 11, DeWine dispatched the Ohio State Highway Patrol to help local law enforcement with traffic issues in Springfield. Residents have complained for months that Haitian migrants are getting temporary driving permits but not getting licenses. One resident, who asked to remain anonymous because of her position in the public eye, told The Epoch Times that there are “several accidents every day,” and she has seen cars “drive into buildings and onto sidewalks, go the wrong way down one-way streets, make U-turns right in the middle of the road, and run over street signs and into yards.” “They get behind the wheel with little or no education and training about driving laws here, and many of them don’t understand English, so they can’t read the street signs,” Zimmers said. Malc Joseph arrived in Springfield last year with his 11-year-old son, Marcley. They fled from Haiti and lived in Philadelphia before moving to Ohio because of the lower cost of living. “We were welcomed when we got here, and it was good because there was a big adjustment coming from a big city. After the accident, it started to change. I’m afraid for my safety. People are saying we are eating cats and dogs. That’s not part of our culture. We don’t do that,” he said. Lindsay Aime is the treasurer for the Haitian Community Help and Support Center in Springfield. He told The Epoch Times that he acknowledges that there are cultural differences and encourages residents to be patient as the Haitian population adapts to American customs. “Learning the language and the culture takes time. I don’t think Americans understand how difficult it is. We don’t have an established Haitian community here like in bigger cities. We need more time to integrate ourselves here. Just give us time,” Aime said. “We are good workers, hard workers. We are paying taxes. We are customers for businesses. We want to have a positive presence here, and we’re here to stay. We can’t go back to Haiti.” B.J. Newman is a pastor who works in Springfield. He told The Epoch Times he sympathizes with the Haitian migrants but also believes that residents should be shown more understanding. “I’m extraordinarily compassionate to the plight of the immigrants. We just need to make sure that compassion goes in both directions. If you drive through Springfield, it doesn’t look like there’s anything out of the ordinary. This isn’t like the BLM riots, where there is violence and destruction on the streets. But there is a crisis. This happens when such a high number of refugees come here in a short time,” he said. “Anytime you have a population jump of 20,000 in a short time, problems are bound to happen. The fact that they’re from a very different culture, I think, is what’s creating the real friction.” Kelly Combs is a Registered Nurse who worked for a health care network on a team that provides perinatal outreach to at-risk families, including Haitians in Springfield. She told The Epoch Times she empathizes with migrants and residents alike. “They came here for a better life, but now many of them are afraid to leave their homes,” Combs said about the Haitian migrants. “Residents feel like it is an invasion because the refugees don’t know proper etiquette, and there is a drastic cultural difference that is creating tension.” Combs works as a nursing instructor at Clark State Community College, which is located in downtown Springfield. She lives with her husband in a village five miles outside the city limits, so she is insulated from the migrant crisis there, but she worries about driving downtown. “There is an intersection I pass through every day I’m at work, and there are accidents there seemingly every day,” Combs said. “You have to be attentive when you’re driving here. You can’t afford to get distracted.” Housing is also a critical issue in Springfield. The number of affordable housing vouchers has declined as some landlords have moved to market-based rents, which increased amid higher demand. Multiple residents told The Epoch Times that landlords have kept increasing the rents for local residents to the point they can no longer afford to pay, choosing instead to attract Haitian migrants. Fred Stegner is president and founder of the Springfield Soup Kitchen, which serves a free hot meal to anyone who walks through the door on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. He told The Epoch Times that landlords raising their rents to a level where residents can no longer afford to pay has contributed to the homeless problem in Springfield. “It makes me angry. I’m a veteran, and I’ve had many veterans come in here telling me they are getting evicted because they can’t pay their rent. This shouldn’t be happening to U.S. citizens. I know the migrants are escaping a difficult life, but there should be a compound set up for them to live. And landlords shouldn’t be allowed to drive out the residents because they know they can make a lot of money off the Haitians,” he said. Stegner mentioned that homeless shelters in the community have closed, and he is concerned about the safety of the homeless population, with winter just a few months away.","summary":"Haitians are asking people to give them more time to adapt to a new culture, but residents worry about their safety and the drain on resources.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/residents-of-springfield-ohio-react-to-influx-of-20000-haitians-5724134","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/12/id5723242-Springfield-Ohio-AP24255716373075-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:40:46","author":"Jeff Louderback","authors":["Jeff Louderback"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":256428036,"title":"Kamala Harris’ ‘word salad’ softball interview with ABC affiliate was proof VP is ‘disconnected from everyday Americans’: critics","text":"Kamala Harris served up another huge helping of “word salad” during her softball interview with an ABC affiliate – dodging questions and saying little of substance during her first solo media sitdown since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, critics told The Post Saturday. “When a reporter asks about inflation and she responds by talking about [neighbors’] lawns, I’d say she is disconnected from everyday Americans,” Rep.

She never said how she’d tackle inflation, but instead highlighted her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and provide tax breaks to new small businesses. Harris’ answers are “perfect example[s] of why her handlers are concerned about her doing interviews,” said Republican political consultant Rob Ryan. “When asked a basic question about the economy, she once again regurgitated the same story from the debate about growing up in a middle-class setting with a working-class mother.” “At best, it was a disjointed response showing no real empathy or understanding of the issue and only repeating the lines that were drilled into her during debate prep, offering no real solutions.” When asked how she’s different from President Biden, Harris also said a lot of nothing. “Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden, and I offer a new generation of leadership.” Catch up on The Post’s debate coverage Kamala Harris’ dismissive laugh on full display in first presidential debate with Trump Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris minutes after presidential debate: ‘I’ve made my choice’ Read Trump’s and Harris’ closing statements from their first presidential debate Harris campaign calls for second debate after Trump’s performance is panned by critics Trump refers to Kamala Harris’ 2020 viral ‘I’m speaking’ moment in presidential debate: ‘Does that sound familiar?’ Harris tries to pin Project 2025 on Trump during first minutes of presidential debate Trump claims Harris supports abortions in the ‘ninth month — and she doesn’t deny it’ during presidential debate Everything to know about the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate She then vowed to “invest in areas that need a lot of work,” without specifying any. “My focus is very much on what we need to do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st Century,” Harris bizarrrely added. Harris also skirted the question when asked why ex-President Donald Trump appeals to so many Americans. Instead, she spent time speaking in circles before painting the Republican presidential nominee as divisive. “I, based on experience and, uh, and, a lived experience, know in my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of us as Americans have in common so much more than what separates us,” Harris said. “And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans — and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” she said. Perhaps, the veep’s clearest answer came after being asked about the country’s gun-violence epidemic. Harris, a licensed gun owner, said she won’t take “anyone’s guns away” and supports the Second Amendment, but would beef up background checks and ban “assault weapons.” “They’re literally tools of war,” Harris said. Harris did the interview with ABC affiliate three days after the network’s moderators came under fire for refusing to fact-check the veep during her presidential debate while fact-checking Trump five times.","summary":"Kamala Harris served up a hearty dish of \"word salad\" during her softball interview with an ABC affiliate, critics told The Post Saturday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/14/us-news/kamala-harris-served-word-salad-in-abc-interview-critics/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89678449.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/f6Tqbnyr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:34:06","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":256429700,"title":"Exploiting fear is what the Republicans do","text":"Exploiting Fear Is What They Do Of all the falsehoods, evasions and plainly loony remarks by former President Donald Trump during his ill-fated debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, perhaps it was to be expected that his ridiculous lie about the endangered pets of Springfield, Ohio, would go super viral. While the Republican candidate declared himself the winner \"by a lot\" (a claim rejected even by many of his supporters), the internet was aflame with hundreds of mocking memes and several music videos that sampled his glowering image and tone of menace as he said, \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.\" Harris couldn't restrain herself from laughing -- and it was impossible not to join her. While some of us are still laughing, the intention behind that indictment of Haitian immigrants by Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, wasn't funny but deeply sinister. The only conceivable reason to spread that ugly myth, like so many of wild delusions promoted by politicians like Trump and Vance, is to demonize defenseless people, enrage gullible conservatives, and harvest money or votes or both in the process. By now this industry of profiting from invented grievances is very familiar, having been refined in countless varieties by the generations of right-wing grifters who paved the way for Trump. Decades ago they began by promoting paranoia about communism and civil rights, initially by direct mail, and always with the most outlandish tales: of \"barefoot\" African soldiers just over the southern border, waiting to invade at the order of the United Nations; of public school teachers indoctrinating children to accept cannibalism and \"wife-swapping\"; of unions forcing firefighters to let houses burn down. None of these canards bore the slightest resemblance to truth -- yet they induced millions of people to mail checks to crooked political entrepreneurs. The only difference between then and now is that the Trump campaign expects to profit from its lies via email and credit cards rather than mailed checks. Trump and Vance care just as little for the truth as those direct-mail shysters, unashamed to keep repeating the lie even as the mayor of Springfield, the city's police chief and the very Republican governor of Ohio have sought to explain that there has been not a single case of a Haitian immigrant eating anybody's cat. Vance claims that his office has received \"many\" such complaints from local residents, but he doesn't seem to have forwarded them to any authorities. (It's probably safe to assume he's lying about that too.) The smirking senator doesn't care whether the stories are true. He just wants to fan the flames of fury. It is true, as local and state officials have hastened to note, that the huge influx of migrants to Springfield and the surrounding counties has created real difficulties. Some are cultural and some are simply due to overburdened systems and infrastructure. Local governments had no opportunity to prepare -- and they assuredly need much more assistance than they have gotten from the federal government, which created the problem with good intentions and inadequate foresight. But what is so impressive - and inspires hope for our country - is how many of the citizens of Springfield have sought to make the best of this challenge, despite the hardships, even as opportunistic politicians and their most racist supporters try to exploit it. Trump and Vance have nothing to offer except antagonism, panic and potential violence. But Springfield's employers have provided jobs and found the Haitians to be valuable and diligent workers; clergy have welcomed Haitian families into their churches; and the city and county frontline workers, in social services and public safety, have stepped up with compassion. Even a man who lost his son to a traffic accident caused by a reckless Haitian driver last year has set aside his grief to admonish those who have misused his son's death to incite fear and hate. At a recent city commission meeting, Nathan Clark invoked the memory of his late son. \"Using Aiden as a political tool is, to say the least, reprehensible.\" He named Vance and Trump, among others, saying, \"They have spoken my son's name and used his death for political gain. This needs to stop now.\" It will only stop when the reprehensible exploitation is no longer profitable.

General Assembly to discuss Ukraine’s strategy for the war ahead of the U.S. elections, said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. With little more than four months before a new U.S. president is sworn in, “we are going to treat each single one of those days preciously when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Sullivan said via a video link to the annual Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, organized by businessman Victor Pinchuk. “I believe that we’re at a vital moment, at a crossroads,” Sullivan said of the Biden meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting at UNGA. Zelenskyy, who’s repeatedly criticized allies for the slow supply of promised weapons, has said he’ll lay out a “victory plan” when he meets with Biden that would force Russia to halt its full-scale invasion, though he hasn’t offered specifics. Ukraine’s leader said he would also brief the U.S. presidential candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on the proposal. Ukraine is pressing its allies to allow the use of Western weapons to strike deeper inside Russia to target military objects that have been moved further back from the nations’ border. “Our job is to put Ukraine in a strong position on the battlefield so that they are in a strong position at the negotiating table,” Sullivan said. “Having a conversation that puts all of the pieces together” is what the White House hopes to bring together at the New York meeting. Sullivan warned that any peace proposal suggested for Ukraine that ran counter to “fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, democracy and freedom” wouldn’t be sustainable. Ukraine has to be “in the lead when it comes to diplomacy and negotiations,” he said. Kremlin forces recently stepped up missile attacks on Ukraine, damaging its energy facilities and causing blackouts across the country. Russian ground troops are advancing in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk as the war moves through its third year, outnumbering Kyiv’s army in personnel and ammunition. The strategic town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk is of “unique concern,” Sullivan said. “I meet with my team every single day to think about what tools we need to put into place to help stabilize the front and make sure that those grinding advances by the Russians are met with stiff resistance,” Sullivan said. “We are currently working on a substantial package, pulling together a range of different capabilities that we are going to try to get out the door before the end of this month.” Ukraine has repeatedly called for more air defense systems and the U.S. is “in the process right now of securing those from partners,” Sullivan said. Kyiv also needs to build more concrete barriers around energy transformers and substations to protect them from Russian drones, Sullivan said, adding that “we’re trying to deliver the tools to be able for them to build that out around more energy infrastructure.” The U.S. has made it a priority to help protect Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, Sullivan said. “Russia has proved completely brazen about its attacks on civilian energy infrastructure,” he added. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

A downtown bus stop had about five people walking by around 3 p.m. Haitian Community Help and Support Center in Springfield, Ohio. (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story) Yet, the Ohio city of about 60,000 residents was thrust into the national spotlight this week when Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) both spread unsubstantiated claims of Springfield residents having “their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country,” as Vance posted on X. Trump brought up Springfield during his first debate against Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, saying, \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.” Rob Rue, mayor of Springfield, held a press conference Tuesday to address “recent rumors that have been circulated related to our Haitian community.” “We wish to clarify that we have not been able to verify any credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,” Rue said. Rue did not respond to Raw Story’s requests for comment. Raw Story visited City Hall on Wednesday to speak with Rue and Bryan Heck, city manager for the City of Springfield, and was emailed a video statement from Heck. “It is disappointing that some of the narratives surrounding our city has been skewed by misinformation circulating on social media and further amplified by political rhetoric and the current highly charged presidential election cycle,” Heck said in the video statement. ALSO READ: Inside Trump’s 'peace candidate' debate scam Heck did not respond to Raw Story’s follow-up questions via email, nor did Karen Graves, strategic engagement manager for the City of Springfield. “While we are experiencing challenges related to the rapid growth of our immigrant population, these challenges are primarily due to the pace of the growth rather than the rumors being reported,” Heck said in the video statement. “These rumors will not distract us from addressing the real strain on our resources, including the impact to our schools, healthcare system and first responders.” Joe Morman, a doctor and chief clinical officer at Mercy Health-Springfield, said the influx of Haitian immigrants into Springfield (estimated between 15,000 and 20,000 since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to city officials) has had “a huge impact” on the hospital, but not a bad one. Joe Morman, a doctor and chief clinical officer at Mercy Health-Springfield. (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story) “I think it is a very positive thing, and we enjoy the challenge,” Morman told Raw Story after a walk in Snyder Park. “Language is a huge challenge for us, but yeah, they're wonderful people.” About the dog- and cat-eating rumors? Morman said on Wednesday, “The whole nation heard it last night. I haven't heard of any cat and dog cannibalism. I wouldn't mind if there were a lot less geese in our parks. God bless the Haitians if they're willing to do that for us.” Some residents were indeed concerned by claims on social media of migrants eating pets and decapitating ducks and geese in Springfield — but no one Raw Story spoke with saw or heard any direct evidence of such incidents. All said they just saw such claims on Facebook. Conservative publication The Federalist published a recording and report involving a nonemergency call in Springfield about four migrants allegedly taking geese, but Raw Story was unable to substantiate the validity of the caller's claim and the outcome of any investigation by the time of publication as Rue, Graves and Heck did not respond to Raw Story’s questions about the call. Raw Story visited the Springfield Police Division on Wednesday and was directed to contact Graves. Steven Monacelli, a freelance investigative correspondent, obtained the same report and recording as The Federalist and spoke with the caller. Monacelli posted on X that the caller, Toby, said the \"men he says he saw with geese were speaking Creole. But he hasn't seen anything like it since, and there isn't any photographic evidence showing similar things in Springfield.\" Karen Beckett, clerk with the Clark County Sheriff's Office,\" told Monacelli via email that the office had \"no other information to provide\" about the call and report. \"At this time we have not found any other record concerning Hattians (sic) harvesting geese. At this time we have not found any record of Hattians (sic) eating pets,\" Beckett wrote. Liza Cash, a Springfield resident and Trump supporter, said the migrant situation in Springfield is “very bad,” and she saw a video on Facebook of an immigrant carrying two ducks he killed at Snyder Park. Did she see any such thing herself? “No,” Cash said. Liza Cash, a Springfield resident (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story) Raw Story went to Snyder Park and saw dozens of ducks swimming near a fountain. Geese were gathered in the park as well. No one was bothering the birds. A 14-year-old resident fishing nearby said he heard of the rumors, too, but again, he didn’t see anything himself except “a picture of it on Facebook.” Brian Evans, a Springfield resident, said he hasn’t “had a problem with it at all,” regarding the Haitian migrants in the city. “A few live right across the street from me. I live right behind where the Catholic Central football field is. I don't have any problems with it,” Evans said. Brian Evans, a Springfield resident (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story) When asked if he knew of any issue of migrants eating pets or fowl from the parks, Evans laughed and said “no.” Raw Story stopped by a pet store in Springfield, Bone-a-Fido Bakery, to ask about any concerns residents had for their pets. An employee said their phone had been ringing nonstop, but she was unable to answer any questions. Community impact of the national spotlight Near the intersection of South Yellow Springs Street and Robinson Drive in Springfield is a nondescript one-story brick office building, the Haitian Community Help and Support Center. The parking lot was nearly empty as was the office building itself when Raw Story arrived on Wednesday afternoon. Denise Williams, president of the NAACP, Springfield, who was visiting the center on Wednesday, said the rumors about the migrants in Springfield have led to “major turmoil” for herself and Rue, the mayor. “He's been threatened. I'm getting hang-up calls. I'm getting emails that are disgusting,” Williams said. “You got the hate groups that's here, and it's disgusting.” Williams continued, “I think it's very, very disgusting to have a running president and vice to even single out Springfield without them educating themselves. It is causing extra turmoil here in our city, and I think it's a very disgusting moment for our community as a whole.\" Williams called on politicians to \"stop all of this rhetoric,\" specifically asking for Vance to apologize to the Springfield community for his spread of rumors about the Haitian community in the city. \"I want J.D. Vance to apologize to our community because it was a disgusting remark, and it has fueled the fire that's already blazing here,\" Williams said. “I hope the word gets back to him that we really need him to apologize to the city.” On Monday Vance posted on X about “Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.” Vance on Tuesday acknowledged the potential falsehood of the claims of animal harm by migrants. NOW READ: Trump is permanently wounded ”In the last several weeks, my office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who've said their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false,\" Vance posted on X. In the post, Vance went on to criticize Harris for her immigration policies and point to the death of a Springfield child, Aiden Clark, who died after his school bus was accidentally hit by an Haitian migrant. The child's father, Nathan Clark, asked for his son's name to not be invoked in political debates about immigration, AP reported. \"This needs to stop now,” Nathan Clark said at a Springfield City Council meeting. “They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members. However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio. I will listen to them one more time to hear their apologies.” Williams said Haitian migrants in Springfield will \"help our community\" and include educated individuals, including engineers and doctors. Sheila Fambro, a pastor in Springfield, added, “It’s just been crazy, just horrible the lies that are spread about the Haitian community, as far as eating the animals. It makes no sense at all.” Viles Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian Community Help and Support Center, himself migrated to Springfield from Haiti four years ago. The center helps migrants with legal paperwork, such as work authorizations, and applications for jobs, housing and \"social benefits, like food stamps, Medicaid or cash assistance, so we help them as as much as we can,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They came here in search of jobs. All that happened in Haiti, the chaos, the political upheaval, so all those things kind of pushed Haitians away, and they flee the country for their safety,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They just look for a place to stay, and they chose Springfield because some friend told them that they can find job here in Springfield, and they came here just to find a safe place to raise their family and to get a job.\" Gang violence is a particular issue in Haiti. More than 2,500 Haitians were killed or injured in the first quarter of 2024 due to gang violence, according to the United Nations. Dorsainvil said the unsubstantiated demeaning comments about the Haitian community in Springfield \"have great impact\" on people's mental health. \"It is sad to know that this thing comes from people who are seeking the higher office of the land, people who attended good universities, well educated, people who have the possibility to check everything that they hear or everything that comes their way,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They should be here to work for the betterment of the country, instead of making fake news or saying fake thing that could impact the community or divide the community or the country more than it is now, so I think that they're high ranking people, and they should do better.\" Dorsainvil said the comments about migrants eating pets in Springfield were \"so shocking.\" \"It has made so much impact on the community, and friends have been calling me, asking me what they have to do, if they have to leave, or if they have to stay here because those rhetoric can escalate towards violence or anything bad for the community,\" Dorsainvil said. \"We are here to help boosting the economy. We are here to pay taxes [like] everybody else when we work, so we are here to live and to see a good community in Springfield.\" Sheila Fambro, Viles Dorsainvil and Denise Williams at the Haitian Community Help and Support Center. (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story) Under the direction of Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH), the Ohio State Highway Patrol was present in Springfield Wednesday and Thursday, Ray Santiago, a lieutenant with the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Public Affairs Unit confirmed to Raw Story. The patrol does not have an “operational end date” for its presence in Springfield, nor could it confirm the number of officers present, Santiago said. The patrol's presence in Ohio cities is \"data-driven\" and focused on \"addressing any crash causing violations to enhance roadway safety,\" Santiago said. He noted that there were seven fatal traffic crashes that resulted eight fatalities in Springfield in 2023, compared to two in 2022. The Ohio State Highway Patrol was in Springfield in July and August as well \"to decrease that fatal traffic crash trend that existed from last year to the year prior and address any of those challenging safety concerns, whether it's folks unfamiliar with traffic laws or folks that are simply disregarding them,\" Santiago said. Springfield City Hall, along with multiple agencies and media outlets, received bomb threats on Thursday. The Ohio State Highway Patrol provided assistance in responding to the threats, which are unclear if they're related to the national news about Springfield's migrants. A spokesperson for Vance acknowledged Raw Story's request for comment but did not respond by the time of publication. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Raw Story's questions.","summary":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Driving through Springfield, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon was not a scene of migrants digging through trash cans, decapitating animals or harassing neighbors.\n\nDucks and geese were undisturbed at Snyder Park, and even a small puppy sat on top of a picnic table in the park.\n\n  Ducks at Snyder Park in Springfield, Ohio (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story)\n\nFor the most part, residential streets were empty Wednesday afternoon.

Community impact of the national spotlight Near the intersection of South Yellow Springs Street and Robinson Drive in Springfield is a nondescript one-story brick office building, the Haitian Community Help and Support Center. The parking lot was nearly empty as was the office building itself when Raw Story arrived on Wednesday afternoon. Denise Williams, president of the NAACP, Springfield, who was visiting the center on Wednesday, said the rumors about the migrants in Springfield have led to “major turmoil” for herself and Rue, the mayor. “He's been threatened. I'm getting hang-up calls. I'm getting emails that are disgusting,” Williams said. “You got the hate groups that's here, and it's disgusting.” Williams continued, “I think it's very, very disgusting to have a running president and vice to even single out Springfield without them educating themselves. It is causing extra turmoil here in our city, and I think it's a very disgusting moment for our community as a whole.\" Williams called on politicians to \"stop all of this rhetoric,\" specifically asking for Vance to apologize to the Springfield community for his spread of rumors about the Haitian community in the city. \"I want J.D. Vance to apologize to our community because it was a disgusting remark, and it has fueled the fire that's already blazing here,\" Williams said. “I hope the word gets back to him that we really need him to apologize to the city.” On Monday Vance posted on X about “Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.” Vance on Tuesday acknowledged the potential falsehood of the claims of animal harm by migrants. NOW READ: Trump is permanently wounded ”In the last several weeks, my office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who've said their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false,\" Vance posted on X. In the post, Vance went on to criticize Harris for her immigration policies and point to the death of a Springfield child, Aiden Clark, who died after his school bus was accidentally hit by an Haitian migrant. The child's father, Nathan Clark, asked for his son's name to not be invoked in political debates about immigration, AP reported. \"This needs to stop now,” Nathan Clark said at a Springfield City Council meeting. “They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members. However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio. I will listen to them one more time to hear their apologies.” Williams said Haitian migrants in Springfield will \"help our community\" and include educated individuals, including engineers and doctors. Sheila Fambro, a pastor in Springfield, added, “It’s just been crazy, just horrible the lies that are spread about the Haitian community, as far as eating the animals. It makes no sense at all.” Viles Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian Community Help and Support Center, himself migrated to Springfield from Haiti four years ago. The center helps migrants with legal paperwork, such as work authorizations, and applications for jobs, housing and \"social benefits, like food stamps, Medicaid or cash assistance, so we help them as as much as we can,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They came here in search of jobs. All that happened in Haiti, the chaos, the political upheaval, so all those things kind of pushed Haitians away, and they flee the country for their safety,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They just look for a place to stay, and they chose Springfield because some friend told them that they can find job here in Springfield, and they came here just to find a safe place to raise their family and to get a job.\" Gang violence is a particular issue in Haiti. More than 2,500 Haitians were killed or injured in the first quarter of 2024 due to gang violence, according to the United Nations. Dorsainvil said the unsubstantiated demeaning comments about the Haitian community in Springfield \"have great impact\" on people's mental health. \"It is sad to know that this thing comes from people who are seeking the higher office of the land, people who attended good universities, well educated, people who have the possibility to check everything that they hear or everything that comes their way,\" Dorsainvil said. \"They should be here to work for the betterment of the country, instead of making fake news or saying fake thing that could impact the community or divide the community or the country more than it is now, so I think that they're high ranking people, and they should do better.\" Dorsainvil said the comments about migrants eating pets in Springfield were \"so shocking.\" \"It has made so much impact on the community, and friends have been calling me, asking me what they have to do, if they have to leave, or if they have to stay here because those rhetoric can escalate towards violence or anything bad for the community,\" Dorsainvil said. \"We are here to help boosting the economy. We are here to pay taxes [like] everybody else when we work, so we are here to live and to see a good community in Springfield.\" Sheila Fambro, Viles Dorsainvil and Denise Williams at the Haitian Community Help and Support Center.

Mike DeWine (R-OH), the Ohio State Highway Patrol was present in Springfield Wednesday and Thursday, Ray Santiago, a lieutenant with the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Public Affairs Unit confirmed to Raw Story. The patrol does not have an “operational end date” for its presence in Springfield, nor could it confirm the number of officers present, Santiago said. The patrol's presence in Ohio cities is \"data-driven\" and focused on \"addressing any crash causing violations to enhance roadway safety,\" Santiago said. He noted that there were seven fatal traffic crashes that resulted eight fatalities in Springfield in 2023, compared to two in 2022. The Ohio State Highway Patrol was in Springfield in July and August as well \"to decrease that fatal traffic crash trend that existed from last year to the year prior and address any of those challenging safety concerns, whether it's folks unfamiliar with traffic laws or folks that are simply disregarding them,\" Santiago said. Springfield City Hall, along with multiple agencies and media outlets, received bomb threats on Thursday. The Ohio State Highway Patrol provided assistance in responding to the threats, which are unclear if they're related to the national news about Springfield's migrants. A spokesperson for Vance acknowledged Raw Story's request for comment but did not respond by the time of publication. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Raw Story's questions.","summary":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Driving through Springfield, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon was not a scene of migrants digging through trash cans, decapitating animals or harassing neighbors.\n\nDucks and geese were undisturbed at Snyder Park, and even a small puppy sat on top of a picnic table in the park.\n\n  Ducks at Snyder Park in Springfield, Ohio (Photo by Alexandria Jacobson/Raw Story)\n\nFor the most part, residential streets were empty Wednesday afternoon.

Heading up the effort was Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz, a political consultant with 448,200 followers on X. Bruesewitz played a key role in the “Stop the Steal” movement that mobilized Trump supporters to converge on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following the 2020 election. The right-wing influencers assembled for the “war room” have collectively promoted a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that high-level Democrats are involved in a child sex trafficking network, demonized transgender people and, like Bruesewitz, mobilized Trump supporters to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 6, 2021. But in a campaign in which Trump and his running-mate, JD Vance, are brazenly stoking fear about immigration by pushing a debunked claim that Haitians are eating pets or suggesting government collusion in the attempt on Trump’s life, the flurry of X posts produced by the influencers on Tuesday might not have made a huge impression. In the hours before the debate, Chaya Raichik, creator of the Libs of TikTok account, made a handful of posts on X with memes that showed variations of Trump holding cats and ducks, and in one case showed the former president pointing a pistol while a militia of house cats wielding assault rifles massed behind him. She also posted a link to a story by the Federalist that purported to substantiate the claims by citing a single phone call to a police dispatcher reporting that he saw “a group of Haitian people” with “geese in their hands.” Local officials have since said that there's no evidence of Haitians harming geese. Whether desperate or unimaginative, the posts about Haitians eating pets have come in for criticism from some surprising sources. The hits are not coming just from progressives and moderate Republicans, but also from at least two figures further to the right than MAGA who are no strangers to online provocation. Ali Alexander, who organized the 2020 “Stop the Steal” campaign alongside Bruesewitz, leveled criticism at “right-wing influencers” during an extended commentary for a livestream on his Telegram channel on Wednesday. He didn’t mention any of the pro-Trump influencers by name, but he took aim at one of their central preoccupations. “If you watch the Republicans on Twitter, you’re dumb,” Alexander said. “You’re just uninformed and dumb. You think that Haitians are eating all kinds of people’s cats. Okay. So, you’re just kind of dumb, and you know, I can’t control that.” Following the political and legal fallout over Jan. 6, Alexander has struggled to rebuild his stature in MAGA, and was largely exiled in 2023 following a revelation that he asked teenage boys to send him nude pictures. Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who helped organize the 2017 Unite the Right neo-Nazi gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in which an antiracist activist was murdered in a car attack by a rally attendee, also ridiculed the memes. “The ‘Haitians eating cats’ thing is utterly stupid,” he wrote on X three hours before the debate. “It’s crude and easily debunked and thus easily turned around and used to make the Right look bad.” ALSO READ: 'I want Vance to apologize': We went to Springfield and found community hurt — and divided In November 2016, Spencer and his nonprofit National Policy Institute attempted to ride the coattails of Trump’s electoral victory in an effort to inject white nationalism into the political mainstream. But following Unite the Right, which eventually led to a $25 million judgement against the organizers, Spencer’s influence rapidly waned. On the day of the presidential debate, Spencer reflected that outlandish and overtly racist claims about Haitians eating cats would have been confined to the fringe in 2016, when he led the so-called “alt-right” movement, but are now being embraced by mainstream GOP figures including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). “The alt-right methodology and ‘vibe’ has been fully integrated into the GOP,” he wrote on X. “At this point, online racism is just another chapter of the ‘Southern strategy.’” ‘We’re doing the influencer war room thing — whatever’ About an hour before the start of the debate, Trump spoke to the influencers through a cell phone call with Bruesewitz, his campaign advisor, according to a video posted by one of the influencers, CJ Pearson. Bruesewitz boasted to his boss that the 16 influencers seated around a long row of tables in the conference room would be reaching a combined 50 million followers on X. “They’re big deals,” he said. Trump seemed unimpressed. “Have a good time,” he said. “They’re going to have 200 million watching this.” (Later estimates by the media analytics company Nielsen would peg the number of viewers at 67.1 million.) Another video posted by Jack Posobiec, who promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory holding that Democratic Party elites were running a child sex ring from a Washington, D.C. pizzeria, shows him in the conference room saying, “All right. We’re doing the influencer war room thing — whatever.” Then, Posobiec turns the camera towards Bruesewitz and asks, “What is this called?” “No clue,” Bruesewitz responds. “But there’s a lot of influence here.” Shannon McGregor, an associate professor at the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media, told Raw Story that the near complete alignment between Trump and the social-media influencers to push extremist messaging means that influencers are likely not “drawing in heaps of new people.” But that doesn’t mean their influence should be discounted. The false claim about Haitians eating cats, which appears to have originated on Facebook, is a case study in how right-wing influencers with large social-media followings find and amplify individual stories, she said, that resonate “across mainstream Republican politics, which is this deep white nationalist story.” Whether the influencers or Republican politicians are driving extremist radicalization, McGregor said the people shouldn’t underestimate the ability of influencers to mobilize followers to commit political violence on Trump’s behalf. “To me, what’s most unsettling is that people who have not just media power, but real political power that they share this sort of deep story that ‘our’ way of life is under attack,” McGregor said. “By our, I mean a white nationalist identity. That’s scary from the point of view of the health of our democracy. “I do think where the danger, in particular with some of these right-wing accounts that are huge, is being able to whip up thousands of people into political action and political violence,” she added. “We saw that already on January 6th and we saw it in Charlottesville.” NOW READ: Trump is permanently wounded","summary":"While former President Donald Trump debated Vice President Kamala Harris at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, more than a dozen hand-selected right-wing influencers hunched over laptops in a conference room to churn out social media posts designed to amplify Trump’s messaging.\n\nHeading up the effort was Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz, a political consultant with 448,200 followers on X.

On Thursday, his campaign announced new Trump shirts that are brazen knockoffs of Swift’s “Eras” tour poster. The T-shirts, which sell for $36, include a Trump image in the foreground, with different photos of him on a grid in the background. The design is an imitation of the poster for Swift’s billion-dollar-grossing tour, which is also sold on T-shirts and various other merchandise. Trump’s campaign touted the product on X, calling it a “Trump Era shirt.” It’s unclear what, if any, legal action Swift could take against Trump, who is already facing a host of notices from musicians and their estates to stop using their music at his campaign events. Swift is famously cautious about her public image, and her publicist is known to be intensely protective. Swift has yet to respond publicly to the campaign’s promotion. But the pettiness of the move suggests the former president may be more agitated by Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris than he has let on. Last week, Trump suggested to Fox News that Swift’s endorsement would affect her success “in the marketplace” and said that he was not a fan. “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said, referring to Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and a friend of Swift’s who publicly expressed her support for Trump. “She’s a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan.” Yet Trump has gone to lengths to use Swift’s popularity to his benefit. In August, he posted on Truth Social multiple AI-generated images of the pop star and her fans, known as “Swifties,” supporting him. Swift said in her endorsement of Harris that she was motivated to do so in part because of those fake images, writing, “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.” Swift has spoken up against Trump a handful of times over the years. Earlier this year, however, Trump said he did not believe Swift would endorse President Joe Biden in 2024 because in 2018 Trump signed bipartisan legislation to reform copyright law, arguing that she would not “be disloyal to the man who made her so much money.” (This despite the fact Swift previously endorsed Biden in 2020.) Trump has also expressed disbelief that “a country star can be successful being liberal” (Swift started out making country music but has since moved into a decidedly pop direction) and asked if “she is liberal, or is that just an act?”","summary":"Donald Trump dismissed Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, but it seems his campaign is still hoping to cash in on Swift's reputation.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/taylor-swift-trump-shirt-eras-tour-rcna171149","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240914-taylor-swift-ch-1436-7544f3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:19:14","author":"Clarissa-Jan Lim","authors":["Clarissa-Jan Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":256427256,"title":"‘Clearly chicken you weirdo’: People respond to JD Vance sharing video he claims shows migrants grilling cats","text":"Republican vice-presidential candidate Senator JD Vance continues to stoke outrage against foreign-born members of his own constituency, sharing video footage with his 1.9 million social media followers that he claimed showed African migrants in Dayton, Ohio “eating cats” — but instead appears to show nothing more than poultry cooking on an outdoor grill. “Kamala Harris and her media apparatchiks should be ashamed of themselves,” Vance posted Saturday on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. “Another ‘debunked’ story that turned out to have merit.” Vance has claimed, falsely, in recent days that Haitians — who are not Africans — living in Springfield — a town of 58,000 which is not Dayton — were stealing, killing, and consuming their neighbors’ pets. The video was originally posted by the right-wing Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo, who offered a $5,000 bounty to anyone that could provide “proof” of cat-eating immigrants in Ohio. The footage was filmed last year in Dayton, Rufo wrote in a companion article published Saturday on his personal website. He said he spoke with the person who shot the video, and that this person said the cat-eaters were “some Africans that stay right next door to my kid’s mother,” according to Rufo’s piece, which insists the claims were verified by “multiple witnesses and visual cross-references.” “One can make the case for migration, but one cannot, at the same time, deny that it comes with costs — which, in this case, seem to include a pair of flayed cats on a blue barbeque in Dayton, Ohio,” the article concludes. Backlash was swift, with replies ranging from, “I find it strange that a self-professed ‘hillbilly’ doesn’t know what whole chickens look like,” to, “HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT CHICKENS LOOK LIKE WITH THEIR LEGS ATTACHED YOU F****ING DIPSHIT.” Oliver Alexander, an open-source intelligence analyst, weighed in, sharing images of plucked chickens looking remarkably similar to whatever was being grilled in the video. “Clearly chicken you weirdo. Dude’s never seen chicken that wasn’t dino-nugget shaped,” he wrote. Rufo did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Vance campaign declined to comment on the record. An expert at the National Chicken Council did not reply to inquiries. However, a source close to Vance told The Independent that they do not believe the carcasses seen on the grill are chickens. A visual comparison of skinned cats prepared for laboratory use and whole-plucked chickens suggested the animals in the video are almost certainly not feline. Saturday’s repost by Vance, a Yale-educated lawyer who represents the State of Ohio, marks yet another escalation in the anti-immigrant narrative he publicly launched less than a week ago. On Monday, Vance claimed, falsely, that newly-arrived Haitians in Springfield were feasting on their neighbors’ domestic animals, prompting national outrage by the right. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz gleefully stirred the pot, posting a photo that same day of a cat with a single line of text reading, “Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don’t eat us.” As the concocted tale picked up steam, it was swiftly debunked by Springfield officials, who said they had no information to support Vance’s allegations. However, that didn’t stop the Trump-Vance campaign from sending out a press release accusing “unvetted” Haitians of consuming not only domestic animals, but local wildlife such as ducks and geese, too. On Tuesday night, during the first (and likely only) presidential debate between Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris, the former president seized the opportunity to ratchet tensions up even further. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump insisted at the Tuesday evening event. “The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” Since then, members of the Haitian community have become targets, many of them scared to leave their homes for fear of being attacked by angry residents. “It’s creating so much panic in the community,” Springfield resident and local leader Viles Dorsainvil told The Independent. “... The words that come out of their mouths matter. They are looking for the highest office in America. They have the obligation to do better, because words are powerful.” He said Haitians in Springfield have been calling the nonprofit Haitian Community Help and Support Center, which Dorsainvil founded last year, to ask if it is safe for them to go outside. “And we let them know, when they are going out, to be careful,” Dorsainvil said. On Thursday morning, multiple schools and government offices in Springfield were evacuated following bomb threats, followed by a repeat of the situation on Friday, which forced evacuations at two elementary schools and a middle school. No explosives were found at any of the locations listed in the threat, Springfield authorities said in a news release. Still, a day later, Vance was back at it. As one dismayed X user wrote, “It does feel like these guys won’t be satisfied until someone is hurt or killed.”","summary":"The “gotcha” footage posted online by Vance may not be the slam dunk he apparently hoped it would be","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-cats-grill-chicken-ohio-b2612999.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/11/04/Election_2024_Debate_74682.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 21:16:03","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":256428562,"title":"Harris is promoting her resume and her goals rather than race as she courts Black voters","text":"While President Joe Biden was hosting a celebration of Black excellence at the White House with lawmakers, advocates and celebrities this past week, Kamala Harris was instead headed off to Pennsylvania. The nation's first Black vice president talked with Pennsylvania voters about supporting small businesses, building more housing and expanding the child tax credit. She said the country “needs a president of the United States who works for all the American people.” What she did not do was spend time talking about her race or gender or the prospect that she would be the nation's first Black and South Asian woman to be president if she defeated Republican Donald Trump. As Harris courts voters, she embodies her identity as a woman of color rather than making it an overt part of her pitch, choosing instead to emphasize her policies and resume. She will be making her case to minority voters in a number of key settings in the coming days. She is scheduled to speak on Saturday night at a Washington awards dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, conduct an interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and attend an online rally Thursday headlined by Oprah and involving groups such as “Win with Black Women,” “White Women: Answer the Call,” and ”South Asians for Harris.\" Harris, throughout her career, has been \"many different firsts, and has never really led with that as a descriptor,” said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' winning campaign for California attorney general in 2010. “Her life story and her identity and her background and her job experience have all been critical parts of her campaigns,\" he said. But he added that \"becoming the first — that has never actually been part of her core rationale for why she should be elected a office. It just happens to be a important result of her elections.” Harris' identity, too, is evident in how she chooses to engage with voters. A member of a historically Black sorority while attending Howard University, Harris spoke this summer in Houston at the annual assembly of another sorority, where she told the women “it is so good to be with you this evening, and I say that as a proud member of the Divine Nine. And when I look out at everyone here, I see family.” It's a different approach from Hillary Clinton's in her 2016 Democratic campaign for president, when she put front and center her potential to break the glass ceiling. Harris' aides and allies say with no time to lose in a compressed campaign this year, it is perhaps more valuable to focus on voters rather than herself. North Carolina's Crystal McLaughlin, who attended a Harris rally in Greensboro this past week, acknowledged Harris’ candidacy as an important “historical moment” but added that what is more important is to look at “who wants to do what’s right.” Still, she said Harris' identity matters even if it is not the focus on her campaign. “It's important, not only for Black young girls, but for girls period,” said McLaughlin, 53, who is Black. “If you can see it, you can actually be it.” So far, it’s been Trump who has brought up race in the campaign, falsely claiming that Harris belatedly “turned Black.” During the presidential debate this past week, he again said he had read she was “not Black” and then she was. Harris did not mention herself once in her response, saying instead: “I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people.\" After Biden dropped out of the race in July, polling indicated that Black Americans were more excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee. In late July, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll showed that about 7 in 10 Black adults said would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee. That was a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt that way about Biden. Another AP-NORC poll conducted in August found that about half of Black adults said that “excited” would describe their feelings “extremely” or “very” well if Harris was elected president. Only about 3 in 10 had said the same about Biden in March. Although Black Americans overwhelmingly identify as Democrats and about 9 in 10 Black voters supported Biden in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast, there are some signs that older Black voters may be more supportive of Harris than younger Black voters are. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 9 in 10 Black voters over age 50 were supporting Harris, compared with three-quarters of Black voters 18 to 49. Civil rights organizations focused on mobilizing Black voters say they have seen an uptick in enthusiasm and engagement since Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. The NAACP has been circulating messaging with allied groups that its researchers believe will especially resonate with Black voters, including protecting the rights of Black Americans and appealing to their responsibility to vote. On economic questions, the civil rights group is urging organizers and campaigns to listen to Black voters’ concerns. “Black voters want policy solutions,” said Phaedra Jackson, vice president of unit advocacy and effectiveness at the NAACP. But she added: “Representation matters. Folks are excited to see a Black women vying for the highest office in the land” and they care more about institutions when they are represented within those institutions. The NAACP has focused much of its voter turnout efforts in battleground states where they believe issues like voter suppression will be a potential issue come November. “Black voters are reachable and we are not a monolith. This is an extremely exciting time to be in voter engagement,” said Tyler Sterling, the NAACP's national campaign director. John Spencer, a 58-year-old geographer from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he wants Harris to stay focused on her plans for the future rather than her race and gender. Identity, unlike policies, is something you can tell just by looking at her, he said. “Ideally in this country, a politician should be judged about their positions and not about anything other than who they are and their character and their positions,” said Spencer, who is white. He said Harris' positions matter more to him because he said they will ultimately impact his 11-year-old daughter Leah, who attended the Greensboro rally with him. When Harris takes a stage, said 66-year-old Sheila Carter, the Democratic presidential candidate's identity is “self-explanatory.” Discussion about her race and gender are secondary to what she offers as a candidate, said Carter, a Black retiree from Durham, North Carolina, who attended the rally. “You see who she is,” Carter said. “And as she says, ‘Why bother to even address whether or not I’m Black or Indian or whatever? I am who I am. You see it, I see it, the world sees it.‘” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Biden could no longer fulfill that role, so the Democrats and the press ushered him off the stage and are now elevating Harris as their new figurehead. What’s her plan? What’s her record? The answer: It’s terrible, and she obviously hates you. The Kamala Harris you saw in the debate didn’t exist before. I live in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state and one of the few places where people actually saw Kamala Harris try to win over voters. In California, she didn’t need to campaign as a Democrat, but in Iowa, she had to meet people. Uh-oh! That effort went so poorly that she and I ended up with the same number of delegates in the Iowa Caucus — zero. Now, betting markets are giving Harris about 51-49 odds to become president, even though no one cast a single vote to put her in this position. This is no time for clever memes or jokes about how clueless she is. Those won’t work — and did I mention how badly I want to win? — against the dark forces guiding Harris. Americans are about to start voting in key states. The clock is ticking, and I have no desire to end up in prison in a few years for simply speaking my mind about Kamala’s tyranny.So let’s focus on what we can control right now. The debate moderators were a disaster, but focusing on that is what those destined to lose do, just like so many other feckless GOP candidates of the past. We have 55 days until the election — the same amount of time that’s passed since Trump faced his toughest blow — and we can’t afford to waste it as we did during that critical moment. The path to victory lies in this undeniable truth: Republicans win when elections focus on issues. Democrats win when they focus on personalities. One recurring theme in the debate gives Trump an opportunity, if he listens to those who truly see and understand who Harris, America’s new Jezebel, really is. Remove all the demonic flash and the satiation of your senses. Look beyond the surface as a discerning believer. Recognize the assault on reality that the Democratic Party is capable of creating. You won’t defeat it by trolling or “owning the libs.” At least half a dozen powerful commercials can be made against Kamala Harris using her own words from the debate. The message is clear: Harris has no regard for the suffering of the American people, suffering she helped cause as vice president over the past four years, and she shows no intention of easing. That is her record, and we must hang her political future with it, or we will all hang separately, as our revolutionary forebears understood. In the end, people want elections to focus on them and their issues. This leads to my second absolute truth of American politics: Whoever makes the best argument about the future wins every time. I can’t change the fact that Donald Trump spent about 70% of the debate defending his record instead of making Kamala defend hers as the incumbent, but I can insist we reverse this approach moving forward. What is Kamala’s plan for us besides copying Joe Biden’s aggressive failures and pasting them into her presidential website? No area of American life is better than it was during the first three years of Trump’s presidency. Use the very clips from the debate that Democrats celebrate and expose the truth of her dark agenda with her own words, without even featuring Trump in the commercials. What’s her plan? What’s her record? The answer: It’s terrible, and she obviously hates you. As I’ve been saying for years, people like Harris don't call us all racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic bigots because they've got these well-reasoned and detailed arguments they're just holding back to unleash when we least expect it. They do so because they have none of those things. And because they despise us and our traditions. Did I mention I really want to win?","summary":"I want to win. I like to win.

A social media account posing as the Kansas City Chiefs star posted a message hitting back at Elon Musk on the billionaire’s own site, X, after he shared a creepy response to Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris this week. Just hours after the pop superstar, who has been dating the NFL player for over a year, endorsed the Vice President in an Instagram statement, Musk bizarrely offered to give her a child. Shortly after Musk’s tweet went viral, screenshots of a response allegedly from the Super Bowl winner also began making the rounds. ‘I’m 6’5′ and actually play football. The fact I went to college and got a degree and worked hard might be lost on you. I don’t play backgammon but I do play chess. I could also twist you into a pretzel,’ the post read. However, the fraudulent threat was quickly debunked by social media users, who identified it as a screenshot of an old tweet by an MLB fan that has been edited and used by other imposters multiple times on X. But while social media sleuths easily identified the fake, Cowherd wasn’t as astute. Cowherd cited the tweet on his show this week, discussing the Chiefs star and Tesla founder’s alleged online feud. ‘I saw yesterday, Elon Musk and Travis Kelce going at it. Travis Kelce taking a shot at Elon Musk on X,’ the analyst said on his FS1 show, ‘The Herd.’ Musk raised eyebrows when he reacted to Swift’s dramatic endorsement of Harris for US president. The singer made the announcement on Instagram following last night’s debate and signed off her endorsement ‘Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady’ – in a dig at Donald’s Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance . However less than two hours later, father-of-twelve Musk, who has also spoken out against underpopulation in the past, penned a bizarre proposal to Ms Swift. The Tesla boss wrote on X: ‘Fine Taylor … you win…I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.’ The real Kelce has remained silent on the SpaceX chief’s disturbing offer to his songstress girlfriend but others have jumped to the ‘Fortnight’ singer’s defense online. Rapper Azealia Banks has inserted herself into the drama by publicly encouraging Swift — who, like Musk, is a billionaire — to ‘sue him for loads of cash.’ ‘Nah this is actual sexual harassment,’ the rapper tweeted out Thursday. ‘Taylor should flex on his a** and sue him for loads of cash n level up to be the most undefeatable richest woman in the history of music. ‘Take his f***ing money taylorrrrrrr!!!!’ Banks continued her rant in two follow-up tweets as she marveled at the thought of Swift taking a huge chunk out of Musk’s $250billion net worth. ‘Put his a** in a hole sis. Lmao the pop girlies would all be so crumb. I love this,’ she wrote. Banks then brought Kanye West — Swift’s biggest rival — into the mix by speculating that he’d ‘have a heart attack’ if Swift successfully took down Musk. ‘lmao the heart attack kanye will have when she is ULTRA -UNREACHABLE levels of WEALTHY of his daddy elon’s back bwahahahaha.’ She concluded with: ‘CUCK THEM ALL SIS’ Musk’s post shocked even one of his most ardent supporters, Ian Miles Cheong, who responded: ‘My God.’ In her lengthy Instagram post, Taylor vowed that she ‘makes sure to watch and read everything she can’ about Trump and Harris’ ‘proposed policies and plans for this country.’ She said she planned to vote for Kamala because she believed the 59-year-old ‘fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.’ She also praised Kamala’s running mate Tim Walz for ‘standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSports analyst Colin Cowherd became a victim of a viral fake Travis&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Fox analyst Colin Cowherd falls for Travis Kelce tweet in response to Elon Musk&#8217;s inappropriate post about Taylor Swift first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/fox-analyst-colin-cowherd-falls-for-travis-kelce-tweet-in-response-to-elon-musks-inappropriate-post-about-taylor-swift/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Fox-analyst-Colin-Cowherd-duped-by-Travis.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 20:48:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":256426860,"title":"Texas voting group wants judge to block Ken Paxton's investigation into voter registration efforts","text":"A nonprofit focused on increasing Latinos' civic participation sued Attorney General Ken Paxton in federal court Friday so it could continue its voter registration efforts after the Republican official targeted them in an investigation last month. The organization Jolt said in its request for a temporary restraining order that Paxton's investigation would irreparably harm the organization and its associates by disclosing personal information and potentially placing its workers, volunteers, and associates in harm's way. \"If Jolt were forced to disclose confidential information to the attorney general, it would be considered a betrayal of the trust that Jolt has earned from the Texas Latino community,\" the organization's lawyer, Mimi Marziani, wrote in the lawsuit. \"It would make it more difficult for Jolt to associate with others and carry out its mission effectively, and it would likely put Jolt employees and others associated with the organization in danger.\" The background: Jolt's lawsuit comes as Paxton, a Republican, has tried to bolster unfounded claims that Democrats are allowing noncitizens into the country so they can vote in large numbers. It also follows unprecedented attempts to investigate or shut down nonprofit social aid organizations that assist migrants and Latinos. Last month, Paxton announced that his office was investigating whether organizations in Texas were \"unlawfully registering noncitizens to vote\" after FOX News host Maria Bartiromo had posted on social media that someone had seen organizations in Parker County and Fort Worth registering \"immigrants\" to vote. The elections administrator and Republican County Chair in Parker County had told news outlets there was no evidence to support the charge. Experts say there is no evidence that people who aren't U.S. citizens vote in elections in mass numbers. And before someone is allowed to vote, local and Texas officials verify their eligibility. But on Aug. 31, Jolt, which had been registering people to vote outside Department of Public Safety offices in Fort Worth, received a \"Request to Examine\" from Paxton's office asking the organization to turn over several documents, including information it provides about the voter registration process and all of the voter registration receipts it had completed. In its lawsuit, Jolt said Paxton did not identify a reason why the nonprofit needed to provide the information and did not accuse the organization of any wrongdoing. The group also said Paxton did not obtain the permission or authority from a court to obtain the documents, instead asking for a \"Request to Examine\" under state law regulating the organization of businesses. If Jolt did not comply with the request, the nonprofit could forfeit the ability to do business in the state. The nonprofit said in its lawsuit that it is also a Class B misdemeanor to fail to comply with the request from the attorney general's office. Why Jolt sued: The group said it was concerned that the Attorney General's Office would make public the information it was requesting from the organization, which its leaders said would harm its workers and its reputation with the Latino community. Two days after Bartiromo's tweets, individuals began posting on social media without proof that Jolt was a \"Marxist nonprofit organization\" that was helping undocumented immigrants register to vote. Some people posted videos on social media purporting to confront the group's volunteer deputy registrars. Other users responded to those social media posts with threatening comments such as \"Target practice\" or saying they wanted to \"hunt\" people who worked with Jolt. One social media user responded by posting the name of one of the group's board members. Given those threatening comments, Jolt's board decided it could not comply with Paxton's request without jeopardizing the safety of its volunteers or the people it works to register. Turning over the information, the group said, could also subject these people to being targeted by Paxton. The group said it is already feeling the effects of Paxton's investigation. Some of its previous partners have been less willing to cooperate with the group and its number of volunteer deputy registrars has dropped since the investigation began. Jolt is asking the court to declare Paxton's investigation unconstitutional and issue a preliminary injunction barring Paxton from taking any action to enforce his investigation. What Paxton says: Paxton's office could not be reached for comment Friday evening. But in the past, his office has said without proof that \"Texans are deeply troubled by the possibility that organizations purporting to assist with voter registration are illegally registering noncitizens to vote.\" He questioned why organizations were registering to vote outside DPS centers if citizens are already given the opportunity to register to vote when conducting business inside the DPS offices. \"My office is investigating every credible report we receive regarding potential criminal activity that could compromise the integrity of our elections,\" Paxton said in an Aug. 21 news release announcing his investigation into nonprofit organizations. \"Any wrongdoing will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\" Paxton has falsely accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of intentionally allowing undocumented immigrants into the country so that they can vote for Democrats. In recent weeks, he has said on social media that 6,500 noncitizens have been removed from the voter rolls in Texas, a number that was first reported by Gov. Greg Abbott's office. Voting rights organizations have said Abbott's framing of that routine process could be used to undermine trust in elections. The idea that mass numbers of non-citizens are voting is a winning topic with many Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee this year, who has repeated similar claims, including during the presidential debate this week.","summary":"The organization Jolt, which advocates for more Latino voting participation, says the attorney general's probe has spurred threatening comments online.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/nonprofit-focused-increasing-latinos-civic-participation-sued-texas-ag-ken-paxton-continue-voter-registration-efforts/15303550/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15303588_091424-ktrk-TT-voter-registrations-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 20:47:38","author":"Houston,James Barragán, The Texas Tribune","authors":["Houston","James Barragán, The Texas Tribune"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":256426618,"title":"Harris' first solo interview proves candidate is 'unprepared for office,' say online critics","text":"Social media users declared that Vice President Kamala Harris’ first solo sit-down interview this week proved that she does not have what it takes to assume the office of the presidency. Harris’ interview with Philadelphia's 6 ABC anchor Brian Taff went viral on social media Friday as it featured her giving answers that were criticized as being overlong and devoid of substance about her actual economic policies. Harris’ critics on X claimed that the conversation proved her unfitness for office. \"Oh my goodness this is an absolute train wreck,\" digital strategist Greg Price wrote about the interview on the social media platform. TRUMP APPEARS TO LEAVE DOOR OPEN FOR SECOND DEBATE WITH HARRIS: ‘MAYBE IF I GOT IN THE RIGHT MOOD’ The vice president’s interview took a ton of heat online for one answer in particular, where she gave a meandering response about growing up middle class to a direct question about what policies she will enact to provide economic relief to Pennsylvanians. \"When we talk about bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people, what are one or two specific things you have in mind for that?\" Taff asked. Harris replied, stating, \"Well, I'll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager.\" The Democratic candidate continued: \"I grew up in a community of hard-working people, you know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. And I try to explain to some people who may not have had the same experience. You know, a lot of people will relate to this.\" At first, Harris declined to mention any policy, continuing to go on about growing \"up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn.\" After more dialogue about her mother, she finally touted her proposals to give start-up businesses a \"$50,000 tax deduction\" and new home buyers a \"$25,000 down payment assistance.\" VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN For some X users, the answer offered more proof of Harris being unqualified for office. Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra wrote, \"This interview that Kamala Harris gave is truly staggering. Never have seen a politician this nervous, this unprepared for the office they are running for, and this clueless headed into an election. Kind of scary to be honest.\" Culture reporter Matt Kadish remarked, \"Usually, going through the primary process weeds out the people who aren't ready for prime time. Womp, Womp.\" Author Tim Murtaugh claimed, \"Kamala Harris is getting roasted over her first solo (taped) TV interview tonight and there are no Democrat accounts out here defending her.\" The Trump War Room X account compared Harris’ interview answers to similar answers she gave during her debate with former President Trump. The account stated, \"Kamala during the debate on the economy: ‘I grew up a middle class kid...’ Kamala three days later on the economy: ‘I grew up a middle class kid...’ She has no plan for America; all she can do is repeat the same rehearsed talking points.\" The Harris campaign did not immediately to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Saturday’s threats came even after the woman who started the rumors acknowledged to NBC News that they were unfounded and publicly apologized. Kettering Health Springfield was one of the medical facilities targeted, with officials later saying they found nothing suspicious during a search. Another hospital, Mercy Health’s Springfield regional medical center, received a similar threat. A spokesperson with Mercy Health said the hospital has continued to operate and thanked Springfield police as well as hospital staff “for their swift, efficient and caring response”. The bomb threats Saturday came after others had been called in to government buildings Thursday, forcing their closure and causing local schools to be evacuated. “We recognize that the past few days have been particularly challenging for everyone in our community,” Springfield police said in a statement. Police added “we remain fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of each and every person”. On Friday, a Springfield woman, Erika Lee, apologized for rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets that resulted from a post she wrote on Facebook claiming that the friend of a neighbor’s daughter lost her cat – and then found the animal strung up outside the home of a Haitian family. Lee now says she had no firsthand knowledge of the claim. The neighbor referenced in the post, Kimberly Newton, revealed that she also had heard the story from an acquaintance and not her daughter. Lee said she was filled with regret and insists she never intended to put a target on the backs of the Haitian community. “It just exploded into something I didn’t mean to happen,” Lee told NBC News on Friday. Local authorities in Springfield had already debunked the lies even before Donald Trump made the allegation that Haitian immigrants were eating pets during the debate with Kamala Harris on Tuesday. Lee told the outlet she never imagined her social media post would become fodder for conspiracy theories and hate aimed at the Haitian community in Springfield. “I’m not a racist,” Lee said, adding that her daughter is half-Black and she herself is mixed race as well as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. “Everybody seems to be turning it into that – and that was not my intent.” The city of Springfield believes the rumors may also have arisen from a case in Canton, Ohio, where an American with no known connection to Haiti was arrested in August for allegedly stomping a cat to death and eating the animal. Separately, an explanation for a viral photo of a man carrying two geese in Columbus, Ohio, has been made, although it also helped set off the now-discredited rumors about pet-eating in nearby Springfield. The Ohio state division of wildlife told TMZ that the man had been picking up the two geese that had been hit by a car. The agency also reported that there is no evidence that the man is Haitian, an immigrant or that he intended to eat the geese. About 15,000 Haitian immigrants began trickling into Springfield – a city of 60,000 – to work in local produce packaging and machining factories in 2017. They have been in demand at Springfield’s Dole Fresh Vegetables and at automotive machining plants whose owners grappled with a labor shortage in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.","summary":"Two hospitals sent into lockdown, government buildings shut down and local schools evacuated\n\nTwo hospitals in Springfield, Ohio, were sent into lockdown after bomb threats, police said Saturday, marking the fourth such case in as many days that appears linked to false claims circulating among the far right that Haitian immigrants there are eating domestic pets and wildlife.\n\nSaturday’s threats came even after the woman who started the rumors acknowledged to NBC News that they were unfounded and publicly apologized.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/more-bomb-threats-hit-springfield-ohio-after-trump-elevates-false-claims-about-haitians","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d35c6c8e2ab2c432fedb4ffcbbc40e0a65d77de/0_49_6000_3602/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 20:29:56","author":"Edward Helmore","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":256425766,"title":"Kamala Harris Gets Good News From Economists: New Survey","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, received good news from economists about her economic agenda, according to a survey published on Saturday.The economy has been a major talking point in this year's election following high inflation in recent years. Even though inflation has decreased, falling to its lowest level in three-and-a-half-years in August, many Americans are still feeling its effects.The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark rate, known as the federal funds rate, during next week's meeting by either a modest quarter-point or a larger half-point cut. The Fed raised the rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to curb high inflation, which hit both the United States and countries around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected rate cut would be the first in over four years. The cost of consumer borrowing, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, should go down over time with a series of Fed cuts.So, which presidential nominee has the better economic agenda to get Americans back on track? According to nearly 40 economists from America's top schools surveyed by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business' Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets, it's Harris instead of former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee.When asked which nominees' economic policies would be more inflationary, meaning it would cause more inflation, 70 percent of the economists said Trump's while only 3 percent said Harris'. Meanwhile, 27 percent said there is no material difference in each economic platform's inflationary consequences.A total of 70 percent also thought Trump's economic platform would produce larger federal budget deficits, while only 11 percent said Harris' platform would and 19 percent said there would be no material difference.Budget deficits are when government expenses exceed revenue. They also add to the national debt, which is not good for the economy.Newsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.What Are Harris' and Trump's Economic Policies?Harris wants to expand tax deductions for small businesses, restore and increase the child tax credit and lower housing costs by giving first-time homeowners down payment assistance. The vice president plans to pay for these social benefits by raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. She also wants to crack down on price-gouging to help with Americans' grocery bills.Trump, meanwhile, plans to continue the tax cuts he passed in 2017, which largely benefited the rich and big businesses. He also proposed 10 to 20 percent tariffs on all imports and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China. The former president has also promoted deregulation.How Does the Public View the Nominees' Economic Policies?According to a YouGov survey from September 11 to 12, Americans are split on which nominees' tax plan would be worse in the eyes of economists.When asked, \"Whose tax plan do you think economic experts say would increase the national deficit by a larger amount,\" 34 percent said Harris and 33 percent said Trump. Meanwhile, 8 percent said there is no difference and 24 percent weren't sure.The poll surveyed 1,120 U.S. adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.In a Pew Research Center poll conducted from August 26 to September 2, 55 percent of registered voters said that they are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy compared to 45 percent who said that about Harris.The poll surveyed 9,720 adults, including 8,044 registered voters, and the full sample's margin of error is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points.However, it's important to note that this poll was taken before Tuesday night's presidential debate.","summary":"A majority of economists in a new survey think the vice president's policies would be better for the economy instead of former President Donald Trump's.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-donald-trump-economic-policies-survey-1953940","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471521/harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 20:27:00","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255}]}
