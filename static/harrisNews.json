In a joint statement, co-CEO George Cheeks, CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach, and CBS Studios president David Stapf insisted the decision was based purely on declining revenues and shifting industry dynamics.\n\n'This was a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,' they said. 'It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.' \n\nBut critics aren't buying it.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders fired off a blistering statement on X: 'Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late-night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.'\n\nSenator Ed Markey went further, suggesting possible political interference: 'If the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company's editorial decisions, the public deserves to know.'\n\nTrump wasted no time celebrating the move on his Truth Social account gleefully writing, 'I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once-great.'\n\nThe post prompted a visceral response from Colbert's fellow hosts. Kimmel posted to Instagram: 'Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.'\n\nThe timing of Colbert's cancellation has only deepened suspicions.\n\nOn July 2, Paramount agreed to settle Trump's lawsuit. On July 15, Colbert railed against it on national television. On July 17, Paramount pulled the plug on the show despite it still being the top-rated program in its timeslot, beating both Fallon and Kimmel in linear and digital viewership.\n\nIndeed, while CBS cited financial strain, the numbers have painted a more complicated picture.\n\nAdvertising revenue for The Late Show has dropped 40% since 2018 from $121.1 million to $70.2 million last year, according to ad firm Guideline.\n\nBut the show still drew a nightly average of 1.9 million viewers this past season, more than any other late-night rival with Colbert has maintaining a massive digital following on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nBut CBS insists the business no longer adds up.\n\nOne former TV network executive said The Late Show had been hemorrhaging money and losing up to $40 million annually because of shrinking ad dollars and rising production costs. \n\n'Fifteen years ago, a show like The Tonight Show could earn $100 million a year,' they said. 'Now, they're money pits.' \n\nCBS had already begun gutting its late-night schedule. The Late Late Show with James Corden was scrapped in 2023. After Midnight was canceled earlier this year. \n\nColbert will end in May of next year with CBS planned to fill the Late Show slot with reruns of the primetime hit Tracker.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. \n\n\"I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,\" Kimmel told Variety in 2022. \"And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.\"\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nColbert's cancellation is the latest flashpoint in what critics call a mounting war against media critical of Trump.\n\nThe president has long sparred with journalists and entertainers, launching lawsuits against The New York Times, CNN, 60 Minutes, and ABC News. \n\nEarlier this week, his administration slashed funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS and has openly mused about pulling licenses from outlets he considers 'fake news.","summary":"A powerful Hollywood entity is demanding a state investigation after CBS abruptly canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, just days after the host accused Paramount of bribing Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14921939/Powerful-Hollywood-entity-call-investigation-bribery-Stephen-Colbert-cancellation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/20/01/100462461-0-image-a-10_1752971564108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 01:15:49","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":343312450,"title":"Rosie O'Donnell goes off on 'madman' Trump and Colbert's cancelation in scathing TikTok attack","text":"Rosie O'Donnell launched a passionate TikTok attack against \"madman\" President Donald Trump and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show on Friday and Saturday.

Trump also commented on the cancellation of Colbert's show, posting the following statement to his Truth Social account: \"I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired.

She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he wrote on Truth Social.

It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\nWhether or not politics were at play, the late-night format has been struggling for years, as viewers increasingly cut the cable TV cord and migrate to streaming. Younger viewers, in particular, are more apt to find amusement on YouTube or TikTok, leaving smaller, aging TV audiences and declining ad revenues.\n\nAmericans used to religiously turn on Johnny Carson or Jay Leno before bed, but nowadays many fans prefer to watch quick clips on social media at their convenience. Advertising revenue for Colbert's show has dropped 40% since 2018 - the financial reality that CBS said prompted the decision to end “The Late Show” in May 2026.\n\nOne former TV network executive said the programme was a casualty of the fading economics of broadcast television.\n\nFifteen years ago, a popular late-night show like The Tonight Show could earn $100m (€86m) a year, the executive said. Recently, though, The Late Show has been losing $40m (€34m) a year, said a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe show's ad revenue plummeted to $70.2m (€60.4m) last year from $121.1m (€104.1m) in 2018, according to ad tracking firm Guideline. Ratings for Colbert’s show peaked at 3.1m viewers on average during the 2017-18 season, according to Nielsen data. For the season that ended in May, the show’s audience averaged 1.9m.\n\nComedians like Colbert followed their younger audiences online, with the network releasing clips to YouTube or TikTok. But digital advertising did not make up for the lost TV ad revenue, the source with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe TV executive said reruns of a hit prime-time show like Tracker would leave CBS with “limited costs, and the ratings could even go up\".\n\n The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is just the latest casualty of the collapse of one of television's most durable formats. When America's The Late Late Show host James Corden left in 2023, CBS opted not to hire a replacement. The network also canceled After Midnight this year, after host Taylor Tomlinson chose to return to full-time stand-up comedy.\n\nBut the end came at a politically sensitive time.\n\nParamount Global PARA.O, the parent company of CBS, is seeking approval from the Federal Communications Commission for an $8.4bn (€7.2bn) merger with Skydance Media. This month, Paramount agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 Democratic challenger, Kamala Harris.\n\nColbert called the payment “a big fat bribe” two days before he was told his show was cancelled.\n\nMany in the entertainment industry and Democratic politicians have called for probes into the decision, including the Writers Guild of America and Senator Edward Markey, who asked Paramount chair Shari Redstone whether the Trump administration had pressured the company.\n\nParamount has the right to fire Colbert, including for his political positions, Markey said, but “if the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company’s editorial decisions, the public deserves to know”. A spokesperson for Redstone declined comment.\n\n\"It's a completely new world that artists and writers and journalists are living in, and it's scary,\" said Tom Nunan, a veteran film and TV producer who is co-head of the producers programme at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. \"When the news came in about Colbert, we were shocked but not surprised.\"","summary":"Late night television has been in decline but the host had openly accused the network of political shenanigans","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/companies/arid-41672948.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9422/4711121_4_seoimage1x1_US_20Harry_20080864_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 21:10:00","author":"Dawn Chmielewski And Lisa Richwine,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Dawn Chmielewski And Lisa Richwine","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":343288012,"title":"Bribery Allegations Rock Paramount: Writers Guild Demands 'Full Investigation' into Parent Company of CBS After Stephen Colbert's 'Late Night' Show Gets Axed","text":"The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has called for an investigation into Paramount following the abrupt cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nThe statement, released by the WGA on Friday, July 18, alleges that Paramount’s decision may be linked to “bribery concerns” tied to recent legal negotiations with President Donald Trump.The WGAThe call for inquiries into Paramount centers on its controversial $16 million settlement related to a 2024 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

The timing has sparked speculation among fans who view the cancellation through the lens of Paramount's pending merger and the company's recent settlement of a lawsuit with Trump over a 60 Minutes report.Trump accused 60 Minutes of editing its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in last year's presidential election, in a \"deceitful\" way, which the program denied.In a statement on Thursday, the network dismissed speculation and said the late-night talk show was being canceled for financial reasons. Those reasons are associated with Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which requires Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval under the Trump administration. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.In response to the Late Show's cancelation, Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday: \"I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.\"Last Monday, Colbert called out Paramount over its $16 million settlement with Trump during the show.\"While I was on vacation, my parent corporation Paramount paid Donald Trump a $16 million settlement over his 60 Minutes lawsuit,\" Colbert said in a monologue on The Late Show. \"As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended, and I don't know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company. But just taking a stab at it, I'd say $16 million would help.\"O'Donnell's nearly 10-minute TikTok post also included unsubstantiated claims about Trump's mental and physical health, calling him \"mentally incapacitated\" and alleging he suffers from dementia. She framed Colbert's cancellation as part of systematic silencing of Trump critics, comparing immigration enforcement to \"his own personal Gestapo.\"Trump, who is 79 years old and is the oldest person to serve a second term, has faced intensifying scrutiny over his age and cognitive fitness. Although, his physician declared him \"fully fit\" after a comprehensive physical that included a perfect score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the White House announced on Thursday that he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).What People Are SayingRosie O'Donnell via TikTok on Friday: \"I think Americans should stand up and say, no way. You're not going to silence us. You don't have the right to silence us. You never did. And you never will. We, the people, have the right to speak up against atrocities, which are happening on a daily basis, ICE, his own personal Gestapo—what will it take, America? What will take? He's gonna arrest every artist that disagrees with him and pretty much every artist does.

Because this madman, this mentally incapacitated, physically ill, mentally ill man is spiraling out of control.\"President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social last Saturday: \"Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"Stephen Colbert reacted to The Late Show's cancellation during Thursday's episode: \"Before we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night. Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May,\" he said as the audience booed. \"Yeah, I share your feelings. It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced, this is all just going away, and I do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners. I'm so grateful to the Tiffany Network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home.

Earlier in the week, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll similarly found that the party as a whole has an approval rating of 40%—considerably lower than the Republican Party’s 48% approval rating found by the same poll. \n\nNor can Democrats necessarily rely on any GOP infighting to redound, in seesaw-like fashion, to their own benefit; for all the Sturm und Drang generated by the “Epstein files” affair, President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have actually increased among Republicans this month.\n\nThe issue for Democrats is that their current unpopularity is not a byproduct of the political scandals of the day or the vicissitudes of Trump’s polarizing social media feeds. Rather, the problem for Democrats is structural—and it requires a rethink and a reboot from soup to nuts. \n\nAs this column argued last November, it is clear that Barack Obama’s winning 2008 political coalition—comprising racial and ethnic minorities, young people, and highly educated whites—has completely withered. “Obamaism” is dead—and Democrats have to reconcile themselves to that demise. At minimum, they should stop taking advice from Obama himself; the 44th president was Kamala Harris’ top 2024 campaign trail surrogate, and we saw how that worked out.\n\nIn order for the party to rise up anew, as has often happened throughout American history following a period of dominance from a partisan rival, Democrats are going to have to move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievances that have so greatly alienated large swaths of the American people on issues pertaining to race, gender, immigration, and crime and public safety. And the good news, for conservative Americans who candidly wish the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, is that Democrats seem completely incapable of doing this.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old recent winner of New York City’s much-discussed Democrat mayoral primary, is a case in point.\n\nThe Ugandan-born Shiite Muslim Mamdani is a democratic socialist, but he is better understood as a full-fledged communist. That isn’t hyperbole: One merely needs to consider his proposed policies for New York City and review his broader history of extreme far-left political rhetoric. \n\nMamdani won the primary, and is now seeking the mayor’s office, on a genuinely radical platform: support for citywide “free” bus rides, city-owned grocery stores, a full rent freeze on certain low-income units, outright seizure of private property from arbitrarily “bad” landlords, race-based taxation (an assuredly unconstitutional proposal), a $30 minimum wage, and more. A true Marxist, Mamdani has called for the “abolition of private property.” And he has something of a penchant for quoting Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” too.\n\nBut Mamdani’s communism is only part of his overall political persona. He also emphasizes, and trades in, exactly the sort of woke culture warring and intersectional identity politics that have defined the post-Obama Democratic Party. \n\nMamdani is a longstanding harsh critic of Israel who has long trafficked in, and had long refused to distance himself from, antisemitic rhetoric such as calls to “globalize the intifada.” \n\nMost recently, he also opposed Trump’s decision to have the U.S. intervene in last month’s Israel-Iran war, condemning it as a “new, dark chapter” that could “plunge the world deeper into chaos.” (In the real world, there were zero American casualties, and the bombing run was followed promptly by a ceasefire.) In many ways, Mamdani single-handedly encapsulates the unholy “red-green” alliance of Marxism and Islamism.\n\nThere is, to be sure, nothing good down this road for denizens of New York City. If Mamdani wins this fall, expect a massive exodus of people, businesses, and capital from the Big Apple—probably to the Sun Belt. But even more relevant: There is nothing good down that road for the national Democratic Party as a whole. In order to demonstrate that the party has learned anything from its 2024 shellacking and its current abysmal standing, it will have to sound and act less crazy on the tangible issues that affect Americans’ day-to-day lives.\n\nThat isn’t happening. If Mamdani’s rise is representative—and it may well be, especially as other far-left firebrands like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, continue to make outsize noise—then Democrats seem to be moving in the exact opposite direction: full-on Marxism and woke craziness. If the party continues down this path, it will experience nothing but mid- to long-term political pain. But as one of the aforementioned conservatives who wishes the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, I’m not too upset about that.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Trump is demanding $10 billion in damages; in a post on TruthSocial, he called the legal action a “POWERHOUSE Lawsuit,” calling the article “false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS” and the Journal a “useless ‘rag.'”\n\nThe story concerns a birthday album compiled by Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, who’s now serving 20 years on sex trafficking charges. In the album, the paper wrote, was a “bawdy” letter bearing Donald Trump’s name.\n\n“It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker,” reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo wrote. “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The typewritten text features an imaginary conversation between Epstein and Trump, written in the third person. The letter closes with the words, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” \n\nThe Journal story also prominently featured Trump’s denial, in which he called the letter “a fake thing,” adding, “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\nTrump also immediately threatened to sue the paper, “just like I sued everyone else.” Paramount recently agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to settle a suit from Trump alleging that CBS had engaged in election interference by what he loudly insisted was unfair editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (For good measure, CBS is also canceling Stephen Colbert’s show, days after he called the Paramount settlement “a big fat bribe” on air, citing vague financial concerns.) In December 2024, ABC News agreed to make a $15 million donation to Trump’s presidential library to settle a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made about writer E. Jean Carroll’s civil lawsuits, which she brought against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. Trump was ordered to pay Caroll $5 million, a judgment that was just upheld by a federal appeals court in June. But Stephanopoulos incorrectly stated that Trump was “found liable for rape,” which he was not. \n\nIn his suit against Murdoch and the Journal, filed by Florida law firm Brito PLC, Trump also names Dow Jonesand NewsCorp CEO Robert Thomson as defendants as well as each journalist on the story individually. In the complaint, Trump’s lawyers write that Safdar and Palazzolo “failed to attach the letter, failed to attach the alleged drawing, failed to show proof that President Trump authored or signed any such letter, and failed to explain how this purported letter was obtained.” It also complains that the story went “viral” on the internet and Twitter, including screenshots of organizations like the Lincoln Project and figures like former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann sharing it. \n\nIn a post on TruthSocial after the lawsuit was filed, Trump cast it as part of a long history of legal actions against the media. \n\n“We have proudly held to account ABC and George Slopadopoulos, CBS and 60 Minutes, The Fake Pulitzer Prizes, and many others who deal in, and push, disgusting LIES, and even FRAUD, to the American People,” he wrote. “This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media. I hope Rupert and his ‘friends’ are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case.”","summary":"Donald Trump filed suit late Friday afternoon against the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s parent company, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and several other defendants, saying he was defamed by a story that claimed he contributed to a 50th birthday album for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.

As it struggles to unify around a clear successor at the top, there have been calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.What To KnowThe survey, conducted between July 13 and 18 among Democratic-identifying voters, shows former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg leading with 26.7 percent, while Ocasio-Cortez trails in second with 18.5 percent—a strong performance for a candidate who has never held statewide office.The New York congresswoman's numbers outpace traditional power players such as California Governor Gavin Newsom—who polled at 15.8 percent—and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who polled at 14.5 percent.A second-place finish in a crowded field dominated by governors and former presidential candidates signals that Ocasio-Cortez would be a top-tier contender should she officially launch a campaign.While she has not formally announced a presidential bid for 2028, a number of recent moves and statements have raised eyebrows about what she has in store for her political future.The progressive representative has been actively engaging in national politics, most notably through her \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour alongside independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which has drawn large crowds and widespread attention.She has also released a campaign-style video featuring the slogan \"We are one,\" further fueling speculation that a presidential run may be on the horizon.When questioned about a possible 2028 candidacy, Ocasio-Cortez did not offer a definitive answer. Instead, she highlighted her focus on defending Medicaid and civil liberties, telling Fox News: \"This moment isn't about campaigns or elections or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected.\"Still, her growing national profile has caught the attention of political analysts. In April, pollster Nate Silver, who publishes the Silver Bulletin, named Ocasio-Cortez the most likely Democrat to lead the party's 2028 presidential ticket, citing her strong grassroots support and cross-generational appeal.The same poll also showed fellow progressive Mamdani—who is running for mayor of New York City—emerging as a potential 2028 contender. Mamdani polls at 4 percent, placing him in the middle of the pack and tying with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who registered 4.1 percent. Mamdani's support likely overlaps with Ocasio-Cortez's base, raising the possibility of a split progressive vote if both enter the race.Mamdani has already built up significant momentum during his bid for the Democratic nomination for New York Mayor against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. However, the New York state assembly member is unlikely to launch a bid for the presidency.While he is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he was born in Uganda, meaning he does not meet the \"natural-born citizen\" requirement outlined in the Constitution.Nonetheless, support for Mamdani in the poll signals enthusiasm for a more radical alternative to the Democratic establishment.Elsewhere in the Democratic field, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who secured the party's vice presidential nomination in the 2024 election, had 8.7 percent support—outperforming several other prominent figures.Booker and Mamdani tied at 4 percent, both ahead of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who had 3.2 percent. Others—such as Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (1.4 percent), Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia (0.5 percent) and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (0.3 percent)—remained at the bottom of the field.The results paint a picture of a highly fragmented Democratic primary, with no single figure consolidating majority support and multiple ideological factions vying for influence.On the Republican side, the race appears far less competitive—at least for now. Vice President JD Vance holds a commanding lead in the GOP primary field, with 57.9 percent support among Republican-identifying voters.His lead dwarfs that of his closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who sits at 13.2 percent. Secretary of State Marco Rubio followed with 9.7 percent, while 7.6 percent of respondents said they would vote for \"none of the above.\"Donald Trump Jr., a potential heir to the Trump political legacy, garnered 4.6 percent, placing him well behind the top tier. Other potential contenders include Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina (2.6 percent), 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy (1.8 percent), Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem (1.4 percent), Texas Governor Greg Abbott (0.9 percent), Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (0.2 percent) and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas (0.2 percent).What Happens NextThe 2028 Democratic primary is likely to be a crowded field. In 2020, the last time Democrats had an open primary, more than a dozen candidates launched White House bids.","summary":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani are emerging as notable contenders for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-zohran-mamdani-2028-chances-polls-2101197","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686435/aoc-mamdani.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8553e83f8e85a5baa14524f93824e1dc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 16:34:32","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.294},{"id":343234772,"title":"Vance a ‘shoo-in’ to win 2028 presidential election: oddsmakers","text":"They think Vance has a chance. \n\nOdds for the 2028 presidential election were revealed by Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market — and bettors are putting their money on the veep becoming the victor.\n\nJD Vance has a 27% chance of becoming the country’s next commander in chief, according to the cryptocurrency-based prediction market.\n\nVance, 40, has already spoken about a possible 2028 run.\n\n“When we get to that point, I’ll talk to the president, we’ll figure out what we want to do.

For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they’ve turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it’s clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert’s show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global’s president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks’ problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount’s decision to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount’s $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration’s approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York’s attorney general into whether Colbert’s cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS’ decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert’s show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy’s most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn’t just the end of a show. It’s the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert’s demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert’s contract, celebrated the show’s upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers’ late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live,” told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount’s Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He’s hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I’m not doing this anymore?’ It’s a very complicated thing … I’m not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.","summary":"As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in $439 million in ad revenue for its late-night programs.

CBS announced Thursday that Colbert’s show will end in May 2026, citing \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night\". Trump reacted Friday morning in a Truth Social post, writing, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.

The announcement comes two weeks after CBS parent company Paramount Global agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview featuring Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump had alleged the interview was deceptively edited. Colbert addressed the settlement on his July 14 monologue, calling it “a big, fat bribe,” and joked, “Just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.” He added, “Paramount knows they could have easily fought it because in their own words, the lawsuit was ‘completely without merit.’ And keep in mind, Paramount produced Transformers: Rise of the Beast. They know ‘completely without merit.’” At Thursday’s taping, Colbert informed his studio audience of the cancellation. “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it,” Colbert said. “It’s not just the end of our show, but it’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced. This is all just going away.” Kimmel, meanwhile, responded on Instagram, “Love you Stephen,” before lashing out at CBS: “F--- you and all your Sheldons CBS.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"The announcement comes two weeks after CBS parent company Paramount Global agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview featuring Vice President Kamala Harris.

On Thursday Colbert told his audience at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York that his popular late night TV show is being cancelled. “Yeah, I share your feelings,” he said in response to a chorus of boos.\n\nThe CBS network insisted that it had made “a purely financial decision” to wind up The Late Show next year. But others are not so sure. Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator who was a guest on Thursday’s show, tweeted: “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”\n\nThere are reasonable grounds for suspicion. Earlier this month CBS’s owner, Paramount Global, reached a $16m settlement with Trump over an interview on its current affairs strand 60 Minutes, removing a potential obstacle to the company’s $8bn sale to the Hollywood studio Skydance Media.\n\nIf the mega-merger goes ahead, a friend and ally of the US president, the billionaire Larry Ellison, could wield huge influence over the CBS news division as well as programmes ranging from South Park to Star Trek. The Late Show is sure to be seen by some as an example of obeying in advance.\n\nAmong those sounding the alarm is Marvin Kalb, the last correspondent personally hired at CBS by Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism whose defiance of McCarthyism was recounted in the film and play Good Night, and Good Luck. Now 95, Kalb perceives the Skydance takeover as a threat to CBS’s journalistic independence and moral integrity – and fears that this time it will buckle.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his home near Washington, Kalb said: “In my judgment it means that CBS, starting with 60 Minutes, will be under a tighter editorial control than it has ever been. The idea that 60 Minutes will be able to continue to do virile, unafraid reporting on Trump may be coming to an end.”\n\nThe Murrow protege, who spent 24 years at CBS News, warns that the network could drift in the direction of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News, which often parrots Trump’s talking points. “I’m afraid that CBS News will become a little Fox, that it will begin to be timid in the way in which it approaches any possibly critical story about the president.\n\n“Just as you rarely see or hear anything on Fox that is critical of Trump, likewise it may very well end up that CBS will be essentially in the same position, and that is huge loss for those who still favour freedom of the press and who still favour a vigorous, unafraid press.”\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, before the news about The Late Show broke, Kalb expressed concern about the future of the late-night comedians whose caustic, bullshit-detector political satire has earned Trump’s wrath in the past. Jon Stewart, whose current contract expires in December, and Colberthave both mercilessly skewered Paramount for caving in to Trump.\n\n“My gut feeling would be that Colbert’s contract, when it comes up, will simply not be renewed, and they will find a humourist who is pro-Trump,” Kalb said presciently. “Those are the kinds of programmes that, in a humorous way, tend to either criticise or make fun of Trump – and he doesn’t like that.”\n\nThe former host of NBC’s Meet the Press who is Edward R Murrow professor of practice, emeritus at the Harvard Kennedy School continued: “He has already taken action against the press, starting from his first term with ‘fake news’ and ‘fake media’. He has already gone a long way toward diminishing the once virile press – I keep using that word because I’m thinking about people who are not afraid, people who are open minded, fair-minded journalists who are simply covering the news.\n\n“If the news happens to be unfavourable with respect to the president, so be it. But if the president doesn’t like it, he’s going to make his views known. I think if there were a serious study done even up to this point on the last five or six months, I believe you would see an initial, perhaps reluctant timidity come into the coverage of news concerning Trump.”\n\nTrump filed a $10bn lawsuit against CBS last October, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on 60 Minutes with the then vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed in February, Trump bumped his claim for damages to $20bn. CBS initially called the lawsuit “completely without merit”, a view shared by many legal experts, and sought to have it dismissed.\n\nBut then the company entered into mediation in an attempt to placate Trump as Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, sought to close the $8bn merger with Skydance, which needs federal government approval. The CBS News head, Wendy McMahon, and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens quit over Paramount’s handling of the showdown.\n\nWhen Paramount reached the out-of-court settlement, it insisted that the $16m would go towards Trump’s future presidential library, rather than to him personally, and it would not be issuing an apology. But critics saw it as the starkest example yet of Trump’s ability to intimidate major institutions including the media.\n\nRome Hartman, one of the producers of the Harris segment, who retired from CBS News and 60 Minutes last month for unrelated reasons, said in a phone interview: “The motive of this lawsuit was clearly harassment and intimidation and the decision by Paramount’s leaders to succumb to that harassment and intimidation was an absolute betrayal. It’s a shameful betrayal of the hardworking people at 60 Minutes and at CBS News.”\n\nDespite Trump’s pressure campaign, 60 Minutes has continued to produce unflinching reports on his administration’s immigration crackdown, assault on federal government departments and other issues. Now its staff are bracing for a change of ownership and potentially different approach.\n\nHartman continues: “Now everyone is hoping that the new corporate parents will allow 60 Minutes to operate with the independence that it has always enjoyed. That’s not a just-because-we-want-it sort of thing; that’s because the independence and editorial voice of 60 Minutes is one of the reasons it has lasted as long as it has and it has the amazing reputation that it has for over half a century. We were betrayed by one corporate parent and they hope that will not be repeated by the new folks.\n “We are living in a moment of real peril for free voices and independent journalism, even independent commentary, as would be the case with Stewart and Colbert. These guys are businessmen in the end, and I hope they see that to maintain longstanding principles of independence and free speech is not just in their interest morally but in their interest economically.”\n\nSkydance was founded in 2010 by Larry Ellison’s son David. According to its website, David, who is a pilot, came up with the name as a reference to flying aerobatics known as “skydancing” and its promise of limitless possibilities. It has produced films including the Tom Cruise vehicles Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nBut although David is the public face of Skydance, his father Larry will be the power behind the throne at Paramount, according to an organisational chart obtained by the New York Times last year. The co-founder of software company Oracle is one of the world’s wealthiest men and a friend of Trump, who has touted Ellison as a potential buyer of TikTok.\n\nBill Carter, the author of four books about television, says: “Both of the Ellisons seem to be close to Trump, and Trump will basically use any leverage he can. That’s what he does, and he has been given the power to do it pretty much across the board here.\n\n“The speculation is that they’ll install somebody who is at least somewhat willing to take his side in a future controversy, which means there’s very likely to be some kind of chilling effect on the news division, and especially at 60 Minutes, because they have basically defied him even after this.”\n\nLast week the New York Times reported that David Ellison had held talks about acquiring the Free Press, an online publication co-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics. Discussions include Weiss “taking on an influential role in shaping the editorial sensibilities of CBS News”, the paper added, though probably not in a managerial capacity.\n\nJournalist Mehdi Hasan responded to the report about Weiss by tweeting: “RIP CBS News.” Paul Farhi, a former media reporter at the Washington Post, said: “She’s an opinion journalist and always has been, and that’s not the person you want running a news division or having a prominent role in the news division. You want someone who actually knows or upholds the tradition of straight-up reporting that CBS has stood for its entire existence.”\n\nFarhi added: “I suspect at the end of it he’ll discover that CBS News wouldn’t be too crazy about having her, but it’ll be a real test of his intentions, if he has any intentions at all, for CBS News. If he brings in someone like her, it will signal a direction and will be a sign of we’re not going to do things the way we’ve done in the past.\n\n“But I think it’s more likely that he won’t do anything that’s going to be radical in terms of CBS News. For one thing, CBS News is a very small part of the overall Paramount enterprise that she’s buying. It’s not a big profit centre. At the end of the day I suspect we won’t be talking about this topic once the merger is done, simply because CBS News is not out of control.”\n\nBut other parts of the Paramount forest are already in revolt. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of the long-running animated sitcom South Park, have accused the incoming Paramount president, Jeff Shell, of meddling in contract negotiations for streaming rights to the show, allegedly to benefit Paramount+ at their expense.\n\nThis has caused disruption to production schedules including a delay for South Park’s 27th season. Parker and Stone wrote on social media earlier this month: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”\n\nStewart and Colbert have also been pushing back. Stewart used a Daily Show monologue to tear into Paramount’s settlement, interrupted by a spoof ad for the fast-food chain Arby’s that said: “For when you want a sandwich commensurate with your company’s shame.” Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” and even alluded to speculation about his own job security, pointing to a moustache he grew on holiday and quipping: “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert if they can’t find him?”\n\nThe timing of the decision to axe him raised eyebrows in Washington. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday: “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just three days after Colbert called out CBS owner Paramount for its $16m settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”\n\nSpeaking before the announcement, Carter, author of The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, said: “It would be pretty obvious to anybody looking at this situation if they decided to eliminate those guys that it would be for political reasons because they’re obviously outspoken and have a big audience listening to them and it gets under Trump’s skin.\n\n“But it’s scary to think that’s something that could happen in America, that a president could basically eliminate a voice of protest against him. It would be like [President Richard] Nixon getting rid of the editorial cartoonists who were criticising him over Watergate. I would not put it past Trump to try to do it.\n\n“I do think that if you’re David Ellison, it’s a terrible look. If you’re in Ellison’s shoes, you have to know this will brand you as another person who’s basically giving the knee to Donald Trump. A lot of these guys don’t care because they have other agendas. But it is a thing to live with if you’re going to be branding yourself that way.”","summary":"The fallout from the Trump payoff comes as a merger threatens the company’s integrity and A-list talent, such as Stephen Colbert, have already been sacrificed\n\nFor a decade the comedian Stephen Colbert has mocked, ridiculed and eviscerated Donald Trump from every conceivable angle.

The CHS said Spafford had recently lost three fingers while producing homemade explosives.\n\nThe informant relayed a series of troubling behaviors from Spafford, who repeatedly espoused disdain for most forms of government regulations, particularly those in connection with firearms and other weapons.\n\nOne of the components Spafford used in constructing explosive devices was Tannerite, a brand of binary explosive shooting target designed to blow up when struck by a high-velocity bullet and used mostly for long-range target practice.\n\n“In June 2023, after shooting at the range with the CHS, Spafford stated that ‘we need to bring back political assassinations,”‘ to which [a family member] responded, ‘for real,'” prosecutors wrote in a statement of facts. “During that conversation, Spafford discussed making Tannerite with a substance that makes it as strong as dynamite, and stated he likes to set it off with homemade blasting caps.”\n\nAfter Spafford explained how he created a special solution that would “remove DNA and fingerprints” from weapons, the defendant invited the informant to “go shooting” with him, saying, “he was using homemade targets with photographs of the President for target practice.” At the time of the comment, Biden was the sitting president.\n\nIn a similar vein, authorities say that about two weeks after the near-miss assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a July 2024 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Spafford sent the informant a text message that read, “Bro I hope the shooter doesn’t miss Kamala.” The comment came shortly after then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced her intention to run for president.\n\nWhile giving the informant a tour of a property recently purchased by Spafford’s family members, the informant heard Spafford tell a family member that he kept hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) stored in a deep freezer on the premise. Prosecutors described HMTD as “peroxide-based primary explosive” that is “highly sensitive and easily detonated as a result of impact friction, or temperature changes.”\n\nSpafford also reportedly told the informant that he had an AR-15 that he had modified into a short-barrel rife. He stated that the weapon was not registered because he “doesn’t believe in any of that,” and expressed his desire to install a 50-caliber firearm on the roof of the house, saying, “They can’t get close enough if I’m mowin’ down on my fifty cal,” per the statement of facts.\n\nWhen authorities arrested Spafford and executed a search warrant on the home in December 2024, he initially claimed that any explosive materials were from fireworks.\n\nIn addition to the HMTD, authorities said they recovered about “155 improvised explosive devices” that “appeared to be homemade bombs” in an unlocked garage that also stored “household items and children’s toys.” The HMTD was located in a freezer in the garage “stored near Hot Pockets, popsicles, and Go Gurt.”\n\nSpafford, who has been in detention since his arrest, is currently scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Arenda L.

However, she is also the subject of gossip on social media. From her outfit choices that make her look older to her 33-year age gap with her husband, Nicholas Riccio, people always have material to discuss about Leavitt.\n\nDespite that, experts think that if Trump had gone with his original choice for his press secretary, it would have been a disaster. It was recently revealed that the Republican leader almost gave the position to a woman, who is definitely one of his biggest supporters, but also the most controversial one. \n\nAccording to the book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, Donald Trump was considering Laura Loomer as his press secretary.\n\nLoomer was one of the biggest cheerleaders during the U.S. President’s re-election, and he couldn’t help but appreciate her efforts. The infamous internet personality put grave efforts into furthering Trump’s election campaign, going as far as exposing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was apparently willing to run against Donald for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn their book, authors Josh Dawsey, Issac Arnsdorf, and Tyler Pager claimed, “Trump called Loomer to thank her, saying she’d exposed ‘DeSanctimonious,’ as Trump had started calling him, as a disloyal Trump hater.”\n\nDespite her efforts, it was Loomer’s many controversial statements that failed to give her a solid seat even amongst the MAGA loyalists. From her anti-Muslim views, casting doubt on the gravity of tragic school shootings, to openly mocking former Vice President Kamala Harris’s Indian heritage, Loomer has always come strong with her problematic opinions.\n\nTrump has indicated if he won Laura Loomer would be his Press Secretary. Can you imagine that? pic.twitter.com/XxG6xsZN9L\n— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) August 20, 2024 \n\n“Many of Trump’s advisers viewed Loomer as too-conspiracy-minded and pugilistic, but he liked her,” the book claims. However, despite Trump’s liking, Laura ultimately wasn’t fit enough to head his press team. The authors say that Donald Trump once asked his aides, “Is she too fringe to be press secretary?” When Karoline Leavitt was appointed instead of Laura Loomer, the Republican leader answered his own question.\n\nWhile Leavitt also makes many controversial comments, she is far more diplomatic than Loomer. The outspoken political activist has go embroiled in many problematic situations over the years, but never showed remorse for her actions.\n\nShe also criticizes Donald Trump‘s Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom she refers to as “Blondi.” While the President is quite fond of his AG, Loomer slammed her, claiming that she was “covering up” information about Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged “client list.”\n\nLoomer and Trump have a complicated relationship, with some rumors even claiming that their friendship is more than just mutual appreciation. Hence, it’s only natural that, she wasn’t ultimately appinted to head the White House press team.","summary":"Karoline Leavitt might be the head of the press team now, but she wasn't Donald Trump's first choice.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/not-karoline-leavitt-this-controversial-maga-loyalist-was-donald-trumps-first-choice-for-white-house-press-secretary","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Before-Karoline-Leavitt-Donald-Trump-Considered-Appointing-Laura-Loomer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 11:31:12","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":343177144,"title":"Diagnosing Democrats' self-inflictions","text":"The 2028 presidential election will mark 200 years of the world’s oldest active political party: the Democratic Party. But high tide for the party was long ago. Two centuries on, the party is floundering and foundering, its factions splintered beyond repair.\n\nA recent dinner with a longtime Democratic activist and fundraiser in D.C. confirmed my worst fears: they are doing nothing and giving nothing to a party that has “no message and no messenger.” In their sanguine estimation, the Democratic National Committee’s cash reserves of $15 million won’t carry it past this year. The Republican Party heads into the midterms with five times the funds. If the House doesn’t flip in 2026, the 2028 election won’t be pretty.\n\n“Happy Days Are Here Again” has been the Democratic Party’s unofficial theme song since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1929, but it ought to substitute taps. We come to bury the party, not to praise it. A color map of the country tells the tale: blue coastal outposts and red all over. Once upon a time, a coalition forged in the fires of FDR’s New Deal included voters in the North and South; labor unions; Black, Catholic and Jewish Americans; liberals and, most of all, a dedication to agrarian interests versus the big-business bent of the GOP. But America’s heartland went red some time ago. In its shrunken state, blue has just gone black-and-blue.\n\n“It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” as Bob Dylan once sang. The dissolution has been a long time coming. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 began to cleave the South away from the party. The Vietnam War was a fault line that caused a liberal-versus-conservative schism that obtains to this day. Under Ronald Reagan, the white working class migrated to the Republican Party. One-term President Jimmy Carter’s long lines at the pump didn’t help any. The Clinton era was a respite but birthed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, who had none of her husband’s charm and all his baggage and then some.\n\nBarack Obama’s Affordable Care Act should have represented a return to the triumphs of FDR and the domestic achievements of Lyndon Baines Johnson, but Obama failed to sell it in, and the GOP had a field day deriding “Obamacare.” Sadly, the nation’s first Black president triggered a backlash from those for whom the whole era of diversity, equity and inclusion represented cultural assault by coastal elites. A toxic surge of resentment and fatigue with progressive initiatives made Obama’s pick of Hillary to succeed him a disastrous choice. Coming out of Donald Trump’s first term, the only thing worse than Joe Biden staying in the race too long was rubber-stamping Kamala Harris, who represented more of the same.\n\nThe party brought it on itself. An obsession with political correctness and marginalized groups, plus a border crisis with millions of illegal immigrants who by definition can’t vote, and it’s no surprise that the party is seen as having lost its way. Values that might be laudable in other contexts — from LGBTQ issues to climate change, abortion rights and health care reform — instead got buried under wildly unpopular advocacy for transgender juveniles.\n\nTo bottom it out, New York City’s ranked-choice Democratic primaries put up an avowed socialist for mayor, one who previously refused to condemn the phrase “global intifada.” Good luck with that. Traditional Democratic support from the city’s Jewish population is replaced by a coalition driven by social media. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams just might pull this one out of the trash while running as an independent.\n\nWith nationally recognizable names like Gavin Newsom, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders (an independent who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination) and, now, Zohran Mamdani, the Dems have their work cut out for them. The electorate has moved center-right, while blue boldface names are left. Newsom is doing his best to pivot, but his past will be hard to shake. Any election irregularities or structural disadvantages that suppress Democratic votes will have to contend with a Supreme Court with six Republican-appointed justices that has demonstrated no tolerance for lower-court rulings in opposition to the executive branch. Further, a majority of governors, who control their states’ electoral apparatuses, are Republicans. And this is not your father’s GOP but a MAGA flock of bleating yes-men happy to be sheep.\n\nWe are living in post-democratic times. One party is in tatters while the other controls all the spokes of government. The country does not share the values to prevent tacit autocracy. Elon Musk’s third party won’t save us — he’s part of the problem, not the solution. In a kleptocracy, it’s all about the Benjamins. The Republican Party has vacuumed up money, votes and illiberal control. Welcome to the nation’s sestercentennial next year.

This is all just going away.’ His tone was somber, but many viewers felt there was clear tension under the surface. \n\nSorry, the video was not found\n\nJust days before the announcement, Colbert criticized CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for reaching a $16million legal settlement with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe suit concerned the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, an interview Trump claimed was manipulated. Not long after Colbert publicly blasted the settlement, CBS dropped the axe. \n\nOfficially, the network claims the show’s cancellation has nothing to do with Trump, politics, or the content of The Late Show but that denial came across less as a confident clarification and more as damage control.\n\nImportantly, the show has had consistently high ratings in its slot and is often the highest-rated show in late-night.\n\nTheir statement read: ‘We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire ‘THE LATE SHOW’ franchise at that time. This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.’\n\n Colbert has hosted The Late Show since 2015 (Picture: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images)\n\n Donald Trump – who Colbert interviewed on the show in 2015 – gloated about the cancelation online (Picture: Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS via Getty Images)\n\nAs Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall noted: ‘Pointedly, there is no comment from Colbert in the release, and there’s no way he wasn’t asked to provide a polite quote.’\n\nThen came Trump’s gleeful gloating on Truth Social: ‘I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!\n\n‘[Fox News host] Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.’\n\nIt was a smug victory lap that, intentionally or not, framed the network’s decision as a political scalp. It’s a bizarre spectacle when a sitting president takes public joy in the silencing of one of his loudest critics, but some also found it telling. \n\nThe Writers Guild of America issued a statement calling on New York state officials to launch an investigation into Paramount over ‘potential wrongdoing.’\n\nThe statement reads in part: ‘Given Paramount’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that The Late Show’s cancelation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.’\n\n Colbert took over for David Letterman in 2015 (Picture: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images)\n\nUS Senator Bernie Sanders shared a similar sentiment: ‘CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.’\n\nSenator Adam Schiff agreed: ‘Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled. If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.’\n\nHollywood isn’t buying the official line either. Colbert’s peers have rallied around him, none more bluntly than Jimmy Kimmel, who posted: ‘Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.’\n\nCBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance.Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal.

He was, arguably, the last late-night host still consistently willing to hold power to account with biting honesty. And now he’s gone.\n\nCBS may insist this is a simple case of budget cuts and shifting media trends, and it’s true the network, like many in legacy media, is navigating rocky financial waters. \n\nBut even if financial considerations were real, the optics of the timing and the conspicuous omission of any comment from Colbert in the announcement make it hard to believe the move was apolitical. \n\nThe merger between Paramount and Skydance Media – which still awaits approval from the FCC, an agency that reports to the President – adds another layer of intrigue. It’s not a stretch to see the show’s cancellation as a quiet concession, a quid pro quo to grease the wheels of a larger corporate deal.\n\nA host with a clear political point of view, one unafraid to criticize both his own network and the sitting administration, is being taken off the air, while the President cheers from the sidelines and a multi-billion-dollar media merger waits for government approval. \n\nThe warning bells of creeping authoritarianism have been ringing in America for some time now, but this doesn’t just echo them; it sounds a blaring alarm.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"'Make no mistake about it: Fascism is here.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/07/19/fans-convinced-late-show-stephen-colbert-cancelled-terrifying-reason-23700363/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SEI_259343511-10b0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 09:46:55","author":"Brooke Ivey Johnson","authors":["Brooke Ivey Johnson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":343157970,"title":"“His talent was even less than his ratings” — Donald Trump reacts to Colbert’s Late Show cancellation, while fans call it a political win for him","text":"CBS has recently announced on July 17, 2025, that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will come to an end in May 2026, prompting Donald Trump to celebrate.

On July 18, 2025, former President Donald Trump reacted gleefully to the news on his social media platform, Truth Social, and wrote:“I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”For Trump and his supporters, Colbert’s cancellation is being hailed as a cultural and political victory. Online MAGA communities cheered the move, celebrating the downfall of one of Trump’s most visible media critics. Many see it as a symbolic triumph over what they perceive as liberal media bias.CBS Cancels The Late Show After 33 YearsCBS formally declared that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert did not plan to be extended past May 2026, when Colbert would be free of his current contract, on July 17, 2025. Colbert has hosted the show since 2015, a nine-year anchor of the network's late-night lineup and a ratings powerhouse. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostA Wall Street Journal report says the show was canceled mainly for financial reasons. Although Colbert had the highest viewership, CBS was losing over $40 million a year because of high costs—Colbert's $20 million salary and a staff of over 200 people.CBS claims the decision was purely about the budget, but some believe there may be other reasons involved.CBS settles with Donald Trump amid merger negotiationsJust days before Colbert’s cancellation, CBS had paid Donald Trump 16 million over a defamation suit related to a 60 Minutes report that aired, featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris.It is claimed that the segment gave a misleading impression of Trump, and CBS decided to reach a settlement agreement instead of continuing with litigation. This settlement occurred alongside delicate merger negotiations between the parent company of CBS, Paramount Global, and Skydance Media.The merger required federal approval, placing the company in a vulnerable political position. Colbert criticized the network on-air, accusing CBS of paying off Trump and labeling the settlement “a big fat bribe.”What started off as a company cost-cutting move has rapidly turned into a political hot spot. The cancellation of the show is a straight win for Donald Trump. As CBS switches off the lights on The Late Show, Colbert’s final bow will mark the closing act of an era.","summary":"CBS has recently announced on July 17, 2025, that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will come to an end in May 2026, prompting Donald Trump to celebrate.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/shows/news-his-talent-even-less-ratings-donald-trump-reacts-colbert-s-late-show-cancellation-fans-call-political-win","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/6d292-17529152840906-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 09:18:57","author":"Tanishqa Patil","authors":["Tanishqa Patil"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.03},{"id":343162800,"title":"Donald Trump Is Most Successful President After Six Months Since FDR","text":"The first six months of Donald Trump's second presidency have been the most \"successful\" of any American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, according to an analysis conducted by Newsweek using AI.The model defines success in terms of legislative accomplishments, taking into account what degree of control over Congress each president's party enjoyed over the relevant period. Speaking with Newsweek, one political scientist said Trump's legislative accomplishments—such as his flagship One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a tax and spending package—are \"reflective of the partisan support in Congress.\"Why It MattersTrump was inaugurated as president for the second time on January 20 after winning the 2024 presidential election on pledges to crack down on illegal immigration, fight \"woke\" culture and slash certain taxes.The model indicates that Trump has been successful at getting many of his priorities passed into law, greatly aided by the slim majority Republicans enjoy in both chambers of Congress and by relatively little impediment from the conservative-dominated Supreme Court.What To KnowNewsweek asked ChatGPT to rank the accomplishments of 20th and 21st century U.S. presidents in their first six months, taking account of the level of support they enjoyed in Congress.The model gave Trump an overall score of \"very high,\" thanks to legislation such as the One Big Beautiful Bill and Laken Riley Acts.On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law after it narrowly passed both the House and Senate. The legislation slashed certain taxes, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts; raised the U.S. debt ceiling; increased spending on the military and border control; and cut some funding from Medicare and other welfare programs. According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the package will add $3.3 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade.Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on January 29, with the bill taking its name from a Georgia college student who was murdered by a Venezuelan illegal immigrant in February 2024. The legislation requires noncitizens charged or convicted of a range of offenses, including theft and assaulting a police officer, to be held without bond. It also gives states more freedom to sue the Department of Homeland Security over immigration enforcement.The AI analysis concluded that the first six months of Trump's second term were the most productive since Roosevelt's first term in 1933. In his first 100 days, Roosevelt passed 15 New Deal statutes, including the Emergency Banking Act.Third in the AI's calculation was Biden's first 100 days, which saw the package of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan designed to combat the economic effects of coronavirus, along with the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday. This package was passed despite the Democrats and Republicans being tied in terms of 50 affiliated Senators each, giving then-Vice President Kamala Harris a tiebreaking vote.At the other end of the spectrum, the AI gave the worst score for the first six months to Theodore Roosevelt, who became president in 1901, arguing that he passed \"no major statue before March 1902.\"Bill Clinton was also ranked poorly, with the AI saying his only major legislative reform during his first six months was the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.What People Are SayingDafydd Townley, an American politics expert at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K., told Newsweek: \"While Donald Trump has achieved some legislative successes, they are more reflective of the partisan support in Congress. Not every president in the modern era has had such a one-dimensional party to support his legislative agenda. The Democratic Party has long been a coalition of diverse voices, making it difficult to appease every member of Congress. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama found this out during their first term in office.\"Until the George W. Bush era, Republicans failed to hold both House and Senate majorities in the modern era, apart from two years in the first Eisenhower administration. Even during the Bush years, control of the Senate shifted back and forth on several occasions, making legislative efforts difficult, if not impossible. Reagan's ability to bridge the partisan divide and work with congressional Democrats on specific bills, such as Social Security reform and immigration policies, suggests a White House capable of achieving ideological success despite congressional barriers. The same applies to Richard Nixon, who gained considerable legislative success despite having a Democrat-controlled House and Senate when he entered office.\"Democrat presidents of the early Cold War had to contend with conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, despite Democrat majorities in the House and Senate. These long-serving members dominated congressional committees, thereby limiting the legislative success of John F. Kennedy, for example. The successful passage of a huge number of bills as part of his Great Society program is a testimony to Lyndon Johnson's management of Congress.\"Trump has been much more reliant on the use of executive orders to implement Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for Trump's second term in office. The Trump-inspired legislation in this Congress is more likely to consolidate power within the executive branch and lead to less congressional interference in the president's management of the White House and its agencies.\"What Happens NextIt remains to be seen how successful the second Trump administration will be in passing legislation through Congress beyond its first six months.If Republicans lose control of either the Senate or House in the 2026 midterm elections, it will make it significantly harder to get the party's bills approved by Congress.","summary":"In terms of legislative achievements, Trump's second term is the most successful since Franklin D.

No empire, no holy faith, no condescension, no fatal ideologies. The fish is grilled, the extended family roll in on their scooters, the wine looks amber in its glass as the socially democratic sun begins its plunge into the sparkling waters below.\n\nThis was not my fortune. I was born to one dying superpower and am now living in another. I was born to an ideology pasted all over enormous granite buildings in enormous Slavic letters and now live in one where the same happens in bold caps on what was once Twitter and what purports to be Truth (Pravda?) Social. America, Russia. Russia, America. Together they were kind enough to give me the material from which I made a decent living as a writer, but they took away any sense of normality, any faith that societies can provide lives without bold-faced slogans, bald-faced lies, leaders with steely set jaws, and crusades against phantom menaces, whether Venezuelan or Ukrainian.\n\nI have written dystopian fiction before, and my latest novel, Vera, or Faith, is a continuation of the natural outcome of my birth in Leningrad and my removal, at age seven, to Reagan’s America. I think I have predicted the future with fairly good aim in novels such as Super Sad True Love Story, where social media helps to give rise to a fascist America, although my timeline when that book was published in 2010 was 30 years into the future, not a decade and change.\n\nBut before I wrote that book, there was a period of some optimism where, I confess, I got things terribly wrong. I imagined, in my least cynical moments, that Russia would become more like America over the years, or at the least more habituated to pluralism and the rule of law. Of course, the very opposite happened. America is becoming Russia with every day. The tractors I would watch on Soviet television leading to ever more heroic harvests are now tariffs that will bring manufacturing back to our land. The dissidents who were the Soviet enemy within are now the vastly fictionalised Tren de Aragua gang members who supposedly terrorise our land, and indeed all migrants deemed insufficiently Afrikaner. Politicians in all countries lie, but the Russian and American floods of lies are not just harbingers of a malevolent ideology, they are the ideology.\n\nVera, the titular character of my new novel, is a 10-year-old girl growing up in an America that is just slightly different from our own. Her best friend is an artificially intelligent chessboard named Kaspie (after the chess player), the car that drives her to school is an ingratiating AI named Stella, and the lessons of her school are preparing her for a constitutional convention that will allow certain “exceptional” Americans, ie those who can trace their heritage to the colonial era but were not brought to the country in chains, five-thirds of a vote. This is being done, Vera is continually told, not to diminish her rights (she, being half-Korean, would not qualify for the enhanced vote), but to honour the Americans who are exceptional by nature of their birth.\n\nOne reason I wanted to write from the point of view of a 10-year-old character – who, as it happens, is also half-Russian by heritage – is because of the way living in an authoritarian regime changed my own life. There was daily cruelty in the courtyards, classrooms and workplaces of the Soviet Union (not to mention the daily fisticuffs over nonexistent products in the food stores), but there was something else you could never forget even as a child: ubiquity. I grew up a stone’s throw from the biggest statue of Lenin in Leningrad; Lenin looked down at me from the walls of the kindergarten classroom in which my mother taught music; and the very city in which I lived had been renamed after him.\n\nWhen I wrote Vera, my own son was 10, and Trump was every bit as much a part of his life as Lenin was of mine, from talk in the playground to conversations at the dinner table to the discussions of his social studies class. It is unsurprising that Trump’s sometime ideological consigliere Steve Bannon has chosen Leninism as a model for his hero’s rule. All mode of social inquiry, even at a fifth-grade level, must lead back to the scowling man on the television and telephone screen. My parents and I may have different styles of childrearing and certainly different politics, but despite our disagreements I will always honour them for getting me out of the Soviet Union at the right time. The question for my son as well as the fictional Vera remains: is it time to do the same with our children? Or is there still room to stay and fight?\n\nOf course, there are large, some would say crucial differences between the Soviet Union of the 1970s and the Trumpistan that America has become today. Much as the comparisons of the contemporary United States with Hitler’s Germany are incomplete (though getting more complete by the day), Russia and America are hardly twins either. And yet, their increasing similarities raise the question of how the similarities that seemed nonexistent at the end of the cold war are becoming unavoidable now.\n\nTo start with, these are vast lands that stretch from sea to sea. Their size alone is enough to fuel messianic complexes, manifest destinies, divine rights. And religion, which can easily morph into ideology and then violence, drives the stupidity of both nations. In both societies, religion helped normalise the bondage of other human beings: slavery in America and the institution of serfdom in Russia. Inequality is baked into the national psyche of both, despite Russia’s experiments with state socialism: the idea that human beings must be parsed into a multitude of categories. Obviously, other countries have caste systems, but none has the capacity to impose its worldview on the rest of the globe with such stubborn resilience. The Soviet Union loudly professed the brotherhood of nations, but Russian racism remained thick and outlandish on the ground (ask almost any African exchange student), and was converted with great ease into a hatred of Ukrainians, with Russian television using animated images of Ukrainians rolling in the mud with pigs and references to a racial slur that can be compared with the worst used in the States.\n\nTrumpistan dives right into this morass with the falsehood that some commonplace tattoos found on Venezuelan bodies supposedly signify gang orientation, but really emphasising that some people – brown or black or non-Christian or non-straight – can never fully claim the mantle of Americanness. There are, indeed, “exceptional” Americans, those that look like Trump and much of his coterie, and then there are those who semi-belong, or who may stay as long as they are useful, and then there are those who don’t belong at all and can be deported at will.\n\nTrump loves Putin with good reason. Putin takes the messianic ideals that are found at the nub of both American and Russian societies and he makes something out of them that Trump can only find beautiful and instrumental to his own power and corrupt dealings.\n\nAs both countries enter headlong into postindustrial, likely artificially intelligent ages, Putin subverts the meaninglessness of Russian working-class lives with loud (though sometimes nonsensical and contradictory) narratives, rooted in a perceived insult to the messianic ideals of the fatherland. When, during his debate with the doomed Kamala Harris, Trump said that Haitian immigrants – those who would never be true Americans even if granted citizenship – are “eating the cats … eating the dogs”, he almost surpassed his master in terms of the clarity and shamelessness of his message, as well as an understanding of the audience for whom these comments were intended. It is most interesting to see older Russian-speaking immigrants in America, who fled the authoritarian USSR of their younger days, embrace Trump precisely because of the clarity of his message, their inability to deny a great leader shouting slogans that, if you take away their ideological direction, look much like the ones that lined the walls of our metro stations or the front pages of the newspapers we sometimes used as toilet paper.\n\nWhen I wrote Vera, there was one thing I couldn’t quite do to my 10-year-old heroine, which is to subject her to the threat of violence. She was simply too young for that, and also, because her family was financially privileged, less likely to face such a threat. But as I write this, in June 2025, Trump is taking the final steps of authoritarian progression in his attempt to label any protest against the unconstitutional nature of his rule as an insurrection that must be put down with military force. These attempts, as we can see, can be easily accepted by his followers, many of whom drink from the well of (often Russian-born) misinformation. There are parts of our population who are aching to shoot a brown “un-American” person at the border, in the same way many Russians without a purpose in life dream of profitably shooting a Ukrainian.\n\nAnd whereas Putin has relied on his own praetorian guard, the Rosgvardia (or Russian National Guard), so Trump is stumbling toward his own force in the fiercely racist and loyal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, which, in cities like Los Angeles and elsewhere, happily spreads the fuel with which our democracy may soon burn.\n\nI want to take a step back and return to the mythical country with which I began. My favourite country in the world, Italy, is ruled by a political party with ties to Mussolini. Other countries I love are not paragons of social democracy and have little love of the “outsider”, although they may rely on exactly such people to care for their parents or raise their children. But the danger of America and Russia lies in the ferocity with which we believe, a ferocity that in Russia is fuelled by a justifiable anger (and built-in fatalism), given how the population has been ruled throughout the entirety of Russian history, and in America is enhanced by a population that, despite its relative wealth, reads below a sixth-grade level and is easily susceptible to manipulation. Ignorance, to add a pinch of Orwell to the proceedings, is the strength of both regimes. Convincing these populations that slavery was but a feeble blip on the radar of American history or that Ukrainians are porcine savages who precipitated Russia’s invasion requires a groundwork set by centuries of hatred and exploitation.\n\nSo where should my Vera live? It is hard to say, because living under these regimes is already preparing our children for the two choices they will inevitably face – to fight or to conform. And is it right to ask a child to give up her birthright, the right to live in a country that invented the grace of the blues, the easy slide of denim jeans, the sweet, almost religious voices of Walt Whitman and James Baldwin? That is a lot to ask of a 10-year-old.\n\nThe beauty of writing about a child is that you can see the monstrosity of the world adults have built filter through their innocence. But no child stays innocent for ever.","summary":"When he left the Soviet Union for a new life in America, the novelist never imagined he would live under another authoritarian regime.

The presumption is that today’s crowded field of Democrats would thin out quickly to give her a virtually free “top two” primary election finish next June. This would assure her a slot on the fall ballot, most likely against either a Republican-turned-Democrat like developer Rick Caruso – who lost a run for mayor of Los Angeles three years ago – or far-right Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nBut that scenario might not come about. As Harris contemplates, none of her prospective Democratic primary rivals has dropped out quickly.\n\nYes, Harris can take comfort she is the early-book leader in this race. Against a host of other declared and rumored candidates, she enjoyed 24 percent support in a poll by the UC Irvine School of Social Ecology. But placed in a hypothetical race against an unnamed Republican (right now, Caruso and Bianco are the most likely to be there), she led by only 41-29 percent, with heaps of undecided voters.\n\nUndecided voters have long been poison to Harris. Their late decisions made her 2010 run for state attorney general against then-Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley a horserace lasting until the very last days of vote-counting, almost a month after Election Day. They made what looked like an easy 2016 Senate run against then-Orange County Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez tighter than most observers thought it would turn out.\n\nAnd last-minute choices of the previously undecided in a few states cost her the presidency against Republican Donald Trump last fall.\n\nSo a contemplative Harris should be able to recognize a very tight race in the making and realize she just might lose – and forfeit any hope of ever becoming president.\n\nShe might even have trouble securing what figures to become the lone Democratic slot in the 2026 November runoff.\n\nYes, she leads the second-place Democrat, former Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter, by a 4-1 margin in the early polling and has even larger edges over other Democrats like former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, ex-federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, current Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state Schools Supt. Tony Thurmond and ex-state Senate President Toni Adkins.\n\nSome of them are bound to drop out of the top-of-ticket race before it gets extremely serious in late fall. But others will stick with it and – like Kounalakis, Porter and Villaraigosa – likely raise enough money to compete heavily against Harris.\n\nHistory, of course, shows that when she faces stiff competition, Harris can have problems, as when she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race in 2020 even before the first primary.\n\nSo even though Dean Jon Gould of UC Irvine’s Social Ecology program told a reporter that “The path to governor seems well-paved for Vice President Harris if she decides to run,” it ain’t necessarily so.\n\nCaruso, for one, will see these findings as extremely encouraging. Should he win a top two slot, he would likely see Harris as at least as soft a target as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, still weakened by the fact she left town when wildfire warnings were being issued before last winter’s Los Angeles area firestorms.\n\nIn debates, where Harris has never done very well, he would try to turn Harris into a pseudo-Bass, suggesting she might be a Bass clone.\n\nThis still makes a Harris entry to this race likely because of her standing as the early leader in every poll. But she’s never demonstrated an abiding interest in top California issues like homelessness or insurance company rates and performance.\n\nAll of which makes a Harris entry into this key race very much a question mark for the moment.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.","summary":"Harris might be leading gubernatorial polls, but does she really want the job&quest;","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/18/harris-might-be-leading-gubernatorial-polls-but-does-she-really-want-the-job/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LDN-L-2FIRES-0121-14-SR.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 07:33:23","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":343168852,"title":"Whatever the polls say, Kamala Harris shouldnt run for president in 2028","text":"The clock is rapidly running out on former Vice President Kamala Harris’ self-imposed deadline to issue a decision on her political future. \n\nIn the spring, Harris promised an “end of summer” decision on whether she would run for Governor of California next year, or whether she would stay out of that race in order to make another run at the White House in 2028.\n\nNow, over halfway through the summer, Harris finds herself at a crossroads: take the – likely – easy win and become the state’s 41st Governor, or instead, commit to a grueling primary process with a spot in the general election hardly guaranteed.\n\nTo that end, new polling may push Harris to give the presidency another shot, but that does not necessarily mean she should.\n\nIndeed, Echelon Insight’s July Omnibus poll shows that, among Democratic primary voters, Harris (26%) leads a 20-candidate field in an early 2028 presidential primary ballot test.\n\nAccording to the poll, Harris leads her two biggest competitors – former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and California Governor Gavin Newsom – by 15 and 16 points, respectively.\n\nViewed strictly through this poll, it may seem that Harris has a considerable advantage and possibly an inside track to represent the Democratic Party again in three years. \n\nAnd yet, it would behoove Harris and her camp to ignore this poll and instead declare her candidacy for the governorship. \n\nPut another way, despite a seemingly encouraging lead, Harris’ position atop the field almost certainly reflects name recognition more than a genuine desire for her to run for president again.\n\nDespite presenting respondents with more than 20 possible candidates, only the three mentioned above and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (6%) could be considered “household names” at the national level. \n\nMoreover, the 2028 Democratic National Convention is roughly three years away. It is extremely difficult for voters to know now who they will prefer then, thus, they often default to the familiar face.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 – analogous to right now in the 2028 presidential cycle – Gallup released a poll among Democratic primary voters. \n\nHillary Clinton (40%) was dominating the field, trailed by John Kerry (16%) and John Edwards (15%). The eventual winner – former President Barack Obama – was not even considered a serious enough contender to be included in the poll. \n\nAll of this is to say that it is entirely possible that the Democrats’ eventual nominee is not even among the list of more than 20 candidates polled by Echelon Insights. \n\nUnderscoring the necessity for Harris to discount this poll is something I discussed in these pages earlier this month. \n\nA separate 2028 poll from Emerson, reported Buttigieg (16%) leading Harris (13%). \n\nAt the time, I wrote that Emerson’s data points to a wide-open race for the party’s nomination, and Echelon’s poll showing Harris with a lead reinforces the conclusion that there is no established Democratic front runner, including Harris.\n\nFinally, were Harris to read this poll as a desire for her candidacy in 2028, its highly likely that she will confront many – or all – of the same challenges that hobbled her 2024 candidacy. \n\nBack on the national stage, voters would be reminded of Harris’ position in the previous Biden administration, which was deeply unpopular at its end. \n\nOne can easily imagine how awkward the primary would be when Harris was forced to defend the Biden administration – and her role in it – against competitors from her own party.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris struggled to separate herself from former President Biden throughout her campaign, nor was she able to truly define a wholly new platform or agenda for a Harris presidency.\n\nAnd, when Harris did take decisive stands on various policies, she was seen as either too far-left or inauthentic. \n\nTaken together, it appears that Harris’ best bet for a continued political future would be to enter the race for California Governor. \n\nShe is almost certain to emerge from the state’s jungle primary either against a much lesser-known Democrat or a Republican, against both of whom Harris would be the clear favorite. \n\nAs Governor, Harris would be able to gain experience in an executive position, remain politically relevant, and build a platform if she chose to run in 2032, when she’d only be 67 years old.\n\nIn that same vein, with the Democratic Party as a whole facing its own crossroads in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s primary win in New York City, Harris would be able to survey shifting political landscapes and decide what type of candidate she wants to be in 2032.\n\nFurther, despite California’s shift to the center on certain issues such as crime and homelessness, Harris’ more left-leaning platform would not be the same obstacle in California that it would be in a national election.\n\nUltimately, nobody – possibly even including Harris – knows what the former vice president will decide, and few could fault her for wanting a redo after the unprecedented circumstances that led to her presidential candidacy. \n\nHowever, if Harris hopes to have another shot as a truly viable candidate, her best course of action is undoubtedly to try her hand at the job in Sacramento. \n\nViewed in that light, Harris’ advisors would best serve her by convincing her that Echelon’s poll is a flash in the pan, not a sign of genuine desire for her return to the presidential conversation. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Whatever the polls say, Kamala Harris shouldnt run for president in 2028","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/18/whatever-the-polls-say-kamala-harris-shouldnt-run-for-president-in-2028/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24311777031117-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 07:32:26","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":343125272,"title":"Bucktin: 'Doddery Donald Trump forgets key fact in his rush to roast'","text":"Doddery Donald Trump publicly roasted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week, blaming Joe Biden for putting him in the job. “He’s a terrible Fed chair,” Trump fumed. “I was surprised he was appointed, surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him.” From behind the Resolute Desk, Trump slapped Powell with the nickname “Too Late”, accusing him of dragging his feet on interest rate cuts and claiming any pre-election moves were an attempt to boost Kamala Harris or Biden.

Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot last month in what Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded an act of \"targeted political violence.\"Brodkorb has been a vocal participant in Minnesota political life—including breaking with his party to endorse Democratic candidates after a long Republican tenure.Such events can have a chilling effect on political discourse and may influence perceptions of safety among political activists and former officials.What To KnowBoth surveillance footage and Brodkorb's statements indicate the suspect wore a mask and arrived on a bicycle, remaining in front of the house for four to five minutes while appearing to use a phone.The individual ignored several other trash cans on the street before seemingly targeting the one outside Brodkorb's driveway.Eagan Police Sergeant Rich Evans told The Minnesota Star Tribune that the incendiary device was \"a mortar-style firework.\" An arson investigation has been launched.Brodkorb, his wife and three children were home at the time but were not harmed.

It was what he didn't say: a single word about the lawsuit Trump had filed hours earlier accusing Hannity's boss, NewsCorp founder and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and five other defendants of defaming Trump in a Wall Street Journal report about a \"bawdy\" birthday note Trump sent to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The ContextTrump sued Murdoch, the Journal's publisher Dow Jones, NewsCorp, its CEO and two Journal reporters after the newspaper published an article saying that Trump in 2003 sent Epstein a 50th birthday letter featuring lines of typewritten text surrounded by the outline of a naked woman, complete with Trump's signature.\"Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" the letter said, according to the report.Trump railed against Murdoch and the Journal over the piece, accusing them of spreading \"defamatory lies\" about him and saying that he had \"personally\" warned Murdoch against publishing the report.The Journal's report on Trump's letter to Epstein came as the White House continues battling fallout over its handling of the investigation into Epstein's 2019 death in a New York City prison.What To KnowHannity's fealty to Trump isn't a new phenomenon and he has long been one of the president's staunchest allies in the conservative cable news sphere. But his effusive praise for the president was particularly jarring to watch in real time on Friday, just hours after Trump had slapped Murdoch and the others with a $10 billion lawsuit.Hannity acknowledged his affection for the president in his opening monologue, telling viewers: \"It's not a secret that I have been a longtime friend and supporter—we've been very transparent—of President Trump. But even I am, frankly, amazed at what he has been able to do, against all odds, in such a very short period of time.\"He went on to claim that Trump's is \"the single most consequential, transformational presidency in our lifetime.\"The president, for his part, seemed privy to what Hannity would say, teasing in a Truth Social post before the show aired: \"Everybody should watch Sean Hannity tonight. He really gets it!\"Hannity on Friday ticked through a list of Trump's measures on issues from tariffs to inflation to taxes to immigration enforcement.The prime-time star also trotted out an army of Trump's acolytes, with one commentator proclaiming: \"It's no doubt that we are in the very beginning stages of a new golden era for America. I have only one complaint: when the president was running the first time, he told me and the rest of America that we would get tired of winning.\"\"I was very doubtful that we would get tired of winning,\" the commentator, Horace Cooper, said as Hannity laughed. \"But I recently told the House speaker [Mike Johnson] we are winning so much that we only have about an hour to celebrate one victory before we move onto the next victory.\"Later in the show, Hannity interviewed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and the two discussed one of Trump's favorite theories: the \"deep state's\" effort to topple Trump's first presidency via the \"Russia hoax.\"In another segment, Hannity went after late-night TV host and frequent Trump critic Stephen Colbert, whose show will end next year after being canceled by CBS.Colbert's cancellation came after CBS' parent company, Paramount, reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a lawsuit he filed related to a 60 Minutes interview that the president claimed was deceptively edited in favor of then-Democratic nominee Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign.Trump gloated about the CBS settlement in the Truth Social post announcing his $10 billion defamation suit against Hannity's boss, Murdoch, in connection to the Journal story. But Hannity didn't mention that lawsuit, or the Journal story that prompted it, once during Friday's show.\"I want to celebrate and then celebrate again,\" he told Cooper after laying out Trump's actions during his second term in the Oval Office. \"Stop sipping your wine and just take a shot and move on to the next celebration.\"","summary":"Sean Hannity's effusive praise of Trump was outmatched by his deafening silence on the lawsuit Trump had just filed against Hannity's boss.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sean-hannity-trump-epstein-murdoch-wsj-lawsuit-2101098","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686316/sean-hannity.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a2e0aa279008a98d5a0fbe609890c1ff","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 03:10:40","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":343072158,"title":"Trump reacts to Colbert cancellation, says 'Kimmel is next'","text":"Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has blasted television network CBS for cancelling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, as the US president took to social media to revel in the news and warn, \"Kimmel is next\".\n\nStephen Colbert announced on Thursday that his late-night show has not been extended beyond the upcoming broadcast season, meaning it will end in May next year.\n\nCBS executives released a statement calling the move a \"purely financial decision\", labelling Colbert \"irreplaceable\".\n\n\"[The decision is made] against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" the statement read.\n\nFellow late-night hosts have reacted with shock and anger, with Kimmel writing on social media: \"love you Stephen.

Kevin Warsh reportedly among the top contenders. After highlighting a recent call for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate Powell for alleged perjury, Fox’s Laura Ingraham asked Fishback whether the vocal criticism of the Fed chairman “has made any difference.”\n\n“I think it has because what the president has a unique opportunity of doing on top of building this incredible economy that works for everyone is he can actually appoint a Fed chair a lot sooner than everyone expects,” Fishback said. “Now markets, as an investor, they are an expectations game. So when you get a Fed chair, even if they don’t take office until May of next year, if you appoint a Fed chair in the early fall, the market will listen to them as opposed to Jerome Powell.”\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna announced on X that she is referring Powell to the DOJ to investigate alleged perjury related to the Fed’s more than $2 billion headquarters renovation project. The move comes after calls for Powell to be investigated began in July, with Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte calling on Congress to launch the investigation. RELATED: ‘The Way The Fed Operates Is All Wrong’: Steve Forbes Tells Fed Not To Neglect ‘Its Sole Focus’\n\nSoon after calls for an investigation into Powell’s $2.5 billion headquarters renewal project, Trump reposted an article about the issue on Truth Social and wrote that Powell should “resign immediately.”\n\n“This is the same Jerome Powell that cut rates by 50 points right before the election in a desperate attempt to Kamala Harris to help her. Of course, it didn’t work. President Trump won a historic landslide. But now he refuses to raise rates even though inflation is lower today than it was then,” Fishback added.\n\nTensions between Powell and the president have grown as the central bank has yet to lower interest rates, despite Trump’s calls to do so while pointing to falling inflation.\n\nSince Trump’s announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs against a handful of countries, Powell has voiced concerns about the uncertainty they could cause. On July 1, Powell told a panel that the U.S. central bank would have lowered rates by now if Trump had not imposed the tariffs.\n\n“So the president is using his First Amendment rights. He’s calling out the Fed chair for being intransigent, for being too late. But my recommendation to the president would be to appoint a Fed chair far earlier than anyone expects so ‘Too Late’s’ voice can be totally nullified,” Fishback said, referring to a nickname Trump gave Powell.\n\nPrior to Luna’s referral, Powell on Monday requested a review of the project, asking Fed IG Michael Horowitz to investigate the costs and any other matters deemed appropriate, according to Axios.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That's what happens when you speak truth to power in a country where the power don't want to hear the truth.\" He also raged at the Trump administration as an authoritarian regime trying to shut down dissenting views. \"This is textbook authoritarian rule,\" he said. \"‘Target your critics,’ ‘centralize power in a few hands,’ ‘intimidate through punishment or removal.’ And you know what that usually does? Shuts people the F up. Okay? Tightens control over public discourse. Sends a message to all media outlets that criticism of Trump could cost you access, approval, editorial control, or your job. This is what authoritarian regimes do. They weaponize legal systems to punish dissent and control messaging.\" LATE-NIGHT DNCTV? COLBERT, KIMMEL FUNDRAISE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN Charlamagne went on to claim that \"The Late Show\" has continually had strong ratings and suddenly deciding to end it after political criticism sends a clear message. \"It becomes a warning. ‘Speak out and we will silence you.’ That is textbook authoritarian strategy. Okay? Because it deters further criticism through the fear of retaliation. Okay? ‘Make America North Korea.’ ‘Make America China.’ ‘Make America Russia,’\" he said. \"That's where we are if we live in a country where there is strategic silence within corporate or media power structures to limit dissent. Okay, when that happens - well, it's already happened! We are fully under authoritarian rule.\" \"This is not just a media story. It's a free speech funeral in slow motion,\" he added. CBS said in its statement announcing the cancellation that it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" adding, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\" Reports indicate \"The Late Show\" was losing CBS $40 million a year. However, liberal critics, including several top Democrats, have expressed outrage towards CBS, insisting Colbert's show was canceled for political reasons. White House Spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital, \"The simple reality is that Stephen Colbert’s overdone and unoriginal ‘comedy’ schtick blasting President Trump and Republicans every night is just not that funny or entertaining.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Trump celebrated \"The Late Show\" cancellation on Truth Social. \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,\" he said. \"His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.\" Fox News Channel's \"Gutfeld!\" has surged to become late-night's highest-rated program. In the second quarter of 2025, the show, hosted by Fox star Greg Gutfeld, notched 3 million viewers and 365,000 in the 25-54 age demographic at the 10 p.m. ET hour. In addition to routing cable news competition, \"Gutfeld!\" outpaced all broadcast and late-night television, including \"The Late Show\" and other such established programs as Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show,\" ABC’s \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and NBC’s \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to Paramount and did not receive an immediate response.","summary":"Radio host Charlamagne labeled CBS and Paramount the &quot;Donkey of the Day&quot; for canceling Colbert&apos;s show, suggesting it&apos;s part of Trump&apos;s plan to silence critics and control media.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/charlamagne-accuses-trump-trying-make-america-north-korea-engaging-authoritarian-rule-media","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/charlamagne-speaks-on-show.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 01:10:01","author":"Alexa Moutevelis,Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexa Moutevelis","Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":343277544,"title":"Man accused of stockpiling bombs, using Biden photo for target practice, pleads guilty","text":"A Virginia man pleaded guilty Friday in a federal case that accused him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history and of using then-President Joe Biden’s photo for target practice.\n\nBrad Spafford pleaded guilty in federal court in Norfolk to possession of an unregistered short barrel rifle and possession of an unregistered destructive device, according to court documents.

Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there’s no denying the economics were not working in Colbert’s favor.\n\nThe network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre.\n\nThe television industry’s declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they’ve turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it’s clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert’s show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global’s president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks’ problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount’s decision to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount’s $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration’s approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York’s attorney general into whether Colbert’s cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS’ decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert’s show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy’s most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn’t just the end of a show. It’s the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert’s demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert’s contract, celebrated the show’s upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers’ late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live,” told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount’s Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He’s hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I’m not doing this anymore?’ It’s a very complicated thing … I’m not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nAP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

It won a Peabody Award in 2021.\n\nDavid Letterman began hosting The Late Show in 1993.

Stewart works for Comedy Central, also owned by Paramount, making the two comics the most visible internal critics of the US$16 million settlement that was announced on July 1.\n\nA handful of media reports in the past two weeks have speculated that Skydance boss David Ellison might try to curry favor with Trump by eliminating the comics’ jobs if the sale is approved.

The Late Show was one of CBS's top shows, attracting an average audience of 2.57m viewers in 2024.\n\nIts ratings actually improved under Colbert, particularly after it began skewering the Trump administration - the host is one of the president's most vocal critics.\n\nAs a result, some have questioned whether the show's cancellation has anything to do with political pressure.\n\nIts closure comes after CBS parent company Paramount settled with US President Donald Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nPresident Trump said the way his presidential rival's answer to a question about Israel was presented on two different platforms made her look more favourable to viewers. \n\nCBS noted at the time its settlement did not include a statement of apology or regret.

Stephen Colbert's CBS cancellation raises troubling questions","text":"The shocking cancellation of \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" is a sign that time is running out for one of TV's most beloved formats. The late-night talk show was invented in the 1950s as a way for networks to own their own programming rather than have it provided by sponsors. Now, amid shrinking audiences and a politically turbulent climate for free speech, the familiar desk-and-sofa tableau is in serious trouble. CBS announced Thursday that the upcoming 2025-26 TV season for \"The Late Show\" will be its last. Executives blamed the cancellation on financial concerns felt across all network late-night shows. Last year, NBC cut \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" to four nights a week while \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" cut its live band. Still, industry veterans were bewildered by the timing. It's hard to imagine Paramount Global executives did not anticipate blowback from announcing the move days after Colbert blasted the company's $16-million settlement with President Trump over CBS News' “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Colbert described the deal as a bribe during his Monday monologue. Every move the company makes is now under a microscope as it tries to get the Federal Communications Commission, led by Trump acolyte Brendan Carr, to approve an $8-billion merger with Skydance Media. Canceling the most watched late-night program hosted by one of Trump’s harshest critics will draw even more scrutiny. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), weighed in on X shortly after taping an interview on Colbert's program. \"If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better,\" Schiff posted. The Writers Guild of America also raised questions, saying the cancellation appeared to be a case of \"sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump Administration.\" One factor contradicting the theory is that Colbert, who has another year on his contract, will remain on the air through May. His commentaries have never been restrained by network executives over his 10-year run and that situation is not expected to change in his final season. The poor optics may be a matter of contractual timing. Paramount Global had to complete the deals with writer-producer teams in July for the upcoming \"Late Show\" season, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to comment. Those deals typically run for a full year, but with the company’s intention to cancel the program — decided several months ago — the contracts being offered only ran through May, which tipped off the network’s plans. When Colbert learned of the cancellation decision on Wednesday, he made the call to inform his staff and his audience the next day. “Late Show” is said to be losing somewhere in the tens of millions of dollars a year as younger viewers have fled. Since 2022, the program has lost 20% of its audience in the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49 age group, according to Nielsen data. Ad revenue for “Late Show” in 2024 was $57.7 million, according to iSpot.tv, down from $75.7 million in 2022. \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" on NBC and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on ABC have also seen significant declines over that period. CBS has already given up on one hour of late night due to financial pressure. Two years ago, it canceled its 12:35 a.m. “Late Late Show” program hosted by James Corden because it was losing money. CBS came up with a lower-cost replacement with “After Midnight,” but that ended after two seasons as its host Taylor Tomlinson decided not to renew her deal. CBS is replacing it with a syndicated program, “Comics Unleashed,” from Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios in an arrangement that will cost the network nothing. Still, Paramount Global will find itself facing questions about why CBS did not seek ways to reduce the production costs of the program instead of just pulling the plug. If CBS decides to continue programming the 11:30 p.m. slot, it will be hard-pressed to approach the same audience levels that Colbert attracted. CBS is giving up a popular culture touchstone, although in the current fragmented media landscape, the days of such hosts having massive sway over a large audience have passed. Media analyst Rich Greenfield wrote that legacy media companies investing in expensive original programming outside of sports and news may be ill-advised as viewers continue to flock to streaming. \"Ending 'The Late Show' is the tip of the iceberg with massive programming and personnel cuts to come,\" he said. For decades, late-night TV served as the brand identity of the broadcast networks. Jack Paar was the witty conversationalist that made Middle America feel like it was invited to a sophisticated Manhattan cocktail party. His successor, Johnny Carson, became a trendsetter in the 1960s, defining male coolness. He had his own clothing line. His dry monologue was often a gauge of the country’s political mood. An invitation to take a seat next to Carson after a stand-up set turbocharged the careers of many top comedians. CBS was unable to compete with Carson for decades, trying and failing with the likes of Merv Griffin and Pat Sajak. When David Letterman became available after he was bypassed for the “Tonight” job at NBC, he came to CBS in 1993 and made the network a serious contender. Letterman’s offbeat, sardonic brand of humor also gave a layer of hipness to CBS, which had long had a reputation for stodginess. \"Late Show With David Letterman\" helped make late-night network TV a financial bonanza. While the proliferation of cable networks was cutting into audience share in the 1990s and early 2000s, the late-night habit still thrived, especially with its ability to reach young men, the most elusive demographic for TV advertisers. As a result, late-night hosts became the highest-paid stars in the business. Letterman and Jay Leno were both earning in the neighborhood of $30 million a year until networks started trimming salaries 10 years ago. But technology chipped away at the late-night talk show habit. When DVRs reached critical mass, consumers started to catch up with their favorite prime-time shows during the late-night hours. The most painful blow came from social media. While online clips of the late-night shows draw hundreds of millions of viewing minutes, that doesn't generate the same kind of ad revenue as TV. They also make showing up at 11:35 p.m. every night pointless. “The networks cut up all of the best parts of the show, and by the end of the night you can see all of them on social media,” said one former network executive who oversaw late-night programs. \"There’s no reason to even DVR it.” Prime-time programs add millions of viewers through on-demand streaming after they air on the broadcast networks. Topical late-night shows don't have the same shelf life. While politics have long been an important element of late-night comedy, the emergence of Trump's political career in 2015 — and his ability to drive ratings and the national conversation — made him the dominant topic. Where Carson, Letterman and Leno skewered both sides of the political spectrum, Trump’s ability to provide endless comedy fodder on a daily basis made him an easy, entertaining and ultimately one-sided target. For years it worked. Ratings for Colbert — who made his bones on Comedy Central satirizing a reactionary talk show host — languished for the first two years after he replaced Letterman. Audience levels and ad rates surged in 2017 once Trump came into office and became Colbert's muse. But the country has become more politically polarized in recent years and the relentless lampooning of Trump has created a lane for “Gutfeld!,” a nightly Fox News talk show with a conservative bent. While not technically a late-night show (it airs at 10 p.m. Eastern), “Gutfeld!” drew an average of 3 million viewers in the second quarter of 2025 according to Nielsen and has grown 20% since 2022. The young men that used to make late night an advertiser magnet are now turning to podcasters such as Joe Rogan and others who can speak without the restraint of broadcast TV standards.","summary":"The end of the 'Late Show' franchise is a major blow for a once-beloved TV format, which has lost relevance and advertising dollars.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-07-18/is-late-night-dead-stephen-colberts-cbs-cancellation-raises-questions","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/069fa61/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5644x3763+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F2c%2Fd6b728194d9f8b178ac267b2b9e3%2Fgettyimages-124714377","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:57:08","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":343047986,"title":"CBS canned ‘The Late Show’ over tens of millions in financial losses annually — not Stephen Colbert’s politics: sources","text":"CBS brass say they pulled the plug on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” because of its punishing losses — pegged between $40 million and $50 million a year — and claim politics had nothing to do with it, The Post has learned.\n\nThe 61-year-old host got canned just days after he took a dig at the Tiffany Network over its $16 million settlement with Donald Trump over a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris as the network’s parent Paramount negotiates with the Trump administration regulatory approval for its $8 billion sale to independent studio Skydance.\n\n“I am offended, and I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said of the truce in his Monday night monologue. \n\n“But just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\n‘Gets no advertising’\n\nBut scathing jokes at the expense of CBS brass wasn’t the problem, according to insiders. \n\nInstead, the network’s bosses could no longer stomach the fact that Colbert has been plagued with an increasingly dire shortage of advertisers.\n\nThat’s despite Colbert’s No, 1 ratings in his time slot and his status as a key face for the Tiffany Network. \n\nIn the end, Paramount’s co-CEO George Cheeks decided to kill the show, sources said.\n\n“Colbert gets no advertising and late night is a tough spot,” said a person with direct knowledge of CBS’s decision. \n\n“Colbert might be No. 1, but who watches late night TV anymore?”\n\nSome Democrats voiced suspicion, citing the host’s left-wing leanings and CBS owner Paramount’s urgent need to gain an OK from the Trump administration for the merger with Skydance, the Hollywood studio behind the “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n\n“CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,” lefty Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on X.\n\n“America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”\n\nSkydance CEO David Ellison is the son of Donald Trump pal and tech billionaire Larry Ellison. \n\nAs The Post first reported, CBS just paid $16 million to Trump and has agreed to run millions of dollars more in MAGA-friendly ads to settle the president’s lawsuit alleging that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited its 2024 interview with Kamala Harris to make her look better.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, celebrated Colbert’s canning in a Friday morning post on Truth Social.\n\n“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote. \n\n“His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!”\n\nFervent denials\n\nBut despite Ellison’s Trump ties, sources said Skydance and its partners at Redbird Capital — the private equity firm that will help run CBS once the deal is cleared — only heard the news of the show’s impending cancellation just before it was announced late Thursday.\n\n“Skydance had nothing to do with this,” one person close to the decision said. \n\n“Colbert loses $40 million to $50 million a year, so George Cheeks just decided to pull the plug.”\n\nThe show’s dominance in its time slot belies sharp declines in viewership as younger viewers move away from traditional TV.\n\n“The Late Show” boasts nearly 2 million total viewers and 200,000 viewers in the key 25-24 “demo” — making it No. 1 in its time slot.\n\nNevertheless, that’s a sharp decline versus the numbers it racked up in its heyday. \n\nThe ad data firm Guideline estimates that CBS’s late-night shows together drew $220 million in ad revenue in 2024 — just half the $439 million they drew in 2018.\n\nRedBird’s Jeff Shell, the former head of NBCUniversal who will run the network once the deal is done, has been crunching the numbers and finding that CBS is a “melting ice cube” with its losses and cost overruns, a source said.\n\n‘Truth-based’ turn\n\nThe plan is to enhance CBS Sports and invest in “truth-based” news at a network that conservatives have long ripped for its alleged liberal bias.\n\nA Paramount spokesman declined to comment and would not deny that massive losses were tied to the show’s cancellation.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit was impeding the approval of the deal by the Trump Federal Communications Commission. \n\nThe Post has learned that Ellison is now telling people that with the lawsuit settled the Skydance-Paramount deal will get FCC approval by mid-August.\n\nWhile Ellison is predicting imminent regulatory approval, it will come at a cost: FCC chairman Brendan Carr is likely to demand conditions to remedy what he believes is left-wing news bias in programming that violates agency “public interest” rules that govern local broadcasting as opposed to cable.","summary":"CBS brass say they pulled the plug on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” because of its punishing losses and claim politics had nothing to do with it, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/media/cbs-ending-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-is-more-than-just-a-financial-loss/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-07lq6w3ei-1752877928075.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752863554&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wbjbpKo6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:54:55","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":343042740,"title":"Jon Stewart Admits to Fears About the Fate of “The Daily Show” amid Outrage Over “Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Cancellation","text":"Jon Stewart is thinking about the fate of his own show amid the news of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert's cancellation.\n\n Hours before Stephen Colbert revealed during the July 17 taping of The Late Show that next year would be its last, Stewart weighed in on the future of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, given it also owned by Paramount, CBS' parent company.\n\n Days before the cancellation was announced, Colbert called out Paramount for the $16 million settlement made with President Donald Trump on The Late Show, but in a statement, CBS said the cancellation is \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night\" and \"not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\n Paramount is in the middle of a merger with Skydance Media, which needs the Trump administration's approval to complete. \n\n When Stewart was asked about what he foresees for The Daily Show if the Skydance merger goes through with Paramount, he was candid about how unsure he is. \n\n \"Boy, that’s a good question,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we haven’t heard anything from them. They haven’t called me and said like, ‘Don’t get too comfortable in that office, Stewart!'\"\n\n Stewart, 62, then joked, \"I’ve been kicked out of s------ establishments than that. We’ll land on our feet.\"\n\n On a more serious note, he said that he \"honestly don't know\" what the show's fate will be. \"I’d like to believe that... Like, without The Daily Show, Comedy Central is kind of like muzak at this point. I think we’re the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park.\"\n\n Stewart would \"like to think we bring enough value\" to the channel, \"but that may not be their consideration,\" he admitted. \"I just don't know.\"\n\n Stewart's comments on the topic came a week after he had 60 Minutes alum Steve Kroft on The Daily Show to talk about Trump's settlement. \n\n On the July 7 episode, Kroft, who retired in 2019 after 30 seasons on 60 Minutes, commented on Paramount's $16 million settlement made with President Donald Trump, who had alleged that CBS' 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n “I think there’s a lot of fear,” Kroft said about the environment at 60 Minutes following the lawsuit. “Fear of losing their job, fear of what’s happening to the country, fear of losing the First Amendment. All of those things.”\n\n He also called the settlement a \"shakedown\" and that \"some people call it extortion.\"\n\n CBS' full statement about Colbert's cancellation emphasized the show's success in the category, seemingly anticipating speculation about whether it had to do with the Paramount settlement. \n\n \"Our admiration, affection, and respect for the talents of Stephen Colbert and his incredible team made this agonizing decision even more difficult,\" the statement said. \"Stephen has taken CBS late night by storm with cutting-edge comedy, a must-watch monologue and interviews with leaders in entertainment, politics, news and newsmakers across all areas.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n \"The show has been #1 in late night for nine straight seasons,\" the statement continued. \"Stephen's comedy resonates daily across digital and social media; and the broadcast is a staple of the nation’s zeitgeist.\"","summary":"Stewart weighed in on the Comedy Central show's potential future on his latest podcast episode","url":"https://people.com/jon-stewart-on-fears-about-the-fate-of-the-daily-show-amid-the-late-show-drama-11775263","image":"https://people.com/thmb/eQIDkv4xGrsfOuHCmnohOBHGoCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x349:752x351)/jon-stewart-FYC-Event-2025-stephen-colbert-snl50-071825-8987d809f9bd4527a106d657d30318b2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:19:21","author":"Julia Moore","authors":["Julia Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":343040424,"title":"‘No good answers’: Trump facing real ‘danger’","text":"A tumultuous week hasn’t been helped by the US president calling his supporters who favour releasing all documents related to Epstein as “weaklings” who have fallen for a “Democrat hoax”.\n\nBut a US political watcher has told news.com.au that Mr Trump himself helped stoke the flames of his current predicament, having previously promoted wild rumours around Epstein. That had “activated” a group that were not about to simply agree there was nothing to see after all. \n\nThere was a real “danger to Trump,” Professor Robert Rowland of the University of Kansas said.\n\n“Trump has been very adept at using conspiracy theories to support his message.\n\n“And on the Epstein conspiracy theory he, and others, have not been constrained in the least by facticity.”\n\nIn addition, a Republican strategist has said Mr Trump has “no good answers” for those clamouring for more files to be released.\n\nA recent poll found two thirds of Americans think the government is “covering up evidence” it has about Epstein. \n\nThe political crisis emerged on July 7 when the FBI announced that as part of its “commitment to transparency” an “exhaustive review” had been concluded into documents related to Epstein. But “no further disclosure” would be “appropriate or warranted”.\n\nIn addition, the FBI declared Epstein had committed suicide after all. There was no rumoured foul play.\n\nSo that was that. \n\nNo more Epstein files would see the light of day. The fabled “client list,” which Attorney-General Pam Bondi herself had said was on her desk, didn’t actually exist. She said she misspoke and just meant some general Epstein files.\n\nLots of reasonable explanations were given for the documents remaining private. They included details of victims, child sex abuse material or just the usual legal issues. \n\nMr Trump said it was time to move on and urged people to “not waste time and energy on … somebody that no one cares about”.\n\nThe problem is many in the MAGA-sphere do care about Epstein. They care a lot.\n\nYouGov research, released last week, showed 75 per cent of Republicans want the Government to release all the documents it has about the Epstein case and 50 per cent of the same voters think a cover up is occurring.\n\nHigh profile commentators who lean Trump are also underwhelmed. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is close to Mr Trump, has urged more “transparency”. Even Trump’s own FBI deputy director Don Bongino, a conservative podcaster, was reportedly furious at how the investigation wrapped up.\n\nTrump’s multiple Epstein references\n\nOver the years, Mr Trump hasn’t been shy in hyping scuttlebutt about Epstein’s life, death and the people who knew him. People who knew Epstein included, of course, Mr Trump. But there has never been any claims of wrongdoing against Mr Trump and the pair ended up falling out.\n\nIn 2019, Mr Trump retweeted a post alleging Bill Clinton was involved in Epstein’s death. In 2020, he suggested it was a possibility Epstein may have been killed in jail. \n\nThen, on the campaign trail last year, he said – several times – that a future President Trump would absolutely declassify the so-called Epstein files.\n\nThat helped keep Epstein fresh in the thoughts of many of his supporters. This fuelled theories of a “deep state” and that a host of high-profile people would eventually be accused of heinous crimes. \n\nUndoubtedly, to many in the MAGA movement, it was hoped those famous names would be political foes, proving that they weren’t just mere opponents but evildoers too.\n\nProf Rowland told news.com.au that Mr Trump was adept at using conspiracy theories to galvanise his supporters. \n\n“His use of the ridiculous ‘birther’ theory (that Barack Obama was not a US citizen and so could not be president) is probably the best example”.\n\nBut the US president has now found himself in an “interesting and confusing” situation, the academic said.\n\nIn February, the Justice Department released what it called the “first phase” of previously unseen Epstein documents. But there was little new information in them. \n\nNow in office, Mr Trump may have discovered that, despite the hype, there wasn’t much to the rumours beyond what was already in the public realm about Epstein. \n\nBut it’s hard to close that Pandora’s box he helped to prise open. Those who, for years, have believed Epstein had dirt on scores of public figures won’t be easily persuaded that was never the case. \n\n‘Trump doesn’t have good answers’\n\nRepublican strategist Alex Conant, of Firehouse Strategies, told the US’ National Public Radio that there had been a “real mismanagement of expectations with (Mr Trump’s) base” over what could actually be delivered on Epstein once he was in power.\n\n“Trump doesn’t have good answers because … they have released everything on this that they are legally allowed to release and their hands are really tied moving forward. \n\n“And yet it’s not enough for … his opponents.\n\n“His supporters are fixated on this decade-old scandal that he can’t ever make them happy on and it’s deeply frustrating to him,” Mr Conant said.\n\nDemocrat ‘scam’\n\nProf Rowland said it was “odd” that the administration didn’t simply release more files, “and claim victory, regardless of what the files actually say”.\n\nThat may now be happening. On Thursday, a clearly angry Mr Trump said that due to the “ridiculous amount of publicity” the Epstein crisis was creating, he had told Attorney-General Bondi to release any “pertinent grand jury testimony”. \n\nA grand jury is group of citizens who determine whether there is a likely case that can be taken to a full court jury. The court process to release these documents related to Epstein could take some time, however.\n\nMr Trump said the furore was a “Democrat scam”. That echoed comments he made earlier in the week when he unleashed on social media claiming what he termed “past supporters” had fallen for a “hoax” perpetuated by the Democratic Party “hook, line and sinker” that was all just “bull***t”.\n\n“As a rule, attacking supporters is a terrible way to maintain credibility,” said Prof Rowland. \n\n“Barack Obama was sharply criticised (during the 2024 election campaign) when he told black men that they needed to do more to support Kamala Harris. \n\n“Blaming Democrats for the controversy appears to be a transparent attempt to change the subject.\n\n“That it strains credibility is extremely generous,” he said.\n\n“It also does not seem to have mollified a large group on the right that apparently has bought into the Epstein conspiracy theory.”\n\nProf Rowland said it was possible Mr Trump’s rhetoric over recent days might simply be “poorly planned,” and symptomatic of his sometimes chaotic messaging. Alternatively, he might be trying to “bury the controversy because of something in the files”.\n\nProf Rowland concedes that in itself is pure speculation. But by keeping the remaining files under wraps, that’s exactly what some angry Trump voters have speculated about.\n\nOn Thursday, US newspaper The Wall Street Journal published a 2003 birthday card to Epstein signed from “Donald”. Mr Trump has been adamant the card was not from him and is “fake”. There is no suggestion of any nefarious activity on Mr Trump’s apart.\n\n‘Activated’\n\nUndoubtedly, Mr Trump is good at changing the subject. One big wild announcement and the hope may be the Epstein energy will fade.\n\n“I think Trump will be able to tamp down the controversy with most of his supporters, because they are focused on their own economic situation,” Prof Rowland said. \n\n“But the situation is different for the online and much more engaged MAGA right. \n\n“Bondi and Trump both activated this group with their earlier comments about Epstein and conspiracy theories are common in the information ecosystem of this group. \n\n“The danger for Trump is that the online MAGA right plays a crucial role for him in amplifying his message,” he said. \n\n“Strong arguments are not going to change their minds.","summary":"Donald Trump is now facing a real “danger” from the MAGA base, political watchers have said, as he struggles to close a Pandora’s box he helped open.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/no-good-answers-trump-facing-real-danger/news-story/853dced7d03cb6c362166c09e6561802?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9ee6e49c3a3a15a288eee6a1823a15c7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:13:42","author":"Benedict Brook In The Us","authors":["Benedict Brook In The Us"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":343045020,"title":"Did money or politics cause Colbert cancellation? Either way, the economics are tough for TV (Entertainment)","text":"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert’s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor.\n\nThe network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre.\n\nThe television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they've turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert's demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,\" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.","summary":"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s late-night comedy show is financial, not political.

But perhaps it’s they who live in a bubble, unaware of the one they helped inflate.\n\nMatthew Yglesias recently posted, “We need a bipartisan initiative to get people to leave the house.”\n\nHe’s not wrong. In 2019, 67% of Americans had a so-called third space — places such as churches, community centers, or bowling leagues. Today, that number is 54% and falling. Add smartphones, social atomization, and chronically online subcultures, and you get a generation more alienated than any in modern history.\n\nThis is nothing new. Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone documented the steady withdrawal from civil society decades ago. But Gen Z is the first generation to grow up almost entirely within the ruins. \n\nThe result? A kind of digital Sturm und Drang: inward, self-critical, and jaded — especially among young men. Teenagers and young adults build sprawling inner worlds but lack tangible communities. As Jessica Grose of the New York Times noted, “Gen Z-ers are more trusting of their peers and what they can see and build themselves.” They crave authenticity — but find only abstraction.\n\nSo when the choice in 2024 came down to the bureaucratic blandness of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s progressivism or Trump’s blunt, populist appeals, Gen Z went with the latter, not because they’re all ready for a theocracy but because they’re desperate for something that feels rooted in reality.\n\nZoomers, in fact, aren’t interested in owning the libs so much as they’re interested in owning something, anything — a house, a belief, or a sense of belonging. \n\nThey long for something from which to plant roots. \n\nImagine: You’re in your early 20s. You’ve been told you’ll own nothing, condone everything, and like it. Your adolescence was a blur of virtual school and political dysfunction. You’re marooned in suburbia with no skills, no mentors, and no rituals. Why wouldn’t one turn to tradition and venerate the enduring?\n\nThomas Jefferson believed that a healthy democracy depended on spiritually and physically competent citizens. In an era of hypercapitalism, sterile institutions, and moral confusion, Gen Z is simply trying to become that again — spiritually and physically capable, grounded.\n\nNow, this isn’t the dawn of some red-tinted theocracy. But it’s not a blip either. It’s a sustained cultural pushback. And if liberal elites continue to treat it as a psychological defect or an algorithmic error, the backlash may only deepen and widen.\n\nGen Z isn’t broken, not in the slightest. They’re simply rationally responding to a broken world, hoping for grace and community. Can anyone really blame them?","summary":"In an Atlantic piece, psychologist Jean Twenge asked a serious question: &#8220;Why are the kids all right-wing?” She argued that the perceived Generation Z “red wave” that characterized President Donald Trump&#8216;s rise to the White House was merely temporary.

Either way, the economics are tough for TV","text":"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert’s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor.\n\nThe network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre.\n\nThe television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\n Once a draw for young men, now they've turned away \n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\n Trump celebrates Colbert's demise \n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,\" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nAP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

Susan Collins’ approval rating has fallen amid a tense summer session where she repeatedly broke away from her party and President Donald Trump on multiple crucial votes.\n\nThe results were released by Morning Consult as a part of its quarterly poll of senators’ approval ratings, and it shows the favorability of the longtime Maine senator, 72, to be in a downward trend. The moderate Republican has said she intends to run for reelection in 2026. (RELATED: Why 3 Republican Senators Voted Against Trump’s Megabill)\n\nA total of 54% of Mainers disapprove of Collins’ job performance, marking a high point for her disapproval in the Morning Consult survey’s eight-year history. Only 38% of voters in the Pine Tree State approve of the senator’s performance in office.\n\nThe Morning Consult survey from the fourth quarter of 2024 by contrast shows that 47% of Collins’ constituents approved of the senator and 44% disapproved. This marked a slight decline from the third quarter of 2024 when 50% of Collins’ constituents approved of her job performance and 42% disapproved, according to the Morning Consult’s poll at the time.\n\nA Collins spokesperson pointed to higher approval ratings in a Pan Atlantic Research poll when reached by the Daily Caller News Foundation. The poll was conducted in mid-May and surveyed 840 likely Maine voters, finding 49% of respondents viewed her favorably, while only 45% viewed her unfavorably.\n\nThe decline of Collins’ approval ratings in the Morning Consult survey comes after she opposed Trump on key elements of his agenda.\n\n I strongly support extending the tax relief for families and small businesses. My vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes. — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) July 1, 2025 \n\nCollins was one of three GOP senators to vote “no” on Trump’s “one big, beautiful” bill which the president signed into law on July 4 — after the Morning Consult survey was conducted — citing concerns over the bill’s Medicaid reforms. Amid the series of votes leading up to the final vote to pass the bill, Collins sponsored a measure to raise taxes on millionaires in an effort to boost the funding for rural hospitals. The amendment would have applied to those making over $25 million a year, or couples who have over $50 million in combined income.\n\nThe White House is reportedly having discussions about replacements for Collins should she decline to seek reelection — although she currently does not face any well-known primary challengers. Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, has yet to announce a formal reelection campaign, but said Tuesday she is planning to run in 2026 and is encouraged by her strong fundraising results.\n\nCollins waited to announce her successful 2020 reelection bid until December 2019. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is already running ads for Collins, and a super PAC backing her has raised $5.6 million in the first half of the year. Collins currently has $5 million in cash on hand and has raised a total of $6 million according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nThe senator’s stocked war chest positions her well in a general election in Democratic-leaning Maine. Collins won her most recent reelection bid in 2020 against Democrat Sara Gideon by 9 percentage points — despite Joe Biden winning the state by the same margin. Maine is currently the only state which voted for failed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024 and has a Republican senator.\n\nJason Savage, Executive Director of Maine GOP, told the DCNF Collins has been doing a “tremendous job” and said her work has touched every community throughout the state— something voters won’t forget when it comes to the 2026 midterms.\n\n“There’s generally broad support within our committee and elected officials here,” Savage said of Collins’ approval in Maine. “I think a lot of it gets blown out of proportion in the national press.”\n\nSavage said part of Collins’ allure to voters across Maine is her capability to be upfront about the politics of Washington. Her willingness to explain the reasoning behind her votes as well, as the policy behind them, drives her reputation of accessibility.\n\n“If Gideon or [Independent Maine Sen. Angus] King aren’t answering the phones, voters know that Collins will,” Savage said.\n\nCurrently declared Democratic Senate candidates in Maine include David Costello, the party’s 2024 Senate nominee who served as acting secretary of Maryland’s Department of the Environment, and Jordan Wood who was the chief of staff to former Democratic California Rep.

Trump had claimed that CBS News misleadingly edited an interview with Kamala Harris last fall during the presidential campaign.\n\nCiting the California state senate’s decision in May to launch an inquiry into Paramount’s $16m settlement with Trump as precedent, the unions said: “Given Paramount’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that The Late Show’s cancelation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nIt continued: “Cancelations are part of the business, but a corporation terminating a show in bad faith due to explicit or implicit political pressure is dangerous and unacceptable in a democratic society. Paramount’s decision comes against a backdrop of relentless attacks on a free press by President Trump, through lawsuits against CBS and ABC, threatened litigation of media organizations with critical coverage, and the unconscionable defunding of PBS and NPR.”\n\nThe unions called on James to launch an investigation into Paramount, saying that she is “no stranger to prosecuting Trump for illegal business practices”.\n\n“We call on our elected leaders to hold those responsible to account, to demand answers about why this beloved program was canceled and to assure the public that Colbert and his writers were not censored due to their views or the whims of the president,” the WGA added.\n\nA spokesperson for James’s office said the NYAG office is monitoring the situation.\n\nThe cancellation comes after Colbert – who has long been a critic of Trump on his show – called Paramount’s settlement a “big fat bribe” on air on Monday.\n\n“As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended … I don’t know if anything – anything – will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16m would help,” he said.\n\nEchoing Colbert’s disapproval, Jon Stewart, who works for Comedy Central – which is also owned by Paramount – condemned the deal on air last week, calling it “shameful”.\n\nHe added: “I would assume internally, this is devastating to the people who work in a place that pride themselves on contextual, good journalism?”\n\nFollowing Paramount’s announcement, numerous lawmakers have weighed in on the cancellation, casting skepticism at the company.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren wrote on X: “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery.”\n\nSimilarly, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said: “CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.”\n\nIn a statement on Thursday evening, CBS executives said that the decision to cancel the show was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night”, adding that it was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount”.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the WGAE for comment.","summary":"Writers Guild of America requests New York attorney general investigate ‘potential wrongdoing’ after shock cancellation\n\nThe Writers Guild of America has called on New York state officials to launch an investigation into Paramount following its sudden decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement issued on Friday, the Writers Guild of America East and the Writers Guild of America West asked the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, to investigate Paramount over “potential wrongdoing” after the company announced the cancellation of the Late Show on Thursday.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/writers-guild-stephen-colbert-investigation","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46062be8fc5198a710d8bb1373e69d1bae8bfa72/418_0_4164_3333/master/4164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 21:20:23","author":"Maya Yang","authors":["Maya Yang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":343044480,"title":"You Should Absolutely Be Furious About What’s Happening With Stephen Colbert","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAt the beginning of his Thursday night broadcast, Stephen Colbert forced a sad smile as he addressed the audience with some grim news. “Before we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night,” intoned the veteran comedian. “Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May, and—”\n\nThe studio spectators cut him off with a loud, extended chorus of boos, as Colbert appeared to vacillate between laughing and choking up. “Yeah, I share your feelings!” he gingerly continued. “It’s not just the end of our show, but it’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced.” Another string of boos hit, before Colbert raised his hands to add another point. “I do wanna say, the folks at CBS have been great partners,” the host declared, expressing gratitude to his staffers and viewers and prompting them to cheer for the next 10 months The Late Show will remain on air—its very last, as a capper to the franchise that David Letterman kicked off in 1993.\n\nLeft conspicuously unthanked: Paramount, the corporation that Colbert has called home for two decades. Also unmentioned: his Monday monologue, in which he’d called his parent company’s notorious legal settlement with President Donald Trump “a big fat bribe.” But it hardly escaped anyone’s notice that The Late Show’s cancellation had happened the same week that Colbert spent three minutes of his show picking apart Paramount’s refusal to defend CBS, in court, from Trump’s ridiculous lawsuit against 60 Minutes. Nor was it all that believable that Colbert’s bosses would suddenly drop one of their biggest and most beloved celebrities without some more unseemly objectives in mind.\n\nLast October, then-candidate Trump’s team baselessly accused 60 Minutes’ editorial team of editing the show’s interview with Kamala Harris to tilt the election in her favor. The storied newsmagazine’s anchors and staffers later warned viewers, on the show itself, that the constitutional right to a free and fair press had been undermined by Paramount’s planned merger with the entertainment firm Skydance. The latter company is owned by the son of tech mogul and Trump pal Larry Ellison—who had himself invested not only in this merger, but in one of Trump’s A.I. initiatives. Paramount needed the Federal Communications Commission’s approval for the deal to happen—which it was unlikely to earn under agency Chair Brendan Carr, who had explicitly stated that the 60 Minutes “issue” would be a factor of consideration. So, instead of fighting an easily winnable case, Paramount folded, pushing out several 60 Minutes leaders and gifting $16 million to Trump’s lawyers and his presidential library.\n\nNow, the suits aren’t calling Colbert’s departure a firing per se; CBS’s statement referred to the host as “irreplaceable” and characterized the Late Show’s ending as “a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nNo one believed it when Paramount said the exact same thing about the Trump settlement. (Co-CEO George Cheeks, who informed shareholders of that legal resolution, is also the reported decisionmaker behind The Late Show’s end.) And no one believes it now, in spite of the undeniable fact that traditional late-night TV is a format in decline. The Late Show was consistently the second-most-viewed show of its genre, lagging behind only Fox News’ Gutfeld! in ratings. Certainly, Colbert’s well-resourced shop was pricey: At Puck News, Matthew Belloni writes that the show reported $40 million in annual losses, thanks to steep plunges in ad revenue that have racked traditional TV as an enterprise. And insider publications like Puck, Variety, and Status News have reported that CBS had expressed concern over Late Show finances for months, as the network reviewed Colbert’s contract and its summer 2026 expiration date.\n\nNevertheless, Variety’s reporting also adds that “Paramount has appeared extremely sensitive” to Colbert’s brand of anti-Trump political comedy, especially in light of the settlement. And the Ellison family members who control Skydance are unmistakably pro-Trump conservatives who hope to shift Paramount away from its more liberal bona fides. (See also: Jon Stewart, who’s already worried that The Daily Show could be sold off.)\n\nOn top of that, Larry Ellison’s son, David, met with the FCC’s Carr earlier this week to get the merger ironed out, promising that CBS would embrace “varied ideological perspectives” under his watch. Such perspectives are likely to be influenced by the right-wingers Ellison wishes to add to the CBS operation, including David Rhodes (a longtime Rupert Murdoch lieutenant), Jeff Shell (the appointed president for the Paramount-Skydance conglomerate, who reportedly pressured 60 Minutes executives ahead of the settlement), and Free Press editor Bari Weiss. (According to Belloni, Skydance is reportedly in talks to acquire Weiss’ increasingly Trumpy publication; if both the Paramount and Free Press deals go through, Rhodes and Weiss would serve as the “ideological guide” for CBS News.)\n\nAll this is why no one really thinks that Colbert’s cancellation is just business as usual. Trump was certainly gleeful, posting on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired.” Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff—the latter of whom was a guest on Colbert’s Thursday show—each voiced their suspicions that The Late Show was done in for “political reasons.” The Writers Guild of America called for New York state Attorney General Letitia James to launch an investigation into that possibility. And plenty of Colbert’s fellow comedians weighed in, with Jimmy Kimmel offering CBS a social media “fuck you” and Julia Louis-Dreyfus directing an angry statement at Paramount and its owner, Shari Redstone. Even CBS staffers are raging, with a few anonymous sources telling the Independent that not one of them “is buying that it’s a financial decision.”\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s also a hell of a way for Paramount to end its longtime, lucrative partnership with one of the defining comics of a generation. The studio acquired Comedy Central in 2003, just as Colbert was coming to wider fame as correspondent for Stewart’s first Daily Show run. Shortly after, he got a landmark solo gig as host of the channel’s Colbert Report, before moving to CBS as Letterman’s Late Show successor—a prestigious slot he earned just as Donald Trump was rising to national power. By the time Colbert cedes his hosting duties next May, he’ll have worked under Paramount for 23 straight years, a career that’s brought him millions of fans thanks to his sharp, hilarious, unvarnished takedowns of modern-day American conservatism. Throughout this era, Colbert bravely called out President George W. Bush to his face at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, ran a brief presidential campaign, testified to Congress on behalf of immigrant farmworkers, made a personal enemy of Trump with his Late Show commentary, and even confronted, on air, the sexual assault allegations leveled against former CBS chief Les Moonves.\n\nIt was that honesty and frankness, combined with his biting touch, that made Stephen Colbert such a TV icon. Paramount had always known that, yet it sold him out for cheap. No wonder Colbert’s fans are once again calling for him to run for president. He’ll certainly have some extra time to plan a campaign very soon.","summary":"Paramount says it’s a business decision.
