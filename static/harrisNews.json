In the ongoing blockbuster that is the United States election, this week's interview with Kamala Harris offered another yet another piece of prime-time viewing. The vice-president's last-minute rise to the top of the Democratic ticket came without a new primary election process. And her reluctance to engage with the traditional media in the weeks after Joe Biden withdrew from the race meant the sit-down with CNN was the first time she'd been seriously tested in an unscripted setting since she emerged as his replacement. It all added up to a heightened level of scrutiny over how she performed. Harris avoided any major stumbles like the awkward \"I haven't been to Europe\" comment from 2021 that now forms part of Republican attack ads. And while she also didn't deliver any stand-out moments that might have helped to accelerate her early momentum, overall, her campaign would presumably be happy with a somewhat neutral result. But the vice-president didn't fully answer some of the biggest questions being asked of her. And with only two months to go until election day, she'll come under continued pressure to do so. 'My values have not changed' Loading... Harris is selling herself as a candidate of change, using the campaign slogans \"A new way forward\" and \"We're not going back\". As vice-president in the current administration, however, it leads to inevitable questions about what exactly she's proposing to do differently to Biden. Harris insisted she had no regrets about defending the president's abilities in the aftermath of his dismal debate performance, saying that serving with him had been an honour. She made clear she would not be deviating from US policy over the war in Gaza, echoing Biden by arguing Israel had a right to defend itself, although \"how it does so matters\". And when she spoke about wanting to \"turn the page on the last decade\" — prompting CNN anchor Dana Bash to point out that the administration she's part of made up nearly four years of that period – she suggested she was referring to Trump. \"I'm talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down,\" Harris said. \"Instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.\" Harris was pushed on energy policy and immigration, two areas in which she's moved her position further towards the political centre in recent years. In 2019, while running for her party's presidential nomination, Harris told a town hall meeting that she was in favour of banning fracking – a process used to extract natural gas. Five years on, with the resources-rich state of Pennsylvania considered a must-win for Democrats, she insists she's not opposed. Pressed on why she'd shifted her position, Harris argued the Biden administration had shown climate change action could be prioritised without imposing a fracking ban. But she also introduced a line that was repeated throughout the interview: \"My values have not changed.\" Harris was then asked about her stance on border security, having previously raised her hand on a debate stage in 2019 when asked whether crossing into the US without authorisation should be decriminalised. Harris now says there \"should be consequence\" for those who enter the country illegally. She blamed Donald Trump for deliberately sinking a package of border legislation that had support on both sides of Congress, because it wouldn't benefit him politically, before pivoting back to her earlier argument. \"My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed,\" Harris said. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, mocked the vice-president's position as \"bizarre\". \"If you have the same values, why have you changed your mind on literally every topic that you previously held an opinion on?\" he said on Fox News. \"I think it's important for us not to buy this.\" Trump will use what he describes as Harris's \"flip-flops\" to prosecute one of his most consistent lines of attack against her: that she's disingenuous. \"I look so forward to debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is,\" he said on Truth Social. \"Harris has changed every one of her long-held positions, on everything.\" The last time the former president took to the debate stage, his opponent ended up exiting the race weeks later. With his head-to-head with Harris taking place in less than a fortnight, neither side should be under any illusions about how significant the match-up will be. Trump's IVF promise While much of the focus this week was on the answers Harris was providing, Trump prompted further questions over his own position on another major election issue: reproductive rights. The former president made a promise that either his government, or medical insurers, would cover all of the costs associated with in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments. Trump nominated three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who helped to overturn Roe vs Wade in 2022, giving the states the power to introduce abortion bans. An Alabama court's ruling earlier this year that a frozen embryo was considered a child gave new weight to Democratic warnings that other reproductive rights could also be affected. The state legislature later passed a law allowing IVF clinics that shut down in the wake of the ruling to resume their services. Trump's announcement didn't come with any detail on how his administration would pay for IVF treatments, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. But it's part of a broader effort to try to neutralise a topic that could cost him support in November. The balancing act proved trickier when it came to questions over a ballot measure aimed at undoing a six-week abortion ban in Florida, where Trump is registered to vote. Trump first suggested he would vote in favour of the measure, telling NBC he believed \"we need more than six weeks\". But anti-abortion campaigners reacted angrily to the comment, and Trump's team soon intervened to argue he hadn't in fact revealed what he was planning to do. Within hours, Trump had announced he'd be voting against it after all – something Harris's campaign was quick to highlight. \"Kamala Harris is going to fight for your rights,\" Democrat campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz argued. \"Donald Trump will take them away.\" ICYMI: An ugly spat on hallowed ground Not far from Washington DC, the Arlington National Cemetery – where thousands of veterans are buried — is one of the most solemn places in the US. Trump visited the cemetery earlier this week at the invitation of some of the families of service members killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The former president took part in a wreath-laying ceremony to mark three years since they died. But when he moved to an area known as Section 60, where the gravesites of those who died in Afghanistan and Iraq are located, an altercation ensued. Trump's team included staffers who were taking photos and videos, with footage from the visit later posted on TikTok. The US Army alleges a cemetery employee, who tried to enforce laws preventing any kind of political activity happening in the area, was \"abruptly pushed aside\". Trump's campaign hit back by accusing the employee of being the one \"who initiated physical contact and verbal harassment that was unwarranted and unnecessary\". The former president himself argued he took pictures at the request of the families, and blamed Biden's \"incompetence\" for their deaths. The army said the incident had been reported to police, but the employee had decided against pressing charges. It considers the matter resolved. The political controversy might not be.","summary":"As the energy around Kamala Harris's nomination settles and she emerges from her first real test, the strategy behind Republican attack ads becomes clear, writes Jade Macmillan.  ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-31/kamala-harris-interview-donald-trump-ivf-promise-ahead-of-debate/104294430","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/826d8960b9e29f0ab32bdafbb1d84795?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=11&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:53:43","author":"Jade Macmillan","authors":["Jade Macmillan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":255306610,"title":"Misdated Mail-In Ballots Should Still Count, Pennsylvania Court Rules","text":"Pennsylvania’s two most populous counties cannot throw out otherwise timely and eligible mail-in ballots because they are undated or do not have the correct date on the outer envelope, a state court ruled on Friday.

Trump. Election officials disqualified nearly 16,000 mail-in ballots for irregularities during April’s primary election. Almost half were disqualified because of issues like missing signatures and wrong dates on outer envelopes. The ruling applies only to Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties.

(WSVN) - Former President Donald Trump is in damage control mode on the heels of a pledge to change Florida’s strict new abortion law. At an event in Michigan, Trump expressed his support for last year’s Supreme Court overturning of Roe vs. Wade. “We have abortion, we have the whole thing brought back to the states, where it belongs,” he said. “That’s where everybody wanted it for years and years.” On Friday, the Trump campaign attempted to clarify recent remarks made by the former commander in chief on abortion and on an upcoming amendment on Florida’s ballot. An NBC News reporter asked Trump whether or not he will vote in favor of Amendment 4. He suggested that he plans to vote yes. “I’m voting that – I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said. A yes vote would overturn the state’s current ban on abortion after six weeks. “If you go back 10 years, 15 years, all they wanted to do is, they wanted [abortion] back in the states; they didn’t want it to be in the federal government,” he said. “I was able to do that. I believe in exceptions for the life of the mother, If you look, incest, rape.”‘ But in a statement, Trump’s team attempted to rework those remarks. In a statement, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote the 78-year-old “has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida,” adding that he “simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short.” However, Trump’s response to NBC News does not seem to align with his campaign’s statement. A spokesperson for the campaign of his Democratic presidential opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was quick to pounce. “He has bragged openly about how he supports the decision of what the court did, and so, it is comical that Donald Trump would talk about women’s reproductive health,” said the spokesperson. Abortion has been a hot issue state by state for Republicans since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. “They celebrated for a while, but then they lost a lot of seats in 2022 that they would have won otherwise in the midterm elections, and it’s really catch up to Donald Trump now in the presidential race,” said a scholar with the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Anna Hochkammer with the Florida Women’s Freedom Coalition also weighed in on the issue. Se said the welcomes the former president’s support for Amendment 4. “I think he can see the same polling that we can see,” she said. “He said that he is going to be voting for more weeks. Well, in Florida, we’ve got a binary in front of us: yes on Amendment 4, or let the six-week cruel ban stand, so I think we have a pretty clear answer about his position, and interestingly, it’s a position that resonates with the vast majority of people across the state of Florida.” Trump also publicly pledged to fund in-vitro fertilization for women, despite U.S. Senate Republicans having recently blocked legislation that would have made it a right nationwide for women to access IVF. Friday afternoon, Trump addressed his position on abortion during a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania. He reiterated he is still in favor of more weeks beyond Florida’s current six-week ban, but because he believes Democrats are too radical, he will be voting no.

Mark Robinson: poll","text":"(The Center Square) – Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson struggles to maintain the approval of voters in North Carolina, even from those within his own party. While 30% hold a very or somewhat favorable view of Robinson, his opponent, Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein, garners 44% favorability. This is according to a new Elon University Poll, which asked 1,095 registered voters in North Carolina about issues related to both the presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. The survey was conducted from Aug. 2 to 9, and the margin of error is +/-3.86%. With just days until absentee ballots go out in North Carolina, Robinson’s popularity, or lack thereof, looks even more stark. While half of state voters hold unfavorable views of Robinson, just 29% felt the same about Stein. Though North Carolina voters regularly choose Republican candidates for president, its downballot races often swing Democratic. Currently, the state’s governor, attorney general and secretary of state are all Democrats. In the last 100 years, only four Republicans have held the governor’s seat. While Stein’s favorability is comparable to Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the Democratic ticket, the poll found that a 16% favorability difference exists between former Robinson and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Professor Jason Husser, director of the Elon University Poll, told The Center Square that some of the poll’s findings show how voters splitting their tickets could hurt Robinson. “The bad news for Robinson in this is that Republicans are more than twice as likely than Democrats to be in those ticket splitter groups,” he said. “Sixteen percent of Republicans were ticket splitters and 6% of Democrats. Making matters worse, 39% of Independents are ticket splitters.” Husser said this could be problematic because though Independents often choose Republicans, they are a decisive subset of voters for North Carolina elections. “[Independents] are how Republicans are able to win statewide elections, despite being a smaller registered, registered voting group than Democrats,” Husser said. Most Independents polled said they viewed Robinson unfavorably, while 27% said they did not view Stein favorably. Political advertising likely plays a role in the candidates’ favorability gap. Stein’s fundraising has outpaced Robinson’s significantly, with the attorney general bringing in more than double the amount of money. Sixty percent of all of Stein’s donors have come from out-of-state, compared with Robinson’s 40%. Polls released last week were mixed on how much Stein leads Robinson, with some as much as an 11-percentage point spread to as little as 4 percentage points.","summary":"While 30% hold a very or somewhat favorable view of Robinson, his opponent, Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein, garners 44% favorability.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/north-carolina-dem-ag-josh-stein-viewed-more-favorably-than-gop-lieutenant-gov-mark-robinson-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88603419.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:24:46","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.658},{"id":255306134,"title":"Trump claims that migrant children are either being trafficked for sex, lost, or deceased because of Kamala Harris","text":"On Friday, ex-President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of the border situation, claiming that many children who entered the US unlawfully since he departed the White House have been exploited as sex slaves, gone missing, or even died. Trump told a rally audience in battleground Pennsylvania that the Democratic presidential nominee, who serves as President Biden’s point person on addressing a surge in illegal crossings, bears responsibility for roughly 325,000 minors whose whereabouts are unknown to federal officials. “Think of the number — 325,000 children are missing. Many are dead. Many are involved in sex operations. Many are working as slaves in different parts of probably this country,” the Republican presidential candidate said in Johnstown. “She was the border czar,” Trump added. “Now she says, ‘I wasn’t the border czar,’ but she was. It was headlines — ‘border czar’, ‘border czar’ — but now she doesn’t want that term. But whether she was border czar or not, she was in charge of the border. 325,000 children are missing.” The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general issued a report last week saying that 232,000 migrants under age 18 have either failed to show up for immigration court hearings or were released from custody but have yet to be contacted for subsequent proceedings. Unaccompanied migrant children were allowed to remain in the United States upon crossing the border illegally beginning shortly after Biden took office — at a time when most others were summarily expelled under a temporary COVID-19-era health policy that under Trump also applied to minors. Biden’s aides described the policy as humane, but Republicans argued it could lead to even greater numbers of unaccompanied minors — many of them in their late teens — crossing into the country. Investigative reporting revealed that many unaccompanied minors were placed by the Department of Health and Human Services with businessmen who treated them like indentured servants and put them to work rather than into school. Some were forced to clean sharp equipment in slaughterhouses in overnight shifts. Over time, the administration allowed most family units and single adults to remain in the United States as they pursue asylum from alleged persecution in badly backlogged proceedings. After six months of waiting, asylum seekers are entitled to work permits. Illegal crossings hit all-time record highs in each year of Harris’ tenure in charge of stemming the crisis — totaling nearly 2.5 million in fiscal 2023 — though recent monthly apprehensions have trended downward since Biden in June issued an order allowing for caps on the processing of illegal entrants. Harris defended herself in a Monday interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, saying she had made some progress. “The root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president, has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we’ve began that work,” she said. But Trump slammed his rival Friday for allegedly fueling the crisis by allowing most unlawful entrants to stay in America — after Biden repudiated his predecessor’s “Remain in Mexico” policy requiring them to await asylum rulings elsewhere. “She created a fast pass entry program to speed the admission of illegals into all of our ports of entry,” Trump charged in Johnstown. “Now they have a new line, ‘We created a strong border’. They keep saying it over and over. The worst border in history, but they think, if they keep saying it over and over …” Trump added that the influx of migrants could harm social safety net programs — especially if legislation proposed by Biden and Harris passed allowing a pathway to citizenship for most people present illegally. “Kamala vowed to grant, remember, mass amnesty and citizenship to all of the millions of illegals that she let in, which will obliterate Medicare and obliterate your Social Security for seniors,” Trump said. He also said migrants pose a threat to public safety, musing that “typically when you have tic-tac-toe boards [tattooed] on your forehead it’s not a good thing.” Harris spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Trump invoked the plight of migrant children after facing years of criticism for presiding over the forced separation of families, including about 5,000 children during then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ “zero tolerance” approach of prosecuting adults who illegally crossed the border. As of last year, about 1,000 of those children remained separated from their parents, though just 81 of them had parents who hadn’t been located.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Friday, ex-President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump claims that migrant children are either being trafficked for sex, lost, or deceased because of Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-claims-that-migrant-children-are-either-being-trafficked-for-sex-lost-or-deceased-because-of-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trump-says-migrant-kids-are-sex-slaves-missing-or-dead.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:21:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":255305954,"title":"Trump Moves To Contain Fallout Of Abortion, IVF Rows","text":"Republican White House nominee Donald Trump sought Friday to contain the blast radius of a fierce backlash over his remarks publicly backing away from right-wing positions on reproductive rights.The ex-president has been under fire from conservatives over an announcement that in a second term he would ensure free in vitro fertilization -- an expensive fertility procedure that many in the anti-abortion movement want to see curbed.The rift widened as he hit out at his home state Florida's six-week abortion ban, calling it too restrictive and suggesting he planned to vote for an upcoming ballot measure that would make the procedure legal until a fetus becomes viable.Trump, 78, walked back the comment ahead of a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Friday, telling Fox News that \"I will be voting no.\"But conservatives had already begun criticizing Trump's ever-shifting positions on abortion, with a new Republican policy platform dropping calls for a national ban and the tycoon's recent claim that his government would be \"great\" for reproductive rights.The pushback from anti-abortion groups on his latest remarks was swift, with activists warning that he risks alienating his base.Evangelical theologian Albert Mohler said Trump's positions appeared \"almost calculated to alienate pro-life voters\" while conservative commentator Erick Erickson posted that Trump's abortion stance \"will be a bridge too far for too many.\"Trump's rally, in Johnstown, was notable for the absence of any remarks on reproductive rights, despite Thursday's big IVF announcement. The campaign of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was happy to weigh in on the issue, smelling blood in the water. \"The majority of Americans support abortion access, they support IVF, they support contraception,\" Mini Timmaraju, of the Reproductive Freedom for All lobby group, told reporters in a campaign call.\"(Trump) has finally figured it out, and he'll do anything to distract from his abysmal, horrifying record on this issue.\"Trump has been all over the map on abortion in the last 15 years, initially describing himself as \"pro-choice\" before calling for \"some form of punishment\" for women seeking the procedure. He boasts about appointing Supreme Court justices who ended federal protections for abortion access in 2022 but has more recently begun to worry that Republicans are out of step with the majority of voters on reproductive rights.His IVF pledge appeared calculated to appeal to moderates but will upset conservatives who for years opposed Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act because they were against the redistributive economics of taxpayer-funded health insurance. Almost every Senate Republican voted against assuring IVF access in a vote in June in any case, and more than half of the House Republican lawmakers have sponsored legislation that threatens its legality. Republicans are divided on fertility treatments such as IVF, with many hailing them as a boost to American families. Others, with strong beliefs that life begins at conception, oppose IVF because the procedure can produce multiple embryos, not all of which get used.Abortion rights activists worry that the Supreme Court decision threatens IVF and were given cause by a February ruling in Alabama that frozen embryos could be considered people, causing several clinics to briefly pause treatments.Yet if the abortion and IVF rows threatened to alienate Trump's most loyal supporters, rally-goers in Johnstown weren't showing it.\"It's not enough to make me not vote for him, no way, because he is pro-life,\" said Lisa Davis, a 54-year-old retired office manager from the nearby town of Somerset.\"I know he wants to give some exceptions -- and I think there should be.\"\"Why should I pay with my tax dollars for a baby getting killed?\" added retired nurse Rosemary Drzal, 69.Trump was due to head to the capital Washington later Friday to speak to the powerful conservative group Moms for Liberty.","summary":"Republican White House nominee Donald Trump sought Friday to contain the blast radius of a fierce backlash over his remarks publicly backing away from right-wing positions on reproductive rights.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-moves-contain-fallout-abortion-ivf-rows-3741402","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4544664/former-us-president-republican-white-house-candidate-donald-trump-speaks-rally-johnstown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:21:21","author":"Michael Mathes With Sarah Titterton","authors":["Michael Mathes With Sarah Titterton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":255305818,"title":"Trump says migrant kids are sex slaves, missing or dead due to Kamala Harris","text":"Former President Donald Trump said Friday that thousands of children who entered the US illegally since he left office are working as sex slaves, missing or dead due to Vice President Kamala Harris — making one of his most forceful denunciations yet of her performance as border czar.

On Thursday, the former president told NBC News that the state’s recently-enacted ban on abortions at six weeks of pregnancy is “too short” and that he wants “more weeks.” If Florida voters approve Amendment 4 on their ballots this fall, the state’s constitution would be amended to state that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” The amendment would effectively overturn the six-week ban that Trump said he opposes. However, the Republican presidential candidate told Fox News on Friday that he plans to vote against it. “So I think six weeks, you need more time. Six weeks, I disagreed with that from the early primaries, when I heard about it,” he said. “At the same time, the Democrats are radical, because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the nine months,” added Trump, who then repeated his false claim that states allow doctors to “execute a baby after birth.” He said he would vote against the measure for that reason. Trump’s description of Florida’s amendment – the “Right to Abortion Initiative” — is also wrong. If passed, the amendment would prevent the state from passing any law that bans abortion care at any point in a pregnancy, before a fetus is viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks. The state would also be prohibited from enacting any law that criminalizes emergency abortion care at any point during a pregnancy. The former president’s conflicting statements on reproductive healthcare over the last 25 years have drawn criticism from both abortion rights supporters and his anti-abortion allies. Florida’s six-week ban – a point before many women even know they are pregnant — was only possible after the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v Wade. Trump routinely takes credit for that decision, after he appointed three conservative justices to the nine-member court who voted to reverse the 50-year precedent. A radically reshaped federal judiciary under his administration has also supported anti-abortion measures that included threats to emergency care and widely used abortion drugs. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, recently rejected Democratic legislation to protect IVF access. And his allies in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also supported federal anti-abortion laws and so-called “fetal personhood” language that is now baked into the GOP’s official 2024 platform. Trump’s allies behind Project 2025, a right-wing think tank’s blueprint for his administration, would also effectively outlaw abortion drugs and strip access to birth control and fertility treatments. In response to Trump’s latest comments, Vice President Kamala Harris said that her White House rival made his position on abortion “very clear”, and underscored her plan to enshrine abortion rights protections into federal law. “He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant,” she said in a statement through her campaign. “So, of course he thinks it’s a ‘beautiful thing’ that women in Florida and across the country are being turned away from emergency rooms, face life-threatening situations, and are forced to travel hundreds of miles for the care they need.” She added: “I trust women to make their own health care decisions and believe the government should never come between a woman and her doctor.” Earlier on Friday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump’s attempts to amend his record on abortion and in vitro fertlization as “gaslighting” and “smoke and mirrors.” “American women are not stupid,” she said during a press call for Harris’s campaign. The former president will “do anything to distract from his abysmal, horrifying record on this issue,” added Reproductive Freedom for All president Mini Timmaraju. “It’s desperation and it’s lies,” she said. Harris’s campaign, meanwhile, is launching a 50-stop bus tour to promote reproductive healthcare access — and making its first stop in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida, on September 3. Florida is among more than a dozen states that have outlawed all or most abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision. Since earlier this year, Florida’s six-week ban makes it a felony to perform or actively participate in an abortion in the state after roughly six weeks’ gestation, or about two weeks after a missed period. Voters in at least 10 states will vote on abortion rights measures this November, including measures that could enshrine a right to seek abortion care in their states’ constitutions.","summary":"The former president will vote against an amendment that would overturn an abortion ban that he says he opposes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-florida-abortion-ban-desantis-b2604783.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/30/23/247672f6da10468593723ff043734da4.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PqTPhVzD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:14:09","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":255305566,"title":"Donald Trump Mocked for New Trading Cards: 'Speechless'","text":"Former President Donald Trump has released another round of digital trading cards for sale, sparking mockery from some of his critics online.The cards, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are being sold at $99 apiece and are branded as the \"America First Collection.\" The digital collectors' items are the latest in a string of unconventional fundraising efforts from Trump, which have included his own line of sneakers and a \"God Bless the USA Bible.\"The new NFT set depicts the former president in a variety of poses, such as him dancing or holding a Bitcoin icon.

But they also suggested it was a missed opportunity that the vice president can quickly put right. Her overall performance received positive reviews. When 294 viewers were asked for their one-word review, the most common were ‘presidential’ and ‘smart.’ After avoiding interviews for more than a month, the vice president sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash as well as her running mate Tim Walz to answer questions in a Georgia restaurant on Thursday. J.L. Partners asked a representative sample of viewers: ‘Kamala Harris did the interview with her running mate, and has not sat for a solo interview since she has been named the nominee. How do you think this makes Kamala Harris look?’ Unimpressed was the overall answer. ‘I think it kind of makes her look bad because I really think she should sit down and have this interview so everyone in the world can see her point of view and where she’s coming from, said 52-year-old female restaurant manager from Texas, who plans to vote for Harris in November. Another Harris voter from Massachusetts said she worried that it makes her look ‘as though she’s not fit to be president.’ However, others also said delaying the interview made her look ‘busy’ and Walz made look part of a ‘team.’ James Johnson, co-founder of J.L. Partners which conducted the snap survey after the interview aired, said there were positives for Harris and for Walz. ‘Voters split by party on their views of how Harris did but they agree on one thing: Harris looked weak for not appearing solo,’ he said. ‘Voters felt she came across quite well in the interview, so it was a mistake not to appear solo straight away. ‘This, though, is something the campaign can dispel quite easily by putting her up for a solo interview soon—it doesn’t feel like something that is going to dominate the campaign.’ Harris fended off questions about flip-flopping on her policy positions, as she confirmed she no longer wanted to ban fracking and that there should be ‘consequences’ for people who cross the border illegally. ‘I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,’ Harris said. The interview got the all-star treatment from CNN, with an on-screen countdown clock and excerpts released ahead of its 9pm broadcast time. Viewers responded with a collective ‘meh.’ When asked for the most memorable moment or issue, the words dominating the resulting word cloud were: Nothing, questions and Trump. Johnson said Harris had cleared a hurdle, without messing anything up. ‘Voters shrugged at the CNN interview last night—it hardly gripped the nation, with “nothing” being the most common response when viewers were asked what they noticed most,’ he said. ‘But in a campaign where views of Harris are already broadly positive and they need to avoid gaffes, the Harris-Walz campaign can notch that up as a win. ‘She was seen by some as presidential and smart during the interview, while others said she was fake and liberal, hesitations that still lurk in voters’ minds when it comes to Harris.’ A 62-year-old retired man from Louisiana who voted Trump in 2020 but plans to vote for Harris now said: ‘From what I saw, I think she cares about this country more than Donald Trump.’ Otherwise a lot of the reactions broke down along party lines in the sample. ‘Approachable, even headed. She kept to her points pretty well,’ said a 36-year-old Harris supporter from Michigan. But a Trump voter in New Jersey said: ‘She was given softball questions and she gave softball answers.’ And Trump 2020 voter in Ohio who has yet to make up his mind this time around said: ‘She came across as a normal politician, fake and only worried about getting votes to stay in power.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris looked &#8216;weak&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; for waiting weeks and then sitting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Audience thinks Harris appeared timid while appearing with running mate in CNN interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/audience-thinks-harris-appeared-timid-while-appearing-with-running-mate-in-cnn-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1725058681_rewrite-this-title-Viewers-say-Harris-looked-WEAK-for-appearing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:58:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":255306284,"title":"Moms for Liberty features ‘culture warrior’ Trump at DC summit","text":"Justice spoke on the culture wars driving Democrats to support Moms for Liberty, actor and comedian Rob Schneider spoke on the first night, Gabbard participated in the morning roundtable with Justice, and Texas state Rep. Shawn Thierry announced she is leaving the Democratic Party and switching to the GOP. “RFK Jr. just came out and endorsed Trump,” Justice said. “I think what is happening right now is that Democrats are getting permission to be able to stand up and say some of these radical policies that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promoting in their own states of California and in Minnesota are not what American parents broadly, overall want. We see that in the polling, and it’s exciting to see that kids are going to be prioritized in America.” Suburban mothers and independent voters who may not be convinced experimental surgeries on children are the answer for body dysmorphia are a very important voting bloc in this election. “A lot of Americans have a real problem with the idea of cutting off the healthy body parts of children and of disengaging parents in the decisions about their children’s education, their medical care, and their upbringing,” Justice said. The Moms for Liberty co-founder feels former President Donald Trump, who will speak at a fireside chat during the summit, is a “culture warrior” in the movement to protect children. “It’s not very surprising to see that President Trump doesn’t seem to shy away from any fight,” Justice said. “You know, he’s a dad and a grandfather. He’s a businessman. We’re in the middle of a cultural revolution. And so, for me as an individual, he’s a culture warrior.” The mother of four also compared Trump doing rallies and roundtables with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who just with CNN as their first news interview since the launch of their campaign. “I think it’s great that he’s willing to answer all of the questions that are asked of him,” Justice said of Trump. “You see him all of the time stopping and answering reporters’ questions, and Kamala Harris won’t answer any questions. I think the American people are going to grow tired of that. If you’re not willing to answer questions, then how could you possibly lead our country?” Harris has spoken with reporters several times while on the campaign trail. Justice also touched on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitting to falling to pressure from the Biden administration to censor content on Facebook. “We know that the social media landscape has been censored because Moms for Liberty has been a victim of that, even a victim of Facebook,” Justice said. “We wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg at one point because our chapters were being removed from the platform. I’m glad that he’s being honest about what is happening.” “We know the federal government, the American government, has been weaponized against the people,” Justice added. “The FBI went so far as to call one of our moms after speaking at a school board meeting.

The ratings bump was CNN’s second major programming event of the summer, after a presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, which drew 47.9 million viewers, a 20-year debate low. Harris and Walz were touring rural Georgia on a campaign bus Thursday following the Democratic National Convention, during which Harris saw a ratings victory, drawing in 26.2 million viewers to her acceptance speech, nearly a million more than Trump’s RNC address. During the interview, CNN’s Dana Bash pressed Harris on her past policy changes and racial identity, echoing attacks lobbed at the vice president from the Trump campaign, but largely avoided giving the duo a chance to answer on substantive policy questions.

The vice president, who was accompanied by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, often looked down, avoiding eye contact, as she tried to answer Bash’s questions about her policy reversals and presidential agenda. “The fact that she’s looking down a lot removes a lot of the fluidity and the authenticity,” Constantine said. “When you’re breaking gaze, that is a form of deflection,” she added. “So when you’re removing an eye gaze, not making good eye contact, it’s just showing me that she’s not confident in what she’s saying.” Early in the interview, Harris was asked about her “Day One” plans, if elected to the Oval Office. But rather than list specific executive actions, Harris indicated that she hoped to “support and strengthen the middle class” and begin work on implementing her “opportunity economy” plan – which would require congressional action. “When she struggles, you start to see a lot of the head bobbling. You know, the head bobbling is ‘what part of the file in my subconscious am I going to pull out? Which ones are my answers?’” Constantine said about Harris’ answer. “She couldn’t come up with a crystal clear answer, and that’s why she tends to bobble. “When you bobble and waffle like that,” the body language expert continued, “that’s another signal that she’s not really… prepared. She doesn’t really have confidence in her own answers.” Constantine also observed that Harris was “consistently looking for acknowledgment” from Walz, 60, during the interview. “She is looking for that signal from Walz to see if he’s on board,” Constantine noted about Harris. “Many times when we see him, he’s got the pressed lips — that tends to be a more serious, more collected, expression in his mouth.” In the lead-up to the sit-down, Republicans charged that the vice president planned to use her running mate as a crutch if Bash’s line of questioning became too challenging. Walz ended up speaking for roughly a fourth of the approximately 27-minute interview. Constantine’s overall assessment was that Harris, who is seeking to become the first female president of the US in November, did not “look like a woman in power.” “Overall, you know, as one woman to another, I would say if you’re going to be a woman in power, you have to look like a woman in power,” she said. “And she doesn’t at this time.”","summary":"\"When I look at her overall demeanor, she does not carry the confidence or the presidential appearance in her demeanor to command in her position,\" body language expert Susan Constantine told Fox News Digital.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/harris-lacked-confidence-and-authenticity-in-first-interview-since-bidens-exit-body-language-expert/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88601410.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lyNy9oow-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:51:35","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":255301936,"title":"Early Addition: No, a Minion didn't die for your sins","text":"It's not just rat-infested dining sheds — even unpermitted little two-tops outside city restaurants are getting shut down by inspectors.

That came just days after Trump criticized Florida’s six-week abortion ban in an interview with DailyMail.com, saying, ‘I think it should be more than six weeks.’ His campaign aides insisted his comments did not reveal his final position, which the candidate then clarified in an interview with Fox News late Friday following pressure from pro-life groups. ‘So I think six weeks you need more time, then six weeks I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it I disagreed with it,’ Trump told the network, repeating the sentiment. ‘At the same time the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. … So I’ll be voting no for that reason,’ Trump said. The amendment on the ballot that he is now publicly opposing bars abortion restrictions up until the viability of the fetus, about 24 weeks – or six months – into pregnancy, with exceptions for the life and health of the mother. With a choice on Amendment 4 that offers a simple yes or no to voters, his response horrified allies in the anti-abortion movement, who are a critical part of his coalition. It followed other comments about protecting reproductive rights as Trump hopes to avoid the difficulties have suffered in off-year elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump appointed three of the conservative justices determined the majority ruling. And his campaign played cleanup on Thursday evening, after Trump made similar comments to NBC News. ‘President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida, he simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,’ said Karoline Leavitt, Trump Campaign national press secretary. Trump had told NBC that ‘I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,’ which further confused the issue, given that it is an up or down vote on the referendum at hand. He told DailyMail.com at Mar-a-Lago that he had decided how he would vote. ‘Well, I do know, but I do want more than six weeks,’ he said. ‘I want more than six weeks. Conservative commentator Erik Erikson was among those fuming at Trump’s recent comments before he finally came out against the referendum, on a night of a big Kamala Harris interview. ‘Instead of having all the focus on the Kamala Harris interview tonight, Trump decided to further divide the GOP. Not a good strategy for winning,’ he posted on X. Florida bans almost all abortions after six weeks and, when asked how he would vote on a measure that would extend the limit to more than 20 weeks, Trump told DailyMail.com: ‘I want more than six weeks.’ Trump has walked a narrow path on the issue, knowing that it could hold the key to the 2024 election. During his administration he was happy to be seen as the most ‘pro-life’ president in history. He took credit for ending federal protections on abortion after the Supreme Court (including three of his picks) overturned Roe v Wade. But he has since expressed concern that Republicans could be battered at the ballot box if they push hardline federal bans. Instead, he said it was up to states to decide the matter. However, with his home state of Florida due in November to vote on Amendment 4, which would allow abortions up to the point of ‘viability’ when fetuses can survive outside the mother’s womb, he cannot avoid explaining his personal position forever. He trailed a public reveal on the issue when DailyMail.com asked him how he would be voting. ‘I think six weeks is a mistake. And I’ll be expressing that soon, but I want more than six weeks,’ he said at his Mar-a-Lago home, speaking for the first time about his thoughts on the referendum. ‘And in Florida, we have a six-week program, and that’s what I believe that you’re voting on, and I think it should be more than six weeks.’ There is no alternative to a yes or no, delighting supporters of a woman’s right to choose, who took to social media in support. He said the same thing in a second TV interview a day later. But a key anti-abortion leader immediately got in touch with Trump to check his position. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said Trump hold her he had not yet committed to how he will vote. ‘President Trump has consistently opposed abortions after five months of pregnancy. Amendment 4 would allow abortion past this point. Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position,’ she said. ‘We strongly support Florida’s current heartbeat law. For anyone who believes in drawing a different line, they still must vote against Amendment 4, unless they don’t want a line at all. Amendment 4 would lock unlimited abortion into the state constitution, preventing the Florida legislature from enacting any changes.’ Florida’s hardline abortion law was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis last year. ‘Donald Trump has consistently stated that late-term abortions where a baby can feel pain should never be permitted, and he’s always stood up for parents’ rights,’ said Taryn Fenske, communications director for the governor’s office. ‘Amendment 4 would allow late-term abortions, eliminate parental consent, and open the door to taxpayer-funded abortions. It’s extreme and must be defeated.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump revealed Thursday that he will vote against a ballot referendum&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump states his stance on Florida&#8217;s abortion law after criticizing the six-week limit in an interview with the Daily Mail. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-states-his-stance-on-floridas-abortion-law-after-criticizing-the-six-week-limit-in-an-interview-with-the-daily-mail/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-confirms-how-he-will-vote.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:36:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":255301596,"title":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly change website page recruiting poll watchers after GOP called out ‘disinformation’","text":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly updated their website Thursday night after Republicans accused them of publishing “misinformation” on the site’s recruitment page, which appeared to be enlisting out-of-state poll watchers in violation of the battleground state’s election law. The Republican National Committee sent a letter to Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt earlier in the day Thursday, pointing out that the Pennsylvania Dems’ “Voter Protection” page on their website said that poll watchers on Election Day “must be physically present in PA for their shift, but do not necessarily have to be PA voters.” That language contradicted Pennsylvania election law going back to 1937, which states, “Each watcher so appointed must be a qualified registered elector of the county in which the election district for which the watcher was appointed is located.” “The misinformation on the PA Dems’ website threatens the integrity of November’s general election,” the RNC’s letter to Schmidt reads, explaining that the Democratic Party cannot be allowed to “flood polling places with unqualified out-of-state poll watchers.” The Pennsylvania Department of State told The Post that poll watchers are “specifically defined as individuals appointed by candidates or political parties to observe inside a polling place on Election Day,” not outside. In other words, Pennsylvania poll watchers must not only be Pennsylvania voters, but they can also only serve in the polling place in the county they are registered to vote. That’s a far cry from what Pennsylvania Democrats were telling potential volunteers, thus sparking Republicans’ complaints of “misinformation.” In a statement to The Post on Friday, the Pennsylvania Dems clapped back at their Republican opponents. “Our Party takes our democracy seriously, unlike the MAGA Republicans that are busy launching bad faith attacks on voters and our volunteers,” said Mitch Kates, PA Dems’ Executive Director. “Poll watchers may be located inside or outside of polling locations, and outside poll watchers can be volunteers from any state,” Kates said. “We have always made this distinction in assigning our volunteers on Election Day.” But Pennsylvania Democrats didn’t make this distinction on their recruitment page – until it was changed Thursday night. Still, the Republicans are urging Schmidt, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, to correct the PA Democrats’ “misinformation and disinformation” on the state’s “Fact-Checking Election Claims” page, and order them to “cease and desist” from publishing inaccurate election information. Both Democrats and Republicans recruit voter protection volunteers from out of state, and both parties are recruiting armies of volunteers to monitor polling places to make sure their team’s ballots are counted, and contest questionable ballots on the opposing side. An Emerson poll released Thursday showed Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 48% support in the Keystone State.","summary":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly updated their website Thursday night after Republicans accused them of publishing &#8220;misinformation&#8221; on the site&#8217;s recruitment page, which appeared to be enlisting out-of-state poll watchers in violation of the battleground state&#8217;s election law.

Reproductive rights remain a political land mine for Trump By Kristen Welker The past 24 hours have underscored how the abortion issue remains a major political land mine for Donald Trump and the GOP heading into the final stretch of the election. It started on Thursday — the same day Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for her first major interview as the Democratic presidential nominee — when Trump told NBC News’ Dasha Burns that Florida’s six-week abortion ban was “too short” and that he would “be voting that we need more than six weeks” when asked about a ballot measure that would expand abortion access in his home state of Florida. His campaign clarified that evening that he had not yet taken a position on the proposed constitutional amendment. And perhaps more significantly, on Thursday Trump also told Burns that he supported not only protecting access to in vitro fertilization, but also having the federal government or insurance companies pay for those costs. Then, on Friday afternoon, after receiving swift backlash from the right, he came out against Florida’s abortion-rights ballot measure. “So I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks. I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it, I disagreed with it,” Trump said in comments to Fox News. “At the same time, the Democrats are radical, because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. ... So I’ll be voting no for that reason.” Florida’s amendment would bar restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy, while ensuring exceptions to protect the health of the mother. Trump’s statements on both abortion and IVF show how thorny the issues are for the Republican nominee — even when he appears to be staking out a position that’s more popular with the general electorate, according to the polls. From one political side, there were anti-abortion conservatives, like Erick Erickson, who jeered Trump’s initial comments, warning they could cost him support from a critical slice of the GOP base. On the other, Harris’ campaign and Democrats continued to hammer Trump for his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, which left the abortion issue to the states. And then there’s the financial aspect of Trump’s plans. With the price tag for IVF treatments at approximately $20,000 each, having the government cover the cost would amount to billions in taxpayer dollars. The reversal of Roe has hurt the Republicans and energized Democrats — just look at the 2022 midterms and the results from recent statewide ballot measures. But Trump’s last 24 hours revealed how the abortion and IVF debate continue to be problematic for Republicans, even for a presidential candidate trying his best to sidestep the issues. How Harris is preparing for her first Trump debate By Yamiche Alcindor Kamala Harris has been preparing for the debate stage for months. Only, instead of facing off against the GOP’s VP nominee as originally expected, she’s now set for her first showdown with Donald Trump in less than two weeks. Here’s a look at how Harris is getting ready for the debate, according to four sources familiar with the Democratic nominee’s preparations. Getting under Trump’s skin: A source told NBC News that while Harris’ team is preparing to talk about a variety of topics, the campaign very much views the optics of the debate as critically important. To that end, the source said, Harris and her team are focusing on homing in on how to needle Trump to rattle him. In that sense, the source said, it’s going to be less about substance and more about showcasing Harris as a woman who isn’t scared and isn’t going to cower and who is standing up to Trump and holding him accountable. Tension over how to differentiate from Biden: Drawing a distinction between Harris and Biden is a source of tension, as some on Harris’ team are taking the approach that she may have to respectfully but forcefully lay blame for some problems, like the Afghanistan withdrawal, squarely at Biden’s feet. One source said the 2021 withdrawal is seen as an “obvious vulnerability” that Harris is preparing how to tackle. Avoiding a Tulsi Gabbard moment: Harris and her team are most focused on avoiding a moment from a Democratic presidential primary debate in July 2019, when Tulsi Gabbard, then a House member from Hawaii, launched a lengthy attack on Harris’ prosecutorial record. Gabbard (who recently endorsed Trump’s 2024 bid) accused Harris of having jailed more than 1,500 people for marijuana violations when she was a prosecutor in California, adding that she “laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” a jab that elicited applause from the audience. Harris and her team were unprepared for the attack and are working to ensure she can quickly pivot in the face of a similar approach by Trump.

The Trump team hasn’t specified how the policy would be adopted, but the quickest way is likely through pending legislation requiring insurance companies to consider infertility a covered medical condition or through amending former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law. If Trump, 78, manages to become the 47th president, he could also issue executive orders expanding free IVF coverage to all federal workers, military members and veterans, who currently are eligible only in limited cases — though such orders would likely face legal challenges. “Politicians promise and overpromise all the time,” Gerald Kominski, senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told The Post Friday. “In this specific case, what [Trump’s] promising has never been done with regard to healthcare in this country.” The price tag for IVF is hefty — with treatments costing $15,000 to $20,000 per cycle, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vanessa Brown Calder, the director of Opportunity and Family Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, estimated the cost of making IVF free to everyone would amount to roughly $7 billion per year — a calculation she said was based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reflecting 413,776 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles in 2021, 99% of which were IVF treatments. “Of course, this substantially understates the true long-term costs of the program,” Calder cautioned. “Most IVF patients are currently self-pay and this limits IVF use. Moreover, government-funded IVF would create new incentives for couples to delay childbearing or engage in elective fertility preservation, leading to growing use and reliance on fertility treatment long-term.” It’s unclear how much of the total burden would be shouldered directly by the government — though increased costs for insurance companies are likely to be passed on to taxpayers as well though higher policy premiums. ‘A Dramatic Moment’ Advocates have been fighting for years to make IVF free — and were thrilled by Trump’s surprise announcement. “It’s terrific that a nominee of a major party in this country is calling for universal access for IVF. That’s great, we applaud that,” said Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). “We would very much love to work with the Trump campaign on what that proposal might need to look like. So far the plan seems to consist of one sentence.” Tipton added: “There’s an active bill sponsored by Republicans right now in Congress. He could say, ‘Let’s do that.'” That legislation was introduced by Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) and cosponsored by 14 House Republicans and six House Democrats, including New York GOPers Mike Lawler, Marcus Molinaro, Anthony D’Esposito, Brandon Williams and Andrew Garbarino as well as Empire State Democrats Dan Goldman and Patrick Ryan. Tipton said the ASRM is interested in learning whether Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris also supports universal insurance coverage for IVF — after she has frequently invoked concern about safeguarding the procedure against state-level anti-abortion laws. “Everyone can speak in platitudes,” he said. “Now it’s time to move past the poetry of supporting IVF and into the prose of what those policies would look like.” Although efforts to get a federal IVF coverage mandate have gained little traction, 13 states — ranging from Republican bastions Arkansas and Utah to Democratic strongholds New York and Massachusetts already require insurance companies to cover it. California, the most populous state in the union, is poised to follow after the state legislature approved a mandate this week. If enacted, a free-IVF mandate would be a major bipartisan accomplishment for Trump, who in his first term similarly breathed new life into long-stalled criminal justice reforms, forcing through a bipartisan package known as the First Step Act after the policies languished for years. “I’ve been in this policy space for 25 years and never has IVF and infertility treatments had this sort of attention from these very top level of politicians,” Tipton said. “So it is indeed a dramatic moment. And so now the job is to take all this interest and translate it into policies that actually provide coverage.” About 2.5% of American babies are born from IVF each year — compared to 5% to 7% in European countries with free coverage for the procedure, he noted. So far, state mandates haven’t led to a large bump in IVF babies, though more incremental increases may be resulting from them. In response to criticism of the plan’s cost, Tipton told The Post opponents should look at the big picture. “In order for the species to survive we have to have reproduction,” he said. “In order for our Social Security system to be fiscally viable, we have to have young employees paying taxes. “You are in a society with those people and we need to have children.” Mixed reactions from GOP loyalists The Trump IVF plan got a range of reactions from Republicans, with some championing it as a bold pro-family initiative while others — especially abortion opponents —shared concerns due to IVF’s process of creating and destroying embryos Even some close Trump allies privately said they were horrified at the idea, with one former White House official calling it “terrible,” before predicting the former president would not lose support from anti-abortion conservatives on Nov. 5. The ex-aide said that the “inartful” plan “doesn’t change what he did and what he plans to do on life” — calling Trump “the most pro-life POTUS of our generation” after he appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and return abortion policy to the states. The Trump initiative is expected to appeal not only to suburban centrists, but more Democratic-leaning voting groups, such as LGBT people who use IVF to conceive children. “Affordable access to IVF is an important issue for the LGBT community across the political spectrum, and President Trump’s proposal would be a game changer for LGBT couples who want to start families of their own,” Log Cabin Republicans President Charles Moran said in a statement. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion organization, called for enacting policies that would stop embryos from being destroyed if Trump’s plan is adopted. “SBA Pro-Life America has no objection to fertility treatments that help couples struggling with infertility in an ethical way, with strong medical safety standards,” said SBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser. “We believe human embryos should not be destroyed. All too often, proposals on this issue go too far by giving blanket immunity to IVF clinics — even for rogue practitioners who switch human embryos, fail to follow basic safety standards, or negligently destroy human embryos desired by infertile couples,” she added. Trump’s IVF plan followed months of Democratic candidates painting him as a potential threat to the procedure following the federalization of abortion policy, which resulted in court fights in some states over whether the practice constitutes abortion. Alabama’s state supreme court in February issued a stunning ruling saying that embryos created using IVF must be considered “unborn children” — prompting the Republican-led state government to hastily ratify a new law in March that provided criminal immunity for providers and patients.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump proposed Thursday that under his administration, in-vitro fertilization would be free and would be covered by the government or insurance companies.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/trumps-free-ivf-plan-could-cost-taxpayers-up-to-7b-experts-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/former-president-donald-trump-enters-88587690.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:27:23","author":"Diana Glebova,Josh Christenson,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Josh Christenson","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":255292350,"title":"'For election purposes': Critics balk at Harris' claim she will 'enforce our laws' at southern border","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris made a 180-degree turn on her opinion about prosecuting illegal border crossings during her long-awaited first interview since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president. CNN anchor Dana Bash questioned Harris Thursday about whether she still believed illegal border crossings should be prosecuted, something Harris indicated she was against while running her 2019 campaign to become president. \"I believe there should be consequence,\" Harris told Bash. \"We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. … And let’s be clear, in this race, I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws. And I would enforce our laws as president going forward.\" TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' FIRST INTERVIEW AS DEM NOMINEE: ‘I WILL NOT BAN FRACKING’ Harris' comments Thursday contrasted with what she has said and done in the past regarding illegal immigration, particularly when it comes to illegal border crossings. Besides indicating during a nationally televised debate that she would not pursue people who have crossed the border illegally for prosecution, she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2015 that \"an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal.\" She also posted the claim on social media. And in a riff with the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain's daughter, Meghan, during a 2019 episode of \"The View,\" Harris reiterated her stance. \"I would not make it a crime punishable by jail,\" she said. \"It should be a civil enforcement issue but not a criminal enforcement issue.\" As a U.S. senator, Harris sought to strip funding from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). And as California's attorney general, she instructed local law enforcement not to adhere to ICE detainers when they request that someone who has committed a crime and crossed the border illegally be held until they can be taken into custody to initiate deportation procedures.

KAMALA HARRIS OFFERS VAGUE ‘DAY 1’ OVAL OFFICE PLAN IN CNN INTERVIEW: ‘A NUMBER OF THINGS’ Fox News Digital spoke to two conservative immigration law experts who called her comments \"insincere\" and \"for election purposes\" only. \"If someone cares about enforcing our laws as they pertain to the border, you would think that they would be a part of and lead an administration that prosecutes sufficient offenses related to crossing the border unlawfully,\" said Gene Hamilton, the director of America First Legal, a right-wing legal group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. \"The Department of Justice's prosecution for border-related offenses are at rock bottom. They are lower than even the Obama years, and that's saying something.\" Hamilton, who served as counselor to the attorney general at the Department of Justice under former President Trump, argued a key metric in determining how seriously an administration is taking border security is the number of illegal border crossings compared to the number of individuals deported. Last year, there were 2.4 million illegal border crossings, according to Department of Justice data, Hamilton said. Meanwhile, the Justice Department prosecuted around 20,000 of those violations. \"You know, the numbers — the numbers speak for themselves,\" Hamilton argued. He also pointed out that in 2019, under Trump, there were fewer illegal border crossings than the country faced in 2023, but the Trump administration still prosecuted more than five times the number of illegal border crossers than the Biden-Harris administration in 2023. \"As she said last night in her interview, her values have not changed. She said that over and over again,\" said Lora Ries, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center. \"She is telling her base, 'Look, don't worry about what the campaign is saying right now. We just have to say that to try and get elected. But my values have not changed.'\" NBC REPORTER CALLS OUT KAMALA HARRIS FOR SAYING HER ‘VALUES HAVEN’T CHANGED': ‘HER POSITIONS HAVE CHANGED’ CNN'S KAMALA HARRIS, TIM WALZ INTERVIEW CAN BE SUMMED UP IN JUST TWO WORDS Ries slammed the Biden-Harris administration for \"gaslighting\" the American public but argued the Harris campaign \"is taking it to another level\" by denying Harris was tapped to be the border czar and pretending as if she is not in power and able to enact tougher measures at the border. \"She's in power right now. If she truly meant it, she would do it now, and she's not. But to pretend like you're not in power and not in office right now is a higher level of gaslighting,\" said Ries. \"I think this is just, you know, for election purposes.\" Hamilton echoed that statement, calling Harris' comments Thursday \"insincere.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign repeatedly for comment but did not receive a response.","summary":"Critics slam Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; record on the border after she told CNN she will &quot;enforce&quot; the law against illegal border crossings.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/for-election-purposes-critics-balk-harris-claim-she-enforce-our-laws-southern-border","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/KamalaHarrisCNN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:22:29","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":255306264,"title":"Trump turns to Truth Social to share sexual jokes and calls for ‘military tribunals’","text":"As the presidential candidates head into the most heated phase of the election year so far, former President Donald Trump has made a distinctive shift in tone on his Truth Social profile, lashing out in increasingly vulgar, misogynistic and vindictive posts. Just this week, he’s reposted messages calling for his political opponents to be jailed, calling for a return of “public military tribunals” for people like former President Barack Obama, as well as making a graphic sexual joke about Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrat Hillary Clinton, his opponent in 2016. The repost of the sexual joke now appears to have been removed from Trump’s profile. But you’d only see that if you’re a user of Truth Social. On other more mainstream platforms like X and TikTok, Trump has maintained a more even tone, one seemingly designed for consumption by a much wider swath of American voters. Truth Social has long been a safe space for Trump allies and acolytes, a place they’re free to lean into unfounded claims of election fraud and a search for revenge, with the distinct possibility those messages could be seen and reposted — or “retruthed\" — by Trump himself. But it has a far more limited reach than the major platforms, leaving things largely out of sight and mind for the vast majority of Americans. On Truth Social, Trump has been able to feed the frenzy of fans who post more extreme conspiracy theories and calls to action, while maintaining a far more manicured presence on larger platforms like X. On Wednesday, Trump made and shared a particularly extreme series of posts on Truth. “How to actually fix the system,” one Truth repost read, with photoshopped images of Hilary Clinton, President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former public health official Anthony Fauci, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Harris all sitting in orange jumpsuits behind prison bars. “Indict the unselect J6 committee sedition,” another reads, followed by “retruth if you want to lock them up.” Another features a picture of Trump sitting next to Obama with the words “All roads lead to Obama. Retruth if you want public military tribunals.” And one includes a screenshot apparently from X of a reply to a photo of Harris and Clinton that oral sex “impacted both their careers differently.” Trump has regularly used his Truth Social platform to denigrate enemies, and weigh in on the various legal cases against him, so much so that a New York judge held him in contempt of court for violating a gag order, in part based on his posts. In March, he shared a video that included an image of Biden bound in the back of a pickup truck. And in July, he reposted another call for a “televised military tribunal” for former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and a quote from Ulysses S. Grant after the start of the Civil War, in which he said: “There are but two parties now: traitors and patriots.” But the sexualized nature of the attack on Harris broached a new frontier, one that comes as all indications point to Harris running a more competitive race against Trump than Biden was. Asked on CNN about the sexual post about Clinton and Harris, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller downplayed a discussion about the post as a “distraction,” trying to draw a comparison to the criticisms Trump has faced from Democrats “ever since he came down the escalator” in announcing his first presidential bid in 2015. “I haven’t discussed that with the president, I don’t know if the president even saw the comment that was on there, or simply the picture. That’s not something I have asked,” Miller said Thursday on CNN. That it hasn’t seen or discussed specific posts with the former president is often the defense Trump’s campaign uses when it comes to the more extreme posts he makes on Truth Social, and harkens back to GOP attempts to brush aside Trump’s statements on Twitter while he was in office by using the same claim. That social media silo has also made it easier for the general public to disengage with some of the former president’s more bombastic posts. Instead of an X post that receives hundreds of thousands of likes, Trump’s Truth Social account, which sometimes sees over a hundred posts in a single day, are often unanimously applauded by a few thousands supporters on the app. There could be a danger for Trump with the broader electorate if those highly charged posts do break through to a wider audience, former Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo told MSNBC on Thursday. “This attack is so, just, beneath a campaign, especially a presidential campaign, that it does make sense for the Harris campaign to ignore it and to allow it to speak for itself,” Curbelo said. “Ultimately, this ends up hurting him with the types of swing voters who will ultimately decide this election.” Trump’s posts to Truth Social stand in stark contrast to his presence on other social media platforms. His most controversial posts on Truth Social don’t appear on his X account, which has more than 90 million followers. Instead, he’s recently touted a new crypto project, shared campaign ads and graphics, boosted his media appearances and other projects, while also criticizing Harris and the Justice Department after a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Trump for election interference in response to a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. On TikTok, which Trump joined in June after trying to ban the app while in office, he has similarly posted content that is relatively tame by comparison. In several direct-to-camera videos to his 10.7 million followers, the former president railed against inflation, promised to make the U.S. “a safe nation again,” and repeated catchphrases including “too big to rig” and “make America great again.” His YouTube channel, which has 3.2 million subscribers, similarly posts attack ads, Trump’s Fox news appearances and his speeches. Trump comparatively has 7.6 million followers on Truth Social, where his posts can rack up a few thousand reposts and tens of thousands of interactions. Trump’s presidency was defined in part by his near-constant presence on X. He’d frequently spar with rivals at all hours of the day and night, and upend news cycles by announcing new policies or making personnel changes at a moment’s notice. But after spending much of the end of the 2020 election cycle, and the months after it, repeatedly stoking false claims the election had been stolen from him, he was banned from the platform, then Twitter, two days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The company said it had “permanently suspended” Trump, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence.” Trump retreated to Truth Social, which he launched in February 2022, and has since made it his digital home base. After some initial growth, the app has struggled to attract users, and the company behind the app has seen its share price drop in recent weeks. Elon Musk reinstated Trump’s account in November 2022 after he bought the platform.

It's easy to tell Kris Austin and Marvin McKenzy love cooking good BBQ.

So, it's just like, you step out on faith, you put everything in there, and you wait to see the reaction, to see what happened,\" Austin said. \"But every weekend, 15 minutes here, that line starts to work its way down the corner. So we're thankful. We're super thankful.\" This is A&M BBQ in Sebastapol, California, owned by Kris Austin, the \"A,\" and Marvin Mckenzy, the \"M.\" \"So A&M BBQ is a Texas style BBQ restaurant, and we serve pretty much everything that you'll find out the Texas menu,\" Austin said. \"From brisket to spare ribs to tri tip, which is in California -- California brisket, I should say. And then we do pork. We do oxtail. We do pretty much everything.

When McKenzy moved to California, he started cooking at a local restaurant, never thinking he'd have his own. \"I took food there and people were like, 'When you're gonna open a restaurant?'

We started this business with $25,000, and we've been scratching and working our butts off every single week since then,\" Austin said. Lines outside the restaurant start forming well before A&M opens. Once it does, the food often is gone in hours. \"No matter what we cook, can't beat the clock. So, like, our hours say 11 to six, but really it's until we sell out of food. So we have not made it to six o'clock since we started. And we've tried.

The old viral clip shows 18-year-old Caitlin “Caite” Upton, who was Miss South Carolina Teen USA at the time, flubbing an answer after being asked about Americans’ knowledge of geography. Vance posted the video on X and wrote: “BREAKING: I have gotten ahold of the full Kamala Harris CNN interview.” Upton, who has since appeared on “The Amazing Race” and in a number of commercials, has said that she dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts over the fallout from the incident. In 2015, she told New York Magazine that she “went through a period where I was very, very depressed.” “I had some very dark moments where I thought about committing suicide,” she told the magazine, beginning to tear up. She added: “Sorry, it’s just really emotional. This is the first time I’ve actually been able to talk about it. It was awful, and it was every single day for a good two years.” On Friday morning, Vance told CNN that he was not aware that Upton had contemplated suicide and said that he hoped she is doing well. The Ohio senator went on to say that it would be best to just laugh it off. “Look, I’ve said a lot of things on camera; I’ve said a lot of stupid things on camera,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re in the public eye, you make mistakes. And again, I think the best way to deal with it is to laugh at ourselves, laugh at this stuff and try to have some fun in politics.” Vance also took issue with being asked about the post instead of the “real” crises facing American families, lamenting that “politics has gotten way too lame” and “way too boring.” “You can have some fun while making a good argument to the American people about how you’re going to improve their lives,” he said. When asked if he would apologize, given what he now knows about Upton, Vance replied: Vance’s attempt at scoring internet points — and then his refusal to apologize — was not received well, including by Upton herself. In a post on X on Friday morning, she wrote: “It’s a shame that 17 years later this is still being brought up. There’s not too much else to say about it at this point. Regardless of political beliefs, one thing I do know is that social media and online bullying needs to stop.” Upton’s account appears to have since been deleted.","summary":"Vance tried to mock Harris by posting a clip of Caitlin ”Caite” Upton, who faced years of ridicule after she verbally stumbled during the Miss Teen USA 2007 event.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-meme-miss-teen-usa-caitlin-upton-rcna169003","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240829-Caitlin-Upton-Vance-aa-1228p-931743.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:17:44","author":"Clarissa-Jan Lim","authors":["Clarissa-Jan Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":255294432,"title":"Gwen Walz Uses ‘English Teacher Voice’ to Tear into JD Vance","text":"Gwen Walz made her debut as a solo campaigner for her husband Tim and his running mate Kamala Harris Friday with a pointed attack on his Republican rival JD Vance. Walz, the first lady of Minnesota and a former English teacher, took aim at Vance for his latest attack on childless women, this time when it was revealed that he slammed a teachers’ union leader for not having a “single child.” The attack on Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, had been made by Vance at a Christian forum in 2021 with the audio unearthed this week by the left-leaning Heartland Signal. “Randi Weingarten, who’s the head of the most powerful teachers’ union in the country, she doesn’t have a single child,” Vance said in 2021. “If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.” Weingarten herself called the comments “nonsensical” and pointed out that she considers herself a mother by marriage to her wife’s two biological children. But on Friday Walz used that as crowd-pleasing material as she addressed an Educators for Harris-Walz event in Manassas, Virginia—and also used it to reference her and her husband’s struggles with infertility, which had caused him to trip up on the form of fertility treatment they used. “For a long time Tim and I were teachers who struggled with infertility and we were only able to start a family because of fertility treatment,” she said, according to footage from NBC News. “So this is really personal for me, and I think it is for millions of Americans. “So let me use my teacher voice,” she added to cheers. “English teachers, you know what these babies are for,” she said as she put on reading glasses. “Mr. Vance, how about you mind your own business?” Walz did not mention that she had had to correct the record over the couple’s fertility journey after her husband repeatedly said they used IVF—which is controversial in pro-life circles and has been effectively driven out of use in Alabama in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade—when they used a less contentious form of treatment, IUI (Intra-Uterine Injection). Her more than 20-minute speech suggests that the campaign wants to see her hit more solo events and tell her and her husband’s story, majoring on their careers as teachers, as well as hitting at Vance. It was her husband’s verdict on Vance as “weird” which played a key part in putting him on the ticket with Vice Pres. Kamala Harris. The presence of Walz on the campaign trail solo adds a new dimension to the vice-presidential race and presents a contrast to Vance’s wife Usha, who has not been seen with him since the Republican National Convention and whose contribution to supporting him in public after that has been a single Fox News interview in which she defended his “childless cat ladies” insult to single women.

A top United Nations (UN) aid official meanwhile questioned “what has become of our basic humanity”, as the war raged on in Gaza and humanitarian operations struggle to respond. The UN has warned the military operation which Israel launched in the West Bank early Wednesday is “fuelling an already explosive situation” in the territory and has pressed Israel to end it. In the United States, Vice President Kamala Harris pledged she will not change Washington’s policy of supplying weapons to Israel if elected to the top job in November. But she stressed it was time to “end this war”. Israel has killed at least 19 Palestinians since Wednesday, the military and the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The military said it killed three Hamas militants in an air strike near the northern city of Jenin yesterday. Witnesses told AFP the strike hit a car in the town of Zababdeh, southeast of the city. Israeli troops pulled back from other West Bank towns late on Thursday but fighting raged on around Jenin, long a hub of militant activity. The AFP journalist reported loud explosions from the city’s refugee camp and thick plumes of smoke rising from the area. In Gaza, Israeli artillery pounded western areas of Gaza City early yesterday, an AFP journalist said, while a medical source at the southern Nasser Hospital said an Israeli strike killed three people near the southern city of Khan Yunis. The World Health Organization said Israel had agreed to at least three days of “humanitarian pauses” in parts of Gaza, starting tomorrow, to facilitate a vaccination drive after the first case of polio in a quarter of a century was recorded in the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the measures were “not a ceasefire”. The Israeli assault in the West Bank has caused significant destruction, especially in Tulkarem, whose governor Mustafa Taqatqa described the raids as “unprecedented” and a “dangerous signal”. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club advocacy group said at least 45 people had been detained in the West Bank since Wednesday. The UN said on Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began. In Gaza, Israeli shelling in the Jabalia refugee camp killed two people yesterday, the civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory said. The UN had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza on Monday due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir el-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers. “More than 88 per cent of Gaza’s territory has come under an (Israeli) order to evacuate at some point,” the acting head of the UN humanitarian office Joyce Msuya. She said civilians were being forced into just 11 per cent of the Gaza Strip, already one of the most densely populated territories in the world before the war. “What we have witnessed over the past 11 months… calls into question the world’s commitment to the international legal order that was designed to prevent these tragedies,” Msuya said. “It forces us to ask: what has become of our basic sense of humanity?”","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/israel-air-strike-kills-three-palestinians-on-third-day-of-west-bank-raid/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P23-A_31082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:07:39","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":255297874,"title":"Texas Responds to Maria Bartiromo's Migrants Voter Claims","text":"Texan authorities have firmly rejected Fox News host Maria Bartiromo's suggestion that migrants have been registered to vote outside a number of Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) facilities across the state.The claims were branded \"simply false\" by a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety speaking to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.Prominent Republicans, including the party's 2024 presidential nominee Donald Trump, have repeatedly suggested migrants are being signed up to vote after arriving in the U.S. despite American citizenship being required to vote in federal elections.

Since taking over the Democratic nomination, Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for not only abstaining from interviews, but for being opaque about what her platform would actually be if she became president. In some areas of policy, she has been accused of flip-flopping or even copying former President Trump. CNN's Phil Mattingly pointed out that Harris’ allies also advise that the candidate stick to talking broadly rather than on the specifics of policy. \"One of the interesting things when you talk to Democrats about where the vice president stands on specific things, you hear from some saying, look, don’t get into the weeds on the policy issues, focus on character, focus on values, as the vice president repeatedly said last night,\" Mattingly said of Harris’ interview on Thursday. \"Is that an effective strategy? Not actually detailing an agenda, but instead kind of talking more 30,000 foot?\" VP HARRIS MOCKED FOR BEING 'TOO SCARED' TO DO INTERVIEW WITHOUT WALZ: 'SHE SIMPLY CANNOT BE LEFT UNATTENDED' \"It has been effective in American history,\" Naftali confirmed. \"Franklin Roosevelt ran on the New Deal, of course, he was running at a time of economic collapse, and he was running against an incumbent. But he didn’t actually say what the New Deal was. Indeed, his ideas about what a New Deal should be in 1932 were — would be very different by the time it was 1934, ‘35.\" He went on to note how both Republicans and Democrats have benefited from vibes-based campaigning. \"John F. Kennedy ran promising to make the country move again. Well, how vague is that? He ran a vibes campaign for the most part in 1960. Richard Nixon in 1968 promised to end the war in Vietnam, but didn’t say how we would do it. He said he had a secret plan. He was as vague as he could be, again, saying, ‘I’m different from the people in power. I’m different from LBJ.’\" He then mentioned a far more recent example, recalling how \"Barack Obama promised change. He did promise some policy changes, of course, but he was basically saying ‘We’ve had enough with the Bush administration. We’ve had enough with its wars.’ So historically, a vibes campaign can be very effective, a campaign that is light on policy can be effective.\" TRUMP CAMPAIGN TROLLS HARRIS, RELEASES POLICY WEBSITE FOR HER AFTER WEEKS OF SILENCE The one twist with this current election, Naftali argued, is that Harris is running as a change candidate while already serving alongside the current president. \"The challenge, of course, for Vice President Harris is that she’s actually in the administration at the moment,\" he said. \"She has to explain a little bit better how she’s going to approach the border issue and why it took, you know, three years to implement that executive order.

By Andy Mannix The Minnesota Star Tribune August 30, 2024 at 10:00PM Minnesota National Guard members on May 30, 2020, maintain a position on Lake Street in Minneapolis protecting nearby firefighters in the wake of the death of George Floyd. (David Joles/The Minnesota Star Tribune) A government watchdog nonprofit is suing to compel the Minnesota Department of Public Safety to turn over records showing how state officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, responded to protests and rioting in 2020. Public Record Media (PRM), a nonpartisan organization, filed a request for records of interviews conducted as part of an after-action assessment of the state’s handling of the civil unrest. Two years later, the state still hasn’t produced the records, according to the civil suit filed in Ramsey County District Court on Thursday, which alleges violation of public data law. PRM member Matt Ehling said he hopes the lawsuit will spur more transparency about how Walz and others acted during a “consequential moment in Minnesota history,” as well as reveal why the state has stalled in responding to a “simple data request.” “I can’t stress enough that we have seen these kinds of problems growing over time, especially in this administration,” said Ehling, speaking Friday to reporters at the State Capitol. He cited examples that he said show the Walz administration’s focus on “narrative control,” including other failures to provide public records related to state agencies. “That’s why we bring these challenges in court,” Ehling said. “It’s important to make the point in a legal proceeding, where these agencies can actually be held accountable for their actions, that this is not acceptable.” (Andy Mannix) Since Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate, Walz has faced attacks from Republicans alleging he didn’t do enough to quell the unrest ignited by the police murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. The riots caused an estimated $500 million in damage to Twin Cities buildings, culminating on May 28 with the torching of the Third Precinct police station. Walz ultimately imposed a citywide curfew and deployed the Minnesota National Guard; the soldiers and other law enforcement snuffed out most of the violence by May 30. In a statement, Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said the governor takes transparency seriously. “Our office has provided tens of thousands of pages of data and have added staff and technology to more quickly respond to data requests. We also have to carefully review these requests to ensure we comply with the law and protect employees’ personal information and sensitive government data.” Howie Padilla, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, said the office acknowledged the public interest in data related to the unrest. “DPS is actively working to review and process the data involved in this request. While we recognize that this process has taken longer than anticipated, it is critical to ensure that the information provided is accurate, complete and complies with all applicable laws.” According to the lawsuit, on Aug. 18, 2022, PRM filed a request for data created as part of the state-contracted Wilder Foundation’s external review of the riots. The report concluded that a lack of “clear, experienced” leadership during the destruction bred confusion and delayed a coordinated response. PRM, a nonprofit organization, asked for transcripts and audio recordings related to interviews with Walz and other high-ranking state officials. The Wilder Foundation is a private organization, but Ehling said the work product related to the contract should be covered under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. “Data sought by PRM often focuses on documenting governmental decisionmaking,” the civil complaint says. “When such data is received by PRM, it is made available to the public and the press so that government actions can be scrutinized and better understood.” PRM sent follow-up requests for the records after Walz joined the Harris ticket. In several emails in mid-August, Kim Parker, general counsel for the Department of Public Safety, said the Wilder Foundation possesses the data, and not the state, according to the civil complaint. The lawsuit says this response contradicts the terms of the contract, which say all documents related to the investigation must be returned to the state upon completion of the work. PRM is asking a judge to order the state to comply with the request and to award monetary damages to the organization.","summary":"Public Record Media says the state has violated Minnesota public data law by refusing to turn over data related to an after-action report after more than two years.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/lawsuit-state-leaders-are-illegally-withholding-records-on-tim-walzs-riot-response/601135130","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/NE74KELGCVDH3EOAE6SOC6BOFQ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:00:24","author":"Andy Mannix","authors":["Andy Mannix"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":255300268,"title":"JD Vance's New Jab at Harris, Shares 2007 Miss Teen USA Clip of Her Struggling to Answer a Question","text":"In a new low, JD Vance hit at Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, with yet another sexist dig. In reaction to Harris's first in-person interview with a professional journalist since the Democrats nominated her for president, the Ohio senator, who is now the running mate for Republican candidate, Donald Trump shared an iconic video of Kamala Harris as a 2007 Miss Teen USA contestant having difficulty responding to a question. Vance captioned his post, \"BREAKING: I have gotten a hold of the full Kamala Harris CNN interview.\" In the video, the South Carolina teen was asked, \"Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map. Why do you think this is?\" Upton's stuttering received massive backlash and fueled speculations that Americans are bad at geography. She answered, \"I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because...some people out there in our nation don't have maps and...I believe that our...education like such as...South Africa and...Iraq and everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should...our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. ...should help South Africa and should help Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future.\" Later in an interview with TODAY, Upton sat down with hosts Matt Lauer and Ann Curry and wondered if that was really her. \"I am sitting here laughing at myself. Is that really me? It's like I am not in my actual body.\" She admitted that the question caught her off-guard and consequently, she froze up and barely processed the question in her mind. \"Everything did come at me at once. And I made a mistake — everybody makes a mistake — I am human. Right when the question was asked of me, I was in shock...I would love to re-answer that question,\" she added. She may have slipped back then, but for this interview, she came prepared. \"Personally, my friends and I...we know exactly where the United States is on a map. I don't know anyone else who doesn't. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more emphasis on geography in our education so people will learn how to read maps better.\" Meanwhile, this isn't the first for Vance.

Or, really, on anything else: Dana Bash pushed her twice to reveal her Day One agenda; she dodged — then Walz did, too. She insisted her “values have not changed,” but the only thing we know about her values is her record as a lefty California Democrat and her choice of impeccably-progressive Walz as her running mate. She still doesn’t have a policy section on her campaign website. And the centerpiece of the “economic plan” she announced just before the Democratic convention was price controls — which, when pretty much everyone dumped on the idea, her campaign quickly announced are not a major policy. Yet, the one time inflation came up in the interview, Harris fell back again on opposing “price gouging.” She also implicitly admitted the “Inflation Control Act” was mainly just Green New Deal spending, by citing it as her excuse for no longer endorsing the GND or a ban on fracking. Indeed, she seemed intent on protecting her left flank with her word-salad that she’s “always believed” that “the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.” Deadlines “around time” — are there any other kind? Crucially, she fully defended Bidenomics, and certainly hasn’t offered any other distinct economic policy beyond those now-disavowed price controls. She’s called for trillions in new federal spending, and is on record favoring trillions more in tax hikes, so sure seems to be promising more of what Biden delivered. Despite that, she claims she’ll be different, with another hefty helping of salad: She aims “to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward, and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies.” “The last decade” covers two years of Barack Obama’s presidency (with Joe as veep!) plus four years each of Trump and then Biden. What part of Obama and Biden does she want to “turn the page” on? Word salad isn’t simple incoherence: It’s what you get when you talk at length while avoiding facts and firm convictions, offering only vibes. And Tim “My grammar’s not always correct” Walz isn’t going to offer anything more. Most of the media seem intent on letting them get away with it, but we’re pretty sure the voters have a higher standard.","summary":"Our biggest single takeaway from CNN’s brief Kamala Harris-Tim Walz interview Thursday night: Harris still has nothing meaningful anything to say.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/opinion/cnn-interview-shows-kamala-harris-has-nothing-to-say-on-inflation-or-anything-else/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/vice-president-kamala-harris-minnesota-88534581_1561a1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:54:53","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":255294264,"title":"Why nobody believes Trump’s flip-flop on abortion and IVF","text":"On Thursday evening, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz sat down with CNN for their first TV interview since they became the top of the Democratic ticket. Naturally, Harris faced questions about her shifting stance on fracking, a key industry in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania. The vice president weathered the grilling well, firmly defending her change of heart. “I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 that I would not ban fracking, as vice president I did not ban fracking, as president I will not ban fracking,” Harris told CNN anchor Dana Bash. “I’m very clear about where I stand.” Overall, it was an uncontroversial, do-no-harm interview that made little news — which is exactly what Harris needed. The same cannot be said of Donald Trump. On Thursday, at a rally in Potterville, Michigan, the former president — who’s been under fire for his party’s attacks on abortions rights — made a surprising pledge to force insurance companies to pay for in vitro fertilization. Democrats have repeatedly hammered Republicans on IVF since Alabama’s supreme court briefly put the treatment on hold in the state. Earlier in the day, a reporter for NBC News asked Trump — who has also been all over the place on abortion issues — how he would vote on Florida’s upcoming amendment that would enshrine abortion rights. He responded by saying the state’s six-week ban is “too short” and that “there has to be more time.” “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, quickly went into clean-up mode. “President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida, he simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,” she said in a statement. Trump’s comments weren’t well received by some of the anti-abortion activists who are among his supporters. Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life America, blasted his take on X. “So, President Trump clearly doesn’t want to be pro-life anymore,” she posted. “Got it. Pro-lifers are being screwed. We need to demand Trump re-consider.” “But don’t let this screw the babies we are fighting for,” she warned. “Vote against Kamala Harris.” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, said that when she spoke with Trump directly, he did not commit to how he would vote on the Trump amendment. “President Trump has consistently opposed abortions after five months of pregnancy,” she said. “Amendment 4 would allow abortion past this point. Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position.” By Thursday, Trump told Fox News that he would vote against the amendment in Florida, accusing Democrats of wanting to allow abortion up until the ninth month of pregnancy. “All of that stuff is unacceptable so I will be voting no for that reason,” he said. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, a fierce abortion opponent, suddenly had audio issues when CNN asked him about Trump’s position on abortion on Friday, which led to the channel cutting to a break. Meanwhile, Democrats aren’t getting too excited about Trump’s vague IVF promises. “There is nothing in what Trump says that actually reverses the underlying policy,” Senator Elizabeth Warren said on a press call. “Nowhere do Trump and Vance stand up and say they will support a federal law to protect access to IVF.” She pointed out that Vance had voted against Senate legislation that would have protected access to IVF. Trump’s comments don’t hold much water with Democrats, who believe little of what he says in terms of abortion protections since he’s continuously bragged about being the person who killed Roe v Wade, namely through nominating three Supreme Court justices who created the 6-3 majority that facilitated the Dobbs v Jackson decision. Even during the one debate between Trump and President Joe Biden, Trump bragged about killing Roe. Many of the abortion bans in red states only exist because of the Dobbs decision. That makes his backpedalling on abortion even more bitter for social conservatives who trusted him on the issue. Trump, a thrice-married former casino owner, seemed like an imperfect vessel to usher in their plans. Now, he seems almost ashamed about his accomplishments as he recognizes that abortion is a political loser for Republicans, even in his adopted home state of Florida. The relationship between evangelicals and anti-abortion Republicans always resembled that of a shotgun wedding. Now, evangelicals are just the latest partner Trump is accused of cheating on. -Alex Woodward contributed reporting","summary":"Trump’s recent comments weren’t well received by the fierce anti-abortion activists who are among his supporters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-flip-flop-abortion-ivf-b2604712.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/30/18/Election_2024_Trump_92429.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PqTPhVzD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:50:42","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.545},{"id":255295756,"title":"Gabbard advises Trump to go after Harris’s ‘character’ during debate","text":"Now Gabbard has this advice for former President Donald Trump before his debate against Harris next month: Make your case against the vice president based on her character. “It’s about her character,” Gabbard told the Washington Examiner. “That was really what I exposed in that debate in 2019 when we were both candidates running for president, was her hypocrisy and how she would say one thing and do another. She would hold people, the people, to one standard and hold herself to a different standard. I challenged her on the record that she claimed to be proud of, and she had nothing to say to defend that record. Not much has changed between then and now.” Gabbard’s advice is somewhat at odds with other Trump supporters who are imploring the former president to criticize Harris’s policies rather than her personality. But, on the sidelines of the Moms for Liberty National Summit in Washington, the Army Reserve officer contended he could do both. “If I can be helpful to him in any way, it really is just sharing the experience that I’ve had with her on the debate stage and how she will try to hide, deflect away from, distract away from the truth, the truth about who she is and her record, and the fact that the policies, at least so far that she has talked about just a little bit, stand diametrically opposed to her record,” she said. “She is a fake person who cannot be trusted and who cares only about herself and her political ambition and not about the American people.” During an interview, Gabbard provided scant details on Trump’s debate preparation, with which she is helping him before his Sept. 10 matchup with Harris on ABC. The former president told reporters this week that he is “not spending a lot of time on it.” “I think my whole life, I’ve been preparing for a debate,” Trump said. “Basically, you have to be real. You can’t cram 30 years of knowledge in your head in one week. There’s a little debate prep, but I’ve always done it more or less the same way.” In 2019, Gabbard accused Harris of prosecuting more than 1,500 people for marijuana offenses when she was San Francisco‘s district attorney and California’s attorney general and then laughing when she was asked by The Breakfast Club radio program that year “if she ever smoked marijuana.” Gabbard then alleged Harris “blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so” when she was the state’s attorney general. Gabbard was referring to the 1983 quadruple murder case of Kevin Cooper after Harris’s office declined to order advanced DNA testing. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA)’s decision to do so has not overturned Cooper’s conviction so far. However, the courts never demanded that Harris conduct the tests, according to the Washington Post. But, five years later, Gabbard is more focused on Harris’s vice presidency and is encouraging Trump to do the same on the debate stage. “She’s been the vice president of the United States for the last 3 1/2 years, a breath away from the presidency, someone who she says is the last person in the room with President [Joe] Biden when he’s making a decision,” Gabbard said. “She has cast more tiebreaking votes in the United States Senate than any other vice president in history. She has not been some passive person sitting in the corner. She is responsible for every policy that the Biden-Harris administration has pushed forward in these last 3 1/2 years, policies that she has said time and time again she is proud of, touting their success. “It’s not about tying her to Biden, it’s tying her to her own record,” she added. “She has very intentionally tied herself as vice president to Joe Biden, pointing out, both of them, that there is no space between them when it comes to policy, that they were a team, that they did everything together. This is about holding her to account for her record and sharing the truth with the American people that Kamala Harris is trying to hide with her lies.” Gabbard argued that Harris’s Democratic Party is not the party that she and another former Democrat-turned-Trump-endorser, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., were part of for so long. In addition to embroiling the U.S. in “multiple wars,” Gabbard cited what she called “tyrannical” aspects of the Biden-Harris administration regarding censorship “through proxies like Facebook and Meta” and increasing economic hardship across the country. “President Trump is showing that he has the ability to bring people together who may not agree on every issue, may have strong disagreements on a few or many issues, but who are coming together around the most fundamental, important issues to us as Americans in peace and freedom,” she said. Gabbard predicted the 2024 election could have echoes of 2016 in that some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) voted for Trump over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that cycle, particularly because of the economy. Gabbard, herself, resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to endorse Sanders that year but cast a ballot for Clinton in the fall. “Why is that? Because they saw what many people are seeing now,” Gabbard said. “You saw some of the populist policies of Bernie Sanders or some of the populist policies that President Trump had then and continues to have now, fighting for the working man and woman in our country. He’s talking about no taxes on tips, no taxes on Social Security. He’s talking about the people who are struggling to survive right now in this tough economic environment that’s been created by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.” Besides the debate, Gabbard is also helping Trump appeal to independents, including by hosting a town hall with him in La Crosse, Wisconsin, the night before she sat down with the Washington Examiner, as Harris makes her own pitch. Gabbard approved, too, of the former president’s recent appearances on podcasts. “It’s reaching people however and wherever we can,” she said. “People are consuming information, media, in a lot of different ways right now.” Shortly after Gabbard endorsed Trump, the former president announced she and Kennedy would be members of his transition team. Although the team has not yet met, Gabbard hoped Trump’s Day One priorities would include undermining the “national security state” and cutting to “the heart of the swamp of Washington.” “That includes elected politicians and a whole lot of unelected bureaucrats in the administrative state who unfortunately have gotten to a point where they believe that they are more important and more powerful than the voices of the people and that they will do what is in their best interest at the cost of our liberty,” she said.

This actor explains it in 82 seconds","text":"Here’s a great clip to share with friends and family if you want to talk about Donald Trump’s tax plans. In a short video posted Friday, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt—a two-time Emmy winner who has been working since childhood and is in the top 1% of earners—explains why he doesn't want the $70,000 tax break Trump wants to give wealthy people like him. “So Donald Trump wants to give me $70,000 in tax cuts, per year, Gordon-Levitt says. “And by the way, he doesn’t want to give that to everybody, but I just read that’s the average tax break for the top 1%, if Donald Trump is elected president.” The “3rd Rock from the Sun” star goes on to point out that regular, middle-class people are not going to benefit from this because “nearly half of it is gonna go to just the top 5% of people.” “It doesn’t feel right to me,” he continues. You don’t have to take Gordon-Levitt’s word for it. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a group within the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, analyzed both Vice President Kamala Harris’ and Trump’s tax proposals last week. \"It's true that Trump looks like he's a winner for everybody, but he'll provide much bigger giveaways to the top 1% and top 0.1%, whereas Harris will be negative for these people,\" Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Wharton program, told CBS News Friday. According to their analysis, people making $81,415 annually would get $1,740 in breaks, while people earning $19,595 would get just $320 in Trump’s plan. “Do you want to talk about who’s going to really help most Americans? It’s Kamala,” Gordon-Levitt says in his video. And he’s right, according to Wharton. That bottom quintile of earners would see $2,355 in tax relief, and those in the middle, $2,165. The top 0.1% who would get a $376,910 gift from Trump, but would have to pay an additional $167,255 in Harris’ plan. As the “Inception” actor says, “Trump’s going to help the same people he always tries to help—the wealthy, himself.” “So Mr. Trump, thank you, but no thanks.” Your $5 or more to help Harris-Walz win could more than pay for itself in taxes! That's a good deal.","summary":"Here’s a great clip to share with friends and family if you want to talk about Donald Trump’s tax plans. \n\n\n\nIn a short&nbsp;video posted Friday, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt—a two-time Emmy winner who has been working since childhood and is in the top 1% of earners—explains why he doesn't want the $70,000 tax break Trump wants to give wealthy people like him.","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/8/30/2266857/-What-s-in-Trump-s-tax-plan-This-actor-explains-it-in-82-seconds?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1340168/story_image/GettyImages-2022144066.jpg?1725049011","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:45:03","author":"Joan McCarter","authors":["Joan McCarter"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.122},{"id":255302952,"title":"Trump wants to make the GOP a 'leader' on IVF. Republicans' actions make that a tough sell","text":"CHICAGO - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's vow to promote in vitro fertilization by forcing health insurance companies or the federal government to pay for the treatments is at odds with the actions of much of his own party. Yet his surprising announcement Thursday reveals the former president's realization that GOP stances on abortion and reproductive rights could be huge liabilities for his chances of returning to the White House. Trump has quickly tried to reframe the narrative around those issues after Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all top stories Even before he made his coverage proposal, Trump had been promoting the idea that the Republican Party is a “leader” on IVF. That characterization is rejected by Democrats, who have seized on the common but expensive fertility treatment as another dimension of reproductive rights threatened by Republicans and a second Trump presidency. It's not just political partisans. “Republicans are not leaders on IVF,” said Katie Watson, a medical ethics professor at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Some of them have posed a threat to IVF, and they’re currently trying to figure out how to be anti-abortion and pro-IVF, and there are internal inconsistencies and struggles there. It appears that the Republicans are careening to remedy the political damage that resulted from their own choices.” Trump's proposal, which he announced without providing details, illustrates how reproductive rights have become central in this year's presidential race. It's also the latest example of the former president attempting to appear moderate on the issue, despite repeatedly boasting about appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion. Even as the Republican Party has attempted to create a national narrative that it's receptive of in vitro fertilization, many Republicans have been left grappling with the innate tension between support for the procedure and for laws passed by their own party that grant legal personhood not only to fetuses but to any embryos that are destroyed in the IVF process. The messaging efforts also have been undercut by state lawmakers, Republican-dominated courts and anti-abortion leaders within the party’s ranks, as well as opposition to legislative attempts to protect IVF access. Ahead of the Republican National Convention in July, the Republican Party adopted a policy platform that supports states establishing fetal personhood through the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which grants equal protection under the law to all American citizens. The platform also encourages supporting IVF but does not explain how the party plans to do so while also encouraging fetal personhood laws that would render the treatment illegal. In May, the Texas Republican Party’s platform committee narrowly rejected a proposal to classify embryos created through IVF as “human beings” and designate their destruction as “homicide.” A bill aimed at expanding IVF access, meanwhile, sailed through in California on Thursday, despite opposition from nearly all Republican lawmakers. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois who shared her own IVF journey on the Senate floor and co-sponsored a bill to protect the treatment, slammed Republicans for saying they support IVF in campaigning but not backing that up with their votes. She added that Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump “paved the way” for the fall of Roe v. Wade and the impact on reproductive rights, including access to IVF. “Republicans publicly claiming to be in support of IVF is absurd,” she told the AP. The issue burst onto the national political landscape in February after the all-Republican Alabama Supreme Court granted frozen embryos the legal rights of children. That decision forced clinics in Alabama to pause their IVF treatments, devastating patients struggling to be parents. Soon after, and facing a national backlash, Alabama’s Republican governor signed legislation shielding doctors from legal liability so IVF procedures could continue. In the weeks after the Alabama ruling, congressional Republicans scrambled to address IVF. Many rushed to create a unified message of support despite histories of voting in favor of fetal personhood laws and arguing that life begins at conception, the same concept that upheld the Alabama decision. “The reality is you cannot protect IVF and champion fetal personhood — they are fundamentally incompatible — and the American people won’t be fooled by another one of Donald Trump’s lies,” Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the Right to IVF bill, told The Associated Press. Republican Sens. Katie Britt and Ted Cruz introduced a bill this year to prohibit states from receiving Medicaid funding if they ban the procedure. But that came after Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have made IVF a federal right. All Republicans except Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine voted against the measure. “It’s not easy for a Republican lawmaker to say they’re for IVF and actually mean it in a straightforward, tangible way without angering a lot of constituents,” said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. An AP-NORC poll conducted in June found that more than 6 in 10 U.S. adults support protecting access to IVF, including more than half of Republicans, and only about 1 in 10 are opposed. But many anti-abortion groups and some lawmakers oppose the treatment, including several members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus who have objected to expanding IVF access for veterans. At least 23 bills aiming to establish fetal personhood have been introduced in 13 states so far this legislative session, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. This type of legislation, all proposed by Republican lawmakers, is based on the idea that life begins at fertilization and could imperil fertility treatments that involve the storage, transportation and destruction of embryos. Still, many GOP lawmakers have been vocal in their support for IVF. The issue is personal for Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who shared his daughter’s IVF experience. But even though Johnson said he fully supports IVF, he was not completely sold on Trump's proposal due to its possible price tag. Other Republican lawmakers who responded publicly after Trump’s announcement expressed similar concerns. “I would need to see cost estimates, impacts on insurance rates, etc., before making any decisions or commitments to support any proposal,” Johnson said. Republican lawmakers have historically opposed federal funding to cover health care, including by repeatedly attempting to undo the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, and may be unlikely to support similar plans, including for IVF. Lack of health insurance coverage for fertility treatments has been a major barrier for those wanting to start or continue treatments. While coverage has been expanding in recent years, less than half of employers with 500 or more workers in the U.S. offered IVF coverage in 2023, according to the benefits consultant Mercer. Republican Rep. Michelle Steel of California faced criticism for supporting a GOP bill aiming to grant constitutional protection to embryos at “the moment of fertilization” after she publicly shared her own experience with IVF. Steel rescinded her co-sponsorship of the measure in March, two days after winning her primary, declaring she does not support federal restrictions on IVF. In a statement to the AP, she said Congress “must pass policies to support and expand access to IVF treatments.” Such flip-flopping from Republicans only provides fodder for Democrats, who say Trump and his party can't be trusted to protect reproductive rights. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan, warned voters to “watch what they do, not what they say.”","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's vow to promote in vitro fertilization by forcing health insurance companies or the federal government to pay for the treatments is at odds with the actions of much of his own party.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-wants-to-make-the-gop-a-leader-on-ivf-republicans-actions-make-that-a-tough-sell-1.7020827","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/8/30/trump-1-7020838-1725053857569.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:43:42","author":"Christine Fernando,The Associated Press","authors":["Christine Fernando","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.554},{"id":255298350,"title":"Kamala Harris finally faced the media and said absolutely nothing… she knows she is out of her depth","text":"IT has been more than a month since Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for President of the United States.

Bush rally: records","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made up major aspects of the so-called “origin story” of his political career, in which he was ostensibly turned away from a 2004 re-election campaign rally for President George W. Bush and promptly vowed to run for public office. Walz, then a high school geography teacher, has alleged that he and two of his students were held up by security and “denied entry” to the event because one of the youths had a sticker on his wallet supporting Bush’s opponent, then-Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). However, the Washington Examiner reported Friday, citing sources and high school records, that neither of the teens were Walz’s students and were not refused a spot at the Bush rally because of the Kerry sticker. Walz also was not a disinterested observer of the 2004 race, having picketed Bush as a “Veteran for Kerry” days before the campaign event in Mankato. “It’s clear he was politically involved before that moment,” Chris Faulkner, a former Bush campaign aide who worked the rally in question, told the Examiner. “He was protesting in front of the ticket distribution center. It’s all bulls–t.” “He was looking for an origin story,” Faulkner added of Walz. “And he made one up.” The students, Matt Klaber and Nick Burkhart, had initially been denied tickets to an earlier Bush event “after making unfavorable comments” about the 43rd president, according to a contemporary news report by a local CBS affiliate, which prompted Republican campaign aides to reach back out and offer them tickets to a later rally. In a Twitter post on Aug. 6, after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Klaber said his and Burkhart’s families had asked the future Democratic governor to escort them to the event. At the time, Klaber was a graduate of Mankato West Senior High School, where Walz taught — though he never took a class with him — and was a member of the Gustavus College Democrats. Burkhart graduated from a different high school, Mankato East, according to the Examiner. On the day, while the group waited in line, Bush campaign staffers told them that Klaber and Burkhart had been flagged as threats to cause a disruption by the Secret Service and could not go in. Walz, however, reportedly was admitted to the event — despite later claiming the snub by the Bush campaign helped him spontaneously decide to throw his lot in with Kerry and become a campaign aide. During his successful 2006 run for Congress, for which Klaber and Burkhart volunteered, Walz would recount his indignation over the incident. “As a soldier, I told them I had a right to see my commander in chief,” he was quoted by the Atlantic as saying during one rally that year. Mankato’s then-mayor, John Brady, referenced the rally in a farewell speech for Walz just one month after he won election to the US House of Representatives. Brady claimed that he had a dream on Election Night, intoning “In the dream I heard a voice: ‘You can keep me out of the quarry [the site of the Bush rally], but you can’t keep me out of Washington.’” “He believed everyone should be allowed to see their president, regardless of political affiliation,” an op-ed writer for the Mankato Free Press framed the incident in 2018, shortly after Walz was elected governor of Minnesota. “And being told these students weren’t welcomed in this rally, well, that didn’t seem to Walz like an American thing to do.” “Having just returned from military duty in Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom I wished to hear directly from the President and my students, regardless of political party, deserved to witness the historical moment of a sitting president coming to our city,” Walz piled on in an August 2020 thread on Twitter, now X. “Above all, I was struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming that a veteran & a group of high schoolers would be turned away at the door,” Walz added. “It was at this moment that I decided to run for office. While I had a passion for politics, I had never been overly involved in political campaigns, and many people thought that a high school teacher and football coach didn’t stand a chance.” Months later, Burkhart denied that the Bush aides even noticed his Kerry sticker. “I wasn’t so daft to wear a Kerry sticker to a rally, it was on my wallet, in my pocket,” he posted on X in January 2021. During his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago earlier this month, Walz said his time as a high school football coach and teacher launched his campaign for elected office. “It was those players and my students who inspired me to run for Congress,” he told the Democratic delegates. “They saw in me what I had hoped to instill in them: a commitment to the common good, an understanding that we’re all in this together, and the belief that a single person can make a real difference for their neighbors.” The Harris-Walz campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"“He was looking for an origin story,” one Republican told the Washington Examiner of Walz. “And he made one up.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/tim-walz-fabricated-key-details-of-political-origin-story-involving-george-w-bush-rally-records-show/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88595039.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/APsWwbYH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:39:05","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":255300062,"title":"‘Blacks Must Sit At The Back…’: Racist Anti-Kamala Harris Signs Spotted At Denver Bus Stops","text":"A city bus and other traffic on the streets of downtown Denver, Colorado, circa 2008. | Source: HUM Images / Getty At this point, Donald Trump and the rest of his MAGA constituents have thoroughly indicated that they are incapable of coming up with fresh attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris that aren’t inherently racist. If it’s not Trump and his cohorts continuing to speak on Harris’ racial identity as if it’s any of their Caucasian business, it’s Trump’s campaign sharing racist memes about Black migrants in an effort to scare white America into thinking they’ll be taking over the country under Harris. When MAGA minions aren’t calling Harris a “DEI Hire,” they’re insisting that Harris can’t run for President because of the long-overturned 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that ruled slaves weren’t citizens — an assertion that manages to be more racist than the original “birther” argument Trump and Trump supporters have tried desperately to resurrect against Harris. MORE: MAGA World Freaks Out Over ‘Rigged’ Polls Showing VP Kamala Harris Leading Trump Now, these race-obsessed race-baiters who constantly accuse “the left” of being race-obsessed race-baiters are out here leaving signs at bus stops that read, “Blacks must sit at the back of the us” while “Kamala’s migrants sit at the back,” which appears to be a continuance of white MAGA supporters, including the commander-in-Black-jobs himself, trying desperately to turn Black people against Harris by pitting Black Americans against migrants, which is a tried and true trick of white supremacy. From The Denver Post: Racist and anti-immigrant signs that also targeted Vice President Kamala Harris popped up Thursday in multiple bus stops along Colfax Avenue in Denver and Aurora, and transit agencies in at least one other state reported similar incidents. “I wish I could say I were surprised, but in a year when a Black woman could become POTUS, those with hate in their heart are going to coordinate these kinds of atrocious, expensive campaigns to stir division,” Denver City Councilwoman Shontel Lewis said in a statement on X. The first Denver sign was reported around 5 a.m. Thursday by a bus driver on the pole of a bus stop near the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Oneida Street, according to a news release from Regional Transportation District. The two other signs in Denver were found at Colfax’s intersections with Garfield Street, near St. Joseph’s Medical Center, and with Yosemite Street. Around 8:20 a.m. Thursday, one man in Denver’s Congress Park neighborhood spotted two white women putting up the sign at the bus stop at Colfax and Garfield. “It was one of those things where you know something is out of place, but you don’t know what’s going on,” said Congress Park resident Greg Bell, who recalled passing by two women who were carrying a white stepladder and trash bags he believes were holding the signs while he was on his way to the grocery store. According to the Post, Regional Transportation District (RTD) officials reported similar signs that had appeared recently at bus stops in Chicago. The agency also said Colorado officials were connecting with other agencies across the county to “assess the magnitude of the coordinated racist activity.” Perhaps investigators should start with a right-wing “artist” whose Instagram account features all of the racist signs found in Colorado, including a yellow “caution” sign that read, “Kamala’s Illegals.” More from the Post: An Instagram account linked to Sabo — a right-wing street artist known for controversial art criticizing progressive policies and candidates — posted photos of the three Denver signs and a fourth at the intersection of Nome Street and East Colfax Avenue in Aurora. That intersection is near an Aurora apartment complex recently shut down for city health and building code violations, uprooting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants. The post on the Instagram account that links to Sabo’s UNSAVORYAGENTS website references the apartment closure, standing by claims from building ownership that a Venezuelan gang took over the complex. Aurora police and city officials have repeatedly denied the claims. The Instagram account linked to Sabo includes an Aug. 21 picture of a similar sign the caption states was posted at a bus stop outside the United Center, where the Democratic National Convention was happening. Mind you, Republicans spent an entire night during the Republican National Convention lying about rises in crime in Black neighborhoods and surges in crime caused by undocumented migrants while crime data shows violent crime has done virtually nothing but fall in America over the last five decades, and that there is no evidence of a surge in crime caused by migrants. It’s almost as if these people can’t decide which racial group they want to be racist against during this election year. No worries, though. Once everything is all said and done in November, they’ll likely go back to being equally bigoted against both Black and Brown people.

In her first media interview as the Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris stretched the facts on her past stance on fracking and the number of clean energy jobs created by recent legislation: Harris said she doesn’t want to ban fracking, maintaining that she “made that clear on the debate stage in 2020.” Not exactly. She said in the vice presidential debate that year, “Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” Harris claimed the Inflation Reduction Act has been responsible for $1 trillion in clean energy investments and more than 300,000 clean energy jobs. But not all the funding has come from the IRA, and her jobs figure is an estimate based on announced projects. Harris’ interview with CNN’s Dana Bash aired on Aug. 29. Fracking Asked if she would ban fracking — a position she supported in 2019 — Harris said she would not and maintained she “made that clear on the debate stage in 2020.” Not exactly. She said in the vice presidential debate that year, “Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris about her comment in a September 2019 CNN town hall, when she was running for the presidential nomination and was asked by a climate activist if she would commit to a federal ban on fracking because of environmental concerns for local communities. Harris answered, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, so yes.” Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a technique that uses water, sand or chemicals to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations. In the Aug. 29 interview, Bash asked, “Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania. … Do you still want to ban fracking?” Harris answered: “No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Pressed on the issue, Harris repeated: “In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I’ve not changed that position nor will I going forward.” But in the October 2020 debate — when Harris was Biden’s vice presidential running mate — Harris stated Biden’s position, not her own, saying: “Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that.” She later reiterated that “the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact.” In this week’s interview, Bash asked if there was “some policy or scientific data” that changed Harris’ mind. She responded: “What I have seen is that we can — we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.” Green Jobs Harris claimed the Inflation Reduction Act has been responsible for $1 trillion in clean energy investments and has created more than 300,000 jobs. But not all the funding has come from the Inflation Reduction Act, and her jobs figure is an estimate based on announced projects, not jobs that have been created to date. “The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest, by my calculation, over 10 — probably a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, investing in a clean energy economy,” Harris said. “What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.” Harris has used the $1 trillion figure before, but her total included two other bills, as E&E News reported earlier this year. E&E News, Jan. 22: “When the VP references the roughly $1T historic climate investment, she is referencing all of the clean energy, resilience, environmental justice, and innovation funding that is part of our historic effort to address the climate crisis, increase resilience, advance environmental justice, and build a clean energy economy,” a White House spokesperson told E&E News. As we’ve written before, the Inflation Reduction Act included an estimated $369 billion over the next 10 years for climate change and “energy security.” E&E News writes that “in addition to the IRA, the number includes: $54 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 that went toward manufacturing, research and development; more than $530 billion of new spending in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; and funding increases the administration secured at EPA and the departments of Energy, Transportation and Commerce.” As for Harris’ reference to clean energy jobs, the Harris campaign referred us to a report by Climate Power — an organization that advocates clean energy. In a June 20 report, Climate Power wrote that more than 300,000 jobs were “announced or [have] moved forward” since the Biden administration’s “climate and clean energy investments became law in August 2022.” “Since August 2022, companies have announced or moved forward with projects accounting for more than 312,900 new clean energy jobs for electricians, mechanics, construction workers, technicians, support staff, and many others,” Climate Power said in its report. The Harris campaign also referred us to the U.S. Department of Energy’s annual U.S. Energy and Employment Report for 2023 and 2024. In those reports, the DOE said the U.S. added 114,000 clean energy jobs in 2022 and 142,000 jobs in 2023. But not all of those 256,000 new jobs over the last two years were because of Biden’s policies. The reports said the jobs were due “in large part” to the administration’s policies, without providing any estimate for the number of jobs created by the bills signed by Biden. “[A]s investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act really start to gear up, I expect we’ll see this growth [in 2022] accelerate over the next few years,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said of the 114,000 clean energy jobs created in 2022. There were 28,000 more clean energy jobs created in 2023 than in 2022, an increase of about 25%.

The situation in the news studio heated up when Mace refused to pronounce Harris' name properly even after she was corrected. Mace was invited on the panel with several other commentators including Democratic strategist, Keith Boykin, and Michael Dyson, a professor from Vanderbilt University. As their conversation began, Mace did pronounce Harris' first name correctly before quickly getting it wrong. “You had it right, you almost got it,” Boykin remarked. “I will say Kamala’s name any way that I want to,\" Mace adamantly responded as seen during the panel's discussion. Soon, the panel erupted into chaos as everyone started talking over one another. “If I purposely mispronounced your name, that would probably not be appropriate,\" Boykin reasoned when he had a chance to speak. The conversation cooled down for a while before it was brought up again. “This congresswoman is a wonderful human being,” Dyson added. “But when you disrespect Kamala Harris by saying you will call her whatever you want, I know you don’t intend it to be that way, that’s the history and legacy of White disregard for the humanity of Black people.” Mace interjected and accused Dyson of calling her \"a racist.\" “I just said you weren’t a racist,” Dyson explained. “No, you don’t have to intend racism to accomplish it. Your disrespect of Kamala Harris is part and parcel of a tradition.” The panel soon began shouting over one another when Mace mispronounced Harris' name for the second time. “It’s Kamala, you’re doing this on purpose, congresswoman,” Boykin asserted. “You’re a White woman disrespecting a Black woman,” Dyson added. At one point, the discussion recounted an instance when Donald Trump made comments about Harris and said how \"she happened to turn Black.\" When Mace was asked if Trump should stop using this rhetoric for Harris, she didn't give a straightforward answer. “I didn’t hear him say it. I didn’t hear what he said about her race. I’m not going to weigh in on her race,” Mace responded. “He said that she turned Black, he questioned whether she was really Black. I don’t think that’s that hard to say, ‘That’s out of bounds.’ Can you say that?” the panel moderator interjected. Sadly, Mace isn't the only Republican party member who has disregarded the correct pronunciation of Harris' name. According to The Independent, during a speech last month, Trump announced that he doesn't care that he regularly mispronounces Harris' name. Harris' husband, Dough Emhoff, released a statement, responding to the same. “I know you have so much trouble pronouncing her name,” Emhoff said during a fundraising event, per the news outlet. “But here’s the good news— After the election, you can just call her Madam President.” As per AP News, Back in 2016, Harris released an instructional video on her X handle where a bunch of kids were filmed pronouncing her name in their own ways. Maybe Mace can take some tips from the video.","summary":"Mace was invited on the panel with other commentators including Democratic strategist Keith Boykin and Prof. Michael Dyson of Vanderbilt University.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/republican-faces-backlash-on-cnn-panel-for-repeatedly-mispronouncing-kamala-harris-name","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/713157/uploads/46b7afb0-66bd-11ef-9a41-4b833fa5cf89_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 21:30:10","author":"INQUISITR","authors":["INQUISITR"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":255294870,"title":"PRE-RECORDED!

Blaze News has received information that the 18-minute discussion was only the first segment of the entire interview. The title of this article was updated to reflect this information on 8/30/24 at 6:00 p.m. ET. The original story is as follows. After weeks of failing to appear in an interview, Vice President Harris finally sat down Thursday night for an interview with Biden-Harris-friendly CNN’s Dana Bash. However, there were a few caveats. The interview was pre-recorded, Harris’ VP pick Tim Walz was to join her, and it lasted a whopping 18 minutes. Former President Donald Trump, who has done multiple, much longer interviews alone — as has his running mate JD Vance — is thoroughly unimpressed. “I think it’s crazy she’s gone months without talking to the press. She’s not talking to anybody. She is copying — they would call it flip-flopping — on everything she believed in for the last 20 years,” Trump said in an interview with the Daily Mail. “She now says, well, she’ll frack, and well, she’ll do walls, but she doesn’t mean it because she’s a Marxist. I mean she’s absolutely a Marxist or beyond that, and nobody’s ever seen anything quite like it. She’s gone back on about 14 different policies all at once,” Trump continued. “She’s only doing it to get elected, and I think the public’s not going to stand for that,” he added. “The things that she isn’t going full communist on, she’s just taking from Donald Trump’s playbook,” Sara Gonzales of “Sara Gonzales Unfiltered” comments, noting that the duration of the interview is especially horrific. “My first initial reaction was wait, it’s only 18 minutes in the first place? You can’t go a full half-hour, I don’t know, maybe 45 minutes?” Gonzales asks, adding, “How much of a disaster are we talking about here?” “Well, without a doubt, this is pre-staged. So there’s probably a teleprompter there, she’s probably going to have notes because she asked for notes for the debate,” Dallas County Republican Party Chairman Allen West comments. “How shameful it is that this person cannot stand up on her own and she needs to have this crutch, or she needs to have a series of crutches, but yet she wants to be the commander in chief, she wants to be the president of the United States of America.

The conservative host claimed that Harris used her vice president as a “big white blankie” during her interview with Dana Bash. “In honor of her and her decision, I’ve brought my big white blankie and I’m just going to do the show with my own big white blankie,” Kelly said, pulling out and embracing a blanket as she rubbed it to her face. “I’m going to hold my blankie and it’s going to get me through the next 27 minutes of interview from Dana Bash, and also for potentially eight years as commander-in-chief and leader of the free world.” She continued, setting aside her prop, “She did show up with her blankie, her emotional support governor. He did – if it’s possible – more poorly than she did.” Kelly’s implication seemed to be that Harris brought Walz, specifically an older white male, to serve as some sort of shield in her interview with Bash. The host’s critique didn’t stop there. She also brought up the fact that Harris seemed heavily coached for the interview in the low and slow way she answered Bash’s questions. The host mimicked the presidential nominee’s attempts to, as Kelly put it, “super serious.” “She also looked like she had been coached to try to keep her demeanor very flat, very even-keeled,” Kelly said, beginning her low-voiced monotone impression. “I am a serious person. I am not a giggler, I have no cackle, I have no personality. I am a super serious person – notwithstanding the many years you’ve seen me make an absolute ass out of myself.” Whatever Kelly’s thoughts on the quality of the interview, it was a big win for CNN. The special drew in 6.31 million viewers for the vice president’s first sit-down interview. It also took the network to a No. 1 ranking in cable news, beating Fox News and MSNBC’s viewership combined.

The Trump campaign wants voters to know that Vice President Kamala Harris claims to have flipped and now supports the Trump border wall — but they don’t want you to believe she’ll actually follow through. That’s misleading. Neither Harris nor her campaign has indicated that she has changed her position. The thin piece of evidence on which this political bank shot rests is that Harris said during the Democratic National Convention that she would sign the bipartisan border security bill that failed in the Senate earlier this year. Trump opposed the legislation. That bill would, among many other things, allow about $650 million appropriated during the Trump administration for border wall construction to be used for that purpose. The origin of this claim is an Aug. 27 article in Axios headlined, “Harris flip-flops on building the border wall.” “If she’s elected president, Kamala Harris pledges to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the wall along the southern border — a project she once opposed and called ‘un-American’ during the Trump administration,” the article begins. “It’s the latest example of Harris flip-flopping on her past liberal positions such as supporting Medicare for All and banning fracking — proposals that aides say she now is against.” That claim that Harris has flipped her stance on the construction of a border wall has since been boosted by conservative commentators and elected Republicans as well as the Trump campaign. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance tweeted, “Kamala Harris is a fake. If she wants to build the border wall, she could start right now!” And Trump posted to Truth Social a video of Sen. Lindsey Graham saying in a Fox News interview, “To the people in Arizona, do you really believe she’s going to build a wall? That’s just bullshit.” Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, released a statement in response to the Axios article, pinning the alleged policy shift to anonymous Harris campaign staffers. “How much longer will the mainstream media allow Kamala Harris to hide and use staff to speak on her behalf? It’s DAY 37 of ZERO interviews and Kamala’s anonymous campaign sources are now claiming she supports President Trump’s border wall — this is a preposterous and false claim,” Leavitt stated. “She called the wall ‘un-American,’ a ‘waste of taxpayer money,’ ‘medieval,’ and said it isn’t going to ‘stop’ illegal immigration.” On Truth Social, Trump posted a link to a video of Fox News’ Sean Hannity in which he claimed Harris “even reportedly went full MAGA on the border wall just this week, at least that’s what the campaign is saying.” But the Axios article isn’t based on anonymous Harris campaign staffers. Rather, the story hinges on Harris’ pledge during her speech at the Democratic National Convention that “as president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he [Trump] killed, and I will sign it into law.” The unnamed Harris staffers in the Axios article pushed back on the idea that she had changed her position. Harris was referring to the Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, a $118 billion bill that sought significant changes in border policy. The bill failed in the Senate in February, garnering just four Republican votes after Trump voiced opposition to the bill. The bill included money to greatly expand detention facilities, and to hire more Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges to reduce the yearslong backlog in cases to determine asylum eligibility. It sought to expedite the asylum process, alleviating the so-called “catch and release” policy whereby migrants are released into the U.S. pending asylum hearings. And it would have increased the standard of evidence needed to win asylum status. The bill also would have supplied more funding to interdict fentanyl and human trafficking, and it included $60 billion in aid for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel. And, as one of the architects of the bill, Republican Sen. James Lankford, explained from the floor of the Senate prior to the bill coming to a vote in February, it included “more border wall construction.” Specifically, the bill states that none of the money set aside for border barriers during the Trump administration in appropriation bills in 2019 and 2020 “may be made available for any purpose other than the construction of steel bollard pedestrian barrier built at least 18 to 30 feet in effective height and augmented with anti-climb and anti-dig features.” The bill extended the deadline to spend that money to September 2028, but it does not include new funding. The bill “doesn’t have everything in it I wanted, it doesn’t have everything in it my Democratic colleagues wanted,” Lankford said at the time. Indeed, the accommodation for border wall construction was not something Biden or his administration touted when they threw their support behind the bill. Lankford’s office told Axios that the legislation — if the Senate version were to be resurrected — would translate to an estimated $650 million for border wall construction. That’s a fraction of the $18 billion sought by Trump in 2018. In recent campaign speeches and interviews, Trump has said he intended to build another 200 miles of new wall, but that Biden’s election upended it. At $20 million per mile, the $650 million from the bipartisan border bill would amount to less than 33 miles. Despite Biden vowing during the 2020 campaign that not “another foot of wall [would be] constructed on my administration,” some border wall has been built during the Biden administration. As we wrote in October 2023, Biden said he could not stop some funds appropriated during the Trump administration from being spent on border barriers, and budget experts we spoke to agreed. Harris’ Past Comments About Trump Border Wall As a senator in 2018, Harris called the massive wall proposed by Trump “un-American.” (Trump was inconsistent about how much he proposed to add to the existing 650 miles of barriers he inherited — saying during his campaign that there should be a total of 1,000 miles, but then as president revising that to 900 to 800 to 700 and even less.) In February 2020, Harris posted on social media, “Trump’s border wall is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won’t make us any safer.” In a CNN town hall in January 2019, then presidential candidate Harris dismissed Trump’s “medieval vanity project called a wall.” CNN host Jake Tapper asked if Harris would vote for a compromise bill that included “wall money” but also permanent protections for so-called Dreamers who were brought to the country illegally as children (something Harris has said she supports). “Let me be very clear. I’m not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances,” Harris said. “And I do support border security. And if we want to talk about that, let’s do that.” Republicans could argue that Harris has changed her position from that town hall about accepting some border wall construction in a compromise border bill. But Harris’ stated support for the failed Senate bill does not suggest she supports every part of the bill — as Lankford said, the bill did not include everything either Democrats or Republicans wanted — it only shows a willingness to accept a bipartisan compromise. (Of note, Republican and Democratic presidents alike have contributed to the wall. About 130 miles of border barriers were built under President Barack Obama. Indeed, images of the border wall feature prominently in a recent Harris ad that seeks to portray Harris as “tough” when it comes to “fixing the border.”) Republicans are trying to accuse Harris of being dishonest about a significant policy flip-flop. But the premise is flawed. Harris has not suddenly thrown her support behind funding for a massive wall, such as Trump proposed. She has voiced support for a compromise bipartisan border bill that, among many other things, would allow $650 million of money appropriated during the Trump administration — a fraction of what Trump sought — to be used for border wall construction over the next four years. And, we note, Trump opposed the bill. Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. Please consider a donation.
