Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BRIAN GALLAGHER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:14 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:01:37 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nUniversal Pictures attached the first trailer for their highly-anticipated adaptation of The Odyssey to screenings of Jurassic World Rebirth, and now the teaser has leaked online.\nIt's an unusual move since the film is still in production and the $250 million film won't hit theaters until July 17, 2026, starring Matt Damon as Odysseus.\nHowever, Jurassic World Rebirth - expected to bring in at least $100 million this weekend - is the biggest film on the studio docket for months, so they attached an early trailer of The Odyssey to it.\nUnfortunately, a very low-quality version of the trailer - filmed from inside some movie theater - has made its way online before its official release.\nThe Odyssey director Christopher Nolan prefers fans to see trailers for his films in theatrical settings, according to The Hollywood Reporter, thus debuting it in front of Jurassic World Rebirth before it arrives online. \nWhile we are not posting the illegally-captured trailer below, there will be a description, so if you want to avoid spoilers and see the trailer on your own, read on at your own risk.\n\nUniversal Pictures attached the first trailer for their highly-anticipated adaptation of The Odyssey to screenings of Jurassic World Rebirth, and now the teaser has leaked online\n\nHowever, Jurassic World Rebirth (above) - expected to bring in at least $100 million this weekend - is the biggest film on the studio docket for months, so they attached an early trailer of The Odyssey to it\nThe trailer begins with an unknown narrator speaking about the title character Odysseus (Matt Damon), who, in the original poem is trying to return home to his wife Penelope after his victory in The Trojan War.\n'Darkness. Zeus’ law smashed to pieces. I’m without a king since my master died. He knew it was an unwinnable war. And then, somehow, he won it,' the narrator says.\n\n Tom Holland is seen filming The Odyssey for the first time with Christopher Nolan in Greece \nThe trailer shows brief shots of the sea - along with what appears to be a mammoth statue of a Trojan Horse.\nThen the trailer shows Jon Bernthal's unnamed character, who says, 'I know nothing of Odysseus, not since Troy, as Odysseus' son Telemachus (Tom Holland) says, 'I have to find out what happened to my father. When did you last see him?'\nBernthal's character shouts to the room, 'Who has a story about Odysseus? You? You have a story? Some say he’s rich. Some say he’s poor. Some said he perished. Some said he’s imprisoned,' along with random shots from the film.\nThe trailer ends with an old man laying on pieces of driftwood, presumably Damon's title character.\nWhile they were not shown in the trailer, the star-studded cast of The Odyssey also includes Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Mia Goth. \nThe film will be the most expensive of Nolan's career, and also the first film in history to shoot entirely on IMAX cameras.\n\nThe trailer begins with an unknown narrator speaking about the title character Odysseus (Matt Damon), who, in the original poem is trying to return home to his wife Penelope after his victory in The Trojan War.\n\nThe film will be the most expensive of Nolan's career, and also the first film in history to shoot entirely on IMAX cameras.\nFilming started back in February on location in Greece, Morocco, Italy, Iceland and Los Angeles, with filming also expected to happen in Britain, Scotland and Ireland.\nNolan is directing from his own screenplay - based on the epic poem by Homer that dates back to the 8th Century BC and was first published in English in 1614. \nHomer's The Iliad and The Odyssey are two of the oldest surviving works of literature to this date, both considered classics.\nThere have been numerous foreign language adaptations of The Odyssey throughout the years, plus a 1997 mini-series starring Armand Assante and the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou, which is loosely based on The Odyssey.\nThe Odyssey will be the sole new release in theater on July 17, 2026, as of now, with both Holland and Bernthal hitting screens as Spider-Man and Punisher, respectively, just two weeks later in Spider-Man: Brand New Day on July 31, 2026. \nMatt DamonChristopher Nolan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChristopher Nolan's The Odyssey trailer leaks online from early screenings of Jurassic World: Rebirth\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:01:14 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:01:31 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nCheryl could reportedly be set for a return to TV as she's being eyed up for a mentoring role on the next series of The Voice. \nThe former Girls Aloud star's last appeared on TV as a dance captain on The Greatest Dancer back in 2019. \nBut according to The Sun, Cheryl may be making her talent show return alongside her longtime pal Will.i.am as a guest mentor mentor on The Voice. \nThe 14th series is reportedly set to see a return of the Battle Rounds and Cheryl is said to be in talks to mentor Will.i.am's team.\nA source said: 'Will.i.am and Cheryl first worked together 16 years ago and have remained good friends ever since.\n'She was the obvious choice to mentor his team when the Battle Rounds return four years after being axed.\n\nCheryl could reportedly be set for a return to TV as she's being eyed up for a mentoring role on the next series of The Voice (Seen in 2022)\n\nThe former Girls Aloud star's last appeared on TV as a dance captain on The Greatest Dancer back in 2019 (Pictured)\n'A lot has happened in Cheryl's personal life since she was last working on a talent show — BBC's The Greatest Dancer — so she's taking baby steps to put herself back out there. \n'Teaming up with will.i.am as a guest mentor seems the perfect way to kick-start her comeback.'\nThe series will reportedly air next year and the source said there are hopes Cheryl will agree to sign on permanently. \nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Cheryl for comment. \nCheryl's possible return to work comes after the tragic death of her former partner Liam Payne, who is the father of her son Bear. \nIn the six years between Liam's split from Cheryl and the singer's untimely death in Argentina, he became engaged to model Maya Henry and was reportedly talking marriage with his girlfriend of two years, Kate Cassidy, before he died. \nBut despite moving on romantically from the Girls Aloud singer, the One Direction star made his feelings very clear, hailing her as 'the most important person' in his life, and praising her for always being there for him, despite their split. \nThe former couple lived just minutes away from each other and before his death Liam revealed their relationship was stronger than ever, describing Cheryl as 'the best mum in the world' to co-parent with. \n\nThe 14th series is reportedly set to see a return of the Battle Rounds and Cheryl is said to be in talks to mentor Will.i.am's team (Seen in 2010)\n\nA source said: 'Will.i.am and Cheryl first worked together 16 years ago and have remained good friends ever since' (Seen in 2009)\n\nCheryl was later revealed to have the heartbreaking task of raising her son without his father, but a new dimension to that task emerged when it was revealed that Liam died without leaving a will. \nIt meant that his £24million fortune will go to Bear, and Cheryl has been named administrator, meaning she will be entrusted with protecting the money for her son. \nIt is unknown whether Liam, 31, had considered this outcome when thinking about his affairs, but regardless Cheryl, 41, has been entrusted with a huge responsibility on behalf of her ex-partner. \nMeanwhile, the lack of will means that Liam did not make any direct provision for his father Geoff and mother Karen, his two sisters and wider family, or other loved ones such as his partner Kate Cassidy. \nBut perhaps it seems appropriate that the responsibility of dealing with his estate has gone to Cheryl, along with music industry lawyer Richard Mark Bray, given the depth of their bond.\nLiam couldn't help gushing about his former partner in interviews saying that he 'couldn't ask for more' in the mother of his child. \nWhile Cheryl has always been more guarded, the remarks she did make about Liam publicly were telling. \nIn a 2018 interview, she claimed he was the only man who had never cheated on her, and she has never publicly dated anyone since they split up in 2018. \n\nCheryl's possible return to work comes after the tragic death of her former partner Liam Payne, who is the father of her son Bear (Seen in 2016)\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline in 2019, Cheryl insisted that things were going good with Liam and that they were navigating their way through parenthood well\nLiam and Cheryl first met when Liam auditioned for The X Factor back in 2008 as a fresh-faced 14-year-old.\nRumours of a romance emerged in 2016 when Liam shared a picture of a tattoo on his hand, thought to be a tribute to Cheryl's giant rose tattoo on her lower back and posterior. \nIn March 2016, they became 'Instagram official' and months later, made their first public appearance at Cannes Film Festival and after more rumours, it was confirmed that Cheryl was pregnant with their son Bear. \nHowever, in July 2018, Cheryl confirmed she and Liam had sadly split in a tweet, writing: 'We are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make.\n'We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.'\nBut despite ending things romantically, the pair continued to be bonded through their son, and stayed close over the years as they co-parented Bear, with Liam later declaring: 'Cheryl's always there for me.'\nKate CassidyThe VoiceGirls Aloud\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCheryl 'is in talks for TV return' five years after her last on-screen gig as she 'kickstarts career comeback' after ex Liam Payne's death\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy T. ZELLER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:21:58 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:14 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nBlake Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds showcased a striking new look on Tuesday as he was honored in his home country of Canada.\nThe Deadpool star, 48, sported a dark new hair dye job, as he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada during Canada Day festivities in Ottawa.\nThe couple, who’ve been entangled in ongoing lawsuit drama with It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni, appeared unfazed by the controversy.\nPutting on a brave face, Gossip Girl alum Blake, 37, looked to be in high spirits as she snapped photos of Ryan while Canada's Governor General Mary Simon placed the medal around his neck.\nGrinning from ear to ear, the actress flashed her signature megawatt smile as Ryan waved to the cheering crowd and blew kisses. \nDespite the dark cloud of the It Ends With Us sexual harassment lawsuit, Ryan Reynolds appears to be on a roll, recently landing the cover of Time magazine in a feature titled 'How Ryan Reynolds Rewrote the Script for Celebrity Entrepreneurs.'\n\nBlake Lively stood proudly by Ryan Reynolds ’ side on Tuesday as he was honored in his home country of Canada — despite the legal storm still swirling around them\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum, 37, looked radiant as her Deadpool star husband, 48, was named an Officer of the Order of Canada during Canada Day festivities in Ottawa\nReynolds has made a pivot in recent years, expanding beyond Hollywood into the world of business. \n\n Tone deaf Ryan Reynolds drops cringeworthy reference to Blake Lively's legal battle \nHis ventures — including production and marketing firm Maximum Effort — even earned a spot on TIME’s list of the 100 most influential companies.\nBut not everyone was buying the hype.\nAfter Reynolds opened up about leveraging his fame to build brands and his strategy of “fastversing” (cross-promoting his own companies), some skeptical fans were quick to mock the TIME cover story, accusing the actor of buying his way in.\nCritics flooded social media with sarcastic takes, including one who joked, 'How Ryan Reynolds paid us to put him on the cover of this magazine! Lol.'\nAnother added, “'How Ryan Reynolds rewrote the script with maximum effort’ — very ironic of them to say this given everything he’s been exposed for.'\nThe medal honor comes after DailyMail.com exclusively learned that Baldoni's lawyers will be allowed to peruse a tranche of messages exchanged by Blake and Taylor, with all communications related to It Ends With Us now set for scrutiny.\n\nPutting on a brave face, Blake looked to be in high spirits as she snapped photos of Ryan while Canada's Governor General Mary Simon placed the medal around his neck\n\nDespite the dark cloud of the It Ends With Us sexual harassment lawsuit, Ryan Reynolds appears to be on a roll, recently landing the cover of Time magazine in a feature titled 'How Ryan Reynolds Rewrote the Script for Celebrity Entrepreneurs'\n\nThe couple, who’ve been entangled in ongoing lawsuit drama with It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni , appeared unfazed by the controversy\n\nSwift and Lively’s relationship has cratered in recent months, with the singer left furious at being dragged into the case. \nAnd she is not the only Swift to be dragged in: last week the Daily Mail revealed the subpoena against her had been withdrawn because Baldoni’s team had managed to acquire the information they were seeking – from none other than her dad Scott, 73.\n'Scott Swift did not want his daughter to be dragged into this any further and he voluntarily gave up this information as part of a deal that would include [Baldoni's team] withdrawing their subpoena for Taylor,' the source explained.\nThe pop star's doting dad - who has played a key role in building Swift's billion-dollar empire as her financial advisor - came to his daughter's rescue after she was allegedly blackmailed by Lively's lawyers.\nThat 'blackmail' revelation appeared in a legal letter filed last month by Baldoni's lawyers, who alleged that Lively's team had attempted to 'coerce' Swift to issue a public statement in support of her.\nThe filing claimed Lively's lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, had contacted Swift's team and demanded she 'release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively's possession would be released.'\nSwift's team allegedly responded to Gossip Girl star Lively's 'inappropriate and apparently extortionate threats in at least one written communication' sent to Gottlieb, according to the letter.\n'It is those communications that [Baldoni's team] seeks to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,' the letter stated.\n\nBaldoni’s team were forced to withdraw a subpoena targeting megastar Swift directly but they scored a victory today. Pictured: Lively and Baldoni in It Ends With Us\n\nBaldoni pictured in December 2024 in LA\nScott seemingly didn't take this alleged attempt to extort his 35-year-old daughter lightly, and decided to take matters into his own hands by cooperating with Baldoni and Bryan Freedman in order to protect Swift from any further legal involvement.\n'Plain and simple – they tried to extort Taylor by threatening to release private information about her so that she would support a narrative that she was not a part of,' our source added.\nIn a statement to People magazine, Gottlieb described the suggestion that Lively's lawyers had threatened Swift as 'categorically false.'\nLively's lawyers later filed a motion asking the court to strike the accusations from its docket as 'baseless, unnecessary, improper and abusive.' The motion to dismiss the letter was granted.\nHowever, the drama sheds further light on the collapse of the pair’s close friendship, which has gone cold amid the actress's high-stakes lawsuit.\nThe drama began last December when Lively, 37, accused Baldoni, her It Ends With Us co-star and director, of sexual harassment and coordinating a smear campaign against her.\nBaldoni, 41, hit back in January, with a $400 million countersuit accusing Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, of defamation.\nAll parties have denied the allegations. Last week, the defamation element of Baldoni’s lawsuit was scrapped by a judge, although he is still suing for civil extortion and invasion of privacy among other claims.\nBut contained in Baldoni's filing were screenshots of alleged text messages, in which Lively regularly mentioned Swift by name.\n\nAnd she is not the only Swift to be dragged in: last week the Daily Mail revealed the subpoena against her had been withdrawn because Baldoni’s team had managed to acquire the information they were seeking – from none other than her dad Scott, 73; The pair pictured May 18 in NYC\nIn one now infamous and toe-curling exchange, Lively appeared to refer to herself as the character Khaleesi – from Game of Thrones – and to Swift as one of her 'dragons.'\nElsewhere in Baldoni's filing is the claim that Swift was present at a meeting convened by Lively at her New York penthouse to discuss It Ends With Us script changes.\nSources close to Swift insisted the singer had no knowledge of the meeting and simply turned up to find it underway.\nNonetheless, the whole furor reportedly left Swift - who is godmother to Lively's three daughters – feeling ‘exploited’ by her pal of ten years.\nScott, a former stockbroker and financial advisor for Merrill Lynch, has long been credited as smoothing his daughter’s path to financial success.\nA disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission lists him as linked to 10 companies affiliated with his daughter, according to Bloomberg.\nLast year, he was accused of assaulting a photographer who was 'waiting' for Swift's arrival off a luxury yacht in Sydney following the Australian leg of her Eras Tour.\nIn a statement to Daily Mail Australia at the time, a rep for Swift described the photographers as 'aggressive' and her father later avoided charges.\n\nSwift and Lively’s relationship has cratered in recent months, with the singer left furious at being dragged into the case; (Swift in February) \n\nScott isn't the only member of Swift’s inner circle to defend the pop star amid the legal drama.\nHer boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, recently unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on Instagram while supermodel Gigi Hadid, another of Swift's closest friends, has reportedly 'iced out' Lively in solidarity. \nIn a statement released to the Daily Mail, a spokesman for Lively accused Baldoni’s lawyers of repeatedly attempting to drag Swift into the case and attempting to ‘exploit’ her popularity.\nIt continued: ‘The Court outright denied the Wayfarer Parties’ motion to compel documents from Ms. Lively, who has produced far more documents in this case than the Wayfarer Parties combined.\n‘Further, the Court’s protective order ruling rests on the Wayfarer Parties’ admission that they received nothing from Taylor Swift, which is exactly the opposite of what their ‘insider’ claimed two weeks ago.\nAs for the rest, Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties demanded access to Taylor Swift’s private communications—despite having already subpoenaed and then withdrawn that subpoena.\nBaldoni’s desire to drag Taylor Swift into this has been constant dating back to August 2024, when the crisis PR firm led by Melissa Nathan included her in their ‘Scenario Planning’ document (Lively Amended Complaint, Exhibit D), referred to her as a bully, and called for a strategy to influence the ‘TS fan base’.\nWe will continue to call out Baldoni’s relentless efforts to exploit Ms Swift’s popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing.\nRyan ReynoldsJustin BaldoniCanada\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively beams with pride as Ryan Reynolds is given Canadian honor amid their Justin Baldoni legal woes\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 34\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I mean, that would always be my first choice but she doesn't live there now, but she's there all the time, her parents are there, she really knows North Carolina well and I won there three times.'\n\nTrump cited Lara's success at running the Republican National Committee in 2024 and her new Fox News talk show. \n\nAssuming a Republican wins in 2026 in the purple state, Trump will be happy to see the back of Tillis regardless of who it is.\n\n'I didn't get along with Tillis and he resigned, that's a good thing. I had it out with this guy two nights ago and he resigned, he did us all a favor. I was happy about it,' Trump told the press gaggle. \n\nThe seat may not be hers for the taking even if she has the support of her famous family.\n\nSeveral other Republicans are considering a bid, including former party chairman Michael Whatley, who is seen as a strong contender; Congressman Pat Harrigan; and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, sources tell DailyMail.\n\nLara, however, would have the Trump family support if she runs, a source familiar told DailyMail. \n\nLara is married to Eric Trump, the president's third child and is also host of a weekend show on Fox News. Eric sparked talk of a Trump political dynasty earlier this month when he told the Financial Times that a political career would be 'would be an easy one' for family members, if they took that option.\n\nStill, one Trump adviser told Axios they'd be 'surprised if she wants to leave the amazing gig she has at Fox.'\n\nNorth Carolina is a longtime battleground state where Democrats tend to win the governorships and Republicans the Senate seats. \n\nDemocrats, however, see the retirement of Tillis, a well-liked Republican senator, as a chance to change their luck. The party is pushing former Gov. Roy Cooper, a popular politician, to run for the seat.\n\nAsked if he would back a successor for his seat, Tillis didn't answer.\n\n'Dependent upon whether or not President Trump endorses somebody it could be an open primary,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill on Sunday night.. 'He could close it out and the party could get behind it, I suspect that's what they do. I just really hope he has some discernment because obviously Mark Robinson was a bad pick.'\n\nRobinson, the scandal-ridden lieutenant governor, lost last year's gubernatorial race to Democrat Josh Stein even as Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the presidential race. \n\nLara Trump, a North Carolina native who graduated from N.C. State University, currently anchors a weekend show on Fox News.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, she served as co-chair of Republican National Committee. In that contest, President Trump backed Whatley to be chairman with Lara Trump as his deputy. The duo served together through the election.\n\nShe was previously floated as a potential Senate candidate when former Republican Sen. Richard Burr retired. She opted not to launch a campaign for the seat. \n\nEric and Lara currently live in Florida. Lara was touted as a candidate to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate when he was confirmed as secretary of state but, again, she opted to stay out of politics.\n\nShe said she worries about moving her family to Washington D.C., pointing to advice she received from her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who both worked in the first Trump Administration.\n\n'It was tough on them personally, but it was really tough on their family,' she told Time magazine in February.\n\n'Even if I decided to move my whole family, dogs and all, up to Washington, D.C., I still think that it probably would have been a big challenge for my kids and for us as a whole.'\n\nEric Trump, speaking to the Financial Times a few weeks ago, expressed the same concerns about his children and a political life.\n\n'The real question is: 'Do you want to drag other members of your family into it?'' Eric Trump said when asked about running for public office. Their son Luke is seven and daughter Caroline is five.\n\n'Would I want my kids to live the same experience over the last decade that I've lived?\n\n'If the answer was yes, I think the political path would be an easy one, meaning, I think I could do it,' he said. 'And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.'\n\nTillis announced his retirement on Sunday after Trump whacked him over his opposition to the president's 'big, beautiful' budget bill currently making its way through the Senate. \n\nTillis was one of two Republican senators who voted against the 'motion to proceed' on Trump's budget bill Saturday evening, along with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. \n\nIn a post made to his social media site Truth Social Sunday morning, President Trump came after Tillis, claiming that he 'hurt the great people of North Carolina' and calling him a 'talker and complainer.'\n\n'Thom Tillis has hurt the great people of North Carolina. Even on the catastrophic flooding, nothing was done to help until I took office. Then a Miracle took place! Tillis is a talker and complainer, Not A Doer! He's even worse than Rand 'Fauci' Paul,' Trump wrote on Sunday morning.","summary":"The president celebrated Tillis announcing he would not run for re-election Sunday.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:23:22 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:00:09 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nColeen Rooney's earnings soared amid her huge TV projects as she looks set to become her family's 'main breadwinner'. \nThe WAG, 38, reportedly boasts a net worth of £15million, with her hubby thought to be worth an enormous £170million thanks to his Premier League footballing days. \nBut in the new phase of their lives, Coleen could be set to take over as the main breadwinner as her popularity soars. \nAmid her skyrocketing fame following her hugely successful I'm A Celeb stint, Disney announced on Monday a new premium access series titled The Rooneys focusing on her and Wayne's life.\nThanks to her ventures, new figures for her firm, CWR 2021, up to September 2024 show the booming business already had £580,000 banked - and that was before I'm A Celeb and her Disney deal. \nMeanwhile former manager of Plymouth Arsenal Wayne was reportedly making £500,000, before leaving the club in December.\n\nColeen Rooney's earnings soared amid her huge TV projects as she looks set to become her family's 'main breadwinner' (Seen on I'm A Celeb in December)\n\nThe WAG, 38, reportedly boasts a net worth of £15million, with her hubby thought to be worth an enormous £170million thanks to his Premier League footballing days (Coleen and Wayne seen in January)\nA financial expert told The Sun: 'These earnings show that, even before Coleen signed up for I'm A Celeb, she was already bringing in more money than Wayne.\n'On the back of her jungle stint, where she was incredibly popular with the viewing public, she's now likely to see her earnings soar even further - and the increased interest in Coleen after she did so well on the show is also likely to have sealed the deal on the Disney contract.\n'Getting big bucks from a global streamer, plus her pay cheque from ITV, will no doubt swell the Rooneys coffers even further.'\nMailOnline has contacted Coleen's representatives for comment. \nIn March, Coleen revealed that she has eclipsed Wayne in popularity after starring on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\nColeen took part on last year's series of the ITV show where she finished as runner up to McFlyn's Danny Jones after winning over a huge number of fans.\nAnd the mother-of-four has explained that she now gets even more attention in public than her famous footballer husband.\nSpeaking to The Mirror at an event in Manchester, Coleen admitted she was humbled by the 'positivity' of people coming up to chat to her about her time in the jungle.\n\nBut in the new phase of their lives, Coleen could be set to take over as the main breadwinner as her popularity soars (Seen in June) \n\nSpeaking of her popularity, Disney announced on Monday that a new premium access series titled The Rooneys is set to air, and filming is already underway (Coleen and Wayne seen in 2023) \nShe said: 'I didn't realise how big the audience was. I get parents come up to me saying \"aw, we got our family back together on the couch to watch it\" and that's lovely to hear.' \nNot being able to resist making a brutal dig at her husband, she then joked: 'Even on school runs, Wayne has passed his sell by date so no one has got a clue [about him] But then all of a sudden we get kids going \"oh Coleen Rooney!\"'\nSpeaking of her popularity, Disney announced on Monday that a new premium access series titled The Rooneys is set to air, and filming is already underway.\nThe ten part doc-series will delve into the footballer and WAG's lives 'like we've never seen them before'.\nIt is set to see Coleen tackle 'new entrepreneurial endeavours' and Wayne stepping away from the football pitch to do school runs. \nThe new show has 'unprecedented access' into their world and dives into their everyday life, including highs like holidays and celebrations as well as the lows. \nThe 'at-home-with' format is expected to see former England footballer Wayne Rooney appear alongside his wife – runner-up on last year's I'm A Celebrity – and their four sons: Kai, 14, Kit, 11, Klay, eight, and Cass, six. \nSources close to the project said earlier this year that Mrs Rooney, 39, will be paid £5 million with the remainder going to production company Lorton Entertainment, which made her previous show, Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story. \n\nOne insider said: 'It has taken months of bidding against one another. The money has gone up and up and has got to £10 million, which is way higher than was first imagined, but Coleen is very much in demand. \n'Both streamers were aware of the viewing public's appetite for the inside track on footballers' home lives. \n'The Beckhams documentary was the most-watched show on Netflix in the UK last year, and has racked up more than 200 million hours of viewing time globally.\n'Coleen is loved by the British public, especially since she played a blinder on I'm A Celeb. It wasn't surprising that Disney and Amazon wanted it and went head to head.\n'It will make for compulsive viewing. It won't just feature Coleen but Wayne and their children, too. \n'It might be expensive, but the view is that it will be worth every penny.'\nColeen RooneyITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nColeen Rooney's earnings soar amid slew of major TV projects as she looks set to become 'main breadwinner' in family with husband Wayne\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

His plan bares a striking similarity to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a set of policies the left used to attack Trump during the 2024 election.\n\n“The oldest truism in politics is you can’t beat something with nothing,” Cherny, a former Democratic speechwriter, told the Times.\n\nCherny is assembling a team of Democrats to write and release quarterly policy proposals over the next two years through Democracy: A Journal of Ideas, culminating in a book to guide candidates in 2028. However, the people reportedly chosen for the team’s board have a history of connections to President Joe Biden, Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (RELATED: HOUSMAN: It’s Time For Trump To Dispose Of China’s Ticking Time Bomb)\n\nCherny told the NYT that the team he put together to draft the plans represented “the Avengers of public policy” and “the best thinkers from across the spectrum.” They intend to run public conferences to iron out their differences. The group will address topics such as national security, the economy and education policy.\n\n Avengers….Assemble! https://t.co/1Ah2TmYqGS — Andrei Cherny (@AndreiCherny) June 30, 2025\n\nNeera Tanden is among those seated on the advisory board, according to the NYT. She currently heads the progressive think tank Center for American Progress and served Biden as a staff secretary and senior advisor. The ex-aide testified before the House Oversight Committee last week amid an investigation into Biden’s mental fitness.\n\nBiden nominated her in 2021 to serve as head of the Office of Management and Budget but withdrew her nomination after backlash, including from Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy. The former Biden aide deleted approximately 1,000 tweets within two weeks of being nominated, according to Wayback Machine archives.\n\nFormer Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also has a seat on the board, the NYT reported. He reportedly offered to resign after the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of 13 service members.\n\nFormer New America Foundation (NAF) President Anne-Marie Slaughter is another board member, according to the outlet. Slaughter was the director of policy planning at the State Department under then-Secretary Hillary Clinton, according to her NAF biography. She is also a published author on topics including “global governance” and international affairs.\n\nJim Kessler, a founder at Third Way, also sits on the advisory board, the NYT reported. Kessler once served as legislative and policy director for Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and worked with him on gun control, according to his biography on Third Way. The organization describes calls its activities “center left.”\n\nFelicia Wong, former president of the Roosevelt Institute, is another member, according to the NYT. She served under the Biden-Harris administration as vice chair of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity. “Any efforts to address inequality in the United States must account for the legacy of racial exclusion built into our economy,” she said in a 2022 Treasury Department release.\n\nThe Roosevelt Institute calls for economic rules “rooted in shared values of equity, inclusion, and sustainability.”\n\nEconomist Justin Wolfers is the final member of the board, the NYT reported.\n\nSome Democrats expressed skepticism over the project, arguing that the group would not be able to establish a coherent policy agenda or that policy was not the issue facing the party, according to the outlet.\n\n“Developing policies by checking every coalitional box is how we got in this mess in the first place,” Democratic author Adam Jensleson said, adding that people pushing policies must face the “interest-group Borg.”\n\n“We didn’t lack policies,” Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told the outlet. “But we lacked a functioning narrative to communicate those policies.”\n\nOn a CNN panel Sunday, political strategist Maria Cardona pointed to socialist Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s tactics as an approach the party could employ, suggesting it was similar to President Donald Trump’s strategy.","summary":"'The Avengers of public policy'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/01/democratic-party-project-2029-2024-neera-tanden-jake-sullivan/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2167046826-scaled-e1751386569307.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 22:43:45","author":"Derek Vanbuskirk","authors":["Derek Vanbuskirk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.146},{"id":337261260,"title":"Kylie Jenner takes her relationship with boyfriend Timothee Chalamet to the next level with shock move","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiddy's mask finally slips: The courtroom picture that says EVERYTHING as jury reaches verdict on four charges and is ordered to keep deliberating on fifth\n\nWho IS running the country, Keir?

But it was a delicate thing in the comedy world. There were a lot of people who did not want to do anything that would kind of ding him in an awkward way.”\n\n “But it’s comedy!” Bowen exclaimed, to which Carvey responded, “That’s the key. If I can do Biden, if I can make Biden funny to everybody, then I am where I want to be. And to make it funny, it had to be recognizable.”\n\n The Wayne’s World actor, who starred on SNL for seven seasons from 1986 until 1993, explained that he worked to create a respectful, yet still identifiable impression of the politician by adopting several key Biden-isms like “I’m not kidding around here” and “I’m being serious.”\n\n Carvey’s podcast cohost David Spade, who served as an SNL cast member between 1990 and 1996, also jumped in to note that he believed it was “easier to make fun” of Biden because he was the president than it would be if he was \"just a 90-whatever-year-old man and just [going], ‘Look at this a--hole.’”\n\n He continued, “Once he’s president, then he’s more fair game. But no one made fun of him forever.”\n\n Carvey explained that it took him two years to nail his Biden impression, which he debuted during the cold open of SNL’s season 50 premiere last year, after the sitting president dropped out of the election and Kamala Harris became the Democrats' new nominee.\n\n “The first six months, it was just sweet Joe…. and I thought, ‘Well, it doesn’t have the pop or energy of Trump or even Obama or [George W. Bush],’” he recalled. “And then I heard him whisper and yell, and I thought, ‘Oh, here we go.’”\n\n He would go on to impersonate the Democratic president on the show in the lead-up and the immediate aftermath of the 2024 presidential election. During that run, Carvey said Biden quickly became his “favorite” person to portray because of his many unique phrasings.\n\n And, as it turns out, Biden's own staff were big fans of his impression.\n\n “His staff came to one of the parties, middle of the night, ‘Hey we just gotta say… We love your Biden. Joe probably loved it too. Why don’t you come down to the White House and have lunch?’” Carvey recalled, before jokingly adding that their meal “never happened” because Biden wasn’t aware of lunch.\n\n Still, he has nothing but positive memories from his time playing Biden on the show — even if it was a fine line to walk. “I loved it. It was entering and exiting, but it was a real challenge to make it acceptable,” he admitted. “And I read comments: ‘Hey man, I hate Trump and whatever, but this is really f---ing funny.’ So that’s the main thing — it was funny.”\n\n Listen to Carvey discuss his Biden impression in the clip above.","summary":"The \"SNL\" alum called it a \"delicate thing\" to make his presidential impersonation both acceptable and funny.","url":"https://ew.com/dana-carvey-saturday-night-live-joe-biden-impression-real-challenge-to-make-acceptable-11764782","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/b4mf-ttA8srf2pR-S8caB9VzGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dana-Carvey-Joe-Biden-SNL-070125-cedbdaecfa5f42dbb4fb9a47615193e7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 22:35:38","author":"Emlyn Travis","authors":["Emlyn Travis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":337267192,"title":"U.S. v.

Skrmetti: Did the trans rights movement overreach?\n\nThe Supreme Court upholds a Tennessee law that bans transgender care for minors, dealing a blow to trans rights\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe court has done \"untold harm,\" as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, \"to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"\n\n(Image credit: Reuters)\n\nThe Week US \n\n1 July 2025\n\nWhat the Supreme Court just did to transgender people \"will live in infamy,\" said Elie Mystal in The Nation. In a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, the justices last month upheld a Tennessee law that bans minors from using hormones and puberty blockers for gender transition. The plaintiffs in U.S. v. Skrmetti, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that the law discriminates illegally on the basis of sex, because it lets a late-developing teenage \"boy\" take testosterone but prohibits the same treatment for a trans teen deemed a \"girl\" at birth. The courts' conservatives were having none of it. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts dusted off one of \"the oldest legal tricks\" in the bigot's playbook, explaining that the law can't be discriminatory because it bans gender dysphoria treatment for all minors, trans or cis. Similar reasoning was \"used to justify Jim Crow laws\" on Black and white intermarriage, said Mark Joseph Stern in Slate. How depressing, in 2025, to see this \"brittle logic\" used against another disfavored minority. With laws similar to Tennessee's on the books in 26 other states, the court has done \"untold harm,\" as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, \"to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"\n\nSorry, progressives, but \"reality isn't unconstitutional,\" said Dan McLaughlin in National Review. Males and females are biologically different, and no one cries \"bigotry!\" when the FDA approves a breast cancer drug for use in women but not in men. As Roberts patiently explains, there's nothing in law to stop a state from approving some \"medical uses\" of a drug while denying others. And Tennessee has good reason to protect its children from drugs that can irreversibly damage their fertility and sexual function. This is more about culture than law, said M. Gessen in The New York Times. Skrmetti is part of a \"vast backlash against trans rights\" that has been building for years, and that extends \"far beyond the conservative Supreme Court or the borders of the MAGA universe.\" In last year's election, Donald Trump's \"Kamala's for they/them\" ad turned some moderate voters against Kamala Harris, and many Democrats are now fretting that they went \"too far\" on trans rights. Exactly how is not clear: By helping young people who are tormented by their bodies find peace?\n\"Backlash is a risk with any social change,\" said Megan McArdle in The Washington Post. That's why most civil rights movements adopt an \"incrementalist strategy,\" picking legal \"fights they think they can win\" while doing the slower, more important work of securing public support. In Skrmetti, conversely, trans advocates decided to \"go for broke,\" hoping a conservative court would sign off on sex changes for under-18s even though 56% of Americans support bans on such treatments. Skrmetti was the brainchild of ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio, said Andrew Sullivan in his Substack newsletter, a trans man whose stated goal is to uproot the whole notion of sex differences. He argues that gay men like me should never have fought for marriage equality, because marriage is a fundamentally violent institution, and that \"a penis is not a male body part. It's just an unusual body part for a woman.\" Such extremism has pushed the gay and lesbian rights movement \"onto thin political ice\": Republican support for same-sex marriage has dropped from 55% in 2022 to 41% today. The Supreme Court's ruling to \"protect vulnerable children\" should force the movement to \"right the ship,\" and work to \"regain the broader public trust we have recently lost.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:22:43 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:22:50 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham shared a tribute to his father-in-law Nelson on his 83rd birthday as he posed for a happy family snap with the Peltzs.\nBrooklyn's wife Nicola, 30, first took to Instagram to share a slew of snaps of her entire family together celebrating at the party, held at the Peltz family's huge home in Bedford, New York.\nBrooklyn, 26, then posted one of the photographs himself, which showed him standing behind Nelson alongside Nicola as they both flashed wide smiles.\nHe captioned the post with a red heart emoji in a tribute to Nelson, but the celebratory photos are the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad's 50th birthday.\nBrooklyn's wife Nicola had also shared a gushing post about her 'most loving father' after throwing Nelson a lavish birthday party over the weekend.\nShe wrote: 'happy birthday dad! i am so lucky to be your daughter, you're the most loving and supportive father i could ever dream of.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham has revealed that he spent the weekend celebrating his father-in-law Nelson's 83rd birthday as he posed for a happy family snap with the Peltzs\n\nThe celebratory photos are the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad's 50th birthday; pictured L-R Cruz, Harper, Romeo, Victoria and David \n'I love you more than I could ever begin to express - you're the wind beneath my wings,' the loving tribute continued.\n'I loved celebrating you yesterday! thank you for always being there for us - our constant love and support.'\nAs Brooklyn celebrated his father-in-law over the weekend, his parents were enjoying their own bittersweet family time back in the UK. \nTaking to social media, Victoria posted a sun-soaked snap as she cosied up to her beloved parents Anthony and Jackie Adams.\nIn the emotional caption she wrote: 'Family weekends make me so happy.'\nDavid and Victoria have reportedly become resigned to the fact that they have become estranged from their beloved son after he failed to attend any of the football ace's 50th birthday celebrations last month.\nHe also didn't wish either his mum Victoria or dad David a happy birthday on social media - an unusual move for the Beckhams, who are known for their loving posts.\nThis is in stark contrast to a post Brooklyn shared last week for his father-in-law and wrote on a picture of himself and Nicola with the billionaire: 'Happy birthday Nelson x We love you.'\n\nHe looked right at home with his in-laws, happily posing with Nicola and Nelson at the Peltz family's huge home in New York. Brooklyn simply captioned the post with a red heart emoji\n\nBrooklyn's wife Nicola also shared a gushing post about her 'most loving father' after throwing Nelson a lavish birthday party over the weekend \n\n'happy birthday dad! i am so lucky to be your daughter, you're the most loving and supportive father i could ever dream of,' Nicola gushed alongside the party snaps\n\nBrooklyn smiled as he posed with his beaming wife, his father in law Nelson and brother in law Will Peltz\n\nRumours of a rift between the eldest son and his parents began when Brooklyn was noticeably silent on his former Spice Girl mother's birthday last month, a far cry from his usual sweet posts about her.\nNeither the former photographer nor his wife wished Victoria a happy 51st, while David, Romeo and Cruz posted gushing messages.\nAnd as well as snubbing dad David's birthday online, he also was notably absent from all of his 50th birthday celebrations - including a boys' fishing trip. \nDespite flying to London at the time, Brooklyn and Nicola also didn't attend the big family party at the Beckhams' Cotswolds home or an idyllic trip to France or a meal at Notting Hill restaurant, Core. \nBrooklyn reportedly 'told his famous family that he wants no contact' with them earlier this month in the latest devastating turn of their ongoing feud. \nWhile a source close to Brooklyn denied the claims, a source told Page Six: 'Brooklyn told his family he wants no contact and he's not responding to those that try to connect.'\nAccording to the publication, the eldest Beckham boy has had no communication with his family following father David's knighthood being announced last week and only learned of the news in the media alongside the rest of the world.\n\n'i love you more than i could ever begin to express - you're the wind beneath my wings,' Nicola's loving tribute to her dad continued\n\nMeanwhile Brooklyn's mum Victoria, 51, who along with husband David, 50, are in the midst of an escalating rift with their eldest son and his wife, enjoyed her own bittersweet family time\n\n Injured David Beckham and son Romeo enjoy a colourful cake with his mum Sandra as they celebrate her 76th birthday - after estranged Brooklyn showed not all family ties had been severed amid ongoing feud \nDenying he'd asked for no contact, a source close to Brooklyn told the publication: 'Everyone's focus should be David Beckham's great honour.'\nAnother source close to Brooklyn told MailOnline: 'This seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father.'\nMailOnline contacted David's reps for comment at the time. \nBut Brooklyn has proven that not all ties had been severed amid the family feud with his own birthday tribute to David's mum Sandra on her 76th birthday. \nSharing a throwback picture of him and his grandmother, he captioned: 'Happy birthday nanny xx love you so much.'\nIn his own post for his mum, David ensured absent son Brooklyn got a mention despite their widening rift. \n\nBrooklyn has proven that not all ties had been severed amid the family feud with his own birthday tribute to David's mum Sandra on her 76th birthday \n\nIn his own post for his mum, Dacud ensured absent son Brooklyn got a mention despite their widening rift \nThe former Manchester United and England midfielder shared a carousel of photos featuring himself with mum Sandra from childhood to the present day. \nTaking to Instagram, he wrote: 'Happy birthday mum we love you so much I hope u have the best day. Thank you for always being there for us all. Love you.' \nHe rounded off the tribute by including the Instagram handles of various family members, among them younger sister Joanne and the retired footballer's three sons with wife Victoria - Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz. \nDaughter Harper, at 13 too young for social media, was given a hashtag as he ended Thursday morning's tribute. \nDavid BeckhamNicola PeltzBrooklyn Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham shares another tribute to Nicola Peltz's father Nelson for his 83rd birthday as he poses with in-laws - after snubbing own dad David's 50th birthday amid feud\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 33\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Fox News.com fell 24%.\n\nFox News parent Fox Corp. and The Post parent News Corp share common ownership.\n\nComScore, which uses a different methodology from SimilarWeb to track traffic, found that NYPost Network — which includes nypost.com and affiliated properties such as Decider and Page Six — drew 433 million page views in June 2024 before falling to 381 million for May 2025, a loss of 12%.\n\nMeanwhile, WSJ.com — part of News Corp-owned Dow Jones — and Fox News.com both posted slight increases over the same time frame, one of the few publications to gain traffic, according to ComScore.\n\nLeft-leaning rivals the New York Times and The Washington Post dipped 0.7% and 6%, respectively, ComScore found. \n\nPublication that saw the biggest gains, according to SimilarWeb, included MensJournal.com (+415%), CoolDown.com (+96%) and Indiatimes.com (+77%).\n\nA Google spokesperson denied that AI push was to blame for the cratering traffic.\n\n“More than any other company, Google prioritizes sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day,” the rep told The Post on Tuesday.\n\n“We’ve seen many inaccurate claims about traffic from Search, often based on speculative or incomplete information, questionable methodology, or data that predates AI Overviews. New AI experiences in Search enable people to ask even more questions, which creates new opportunities for businesses and content to be discovered.”\n\nThe company added that there are known limitations to SimilarWeb’s dataset since it only looks at desktop and mobile web, not app activity. \n\nGoogle’s AI Overviews — automated summaries powered by its Gemini model — appear at the top of results pages and directly answer user queries, often preempting the need for users to go to the source of the information.\n\nSince the rollout of AI Overviews, many publishers have reported steep declines in both traffic and click-through rates (CTR). According to multiple studies, the average CTR for the top organic result on queries that trigger AI Overviews plummeted from 7.3% in March 2024 to just 2.6% by March 2025.\n\nGoogle also recently rolled out AI Mode — an advanced search experience that delivers detailed, conversational answers to complex queries. \n\nDespite previously stating that AI Overviews would not appear for “hard news topics” due to concerns over freshness and factuality, an AIO box appeared atop search results for “anne burrell death” shortly after the story broke. \n\nA recent Google document now states that AI Overviews will appear when they add value and the system has high confidence in the response, though efforts are being made to exclude sensitive or dangerous topics.\n\nThe company claimed that overall visits to the web and traffic from organic search have increased year-over-year in aggregate, and that AI Overviews are designed to enhance the user experience by surfacing more links from a broader range of sources.\n\nGoogle added that publishers can experience traffic fluctuations for many reasons unrelated to AI — including seasonal demand, shifting user preferences and regular algorithm updates.","summary":"According to new data published by Similarweb, 37 of the top 50 news domains saw year-over-year traffic declines.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/01/business/google-ai-pummeling-news-sites-as-traffic-dips-across-the-board/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-sxomsfmi4-1751406151722.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1751391780&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 21:46:16","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.048},{"id":337244752,"title":"US calls reported threats by pro-Iran hackers to release Trump-tied material a 'smear campaign' (World)","text":"Pro-Iran hackers have threatened to release emails supposedly stolen from people connected to President Donald Trump, according to a news report, a move that federal authorities call a “calculated smear campaign.”\n\nThe United States has warned of continued Iranian cyberattacks following American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and the threats those could pose to services, economic systems and companies.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said late Monday that the threat to expose emails about Trump is “nothing more than digital propaganda” meant to damage Trump and other federal officials.\n\n“A hostile foreign adversary is threatening to illegally exploit purportedly stolen and unverified material in an effort to distract, discredit, and divide,” CISA spokeswoman Marci McCarthy wrote in a social media post, linking to a report from Reuters about the threat. “These criminals will be found, and they will be brought to justice.”\n\nReuters reported that it contacted the alleged hackers online. They told the news organization that it held a large cache of emails from Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, other top advisers and porn actor Stormy Daniels, to whom a hush money payment led to Trump's criminal conviction.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged three Iranians last year on allegations of hacking into Trump's presidential campaign. Hackers also targeted the campaign of Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and unsuccessfully tried to leak material supposedly taken from Trump to Democrats and members of the media.\n\nThe threat to release more hacked emails was reported the same day that CISA, the FBI and National Security Agency issued a public bulletin warning that hacking groups supportive of Tehran may attack U.S. interests despite a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe hackers, authorities warned, could seek to disrupt or disable critical infrastructure systems such as utilities, transportation and economic hubs. They also could target defense contractors or other American companies with ties to Israel, the agencies said.\n\nThe bulletin outlined recommendations, including the use of regular software updates and strong password management systems to shore up digital defenses.\n\nHackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and energy companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities — but so far have not caused widespread disruptions.","summary":"Pro-Iran hackers have threatened to release emails supposedly stolen from people connected to President Donald Trump, according to a news report, a move that federal authorities call a 'calculated smear campaign.'

Colin Allred—a civil rights attorney, ex-lineback for the National Football League, and one of Texas Democrats’ brightest prospects—is making a comeback. About eight months after losing to Sen. Ted Cruz, Allred is jumping back into the ring, this time setting his sights on Sen. John Cornyn in 2026.\n\n“Texans are working harder than ever, not getting as much time with their kids, missing those special moments, all to be able to afford less,” Allred said in his launch video. “And the people we elected to help—politicians like John Cornyn and Ken Paxton—are too corrupt to care about us and too weak to fight for us.”\n\nHis message is clear: He’s not finished fighting. The video emphasizes his background and the grit it took to make it to the NFL.\n\n“At heart, I’m still that undrafted kid, fighting for what’s right. I’m still that guy showering after work, instead of before,” Allred said—a subtle reference to his second Senate bid.\n\nTexas Democrats see an opening. Cornyn is caught in a messy fight with state Attorney General Ken Paxton, the scandal-ridden MAGA hard-liner beloved by President Donald Trump’s base. A recent Texas Southern University poll showed Paxton with a 9-percentage-point lead over Cornyn in a two-way Republican primary, but only a 2-point edge over Allred in a general election matchup. That’s why Allred’s video targets both men.\n\nInternal GOP polling reportedly confirms that Paxton is a riskier nominee in a general election. But so far, Trump has withheld his endorsement. While Paxton has been one of Trump’s most loyal defenders, Cornyn is generally seen as more electable statewide.\n\nStill, Allred shouldn’t take the primary for granted. The Democratic field could grow quickly. Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, state Rep. James Talarico, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke have all reportedly considered running. Former astronaut Terry Virts and flight attendant Mike Swanson are already in the race, though neither has gained traction.\n\nThat’s part of why top Democrats are pushing for a unified statewide slate. With more than a dozen major offices on the ballot in 2026—including governor, lieutenant governor, and Paxton’s soon-to-be-open attorney general seat—party leaders hope to avoid a contentious Senate primary and instead focus on retaking a statewide office for the first time since 1994.\n\nAllred arrives with some big advantages: name recognition, national fundraising networks, and potential bipartisan appeal. During his 2024 race, he secured endorsements from prominent anti-Trump Republicans, like former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. A Texas Public Opinion Research poll shows 37% of registered voters in the state view Allred favorably—more than Paxton (35%) or Cornyn (21%). He was also the only political figure in the poll to have a net-positive favorability, meaning more voters had a favorable view of him than had a negative view.\n\nHowever, Allred has something to prove. His previous campaign was criticized for being too cautious, especially compared with the energy O’Rourke brought in 2018. Despite outraising Cruz, Allred lost by 8.5 points—though he outperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who lost Texas to Trump by nearly 14 points.\n\nThis time, Allred promises a different approach. Now, free from congressional duties, Allred said in a recent interview that he plans to “run differently” in 2026—more aggressively, less cautiously.\n\nAllred first ran for office in 2018, flipping a Dallas-area district by defeating GOP incumbent Pete Sessions. Before that, he worked at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration.\n\nNow he’s betting that 2026 will finally be the year Texas flips—and that he’ll be the one to do it.","summary":"Former Rep.

It belonged to her son Omer, who starved to death in March after the soup kitchens feeding her family were shut down almost overnight. He was three years old. One of seven siblings, Omer had a favorite game: wrestling with his brothers. In his final days, he begged for porridge and went blind from hunger before curling up on a mat and dying at midnight.\n\nOmer is one of thousands of children who have died as a direct result of the United States pulling the plug on USAID’s humanitarian programs. On January 20, 2025, Donald Trump signed an executive order halting foreign aid. His ally, Elon Musk, cheered the decision, declaring that Trump was “feeding USAID into the wood chipper.” What followed was one of the most catastrophic collapses of humanitarian aid in modern memory.\n\nThe immediate result in Sudan was devastating. Clinics that had expected deliveries of antibiotics, vaccines, and nutritional supplements were left with empty shelves. Feeding centers shuttered. A country already reeling from civil war, where over half the population needs aid, was thrown into free fall.\n\nOmran, the twin brother of a boy named Marwan, died after his mother brought him to eleven different health centers in search of medicine that never came. Basic antibiotics could have saved him. They were supposed to be delivered in February, funded by a U.S. grant to the International Rescue Committee. Instead, he died in May, whimpering in his mother’s arms, gasping for breath.\n\nLocal doctors say the list of preventable deaths keeps growing: children with diarrhea, diabetics without insulin, cholera patients left untreated. The World Health Organization now estimates that five million people in Sudan are at risk of losing access to health services. In some regions, volunteers have taken over, running makeshift mobile clinics out of mosque windows and abandoned restaurants.\n\nAt the Almanar feeding center in Khartoum, mothers line up with starving children. One woman, Rahma Kaki Jubarra, has two sons wasting away: nine-month-old Farah weighs just 12 pounds. Her three-year-old weighs 21. She sometimes boils water to pretend she’s cooking, hoping they’ll fall asleep before they realize no food is coming.\n\nEven when aid resumed in theory, implementation lagged. Payment systems were frozen. Staff were laid off. Some aid was stuck in warehouses. Edesia Nutrition, a Rhode Island-based nonprofit, says that over 300,000 doses of Plumpy’Nut—the peanut-based paste used to treat severe malnutrition —are sitting idle due to a lack of new USAID orders.\n\nMeanwhile, cholera spreads. RSF fighters bombed water plants in Khartoum, and with USAID's disease surveillance teams disbanded, no one is tracking the outbreak. People drink from contaminated wells while the WHO warns that 60% of the needed medical supplies are missing. Local pro-democracy activists have stepped in with chlorine tablets, leaflets, and determination, but they cannot replace what’s been lost.\n\nThis isn’t just a story of bureaucratic mismanagement or misplaced priorities. It’s a moral failure. One that has turned children into corpses and doctors into mourners. One that shattered a fragile lifeline in a country where life itself is on the brink.\n\nWhen the United States stepped back, no one stepped in. Not Europe. Not the Gulf. Not China or Russia. The void left by America’s retreat isn’t just symbolic, it’s a graveyard. And in Sudan, the graves are getting deeper.\n\nWe are Fighting Back. You Can Too.\n\nThe Alliance for American Leadership is tracking the impact of aid cuts, rallying support to restore funding, meeting with members of Congress, and reminding Americans of the real meaning of American leadership: decency, duty, and hope.\n\nIn just our first two months, we've recruited over 400 volunteers from 41 states, including 23 senior campaign strategists and the former Briefing Manager for the Kamala Harris Presidential Campaign.\n\nAnd we’re only getting started.\n\nWe are on track to mobilize 5,000 volunteers by the 2026 midterm elections to fight for American leadership. We will resist fascism, restore USAID, and rebuild America’s role as a force for good in the world. This is our moment to lead with integrity and purpose, showing the world. What true American values are all about.\n\nThat’s why we’re inviting you to our first national fundraiser. This is more than a night of speeches — it’s a rallying cry for action. We’ll hear directly from organizers, policy experts, and survivors of aid shutdowns, and map out our strategy for turning outrage into results. Whether you’ve been with us from the start or are just joining the movement, this is your chance to plug in and power up.\n\nBut behind every meeting, every voice, and every victory is the operational engine that makes it all possible — and right now, we need your help to keep it running.\n\nWe must raise $20,000 to sustain the operational infrastructure that powers this movement. That means funding our digital outreach and empowering the young, diverse, and working-class leaders who are too often left out of the fight. Your support keeps the lights on, the teams moving, and the pressure on Congress at full force.\n\nIf you want to stand with us:\n\n Donate here: https://givebutter.com/A4AL/samuelgeurtsenshoemate\n\n Get involved: https://a4al.org\n\n Volunteer with us\n\n Subscribe to our newsletter\n\n Join our advisory board\n\n Apply for an internship","summary":"In a dusty slum outside Omdurman, Sudan, Fatma Swak Fadul holds up a child’s shirt.

Slipping in polls could ultimately hinder his political clout in an already highly polarized climate and potentially hurt Republican chances in the coming 2026 midterms.When Trump returned to the White House in January, he coasted in with positive numbers. The reversal came after a series of months marked by declining support and mounting discontent tied to economic and political concerns—like the president's tariff policies.Parallel efforts by both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris to reach millennials via podcasts and digital media emerged as a key feature of the 2024 campaign cycle, seeking to engage a generation that expresses more skepticism toward legacy media and traditional political messaging.Millennials are defined generally as people born from 1981 to 1996. The generation has overtaken the baby boomers as the largest age demographic, according to the Pew Research Center.What To KnowIn the new poll released on Tuesday, the president has a 42 percent approval rating with the voting bloc. The survey was taken from June 27 to June 30 among 1,648 U.S. adult citizens, with a 3.3 percent margin of error.The previous week, the president's approval rating with millennials was 36 percent. That survey was taken from June 20 to June 23 among 1,590 U.S. adult citizens, with a 3.5 percent margin of error.Trump's approval rating coming into office for his second term with the voting bloc was 44 percent and his highest with the pollster was 48 percent in both February and June polls.Before Tuesday's poll, the president saw sliding numbers with the key group, as he hit his lowest rating in over two months.What People Are SayingPolitical analyst Craig Agranoff, to Newsweek via text message Tuesday: \"The 6-point surge in Trump's approval rating among millennials, as reported in recent polls, is a notable shift for a demographic that's now the largest voting bloc, outpacing baby boomers.\"I wouldn't call it a definitive win for Trump, as millennials remain a volatile and diverse group, often skeptical of his broader agenda,\" Agranoff added. \"This uptick likely reflects targeted messaging or economic optimism resonating with younger voters, but it's too early to deem it a lasting trend.\"Concluding, Agranoff said: \"As for prioritizing millennials, Trump's political strategy has historically leaned on energizing his core base, often older, more conservative voters, rather than tailoring policies to younger demographics. His focus seems more about dominating the broader narrative than catering specifically to this age group's public opinion.\"What Happens NextPolling trends suggest Trump's approval among millennials may continue fluctuating amid foreign and domestic policy announcements and upcoming midterm elections.Both major parties will likely expand direct-to-voter media efforts through podcasts and alternative platforms in an effort to shore up support within this pivotal demographic.","summary":"Before Tuesday's new poll, the president saw sliding numbers with the key group as he hit his lowest rating in over two months.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-approval-rating-spikes-millennialspolls-2093288","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2675064/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 20:36:52","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.025},{"id":337241072,"title":"Princess Andre, 18, hits back at lip filler accusation as she shows off her pout in selfies - after vowing to 'embrace natural beauty'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiddy jury stuck on single charge after reaching partial verdict: Live updates\n\nWho IS running the country, Keir?

But I personally don't look at [cosmetic surgery] and think: ''Oh, yeah, I want to do that''.\n'I think it's important, especially for the younger generation on social media, to embrace natural beauty.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy EVE BUCKLAND and BRIAN MARKS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:20:21 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:21:29 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nConservative commentator Candace Owens has hit back at claims she has become the latest star subpoenaed in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal drama.\nAs Baldoni, 41, plots his next move weeks after his $400million countersuit against Lively, 37, was dismissed, a report emerged alleging Owens, 35, had been ordered to turn over communications with the actor and the Wayfarer parties.\nAlongside Owens - who has frequently discussed the It Ends With Us legal wrangle on her podcast - it was claimed media personality Perez Hilton and YouTuber Andy Signore had also been subpoenaed after making waves with their 'Blake bashing commentary.' \nHowever, Owens has fired back at Lively, denied receiving a subpoena and has sensationally accused the A Simple Favor star's team of 'leaking' the story to TMZ.\nShe exclusively told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Given the fact that I have not received any subpoena yet, I appreciate Blake’s team leaking this to TMZ to alert me to it. \n'And of course, I have not the slightest idea what I am being subpoenaed for as I knew none of these parties when their respective lawsuits were filed. But stay tuned, and I’ll let audiences know on my podcast!'\n\nConservative commentator Candace Owens has hit back at claims she has become the latest star subpoenaed in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal drama\n\nAs Baldoni, 41, plots his bombshell next move after his $400million countersuit against Lively, 37, was dismissed, it was claimed podcast host Owens, 35, had been ordered to turn over communications with the actor and the Wayfarer parties \nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Hilton, Lively and Baldoni for comment and has yet to hear back. \nPopcorned Planet host Signore memorably claimed Lively was 'admitting defeat in a sneaky way' after she dropped her emotional distress claim against Baldoni last month.\nLast month the theater of battle between Lively and Baldoni narrowed with the announcement that he will not be amending the claims in his $400 million defamation lawsuit.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Major update on Taylor Swift's subpoena in Blake Lively lawsuit \nHis attorney Bryan Freedman announced that Baldoni would not be amending any of his complaints in the tossed-out lawsuit.\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Freedman said: 'The Court’s decision on the motion to dismiss has no effect whatsoever on the truth that there was no harassment nor any smear campaign, and it does not in any way affect our vigorous defense against Ms. Lively’s claims. \n'Discovery is proceeding and we are confident that we will prevail against these factually baseless accusations,' he continued. 'Instead of revising the existing claims, our clients will be pursuing additional legal options that are available to us.'\nDespite her initial legal win when Baldoni's lawsuit was dismissed, Lively hasn't been letting up on her own lawsuit, and she recently sent out a bevy of new subpoenas.\n\nIt was claimed media personality Perez Hilton - a prolific Lively-Baldoni commentator - had also been subpoenaed\n\nShe exclusively told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Given the fact that I have not received any subpoena yet, I appreciate Blake’s team leaking this to TMZ to alert me to it'\n\nPopcorned Planet host Signore memorably claimed Lively was 'admitting defeat in a sneaky way' after she dropped her emotional distress claim against Baldoni last month\nA spokesman for Lively also responded to the news that Baldoni was stepping back from his failed attempt to countersue her in a statement to DailyMail.com.\n'The Court dismissed the frivolous $400 million Baldoni–Wayfarer lawsuit in its entirety,' they said.\n'In the days that followed, Baldoni’s lawyer said the judge’s decision to dismiss their case was not a big deal as they promised to amend and refile it. As per usual, that was not true,' her spokesperson continued. 'The Court’s dismissal of Baldoni’s sham lawsuit was a total victory after all.'\nJudge Lewis J. Liman dismissed Baldoni's lawsuit, but he left the Jane The Virgin star a second opportunity to amend the suit by June 23.\nHowever, the judge ruled that he could only amend the allegations 'relevant to the claims of tortious interference with contract and breach of implied covenant.' \nThe 132-page opinion broke down why the allegations in Baldoni's lawsuit were without merit, including the accusation that Lively, her husband and her publicist Leslie Sloane engaged in 'civil extortion.'\n\nLast month the theater of battle between Lively and Baldoni narrowed with the announcement that he will not be amending the claims in his $400 million defamation lawsuit \nA statement obtained at the time by DailyMail.com from Blake Lively's attorneys read: 'Today's opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times. \n'As we have said from day one, this '$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. \n'We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.'\nIn a statement obtained by DailyMail.com, a spokesperson for The New York Times said of the dismissal: 'We are grateful to the court for seeing the lawsuit against The New York Times for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting. \n\n'The Court’s dismissal of Baldoni’s sham lawsuit was a total victory after all,' read part of a statement to DailyMail.com from Lively's spokesperson \n\nJudge Lewis J. Limon previously dismissed Baldoni's suit alleging defamation and extortion on the basis that all her allegations were made within privileged court papers; Lively pictured in It Ends With Us \n\nBaldoni's team had released a website which included private communications such as text messages that were included in court filings detailing his interactions with the Hollywood power couple over the making of romantic drama\n'Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism. We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.' \nThe legal battle between Lively and Baldoni officially erupted last year after rumors of tension between the two, with the actress accusing her co-star of sexual harassment and a retaliatory smear campaign, allegations Baldoni denied.\nIn her lawsuit, Lively named a number of Baldoni's collaborators, including his company Wayfarer Studios, the studio's CEO and financial backer, and PR personnel Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel.\nBaldoni has denied the allegations brought about by Lively, while Lively, Reynolds and Sloane have denied the accusations made in litigation by Baldoni.\nBaldoni's team has released a website which includes private communications such as text messages that were included in court filings detailing his interactions with the Hollywood power couple over the making of the romantic drama.\nHe claimed in court filings they made efforts to usurp and undermine his input as the director of It Ends with Us.\nBaldoni's team previously said that the communications shared in court filings on the website makes things clear about the motives of both parties.\nThe website, which is live online at thelawsuitinfo.com, comes amid a spate of high-profile litigation between the collaborators on the film, which was a hit at the box office last August.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Lively named a number of Baldoni's collaborators, including his company Wayfarer Studios, the studio's CEO and financial backer, and PR personnel Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel; Baldoni is pictured with wife Emily in 2020 in West Hollywood\nLively filed an 80-page civil rights complaint with the California Civil Rights Department against Baldoni on December 20, before officially filing a federal lawsuit on December 31.\nIn her lawsuit, the Gossip Girl alum accused Baldoni of sexually harassing her in multiple ways — including body shaming her — and orchestrating a smear campaign against her to damage her reputation.\nBaldoni told the court the trio had concocted 'false accusations of sexual harassment' against him. \nBaldoni and his reps have said in response to the lawsuit that Lively twisted the meaning of text messages and mislead the public about their interactions while making the motion picture.\nOn June 3, DailyMail.com revealed Lively dropped a claim of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against Baldoni. \nBaldoni subsequently sued the newspaper for $250 million in a defamation claim over a December 21 story titled '\"We Can Bury Anyone\": Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine ;' the newspaper has denied the allegations.\nSince Lively's complaint was filed, Baldoni has faced a number of professional consequences, including a lawsuit from a former publicist ; and being dropped by the agency WME , which also reps Lively and Reynolds.\nWME has denied claims that Lively and Reynolds leaned on them to release Baldoni from their client roster, according to Variety.\nNew York TimesBlake LivelyJustin Baldoni\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCandace Owens calls out Blake Lively over claim she's being subpoenaed into Justin Baldoni legal drama\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 44\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, the program featured an interview with former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris that Trump said was deceitfully edited, leading to the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to CNN, Paramount Global is motivated to find a resolution to the legal dispute this week, with the media conglomerate scheduled to have its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\n\nCNN reports that an upcoming July 7 termination deadline for the proposed merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is also weighing heavily. \n\nThe media company is tackling the lawsuit from two fronts, as CBS News also filed a motion on June 23 in the Texas court seeking to have the case thrown out. In the filing, the news network continued to defend its flagship program, saying the First Amendment protects it and that the case should be dismissed.\n\nCBS News was accused of “deceitful” editing by Trump and his campaign team after the Harris interview aired on 60 Minutes back in November 2024.\n\n“To paper over Kamala’s ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” the suit stated.\n\nIn a strongly worded response, 60 Minutes described Trump’s charge as “false” and outlined how the editing decisions followed standard network practices.\n\n“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate, and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide-ranging 21-minute-long segment,” the statement noted.\n\nHowever, the terms of the lawsuit changed after Trump won the election, adding Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) as a co-plaintiff. The president then stated that the interview violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the federal Lanham Act. Trump’s legal team argued that the edited version of the interview was used as a promotional tool for the program, which constitutes commercial speech, thereby putting CBS in direct competition with Trump’s media businesses for advertising revenue.\n\nThe president said that he was harmed because 60 Minutes captured traffic that otherwise would have been directed toward his own media properties.\n\nCBS News’ legal team pushed back, writing, “The law is clear that news organizations may have a ‘profit motive,’ but such motive in no way divests their reporting of First Amendment protections.”\n\nIt further added, “Effectively conceding that their claims cannot survive if the Broadcasts are editorial speech subject to full First Amendment protections, Plaintiffs argue that the Broadcasts somehow became ‘commercial speech’ via a simple promotion for the Interview.”\n\nCBS News is also seeking to move the case back to New York, arguing that the broadcast, which originated from New York City, and the interview, which took place in Washington, D.C., “does not belong in federal court in Texas.”\n\nAll this is happening as Shari Redstone—chair of Paramount Global—is reportedly seeking to settle the suit ahead of Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media.\n\nThis attempt at settlement has caused fallout at CBS News, as two key executives closely associated with 60 Minutes have left the news network, including Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, and Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes.\n\nOliver Darcy, in his Status newsletter on Monday, June 30, reported that all correspondents from the newsmagazine show signed a letter to Paramount Global executives, warning of reputational damage to the program should a settlement be reached between the two parties.\n\nTVNewser reached out to CBS News for comment on the advance settlement negotiations and the letter signed by 60 Minutes correspondents for Paramount Global leadership, but did not receive a response as of the time of publication.","summary":"Settlement Negotiations Advancing Between Paramount Global and President Trump","url":"https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/settlement-negotiations-advancing-between-paramount-global-and-president-trump/","image":"https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Paramount-Global-Paramount.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 20:02:30","author":"Mark Mwachiro","authors":["Mark Mwachiro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":337241100,"title":"What's Next? Elon Musk Hints at 'Escalating' Brutal Feud With Trump After President Threatens to 'Deport' Billionaire","text":"The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving on social media, and their public battle has just been turned up as the billionaire is now hinting he may \"escalate\" things, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe former best pals have been at each other's throats for months, all due to the president's controversial tax and budget bill.Musk Getting Booted?On Tuesday, July 1, Trump took to Truth Social to call out the Tesla Boss, claiming he is considering having the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk previously led, \"take a good, hard look at\" the billions in contracts his companies receive.\n\nAnd just hours following his social media post, Trump once again called out Musk, 54, after he was asked whether he would be \"deporting him.\" \n\n\"We'll have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon,\" the 78-year-old responded. \"You know what DOGE is? The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies.\"After one of his followers posted a clip of Trump's comments on X, Musk was quick to hit back: \"So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.\"\n\nX users responded as well, as one person said: \"Good, not worth it. Don't take the bait,\" and another added, \"You can help America in so many better ways than stooping down to the bottom of the mud, where Trump likes to play. That’s where logic goes to die.\"\n\n\"Please just release the Epstein files!\" someone else said.Trump On Epstein List?During their petty back-and-forth earlier in the summer, Musk was set off after Trump suggested he was dealing with \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"\n\nHe said from the Oval Office: \"But we have it with others, too. They leave, and they wake up in the morning, and the glamor is gone, the whole world is different, and they become hostile.

If the bill ultimately becomes law after passing the House and receiving Trump’s signature — which could all happen before Friday — American health care is never going to be the same.\nThe consequences will be dire. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would slash Medicaid spending by more than $1 trillion and that nearly 12 million people would lose their health insurance. Republicans added a last-minute infusion of funding for rural hospitals to assuage moderates skittish about the Medicaid cuts, but hospitals say the legislation will still be devastating to their business and their patients.\nWhen combined with the expiration of Obamacare subsidies at the end of this year, which were not addressed in the budget bill, and the other regulatory changes being made by the Trump administration, the Republican policy agenda could lead to an estimated 17 million Americans losing health coverage over the next decade, according to the health policy think tank KFF.\nFewer people with health insurance is going to mean fewer people getting medical services, which means more illness and ultimately more deaths. \nOne recent analysis by a group of Harvard-affiliated researchers of the House Republicans’ version of the budget bill (which included the same general outline, though some of the provisions have been tweaked in the Senate) concluded that 700,000 fewer Americans would have a regular place to get medical care as a result of the bill. Upward of 200,000 fewer people would get their blood cholesterol or blood sugar checked; 139,000 fewer women would get their recommended mammograms. Overall, the authors project that between 8,200 and 24,600 additional Americans would die every year under the Republican plan. Other analyses came to the same conclusion: Millions of Americans will lose health insurance and thousands will die.\nAfter a painful legislative debate in which some of their own members warned them not to cut Medicaid too deeply, Republicans succeeded in taking a big chunk out of the program to help cover the costs of their bill’s tax cuts. They have, eight years after failing to repeal Obamacare entirely, managed to strike blows to some of its important provisions.\nSo, for better or worse, they own the health care system now, a system that is a continued source of frustration for most Americans — frustrations that the Republican plan won’t relieve. The next time health care comes up for serious debate in Congress, lawmakers will need to repair the damage that the GOP is doing with its so-called big, beautiful bill.\nHow the Republican budget bill will drive up health care costs for everyone\nThe effects of the budget bill won’t be limited only to the people on Medicaid and the people whose private insurance costs will increase because of the Obamacare funding cuts. Everyone will experience the consequences of millions of Americans losing health coverage.\nWhen a person loses their health insurance, they are more likely to skip regular medical checkups, which makes it more likely they go to a hospital emergency room when a serious medical problem has gotten so bad that they can’t ignore it any longer. The hospital is obligated by federal law to take care of them even if they can’t pay for their care.\nThose costs are then passed on to other patients. When health care providers negotiate with insurance companies over next year’s rates, they account for the uncompensated care they have to provide. And the fewer people covered by Medicaid, the more uncompensated care hospitals have to cover, the more costs are going to increase for even people who do have health insurance. Republicans included funding in the bill to try to protect hospitals from the adverse consequences, an acknowledgement of the risk they were taking, but the hospitals themselves are warning that the funding patches are insufficient. If hospitals and doctors’ offices close because their bottom lines are squeezed by this bill, that will make it harder for people to access health care, even if they have an insurance card.\nThe effects of the Republican budget bill are going to filter through the rest of the health care system and increase costs for everyone. In that sense, the legislation passage marks a new era for US health policy. Since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Democrats have primarily been held responsible for the state of the health care system. Sometimes this has been a drag on their political goals. But over time, as the ACA’s benefits became more ingrained, health care became a political boon to Democrats.\nGoing forward, having made these enormous changes, Republicans are going to own the American health care system and all of its problems — the ones they created and the ones that have existed for years.\nThe BBB’s passage sets the stage for another fight on the future of American health care \nFor the past decade-plus, US health care politics have tended to follow a “you break it, you buy it” rule. Democrats discovered this in 2010: Though the Affordable Care Act’s major provisions did not take effect for several years, they saw their popularity plummet quickly as Republicans successfully blamed annual premium increases that would’ve occurred with or without the law on the Democrats and their new health care bill. Voters were persuaded by those arguments, and Democrats lost Congress in the 2010 midterms. \nBut years later, Americans began to change their perception. As of 2024, 44 million Americans were covered through the 2010 health care law and two-thirds of the country say they have a favorable view of the ACA. After the GOP’s failed attempt to repeal the law in 2017, the politics of the issue flipped: Democrats scored major wins in the 2018 midterms after successfully campaigning against the GOP’s failed plan to repeal the ACA. Even in the disastrous 2024 election cycle for Democrats, health care policy was still an issue where voters trusted Kamala Harris more than Trump.\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is already unpopular. Medicaid cuts specifically do not poll well with the public, and the program itself is enjoying the most popularity ever since it was first created in 1965. Those are the ingredients for a serious backlash, especially with government officials and hospitals in red states railing hard against the bill.\nDemocrats have more work to do on explaining to the public what the bill does and how its implications will be felt by millions of people. Recent polling suggests that many Americans don’t understand the specifics. A contentious debate among Republicans, with several solitary members warning against the consequences of Medicaid cuts, have given politicians on the other side of the aisle good material to work with in making that case: Democrats can pull up clips of Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) on the Senate floor, explaining how devastating the bill’s Medicaid provisions would be to conservative voters in Republican-controlled states. \nRepublicans will try to sell the bill on its tax cuts. But multiple analyses have shown the vast majority of the benefits are going to be reserved for people in higher-income brackets. Middle-class and working-class voters will see only marginal tax relief — and if their health care costs increase either because they lose their insurance or because their premiums go up after other people lose insurance, then that relief could quickly be wiped out by increased costs elsewhere. That is the story Democrats will need to tell in the coming campaigns.\nMedicaid has served as a safety net for tens of millions of Americans during both the Great Recession of 2008 and since the pandemic recession of 2020. At one point, around 90 million Americans — about one in four — were covered by Medicaid. People have become much more familiar with the program and it has either directly benefited them or helped somebody that they know at a difficult time.\nAnd difficult times may be coming. Economists have their eyes on concerning economic indicators that the world may be heading toward a recession. When a recession hits — that is, after all, inevitable; it’s just the normal cycle of the economy — people will lose their jobs and many of them will also lose their employer-sponsored health insurance. But now, the safety net is far flimsier than it was in previous crises. \nRepublicans are going to own those consequences. They took a program that had become an essential lifeline for millions of Americans and having schemed to gut the law ever since the Democrats expanded Medicaid through the ACA more than a decade ago, have finally succeeded. This Republican plan was a reaction to their opponent’s most recent policy overhaul; the next Democratic health care plan will need to repair the harms precipitated by the GOP budget bill.\nIn the meantime, the impetus is on Democrats and truth tellers in the media to help Americans understand what has happened, why it has happened, and what the fallout is going to be.","summary":"Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” a move that will make major changes to Medicaid through establishing a work requirement for the first time and restricting states’ ability to finance their share of the program’s costs.

He wants us to believe that he's environmentally frugal so that he can fly his private jets and use his private yachts. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been a hypocrite and a phony. \n'Anyone who uses a private jet and a private yacht everywhere they go does not care about the environment. He wants us to limit our usage so he can continue with his extravagance,' they added. \nA fan also shared, 'Wealthy/famous people like this assume their influence on others outweighs the damages they cause personally. As if they are carbon neutral on the backs of others personal sacrifices.' \n'Wow.

My boobs are a year old today - thank you @nassabplasticsurgery for making me feel so confident!!! TIME FLIES!!!'\nPhoebe looked stunning in a grey and blue patterned bikini in the snap as she showed off her impressive holiday tan.\nHer post comes after she opened up about how being a teenager mother was the 'best thing in the world'.\n\nPhoebe Tomlinson posed in a skimpy bikini as she marked one year since having her boob job on Tuesday\n\nThe model and influencer, 21, who is the younger sister of One Direction's Louis, took to her Instagram Story to reflect on how she feels 12 months on from her surgery\nThe beauty welcomed a baby girl called Olive Johannah Varley with her footballer boyfriend Jack Varley, 26, on January 3 last year.\nAnd soon after Phoebe took to Instagram to answer questions from her 1.1million followers about becoming a mother. \nWhile she said being a mum is the 'best thing in the world', Phoebe admitted at the time that she was finding breastfeeding challenging. \n'The demand it's had on my body and my mental health has really affected me,' she said, adding that she feels too 'guilty' to switch to combination feeding.\nOlive's middle name, Johannah, is a poignant tribute to Phoebe's late mother Johannah Deakin.\nThe Tomlinson family tragically lost their mother Johannah in December 2016 aged 43, following a battle with leukaemia.\nDuring her Q&A, one of Phoebe's followers asked her if it was difficult becoming a mother while still a teenager, to which she replied: 'To me, I'm just a mum. \n'Being a mum at any age has its challenges I think. But it's the best thing in the world.'\nPhoebe was then asked how she has found breastfeeding her daughter Olive, which she admitted she had been hesitant to answer. \n\nThe mother-of-one revealed she now feels 'so confident' and even tagged where she had her procedure (seen pregnant before her surgery)\n\nShe penned in the caption: 'side note!!! My boobs are a year old today - thank you @nassabplasticsurgery for making me feel so confident!!! TIME FLIES!!!'\n'I'm going to speak on this in the hopes that some mums on here can relate,' she began. \n'I'm not ashamed to say I've not enjoyed breastfeeding at all really,' she said. 'I've found the pressure a lot. \n\n Phoebe Tomlinson, 19, says being a teenage mum is 'the best thing in the world' but reveals breastfeeding has taken a toll on her mental health \n'There are positives, as in the bond and the convenience of just putting her on the boob as soon as she needs however, the demand it's had on my body and my mental health has really affected me.'\nPhoebe continued: 'I'm still exclusively breastfeeding Oliver, which I can't quite believe. I nearly quit at 2 weeks if I'm honest. \n'I've been considering combination feeding purely for the convenience and to give my body that little break when she can have a bottle. \n'It's just one of those things I feel like I'll never actually do because I almost feel guilty, like I'm depriving my baby. I shouldn't think like that but naturally you do as a mum. Can anyone talk to me about combination feeding? I don't know too much about it.'\nSpeaking to other mother's struggling with the realities of breastfeeding, Phoebe urged them to remember they are not alone. She said she found it 'so much harder' than she had anticipated.\n'The fact that you're the only one that can console your baby when they're hungry is such a lot of pressure and it's normal to not cope,' Phoebe added.\nAnnouncing the arrival of Olive, Phoebe shared a black-and-white video documenting the birth, featuring emotional moments of the new mother crying as she cradled her newborn baby.\nIn an accompanying caption, she said: 'Olive Johannah Varley 04.01.24 - weighing 7lb7oz - the best day of our lives.'\nIn the video, Phoebe was seen breaking down in tears as she became overcome with emotion while hugging and kissing her newborn daughter.\nJack was also seen sweetly cradling baby Olive, who was wrapped in a blanket and hat, as he gazed lovingly at her.\n\nThe beauty welcomed a baby girl called Olive Johannah Varley with her footballer boyfriend Jack Varley, 26, on January 3 last year \n\nPhoebe and Jack, who began dating in early 2022, announced she was expecting their first child the previous June\nPhoebe also gave an insight into the water birth as she shared videos of herself cradling her bump and holding hands with her boyfriend Jack as she sat in the tub.\nHer family, including her father Mark and sister Lottie, were quick to share their congratulations with the new parents.\nTaking to the comments section, her father Mark gushed: 'Way way beyond proud so begins the best journey in life ever.'\nWhile Lottie, 26, took to her Instagram Stories to re-share Phoebe's video as well as a snap of herself cradling her niece.\nAlongside the video, Lottie said: 'So beyond proud of you.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy LAURA FOX FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:18:45 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:20:02 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nEmmerdale legend Chris Chittell has reportedly signed a new contract with the soap, as he prepares to mark 40 years since his debut on the show.\nThe actor, 77, who plays scheming businessman Eric Pollard - will mark the momentous milestone next year in September 2026.\nIt comes despite both Emmerdale and its ITV rival Coronation Street being hit by huge cuts, with both shows set to see their weekly number of episodes reduced from next year.\nEarlier this week, it was also revealed that episodes for both shows will now be available to stream on YouTube each morning, before they are broadcast on ITV.\nWhile Chris has been at the centre of many storylines during his time on Emmerdale, including the devastating death of his wife Val.\nHis most hard-hitting plot has come in recent months, when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, which has seen his health slowly decline.\n\nEmmerdale legend Chris Chittell has reportedly signed a new contract with the soap, as he prepares to mark 40 years since his debut on the show\nA source told The Sun: 'Chris is Emmerdale and there was no way he wasn't going to make it to 40 years in the village.\n'It's such a big achievement and he loves being on the show just as much as he did when he first joined.\n'There are big things coming for Eric well into next year.'\nEarlier this week, ITV announced fans of both the Yorkshire Dales and Weatherfield cobbles will be able to stream the latest episode on YouTube.\nFor decades diehard soap fans have had to tune in to each show's respective time slot in the evening for their latest fix.\nHowever, in a bid to rival the BBC and EastEnders, channel bosses last year started dropping each new episode of Emmerdale and Corrie on ITVX the morning before their linear broadcast that evening.\nAnnouncing the move, a spokesperson for both soaps told fans on social media: 'Soap fans, rejoice!\n'Starting tomorrow, full episodes will be available on YouTube from 7am - the same day they air on TV!' \n\nThe actor, who plays scheming businessman Eric Pollard - will mark the momentous milestone next year in September 2026\n\nEXCLUSIVE ITV staff anger as 'tone deaf' bosses throw extravagant 70th anniversary party amid job cuts \nFans welcomed the move, including international viewers who have previously struggled tuning into the ITV soaps.\nOne fan said: 'Awesome! US fans can enjoy!'\nA second commented: 'This is awesome news! Yayyy!'\n'Hopefully they stay on there going forward as I cant use your awful app,' said a third disgruntled viewer.\nThe move comes after it was revealed earlier this year how ITV bosses are slashing their soaps' episode count. \nEmmerdale currently airs six episodes weekly, Monday to Friday with a double bill on Thursdays.\nMeanwhile, Coronation Street also airs six episodes per week, with two episodes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. \nNext year, only five 30-minute episodes of each show will air - a real terms cut to soap broadcast time of 17%.\nBosses will introduce a soaps power hour from Monday to Friday with 30-minute Emmerdale episodes airing at 8pm and 30-minute Coronation Street episodes airing at 8:30pm.\nHowever, the start of the new 2026 schedule will at least be marked in style, as both soaps embark on an ambitious, never-before-seen stunt as part of a week of special episodes. \n\nChris' most hard-hitting plot has come in recent months, when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, which has seen his health slowly decline\nDefending the changes, ITV’s Managing Director of Media and Entertainment Kevin Lygo said: 'The new commissioning pattern is viewer-led.\n'We already give more choice than ever to viewers on how they watch us through ITVX and we want to present their favourite soap to them, in the most digestible way.'\n'In a world where there is so much competition for viewers' time and attention, and viewing habits continue to change, we believe this is the right amount of episodes that fans can fit into their viewing schedule, to keep up to date with the shows.'\nOver on the BBC, fans can watch new episodes of EastEnders from 6am on iPlayer before they're broadcast that evening on BBC One. \nITVBBCEmmerdaleCoronation Street\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEmmerdale legend 'signs new contract despite huge soap cuts and slashed episode count - as he prepares to mark huge milestone'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SHARON MAI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:16 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:19:18 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nKaty Perry suffered a stage malfunction and narrowly avoided a disaster during her concert in Australia this week amid her Lifetimes world tour.\nOn Sunday night, the singer was performing in Adelaide and being lifted in a floating metal sphere when the stage prop seemingly malfunctioned, leaving her stuck in the air.\nThe floating orb then tilted, as seen in fan-taken footage posted on X, and it appeared as though she scrambled to hold on to avoid falling into the crowd. \nFor several long seconds, Perry held onto one of the bars before the crew stopped the lights and music before rushing to help her. \nThe pop star was quickly freed from the prop and saved — before later breaking down in tears onstage — but many of the fans took to social media to express how scared they were for her in that moment. \nMany fans also likened the situation to how Beyonce recently had trouble onstage too when the floating car she was riding in suddenly halted and tilted mid-performance and she had to stop her show during her ongoing Cowboy Carter tour.\n\nKaty Perry suffered a stage malfunction and narrowly avoided a disaster during her concert in Australia this week; pictured April in Mexico City\n\nOn Sunday night, the singer was performing in Adelaide and being lifted in a floating metal sphere when the stage prop seemingly malfunctioned, leaving her stuck in the air; pictured April in Mexico City\n\nI was really scared 😢 pic.twitter.com/FpSPN1EIX2— nasty (@aquitter25) June 29, 2025\n\nPerry is currently on her Lifetimes Tour, performing a series of shows in Australia — which forced her to miss her close friend Lauren Sanchez's wedding to Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos in Venice over the weekend. \nHer now-ex Orlando Bloom attended the weekend-long festivities alone as a newly-single bachelor while Perry was in Australia with their four-year-old daughter Daisy. \nPerry kicked off their tour in Mexico City back in April and is set to conclude her tour in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year, on December 7. \nThe Lifetimes tour is in support of her seventh studio album 143 and is her first headlining stadium tour in seven years since she last toured in 2018. \nWhile performing Down Under, Perry was seen fighting back tears while onstage as she thanked her fans for their support following her split from Bloom. \nShe and the actor had been together for a total of nine years before their split was revealed late last month. \nAs Perry took to the stage for the final show of her Australian leg of her Lifetimes world tour, she fought back tears as the show came to a close.\nIn footage posted on X, she made a heart with her fingers, before struggling to hold back tears as she spoke to the crowd at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.\n\nThe floating orb then tilted, as seen in fan-taken footage, and she scrambled to hold on to avoid falling into the crowd; pictured April in Monterrey, Mexico\n\nFor several long seconds, Perry held onto one of the bars before the crew stopped the lights and music before rushing to help her; pictured April in Mexico City\n\nThe pop star was quickly freed from the prop and saved — before later breaking down in tears onstage — but many of the fans took to social media to express how scared they were for her in that moment; pictured April in Mexico City\n\nWhile performing Down Under, Perry was seen fighting back tears while onstage as she thanked her fans for their support following her split from Bloom; pictured April in Mexico City\n\nShe and the actor had been together for a total of nine years before their split was revealed late last month; pictured March in Beverly Hills\n\n'Thank you Australia for always being there for me,' she said. \nIt came just hours after Bloom shared a series of cryptic Instagram posts, sharing a quote from Gautama Buddha to his seven million followers. \nThe quote that Bloom reposted read: 'Each day is a new beginning. What we do today is what matters most.' \n\n Katy Perry fights back tears while on-stage following split from Orlando Bloom \nHe additionally shared a separate slide which had another quote which was titled 'Daily Encouragement by Daisaku Ikeda.' \nThe text read: 'The important thing is to take that first step. Bravely overcoming one small fear gives you the courage to take on the next.' \nLast week, it was revealed that the former couple called it quits after nearly a decade together. \nAt the time, a source told Us Weekly: 'Katy and Orlando have split but are amicable,' while also adding that the separation has been 'not contentious' thus far. \n'Katy is of course upset but is relieved to not have to go through another divorce, as that was the worst time in her life.' \nThe Teenage Dream hitmaker — who is currently embarking on her Lifetimes Tour — was previously married to Russell Brand from 2010 until their divorce in 2012.\nThe insider further added that the reported breakup had been 'a long time coming' and that their relationship had also been 'tense for months.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKaty Perry gets STUCK in flying metal sphere and nearly falls out mid-air... after crying amid Orlando Bloom split\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:09 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:19:15 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nEva LaRue's General Hospital character Natalia Rogers-Ramirez is exiting the series.\nIt comes just a over one year after the 58-year-old actress debuted the role of Blaze's (Jacqueline Grace Lopez) homophobic mom.\nLaRue, who has also worked on All My Children and CSI Miami, shared a headshot on Instagram this week, writing, 'That's a wrap on Natalia Ramirez.' \nExecutive producer Frank Valentini told Entertainment Weekly, 'Eva's been a dear friend for years and I am so pleased we found an opportunity to work together.\n'What originally was meant as a guest star arc turned into a longer and more satisfying arc, in thanks to Eva's terrific work and chemistry with our cast. I was thrilled Eva was available to us in this extended role. I wish her all the best in her upcoming projects.'\n\nEva LaRue's General Hospital character Natalia Rogers-Ramirez is exiting the series; pictured in 2022\n\n LaRue, who has also worked on All My Children and CSI Miami, shared a headshot on Instagram this week, writing, 'That's a wrap on Natalia Ramirez'\nSpeaking to Soap Opera Digest, Eva confirmed, 'I was originally only supposed to be on the show for a couple of months and it ended up being a much longer run.'\nShe added that the show 'felt like home' due to the presence of other former All My Children actors.\n\n General Hospital and Guiding Light soap star Joe Marinelli dead at 68 \nHer final episode as Ramirez will air this week, after she previously swallowed a harmful mix of pills and alcohol upon learning she would be sent to Belize by Maurice Bernard's Sonny Corinthos.\nLaRue said she suspected her character would get the boot earlier this year.\n'I started to feel it in January. They tried to rehabilitate my character and then all of a sudden, I have these scenes in January where, because Natalia had lied about her ex-husband and broken his trust, Sonny was like, \"We can’t be friends anymore.\"\n'And I thought, \"Uh-oh, there we go,\" because that [relationship with Sonny] was kind of my character's only lifeline.'\nThe actress detailed the struggle to make viewers like her character.\n'People just weren't buying it, because they just hated my character so much,' she explained. \n'I was so vilified that no matter what [the writers] did, it just wasn't a solid enough rehabilitation that they were gonna buy me with Sonny. And so when they finally let that idea go, I realized, \"Okay, I'm probably not much longer for this world.\"'\n\nEva's exit comes just a over one year after the 58-year-old actress debuted the role of Blaze's (Jacqueline Grace Lopez) homophobic mom\n\nSpeaking to Soap Opera Digest, Eva confirmed, 'I was originally only supposed to be on the show for a couple of months and it ended up being a much longer run'\n\nSome of the General Hospital cast pictured in 2023\nShe also noted the contrast between playing Natalia and All My Children's Maria, who was a hit with fans.\n'It was hard for me, actually — for me as a person,' she reflected. 'When you play a character like Maria Santos, love her or hate her, she was not ever meant to be a vilified character. And so it was hard from being that character, being a fan favorite, to being, like, literally hated.'\nShe added, 'The GH fans couldn't stand [Natalia]! So that was tough, because especially if you are accustomed to being rooted for, to be rooted against is not as comfortable.'\nDespite the friction with fans, Eva stressed that she enjoyed her time on the show.\n'I had a blast at General Hospital. I loved being there and I had a lot of really great scenes and I loved everybody that I got to work with,' she told the outlet. \n'It was just an awesome experience, and I was really glad that I got to stay longer than I was supposed to.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGeneral Hospital actress Eva LaRue exits show after only one year\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Instead, Longoria opted to stay in Spain — and “sizzle” on the beach in a tiny pink bikini on Saturday, as the Daily Mail said. The U.K. outlet published photos of Longoria’s “sizzle” and said she could potentially steal attention from Sanchez, as if that was possible over the weekend.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Longoria had obligations with family or her CNN travel show that would have kept her from the wedding of the year in Venice. But in skipping the ceremony, she avoided being seen among the excesses of Sanchez’s omnipresent décolletage and Bezos’s “walking penis” look, as well as is need to flaunt his $237 billion fortune. Longoria also could protect her public image from being associated with local protests against the three-day “takeover” of Venice by the oligarchic, Trump-friendly newlyweds.\n\nNow, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sydney Sweeney, Orlando Bloom, Bill Gates and the Kardashians have to live down that association. Of course, the Kardashians — especially Kim Kardashian — have long shown a shamelessness about consorting with controversial figures, including with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who, not surprisingly, were guests at the wedding. But Winfrey and DiCaprio, especially, like to be seen as advocates for regular people or for progressive causes, such as the environment or promoting 2024 efforts to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again.\n\nNow Winfrey, DiCaprio and everyone associated with the Bezos-Sanchez wedding “suck,” as Theron said at a gala Saturday night on behalf of her Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, Page Six reported. “I think we might be the only people who did not get an invite to the Bezos wedding,” the Oscar winner deadpanned onstage at the party. “But that’s OK because they suck and we’re cool.”\n\nKatie Couric also slammed Sanchez’s bridal look, including her “tacky” Dolce & Gabbana gown, according to TMZ. The journalist said on Instagram Friday: “Welcome to the eighties—when big hair and conspicuous consumption ruled.”\n\nMeanwhile, Olivia Munn joined a number of other female A-listers in throwing shade at the Amazon founder especially by praising his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, over the weekend, Page Six reported. Munn replied “truly incredible” to an Instagram post by Mia Farrow, which told how Scott, Bezos’s first wife and the mother of his four children, had given more than $19 billion to more than 1,600 charitable organizations as of December 2024. Katie Holmes, Sarah Jessica Parker and Rosanna Arquette also responded positively to Farrow’s post.\n\nLongoria has reasons for not wanting to be on the receiving end of anti-Sanchez and Bezos criticism. She has tried to carve out a side career for herself as a well-known activist on behalf of the less fortunate. Perhaps as much or more than Winfrey, she also campaigned on behalf of Kamala Harris in 2024, and she runs a foundation in her own name to “help Latinas build better futures for themselves and their families through education and entrepreneurship.” In the wake of Trump’s crackdown on immigration, Longoria has been active on social media, blasting his police mass deportations and his allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to target Latino communities.\n\nLongoria has previously faced backlash over her friendship with Sanchez and Bezos, especially after Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, told his editors to kill an endorsement of Harris. Reports showed that Longoria had accepted a $50 million gift from Bezos and Sanchez earlier in 2024, to be shared with nonprofits of her choice. When accepting the award, Longoria praised the couple for their “courage and civility.”","summary":"A well-known friend of the controversial couple managed to avoid the Venice extravaganza -- and the global backlash.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/01/how-a-famous-lauren-sanchez-friend-ditched-worst-people-wedding/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/APTOPIX_Italy_Venice_Bezos_Wedding_39328_a9a8c7-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 17:31:40","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":337183174,"title":"Iranian hackers threaten to release Trump associates’ emails in ‘calculated smear campaign’","text":"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the threatened cyberattack a “calculated smear campaign” designed to undermine the Trump administration, evidenced by its targets.\n\n“A hostile foreign adversary is threatening to illegally exploit purportedly stolen and unverified material in an effort to distract, discredit, and divide,” the agency said in a statement late Monday. “This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence.”\n\n“This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” the agency said.\n\nOther allies of the president reportedly included in the stolen emails are Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan and pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who took Trump to court over allegations that he paid her hush money to cover up their purported romantic affair.\n\nThe hackers told Reuters that they might sell the emails but did not disclose their plans or the contents of the material.\n\nThe cyber threat actor wanted the outlet to “broadcast this matter,” according to the news agency.\n\nThe same group hacked into the email accounts of Trump associates and distributed the contents to the news media ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The move, however, did not dramatically alter the outcome of the race between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nFollowing the email leak, the Justice Department alleged in a September 2024 indictment that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps oversaw the hacking operation. The hackers did not respond to the allegation, and Iran has denied any involvement in cyber espionage.\n\nTrump administration officials are not tolerating the cyberattack group’s latest veiled threat.\n\n“These criminals will be found and they will be brought to justice,” CISA said. “Let this be a warning to others, there will be no refuge, tolerance, or leniency for these actions.”","summary":"An Iran-linked cyberattack group is threatening to release a batch of emails stolen from President Donald Trump&#8217;s closest associates.

CBS Documentary Decrying Oligarchs Omits Notorious Lefty Billionaires","text":"A CBS News documentary blasted America’s supposed transition to a so-called “Gilded Age” of oligarchs to attack President Trump and the tech leaders who stood with him at his inauguration. As if CBS stood for Channeling Bernie Sanders. The problem: The documentary conveniently excluded any mention about the most notorious left-wing billionaires in U.S. politics that have used their cash to either try to buy elections or drastically overhaul U.S. policy over the years.\n\nCoincidence? We think not.\n\n The CBS documentary released June 28, “Is America in a New Gilded Age? Wealth, Power and Democracy,” relied mostly on whiny anti-capitalist commentary from radical talking heads like millionaires Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Clinton stooge Robert Reich to slam American capitalism as the culprit for Trump’s return to the White House, and by extension X owner Elon Musk’s tenure as the overseer of DOGE.\n\n“[A]fter the last presidential election, tensions over wealth, power and democracy have only heightened,” sensationalized CBS senior business and technology correspondent Jo Ling Kent. She admitted during a CBS Mornings appearance the day prior to her documentary’s release that her work was inspired by millionaire President Joe Biden’s farewell address warning about a rising “oligarchy.” See where this is going? \n\nKent propped up Sanders and like-minded leftist legislators like fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) who “began the Fighting Oligarchy tour, holding rallies around the country to push back against what he argues is a corrupting influence of billionaires on U.S. politics.” But for all Kent and others’ grumbling over figures like Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Kent completely bypassed the ungodly political influence of other lefty billionaire titans who have built empires on the amount of political power they’ve gained during their lengthy careers. \n\nWATCH: CBS News Reporter Jo Ling Kent Hawks Her Anti-Billionaire Documentary on CBS Mornings (June 27, 2025). \n\nThese include George Soros (and now his son Alex by extension) who has spewed $32 billion into his Open Society Foundations to foment racial strife, buoy climate change fanaticism, stoke LGBTQ political furor, push for open borders and undercut American sovereignty on the world stage. In addition, Soros spent hundreds of millions collectively on electing extremist political candidates and soft-on-crime prosecutors in order to shape politics to be the mirror reflection of his unhinged, anti-American worldview. His son Alex, who now controls his father's empire, openly promotes his enormous political pull with America's and the world's most powerful leaders on social media, including Biden.\n\n(Left to right: Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Reid Hoffman)\n\nOther high-profile billionaires missing from the documentary included Michael Bloomberg, who spent over $1 billion trying to buy the 2020 election, pledged another $1 billion at least to wipe out the U.S. coal industry, and spent $47 million during the 2024 election alone to elect Vice President Kamala Harris and help Democrats maintain control over the House; and deranged LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman who spent millions to elect Harris in 2024 and who personally bankrolled the highly politicized sexual abuse lawsuit against Trump brought by leftist E. Jean Carroll. \n\nReid Hoffman was specifically part of a cohort of left-wing billionaires like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, philanthropist Laurene Powell-Jobs and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz who spent fortunes on secretive political machines to help Biden get elected in 2020. These weren’t mentioned by Kent either, which is even more telling given she also cited leftist anti-Trump author Andrea Bernstein who chirped, “What are you going to do if you’re wealthy and you have a lot of money? You’re going to put some of that into the political system to try to influence outcomes so that you can hang on to even more money. That’s the way the system works.” Ironic. \n\nTo Kent’s credit, she did interview four guests who rebuffed the idea that America was reentering a Gilded Age (including Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley and Competitive Enterprise Institute President Kent Lassman), but these were largely dwarfed by another eight commentators who were just attacking and smearing the billionaires who have coalesced around Trump. For example, Kent tee’d up Dartmouth Sociology Professor Brooke Harrington, whose antagonistic term “broligarchs” she defined as rich people who “decide that they get to keep all the money and that they’re not going to pay any of their fair share of the costs of the society that made them prosperous.” Harrington then used this term to go after Musk and his businesses, but not other powerful billionaires who share her anti-capitalist views, such as Soros. \n\nHypocritically, Kent didn’t bother to mention the enormous ESG asset manager giants that represent three of the top four institutional shareholders of her parent company Paramount Global and her liberal competitor networks at NBC, ABC, and CNN: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which manage over $26 trillion in assets. Sounds pretty oligarchy-adjacent, but apparently not for Kent.\n\nShe had the audacity to cherry-pick Bezos’s purchase of The Washington Post and Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of social media giant Twitter as examples of the inherent problems in business tycoons owning media. “One of the real dangers of great concentrated wealth is that not only does it exert influence politically, but it also exerts influence through its ownership of the media,” Reich complained to Kent. The CBS journalist followed up by referring back to how “in the Gilded Age, the ultra-wealthy could buy almost anything. And one prize for many was the means to influence public opinion.” Pretty sure the C-suites at BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were just tickled pink over that, eh Jo?\n\n“Owning a media company has always been viewed as an accessory for the very powerful,” pontificated Bloomberg Businessweek editor Brad Stone, who along with Kent apparently forgot that eco-activist Michael Bloomberg, worth $104 billion, owns his magazine. But Kent sure let him get in some digs at Bezos for daring to exercise his authority as The Post owner to shift the Opinion Page to a more free market position and ban the editorial board’s objectivity-wrecking tradition of endorsing political candidates. \n\nRiley, in one of his brief appearances in the documentary, slammed the hypocrisy of the left in fixating on billionaires when they seem to be oblivious to the special interests financing their own side. “Are people on the left complaining that other wealthy individuals decide to spend their money on electing people who want to go soft on criminals that are raising hell in low income communities?” He continued: “If you’re spending your money a certain way, you’re okay. If you’re spending it on free market ideas and principles — if you want lower taxes, if you want smaller government and so forth — somehow you are villainous.” \n\nKent conceded that 80 billionaires donated to Harris’s campaign in 2024, while just over 50 billionaires did the same for Trump. But her documentary was clear in its implication that the only titans that matter to her and the CBS media giant are the ones that curry favor with Trump, while ignoring other, more dangerous political players on the left, including her own shareholder bosses. \n\nWatch the entire CBS documentary slamming billionaires by clicking on this link.","summary":"A CBS News documentary blasted America’s supposed transition to a so-called “Gilded Age” of oligarchs to attack President Trump and the tech leaders who stood with him at his inauguration.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy PETER ROBERTSON FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:17:40 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:18:04 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nJonathan Ross has taken a swipe at actor Tom Cruise's changing appearance, after the actor sparked a flurry of speculation with his smooth visage.\nIn recent weeks, Tom, 62, has hit headlines by looking remarkably younger than his previous self, though a surgeon previously told DailyMail.com it's unlikely he's gone under the knife.\nSpeaking in the latest episode of his Reel Talks podcast with daughter Honey, Jonathan was discussing his thoughts on the new Formula One movie F1.\nComparing Tom's appearance that of the film's star Brad Pitt, the presenter said the Mission Impossible star 'doesn't look like him anymore.' \nHe said: 'You've probably seen the poster around town - it's Brad Pitt looking incredible. \n'He has aged remarkably, because even though Tom Cruise still looks good for his age, you can see there's been a bit of tweaking going on there, you know. \n\nJonathan Ross has taken a swipe at actor Tom Cruise 's changing appearance, after the actor sparked a flurry of speculation with his smooth visage\n\nIn recent weeks, Tom (left in April and right in 2023) has hit headlines by looking remarkably younger than his previous self\n'He's definitely got a ton of filler in that face, I'm sure. Yeah, I've met him up close. I like Tom, he's a really nice man when you meet him. \n'He's got that kind of Play-Doh face that people get when they have a lot of filler. \n'To be honest, I wish he hadn't done it cos he's got such a great face, he was a naturally very handsome man when young, and he would be a handsome man when older. \n'He's still… he's not unattractive, but it doesn't look that much like him anymore. You can see it doesn't look natural. \n'It's not because they don't look their age, it's because the shape of the face now looks somewhat different.'\nTom has hit headlines in recent weeks after fans remarked he was looking younger than his usual self.\nYet a plastic surgeon confirmed to DailyMail.com that it doesn't appear as though the actor has gone under the knife and instead his youthful look could be down to weightloss.\nDr Kahn explained: 'I still say that does not look like he has had any plastic surgery.\n\nComparing Tom's appearance that of the film's star Brad Pitt, the presenter said the Mission Impossible star 'doesn't look like him anymore'\n\nTom's appearance in a Superbowl commercial back in February first sparked comments that his face looked oddly 'puffy' and 'stretched'\n\nEXCLUSIVE Plastic surgeons explain Tom Cruise's unrecognizable face after puffy-cheeked Super Bowl appearance \n'It actually looks like he has lots a ton of weight and been working out more. He also has a nice summer tan going on.'\nWhile there is no indication that Tom has been taking Ozempic, Dr Kahn suggested that the star may have given up carbs and alcohol as he has no puffiness in his face, which he had in 2023.\nDr Kahn previously said he thinks the screen hunk may have done Microdermabrasion. 'It's a simple procedure that yields great results,' he said.\nMicrodermabrasion (MDA) is a minimally invasive epidermal resurfacing procedure used to treat uneven skin tone/texture, photoaging, striae, melasma, and scars, including acne scars.\nIt is one of the most common nonsurgical cosmetic procedures performed in the United States.\nIn the past DailyMail.com has also reported that Cruise may had gotten fillers in his face and used Botox to freeze his facial muscles.\nListen to the full episode of Reel Talks with Jonathan and Honey Ross on Global Player. \nTom CruiseJonathan RossBrad Pitt\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJonathan Ross blasts Tom Cruise's changing appearance and insists he 'doesn't look like him anymore' after actor, 62, sparked surgery rumours: 'He's got that kind of Play-Doh face'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

We took the classic Manhattan and gave it a spicy twist using our Hot Habanero sauce. Meet the Brooklyn23.' \nDavid often appears front and centre of Haig Club ad campaigns and doesn't shy away from events and public appearances to plug the whisky, which he helped launch.\nDespite being an ambassador for the brand, David has shared in the past that he isn't a 'big drinker' and often enjoys a healthy lifestyle.\nWhile he has reportedly gained significant profit from endorsing Haig Club, David could be set for new limits if he does go down the road of his own alcohol brand.\nBrooklyn spent the weekend celebrating his father-in-law Nelson, posing in happy family snaps from the billionaire's 83rd birthday.\nHis wife Nicola Peltz has shared another gushing post about her 'most loving father' after throwing Nelson a lavish birthday party over the weekend.\n\nCloud 23 is named after the No.23 jersey his father wore at Real Madrid and LA Galaxy.

The expert is John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. He said young men aged 18 to 29 are starting to turn against Trump. More young people now feel that Trump is harming them, not helping. During the 2024 election, Trump won in tight races in key battleground states, mainly because he reached out to unhappy young men. Trump used right-wing influencers and anti-woke messages to connect with these young men, according to the report by The Daily Beast. Della Volpe believes young men helped Trump win the election. Now, many of these voters feel Trump didn’t keep his promises, especially about the economy. Young voters are now asking: “I thought this would help me financially. What happened?”Della Volpe advised Joe Biden in 2020 and also helped a group that supported Kamala Harris in 2024. Under Trump, the economy has been unstable. His “Liberation Day” tariffs in April made imported goods more expensive, and that cost is hitting regular people, as per reports. ALSO READ: Trump freezes $5–$6.8 billion in school funding — parents and teachers need to take note of these pointsLive EventsYoung voters feel misled about economyJoanna Coles, host of the podcast, said she was surprised these voters didn’t learn from Trump’s first term (2017–2021). Della Volpe explained that 18–24 year olds only saw Trump during the early pandemic, so they didn’t get the full picture, as per reports. Voters in their late 20s and 30s do remember Trump’s first term and are more likely to support Democrats now. What young people really want is stability in life, especially when it comes to money and jobs. Many young men liked Trump’s strong, macho image, not necessarily his policies, as per the report by The Daily Beast. Now, many are unhappy with Trump againThey saw Trump as a guy who could “fight the system” for people who felt nervous about money. But now, after just six months of Trump being president again, many young people feel disappointed. Trump’s approval among young people is only in the 30% range. A report in late April by Harvard said over 40% of Americans under 30 are just barely getting by financially. Less than one-third of young people approve of Trump. During the campaign, Trump got a lot of support from young Latino men. But now, 52% of young Hispanic Americans say they are still struggling to make ends meet — worse than young white (38%) or Black (45%) people, as reported by The Daily Beast.FAQsQ1. Why are young voters regretting their support for Trump?Many young voters feel Trump didn’t improve the economy like he promised and now think he’s doing more harm than good.Q2.

In a wide-ranging exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Lindy Li, a former DNC fundraiser and National Finance Committee member, detailed her front-row seat to Biden's presidency and the people who pulled the strings behind the scenes. \"[Biden is] definitely complicit, but there were a lot of people behind him, like puppet masters. [Former first lady Jill Biden] very much knew what she was doing. What she did was absolutely elder abuse. There is no question in my mind,\" Li said. Last week, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., issued a subpoena to Anthony Bernal, former assistant to the president and senior advisor to the first lady, to appear for a July 16 deposition. TOP BIDEN OFFICIALS SUMMONED TO TESTIFY ABOUT ALLEGED COVER-UP OF FORMER PRESIDENT'S MENTAL FITNESS \"They deny the cover-up, but I had a front-row seat watching it happen. People like Anthony Bernal. I saw him running the White House like he was in charge, like he was a king. It's just so amazing now to see him dodge a subpoena and completely dodge accountability. He can run, but he can't hide. His name is going to go down in infamy forever,\" Li told Fox News Digital. WHO IS ANTHONY BERNAL?: THE 'INDISPENSABLE' BIDEN AIDE DITCHING HOUSE OVERSIGHT PROBE ON HIS MENTAL DECLINE Bernal had confirmed his appearance for a voluntary transcribed interview before the committee on June 26, but after the White House Counsel’s office informed him it was waiving executive privilege for the Oversight committee’s investigation, he refused to appear. Li said Bernal, who also served as the first lady's chief of staff, \"followed Jill around like a dog.\" While Bernal's apparent power grab coincided with Jill Biden's growing role in the Biden White House, Li added that he ran the East Wing more than the West Wing. Li, who attended events at the White House and organized fundraisers in critical battleground states during the 2024 presidential election, said that in addition to Bernal, deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, counselor Steve Ricchetti and senior advisors Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon were among those running the White House during Biden's presidency. Fox News Digital reached out to the aforementioned Biden aides but did not receive a response. Biden's former domestic policy advisor, Neera Tanden, testified for hours before the House Oversight Committee last week about her knowledge of the autopen, an automatic signature tool used throughout past presidencies that allowed aides to sign pardons, memos and other important documents on Biden's behalf. Tanden told reporters that she \"answered every question, was pleased to discuss my public service, and it was a thorough process,\" adding she was \"glad I answered everyone's question.\" Li said Tanden played an \"intricate\" role in using the autopen when \"Biden was manifestly unqualified and unable to prosecute the duties of the office.\" The former DNC insider said Tanden's remarks that she \"answered every question\" reminded her of Jill Biden's demeanor after her husband's disastrous and consequential debate performance one year ago. Li said she was in the room when Jill proclaimed, \"You answered every question!\" and said the Democratic Party went to great lengths, even then, to cover up Biden's cognitive decline. She said that included talking points from Biden's campaign managers, who claimed Biden couldn't drop out of the race due to campaign finance laws. \"This is such an eerie parallel. It's not enough to just give empty answers,\" Li said. The former Democrat, who said she has faced the wrath of her former friends and colleagues since she left the party, added that Jill Biden was ultimately the one running the White House. \"Joe was not able to do a lot of campaign events, so Jill would come out on his behalf, acting like the president or the presidential candidate. That's why she graced the Vogue cover three times. She loved it. If I were to pinpoint two reasons why Joe decided to run again, it would be two people: Jill and Hunter Biden. Because Hunter Biden's freedom was on the line and Jill's ego was on the line,\" Li said. Before the president ultimately dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris last summer, Jill Biden took a break from the campaign trail to show her support for Hunter Biden at his federal trial.

His claim is that the incredible pace of technological progress in our era will, in practice, solve many of the economic and ideological struggles that once pushed humanity to develop theories and abstract solutions.\n\nOf course, we cannot fully endorse or entirely reject this claim just yet. We are only a quarter of the way through the 21st century and technological progress continues at a truly astonishing pace. Achievements and discoveries that once took centuries or generations are now emerging in months, not years.\n\nThe whole is no longer what it was, and it will never again be what it is today, given the pace of economic shifts, innovations, shifts in professions, evolving beliefs and interests, the tremors shaking the structures of societies and their interactions, and the limbo that politics and value systems have entered.\n\nOur societies, all of them, are intellectually teetering between extremism and counterextremism, and between isolationism and the collapse of barriers to invasions that had stood in their way regardless of pretext.\n\nIn short, these are uncertain times. And the wisest among us are those who place no bets, believe no one’s rhetoric and take no risks backing any political project.\n\nEven in Western democracies that have long found comfort in the stability of their institutions, unlike our own “young” states in the so-called Third World, everything is changing before our eyes and the eyes of their citizens.\n\nThe very notion of the nation state, although it seemed firmly entrenched and secure after the end of the Cold War, is now threatened by populist and racist politics. The Ukraine war has sparked immense fear across Europe, which has become terrified of a power that is still nostalgic for the era of czars and red banners.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK’s exit from the EU was driven by the far-right isolationists who now threaten to dethrone the country’s two major parties, the Conservatives and Labour, with the rising proto-fascist isolationists well placed to replace them. At the same time, a resurgence of the Labour left seems to be on the cards, as the credibility of the current Labour government declines. The state of affairs in Britain is part of a broader pattern across Western Europe: moderate forces on the right and left are in decline, while the extreme right and, to a lesser extent, the radical left are gaining ground.\n\nThis is also obvious in France, where Marine Le Pen’s far-right and Jean-Luc Melenchon’s left-wing movements have gained ground. In Germany, it can be seen in the rising popularity of the Alternative for Germany party, while Italy’s Giorgia Meloni is the leader of the Brothers of Italy party. In Portugal and Spain, the far right (Chega and Vox, respectively) are embracing the legacies of the fascist regimes, led by dictators Antonio Salazar and Francisco Franco, that imposed their rule for decades.\n\nWith its strategy for reversing the challenge posed by the far right’s upward trajectory, the traditional moderate left is losing its soul and ability to resist. Frankly, this outcome is not surprising at all. The most these anti-far-right forces can hope for is to build fragile, ad hoc alliances that have no credibility, principles or platform.\n\nYes, all the moderate Western left has done is evade honest conversations, buy time with empty rhetoric and seek to contain the rise of the far right, whose fervor drives its pursuit of wiping out its opponents entirely. The result? The far right is now dictating the political agenda and determining priorities.\n\nIn Britain, for instance, the far-right Reform UK party recently surpassed the ruling Labour Party in opinion polls. This is a telling message and a dire warning delivered to a party that has sacrificed its core principles in an attempt to appease powerful lobbies and temporarily broaden its appeal in the face of a populist force willing to ride any wave.\n\nIn the US, the Democratic Party has made serious mistakes, dragging its feet far too long and trying to cash in on empty slogans.\n\nDemocrats understood the nature of the battle they faced in 2016 against Trump and his populist “Make America Great Again” base. However, they have committed two grave errors. First, they underestimated the far-right’s capacity for stirring anti-immigrant sentiment among unskilled workers and the Rust Belt.\n\nSecond, they ignored the material demands at the heart of this struggle. The US’ most prominent left-wing politician, Sen. Bernie Sanders, did recognize this problem. He tried to appeal to disaffected working-class voters and bring them back into the Democratic fold to ensure they did not become easy prey for Trump and MAGA.\n\nThe Democrats repeated the same mistake later. This time, it was more egregious. The unconditional support of Joe Biden’s administration for Benjamin Netanyahu and his Gaza war cost the party’s 2024 candidate, Kamala Harris, tens of thousands of votes from the left, as well as the votes of Muslims and Arab Americans in key swing states … votes that could have gone her way, at least in theory.\n\nMamdani may or may not win November’s mayoral race in New York — a city that remains the hub of Jewish American life. Nonetheless, he has shown his party that victory is impossible without clear principles, no matter how risky sticking to them may seem.\n\nMamdani understands that the people of New York face urgent material crises that need solutions, not the empty slogans of opportunists and domestic and foreign lobbies that are amplified by Fox News and the like.\n\nEven in the century of technology and virtual worlds, people still need bread, jobs, medicine, employment and social security.\n\nCourtesy: arabnews","summary":"Eyad Abu Shakra The rise of Zohran Mamdani, who last week won the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City, the largest and most impressive city in the US, has jolted the American public out of their slumber, which had seemed endless since Donald Trump entered the White House.

Tim Walz, and James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump.\n\n On the June 26 episode of his and David Spade's podcast, Fly on the Wall, guest Julie Bowen asked Carvey what it was like to embody the former president on the late-night sketch comedy show, which produced an interesting answer.\n\n Carvey was put on the spot about whether he had any regrets about how he'd portrayed the former president. \n\n Carvey called the experience playing Biden on SNL \"surreal\" and \"bizarre,\" but also \"at times, a lot of fun.\"\n\n The Modern Family star, 55, then asked whether he now feels any \"guilt\" about his portrayal, given the belief that \"Biden is severely diminished\" now.\n\n To that, Carvey said, \"I knew that he was compromised mentally, I mean, it was obvious. But it was a delicate thing in the comedy world.\"\n\n He revealed that there were \"a lot of people who did not want to do anything that would kind of ding him in an awkward way\" in the comedy space, understandably.\n\n \"But it's comedy!\" Bowen noted.\n\n Carvey revealed what he thought was the \"key\" to his version of Biden. \n\n \"If I can make Biden funny to everybody, then I am where I want to be,\" Carvey told Bowen and his co-host. \"And to make it funny, it had to be recognizable. And so there were certain things I did not include in my package.\"\n\n Bowen again praised Carvey's impression as \"fantastic,\" while Spade, 60, noted that Biden was \"fair game\" in the comedy world because he was president, which made it \"easier\" to poke fun at him.\n\n \"I think it’s easier to make fun of him if he’s the president than if it’s just a 90-whatever-year-old man and just go, 'Look at this a------.' So once he’s president, he’s more fair game,\" Spade said.\n\n After several weeks as Biden, Carvey transitioned over to a hilarious impression of Elon Musk in the aftermath of the election. \n\n On the Nov. 10 episode of SNL, just days after Trump won, Carvey made his debut as Musk in a cold-open that saw the cast jokingly reveal they'd been supporting Trump throughout the whole election.\n\n He jumped up and down in a \"Dark MAGA\" hat and declared, as Musk, \"Seriously, I run the country now.\"\n\n \"America's going to be like one of my rockets, you know?

As Republicans hold narrow leads in both chambers of Congress, the races may offer Democrats key opportunities to flip seats in the 2026 midterms.What To KnowTillis, who voted against President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" spending bill, announced on Sunday that he would not seek a third term in the Senate. His term is set to end in January 2027.According to analysis in the Cook Political Report, Tillis' announcement makes the state a \"top pickup opportunity\" for Democrats. While Cook previously said the race leaned Republican, it now describes it as a toss-up state—meaning it could go either way.Meanwhile, Bacon, who took office in 2017 and has opposed Trump's tariff powers, announced Monday that he would not seek reelection.Cook reported that while the 2026 race was always going to be \"a crucial battle in the fight for control of the House,\" Bacon's retirement meant the district had moved from a toss-up state to one that leans Democrat.What People Are SayingWilliam F. Hall, an adjunct professor of political science at Webster University, Washington University and Maryville University in St. Louis, told Newsweek: \"These two announcements of decisions made by two very conservative Republican senators, I believe reflect and represent—for the first time in a very tangible way—the beginnings of a significant fissure and split opening up within the heretofore solidly unified, conservative Republican political caucus. Considering the extremely slim margin of the majority currently held by Republicans in the U.S. Senate, this recent political development would also seem to allow for the very real potential possibility for an opportunity for the Democrats to make actual inroads in the U.S. Senate in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.\"Analyst Jessica Taylor wrote in the Cook Political Report newsletter: \"The surprise move from Tillis moves this race into the toss-up category and officially makes the Tar Heel State Democrat's top pickup opportunity.\"Analyst Erin Covey wrote about Nebraska in the Cook Political Report newsletter: \"While this race remains highly competitive, Democrats should have an advantage in 2026, and it's become the number one seat on the party's target list.\"Madison Andrus, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a news release on Friday: \"The writing has been on the wall for months. Nebraskans are tired of the false promises that Republicans are trying to sell and they want real results. Don Bacon's decision to not seek reelection in 2026 is the latest vote of no-confidence for House Republicans and their electoral prospects. Next November, Nebraskans are going to elect a Democrat who will actually deliver for them.\"What Happens NextThe general elections for Bacon's and Tillis' seats are scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026.","summary":"With Representative Don Bacon and Senator Thom Tillis stepping down, races in Nebraska and North Carolina may be more competitive.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-races-tillis-north-carolina-nebraska-2092972","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2674549/republicans-democrats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 15:42:53","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":337181582,"title":"EastEnders fans open-mouthed as iconic BBC star appears in casino advert 21 years on from Walford exit - but do you recognise her?","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEastEnders fans open-mouthed as iconic BBC star appears in casino advert 21 years on from Walford exit - but do you recognise her?\n\nHave YOU got a story?

Where did you get pro-Donald? What you had was respect for office. And it’s great how people spin narratives to things that I think best fit whatever they’re against. You know what I’m saying? Instead of giving a brother the exact fundamental of what he did, what he said. Nobody’s doing that anymore,” the rapper added.\n\nHe also took aim at Kamala Harris, who was a former California prosecutor. Nelly reminded his audience that she locked up thousands of black men, and he also slammed her for having a “white husband,” Doug Emhoff.\n\nNelly responded to podcast fans in a written response, saying, “I’ll put whatever up me and Snoop do more in the community and have been doing for over 20 + years against any of you that are just on here talking trash and have no stats to back up what you mean to the community.”\n\n“From the Black families that we employ to the Black children that we help every day and all year through our nonprofits. Whether we’re sending kids to schools on scholarships to HBCU or helping young black boys in LA, gang central with his (Snoop’s) junior football programs, many players have gone on to go to the NFL and live their dreams.”\n\n“And on top of that, we are ‘Black Men’ married to beautiful Black women with black children. It should be inspiring to most, but that some of y’all have a problem with because the prosecutor who has probably locked up more black men than we’ve helped,” he added.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)\n\nHe also pointed out that Kamala “did not win the election,” and Trump did.\n\nThe rapper went on to say, “again I reiterate, I did not campaign for anyone. I do not tell people who to vote for. I respect and love our country from top to bottom good and bad… and I am very aware that it’s a lot of things in this country that we need to work on the right is too far right and the left is too far left.”\n\n“I’m a military baby with a grand uncle who is a Tuskegee airmen and red tail that was very prideful for his country I told you it’s my respect for the office meaning any president that calls upon Nelly it would be a honor… nothing to do with money,” Nelly wrote.\n\n“Nothing to do with race but if you wanna make it about race, then let’s goooooooooooooo I find it very interesting,” he said.\n\n“That’s so many of you would dump on the two black men that’s married to black women that has black children because the woman of color with the white husband and white kids. Didn’t win..!!” he snarked.\n\nThis is not the first time that Nelly has addressed the criticism for his appearance at the president’s inaugural party.\n\nBack in January when it was announced that he was set to perform for Trump’s event, he said that he accepted the invite because it is an “honor” to perform for a president.\n\n“I’m not doing this for money. I’m doing this ’cause it’s an honor. I respect the office,” Nelly said. “It don’t matter who is in office. The same way that our men and women, our brothers and sisters who protect this country, have to go to war and have to put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office.”\n\n“So, if they can put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office, I can damn sure perform for whoever [is] in office,” he added.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.","summary":"Rapper Nelly has clapped back at critics who slammed him for performing at one of President Donald Trump's inaugural events and he took a serious swipe at election loser and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\nThe post Nelly Defends His Trump Inauguration Performance, Slams Kamala Harris for &#8216;Locking Up Black Men’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/07/01/nelly-defends-his-trump-inauguration-performance-slams-kamala-harris-for-locking-up-black-men/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Nelly-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 15:31:33","author":"The Shade Room,Warner Todd Huston","authors":["The Shade Room","Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":337144194,"title":"Martina Navratilova gives sharp reaction to Donald Trump demanding Elon Musk be deported to South Africa amid duo's controversial blame game","text":"Martina Navratilova didn’t hold back after Donald Trump escalated his feud with Elon Musk, telling the Tesla CEO to go back to South Africa. Once political allies, the two have now turned on each other in a very public spat.The fallout began in late May when the White House passed the controversial ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ which included major cuts to clean energy programs and a faster phase-out of the $7,500 EV tax credit. Musk, who has been the CEO of Tesla since 2008, criticized the move because it would directly hurt his business.Since then, the back-and-forth has only gotten uglier. Musk claimed Trump couldn’t have beaten Kamala Harris without his support and even announced he was leaving DOGE. The President fired back with an ultimatum on Truth Social, and that’s when Navratilova stepped in with a firm reaction of her own.“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump wrote. “It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” he added.Martina Navratilova replied:“So it would appear.”Elon Musk has also fired back at Donald Trump, daring him to cut all subsidies that Tesla has received if he truly believes the company is dependent on government support.Martina Navratilova calls Donald Trump a 'blackmailer' after he warns Elon Musk over losing 'a lot more' than EV mandateMartina Navratilova | Image Source: GettyHours after his fiery Truth Social post, Donald Trump was pressed by reporters about his fallout with Elon Musk.At first, he tried to downplay the situation. But as the questioning continued, Trump claimed Musk was “upset” over losing his EV mandate, and warned that the Tesla CEO could end up losing a lot more than that.“What happened to Elon Musk?” the reporter asked.\"Nothing. He's upset he's losing his EV mandate. But he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you right now. Elon can lose a lot more than that,” Trump replied.Martina Navratilova took to X to call Trump a “blackmailer,” writing:“Blackmailer in chief is at it again and still.”","summary":"Martina Navratilova didn’t hold back after Donald Trump escalated his feud with Elon Musk, telling the Tesla CEO to go back to South Africa.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/news-martina-navratilova-gives-sharp-reaction-donald-trump-demanding-elon-musk-deported-south-africa-amid-duo-s-controversial-blame-game","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/d6fe0-17513828027410-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 15:24:26","author":"Pritha Ghosh","authors":["Pritha Ghosh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.338}]}
