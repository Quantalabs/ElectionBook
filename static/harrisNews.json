He made national attention by prosecuting President Donald Trump's hush money trial last year.The district attorney has faced tons of scrutiny from Trump's allies as the president has maintained his innocence and claimed the case hush money case was politically motivated against him. He also has faced criticism for being soft on crime, but Bragg seems to have shifted focus. During his first campaign in the 2021 election cycle, he focused on criminal justice reform, now his campaign website says his top priority is \"ending the scourge of gun violence\" and that he's \"cracking down on illegal cannabis stores.\"What To KnowAccording to the New York State Board of Elections, Bragg has raised $185,157.09 in contributions from January 1, 2025, to February 12, 2025.Candidates historically see an influx in donations the closer it gets to an election.In the months leading up to the 2024 general election, fewer contributions were flowing in for Bragg as the nation was focused on the race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as other down-ballot races.From August 29, 2024, to November 4, 2024, Bragg only raised $60,042.00 in contributions, according to the Board of Elections. Post-election—from November 5, 2024, to February 12, 2025—Bragg raised $221,587.09 in contributions from November 5, 2024, to February 12, 2025, with the majority raised in the first month and a half of this year.Richard Fife, Senior Advisor for Alvin Bragg for DA:\"People across Manhattan are coming together to support Alvin Bragg's record of reducing gun violence, investing in mental health outreach, standing up for victims, and holding the powerful accountable. We know safety concerns are real, and we've got a lot of work ahead of us, but we are inspired, excited, and appreciative of the support Alvin is receiving.\"Meanwhile, Bragg's Republican opponent, criminal defense attorney Maud Maron, has raised $15,237.26 from January 1, 2025, to February 12, 2025, according to the Board of Elections. She's raised $68,774.35 in contributions in total since August 29, 2024.Newsweek reached out to Maron's campaign via social media direct message on Wednesday.Details About Trump's Hush Money CaseIn May 2024, a New York jury found Trump, guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before his first presidential election in 2016. Daniels alleges she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies.Less than two weeks before his January inauguration, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan gave him an unconditional discharge, meaning that he would not be punished with prison time, fines or community service. He does, however, have felonies on his criminal record, which changed some things for him moving forward such as his ability to own a gun.What People Are SayingChris Coffey, CEO of political strategy firm Tusk Strategies, told Politico in an article published January 14, \"I'm sure there are plenty of Upper West Siders who cheer [Bragg] on for maintaining the rule of law,\" referring to Trump's hush money conviction.\"I think there are other folks who would say: Hey, shouldn't our focus be making sure the city is safe? During times when folks feel public safety is the No. 1 concern, I think you see elected officials become more moderate,\" he added.Maud Maron, 2025 Republican Manhattan district attorney candidate, told The New York Post in an article published in November 2024, \"As a criminal defense lawyer I advocated for my clients and Manhattan needs an advocate now more than ever...Most of us can remember living in a much safer city and we want that city back.\"What Happens NextBragg is running largely unopposed. He did not have a challenger in this year's Democratic primary as of mid-January, and it will be difficult for his Republican opponent to win in the deeply Democratic area.","summary":"According to the New York State Board of Elections, Bragg has made over $221,000 in contributions since the November 2024 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alvin-bragg-donald-trump-election-campaign-donations-2030256","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587219/alvin-bragg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 23:59:45","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":289886594,"title":"Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco, an avid Trump backer, will join the 2026 governor's race","text":"Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, an avid supporter of President Trump and fierce critic of Gov. Gavin Newsom, will run for governor in 2026. Bianco, a law-and-order conservative, becomes the highest profile Republican to join a race already crowded with Democrats. All hope to succeed Newsom, who is serving his second term and is barred from running again. The race remains wide open, and speculation continues to swirl over whether former Vice President Kamala Harris will jump into the contest. Harris, who lost to Trump in the November presidential election, lives in Brentwood and has had a successful career in California politics, serving as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and representing the state in the U.S. Senate. Bianco plans to announce his official candidacy on Monday, President's Day, in Riverside. His decision to jump into the race was first reported by Politico and confirmed by the Times. Bianco was elected sheriff in 2018 after a long career at the Riverside County Sheriff's Office and re-elected in 2022. He has been considering a run for governor since June. As sheriff, Bianco has been a harsh critic of statewide public safety policies. During the 2024 election, Bianco supported Prop. 36, the ballot measure approved by voters to reverse course on progressive criminal justice reform, cracking down on theft crimes and the use of the deadly drug fentanyl. In 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bianco created a political stir when he vowed not to enforce any potential vaccine mandates for Sheriff's Office employees, saying he believed vaccination was a personal choice. Bianco also faced scrutiny after a data leak revealed that in 2014 he was a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right, anti-government group whose members took part in the pro-Trump insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bianco later said he had discontinued his membership because, like many other law enforcement officers, he felt the organization \"did not offer me anything.\" UC Riverside political scientist Shaun Bowler expects any Republican running for California governor to face a difficult path. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the last Republican elected governor, and that was in 2006. However, he does believe it still may be possible for a moderate Republican to fare well — if the candidate can overcome opposition from the party's right wing. \"Even big money Republican candidates have struggled even in recent years,\" Bowler said. \"... I think it's going to be uphill for him.\" Riverside County also has not proven to be major political springboard in California, at least compared to Los Angeles, Orange County or the Bay Area, so Bianco will have to overcome that disadvantage, Bower said. Since taking office, Trump's controversial actions on border security and his push to deport immigrants residing in the country illegally will almost assuredly be a top issue in California's 2026 race for governor, and the Riverside sheriff has not been shy about expressing his views. Last year, Bianco joined a coalition of sheriffs across the country who endorsed the tough stance on border security taken by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, including transporting immigrants to \"sanctuary\" cities across the country. Earlier this month, though, Bianco announced that Riverside County deputies will not perform \"any type of immigration enforcement,\" saying that fear among local immigrant communities has increased due to raids ordered by the Trump administration. \"There has been an alarming increase in the concern over law enforcement and immigration,\" he said. \"Most of this is being caused by misinformation and fearmongering from dishonest politicians, social media, immigration activists and even disingenuous headlines from the media.\" In January, the Trump administration vowed to investigate and prosecute government officials who do not comply with restrictive orders on immigration. The move, outlined in an internal memo from acting U.S. Deputy Atty. Gen. Emil Bove, instructed state and local officials to comply with federal immigration directives. An executive order Trump signed in January also required federal officials to take actions “to ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.” While Riverside County is not a \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction, the Board of Supervisors recently approved a measure designating Riverside County as a “safe place for all residents, irrespective of immigration status.” A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll released in November found that, if Harris entered the governor's race, nearly half of voters would likely support her. Her entry would likely be bad news for the current field of Democrats in the race, which includes Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state schools chief Tony Thurmond, former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee. Other well-known Democrats who appear to be considering a run for governor include former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.

Tim Walz's daughter, Hope Walz, went viral this week for a series of TikToks criticizing President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports. Walz posted her first video about the issue Saturday, when she called the order \"a dangerous precedent.\" \"It is dangerous for the trans community, women, minorities, anyone who is not a straight white man,\" she said in the video. \"We are talking about human beings, and the president of the United States is targeting them because he thinks it will gain him political points or whatever.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM She suggested the issue of trans athletes in women's and girls sports \"is not real.\" \"I have never felt unsafe around a trans person. I have felt unsafe around men. So, maybe let's deal with that,\" she said. Walz posted a follow-up TikTok addressing the issue Wednesday. In that video, she suggested Trump's Cabinet members have \"allegations.\" She also made claims that more of Trump's 15 Cabinet members have \"credible allegations\" than there are trans athletes in high school sports. Walz did not clarify which members or which allegations she was referring to. \"Transphobia and transphobes are so crazy to me because, like, the whole argument is, ‘Oh, we’re protecting women. We need to protect women.’ But then they turn around and vote for a literal felon, who, he himself as well as many of the people closest to him have credible allegations,\" she said. \"Like, the amount of people with credible allegations in the Cabinet is more than trans kids trying to play high school sports.\" HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE However, the United Nations released study findings saying that nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of victories because they have been defeated by transgender athletes. The study, \"Violence against women and girls in sports,\" said more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. \"The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,\" the report said. Tim Walz was a vocal advocate for transgender and LGBTQ+ rights as Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 election. The issue of transgender athletes competing with girls and women proved to be an issue that affected the outcome of an election in which Harris and Walz lost in a landslide. Shortly after November's election, a national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms\" as important to them. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" A recent New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people polled, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Walz's home state of Minnesota is one of the states that has refused to comply with Trump's executive order. The Minnesota State High School League announced Thursday it will continue to allow transgender athletes to compete against girls despite Trump's executive order to ban them from doing so. The Minnesota organization said in an email to member schools that participation by, and eligibility of, transgender athletes is controlled by the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which includes protections for LGBTQ+ people, and the Minnesota Constitution. \"The Minnesota State High School League, similar to other youth sports organizations, is subject to state anti-discrimination laws, which prohibit discrimination based on gender identity,\" the organization said in a statement. \"Therefore, students in Minnesota are allowed to participate consistent with their gender identity.\" California is another state that has refused to comply with Trump's order. The decision by California not to comply with Trump's order has prompted backlash and even protests and threats of lawsuits.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco is expected to announce his candidacy at a scheduled event Monday in Riverside, California, about 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, in the 2026 race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Bianco, a vocal critic of Newsom and other state Democratic leaders when it comes to the issues of crime and punishment, was one of the leaders who helped push California's Proposition 36 ballot measure to a landslide victory in last November's elections. WHAT SHERIFF CHAD BIANCO TOLD FOX NEWS The measure, which took effect in December, mandates stiffer penalties and longer sentences in California for certain drug and theft crimes. MAJOR CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT PREEDICTS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS WOULD CLEAR GUBERNATORIAL FIELD Bianco, who has worked in law enforcement for more than three decades, was first elected sheriff in 2018. He's been openly flirting with a 2026 gubernatorial run since at least last spring. When asked late last year in a Fox News interview if he knew of anyone who might be capable of producing change in Sacramento – California's capital city – Bianco responded, \"I might, I might know someone that would go there with nothing but common sense and the betterment of the citizens of California rather than some crazy ideological agenda that truly makes absolutely no sense to any of us.\" It's been nearly two decades since a Republican won statewide office in heavily blue California. You have to go all the way back to former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election victory. There has been plenty of speculation since former Vice President Kamala Harris' election defeat last November to Trump regarding her next political move, with the two potential options likely being launching a 2026 gubernatorial run in her home state of California or seeking the presidency again in 2028. Harris served as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general and U.S. senator before becoming vice president. Sources in the former vice president's political orbit say no decisions have been made about any next steps. The Democrats' field for governor in the heavily blue-leaning state is already crowded. Among the more than half-dozen candidates already running for governor are Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a Harris ally, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

She was tapping into a belief, widely shared among liberals and Democrats, that progress can’t be stopped. \n\nThis was a powerful and persuasive statement at the time. After the US Supreme Court struck down Roe, there seemed to be a righteous backlash against not only the court but against the former president who had stacked it enough to void the national right to an abortion. \n\nBut progress can be stopped, indeed, it can be reversed, and the process of reversal can lay waste to vulnerable and marginalized people. Liberals and Democrats should not pretend otherwise, not when the greatest mechanism for progress – the federal government – is now being used to claw back advancements made since the 1960s.\n\nI was thinking of this while watching a Tik Tok video that claims to explain why Trump supporters are still angry despite winning everything. Made by a former TV journalist, and viewed nearly 9 million times, it borrows a term from psychology: “extinction burst.”\n\nAccording to the unidentified creator of the video, “extinction burst” is “when you have a behavior and a reward, and you withdraw the reward in order to change the behavior. When you do that, usually to change the undesirable behavior, the behavior itself increases in frequency and intensity for a short period of time till ultimately the subject changes that behavior and that behavior goes extinct.”\n\nHe went on: \n\n“Extinction burst at the national level is much slower, but in this case we actually know what triggered it. It was Obama’s election in 2008. Sarah Palin, the tea party movement, the birther movement, and ultimately maga – it is a 10-year tsunami of rage in the face of inevitable extinction. This is why Republicans are angry. They know Trump winning can’t stop it and they know Trump in office can’t stop it. They can feel the inevitable extinction of their own terrible beliefs.”\n\nHe says that “extinction burst” explains why victory in November did not calm Trump’s supporters. The implication is that they continue to rage against the libs, because they know that even with control of all the levers of power, they can’t stop a greater power, which is the slow but inescapable flattening of America’s social hierarchies, which will result in “the inevitable extinction of their own terrible beliefs.”\n\nThe creator of the video, who goes by the handle “ohhthatsrich,” says the key to this is democratic politics. “The only thing that will stop it is if we let up. If you stop interfering with that undesirable behavior, it will go back to normal. So no you’re not crazy. Yes, you are doing the right thing. And yes, if you persevere, the extinction burst will end.”\n\nThis part, however, feels like an afterthought, as if it were something you think should be said but don’t feel it needs to be said, because, after all, maga people know the end is coming. That’s why they’re still mad. Looming over the entire argument is magical thinking about the nature of progress, as if it were an act of God, rather than what it really is: a product of blood, sweat, tears and, sometimes, death. \n\nDemographics is not destiny, but that way of thinking, permanently emblazoned on the minds of liberals and Democrats in the aftermath of Barack Obama’s historic election, still commands their imaginations, such that they can watch Donald Trump break the law and violate the Constitution – criminal conduct that has already led to individual ruin and death – and still believe that he’ll self-destruct any minute now. \n\nI think there are two kinds of magical thinking – that which comes from people who suffer trauma, some sort of “socially accepted sadism,” as Richard Rorty once put it, and that which comes from people who have never experienced anything comparable to that.\n\nThe first kind is understandable. These folks must hold tightly to that magical thinking as a matter of survival, to defend themselves against psychic death. The second kind, however, is not nearly so noble. \n\nIt is a means of avoidance, an escape, an expression of privilege. It’s when tyranny is so abstract, you can afford to talk about it as if it were a fever, a brief malady, a phenomenon that will burst any minute now. You don’t really need to act. It will go away soon. After all, the terrible beliefs of the Trump horde are heading for extinction. It’s inevitable.\n\nThis magical thinking will persist, no doubt, but perhaps it will weaken in useful ways as the fact of Trump’s tyranny sinks in – to the point where even the most privileged liberal understands that he’s no lame duck. Unless he dies in office, of disease or old age, he’s not leaving. \n\nTo be sure, the prevailing wisdom is that can’t possibly happen. The 22nd Amendment says no one can be elected more than twice. But such belief overlooks reality. Not only is Trump undoing progress – in terms of equity and justice, abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, climate change, the economy, everything – he’s undoing democracy, too. \n\nThe White House said today that the court orders that are blocking his illegal federal funding freeze are a “weaponization” of the justice system that’s provoking a “constitutional crisis.” That's the pretext for saying later that the only way to right such a wrong and resolve such a crisis is to ignore the courts altogether. No law will constrain him. No Congress will remove him. If he does not die in office, he will not leave.\n\nI don’t know any more than you do about what to do about a demented criminal president. What I do know, however, is that no one can afford to believe evil has an expiration date. It is evil, because it’s evil, and all we can do with it is fight it knowing the cost will be great and dear.\n\nNOW READ: Trump supporters are getting played — but for how long?","summary":"When Kamala Harris said “we’re not going back,” she was doing more than repeating a campaign slogan.

The Minnesota State High School League announced Thursday it will continue to allow transgender athletes to compete against girls despite Trump's executive order to probibit them from doing so. That came just days after the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) said it will continue to follow the state's law that allows athletes to participate as whichever gender they identify as.

I would remind these organizations that history does not look kindly on entities and states that actively opposed the enforcement of federal civil rights laws that protect women and girls from discrimination and harassment.\" The Department of Education added that state laws do not override federal anti-discrimination laws, so the associations are subject to investigations. Trump signed the executive order on National Girls and Women in Sports Day, which celebrates female athletes in women’s sports and those committed to providing equal access to sports for all females. The order states that \"it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities\" and to take \"all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms and thereby provide the equal opportunity guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.\" Prior to Trump signing the order Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said part of the motivation behind Trump's executive order would be to create a \"pressure campaign\" for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and NCAA to follow and prevent transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. In response to Trump's order, the NCAA changed its policy, in place since 2010, to disallow transgender athletes from competing against women, requiring them to compete based on their birth gender. During Trump's ceremony at the White House to sign the executive order, he announced that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will prohibit any transgender athletes attempting to compete as women from entering the country for the Olympics in 2028.

Many bureaucrats think of themselves as smarter than or superior to the American people and their elected representatives, a mentality that helps explain the “deep state” efforts against Donald Trump in his first administration.\n\nIn fact, a recent poll found that 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal bureaucrats who voted for Kamala Harris say they will not follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.\n\nThis bureaucracy often aligns with the woke priorities of activist donors like George Soros and his son, Alex. The Department of Government Efficiency under Trump has highlighted how one agency, in particular, the U.S. Agency for International Development, has directed Americans’ tax dollars to promote “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and transgender orthodoxy internationally.\n\nMy book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” exposes the woke activist groups that staffed the federal bureaucracy under former President Joe Biden—groups that are now gearing up to oppose Trump’s administration.\n\nCongress created many of these agencies by statute, but the agencies are supposed to answer to the president, and if the executive power means anything, it means the president should have wide latitude to downsize, restructure, and combine the agencies to make them more effective and efficient for the American people.\n\nIn this context, Trump’s executive order Tuesday directing a massive downsizing of the federal workforce comes as very good news. The order will help bring the bureaucracy to heel, making it more accountable to the people’s elected president.\n\nTrump signed the order in the Oval Office and held a news conference with the head of DOGE, Elon Musk, afterward.\n\nTrump’s DOGE Downsizing\n\nThe order aims to carry out a “critical transformation of the federal bureaucracy” to “restore accountability to the American public.”\n\n“By eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity, my administration will empower American families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of government itself,” the order states. The order fleshes out how DOGE—a temporary federal initiative to root out waste, fraud, and abuse that will wrap up its activity by July 4, 2026—will help streamline the government.\n\nThe order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit a plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce, requiring that each agency “hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart.” The order will not block the hiring freeze at the Internal Revenue Service and it will not apply to the military, to law enforcement, and to border enforcement agencies.\n\nAccording to the order, each federal agency will receive a DOGE team lead, who will help each agency draft a “data-driven plan” to ensure that new career hires “are in highest-need areas.” The DOGE team lead will have the authority to block agencies from filling any vacancies, unless the agency head disagrees.\n\nAlso, according to the order: “All offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law shall be prioritized” for reductions in force, “including all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives,” among others. Trump has rightly directed the federal government to minimize DEI efforts, as they encourage discrimination on the basis of skin color, urging people to judge others based on appearance rather than merit. \n\nThe order also instructs the director of the Office of Personnel Management to tighten the requirements for federal employees, barring applicants who failed to comply with generally applicable legal obligations; those who lack appropriate citizenship status; those who refuse to follow nondisclosure agreements; and those involved in the theft or misuse of government resources or equipment.\n\nThese requirements back up Trump’s previous claims that he aims to instill a performance culture focused on “excellence at every level” and a “more streamlined and flexible workforce.”\n\nThe order also requires agency heads to submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report that identifies the laws that establish the agency or subcomponents of the agency. This is likely a tool to help the administration determine which agencies can be eliminated or consolidated without any act of Congress.The order does not apply to the military, law enforcement, or border enforcement.\n\nThe Ongoing Battle\n\nTrump has aggressively sought to restrain the bureaucracy and oppose leftist ideology during his first month in office. He signed executive orders pausing foreign aid and government grants; reinstating the Schedule F policy that would enable the executive branch to more easily fire bureaucrats; declaring that there are two genders for purposes of U.S. law; and removing DEI from the federal government.\n\nUnder Trump’s direction, DOGE has closed and audited a few agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMany of the same Woketopus leftist groups that infiltrated and advised the federal government under Biden are now filing lawsuits to block Trump’s policies, and judges have issued injunctions ordering the administration to cease its sweeping changes, even though Trump’s funding pauses and DOGE are both temporary.\n\nTrump rightly condemned this trend in the news conference. \n\n“I can’t imagine a judge saying, ‘Well, it may be corrupt, but you don’t have the right. You got elected to look over the country, and to—as we say, Make America Great Again—but you don’t have the right to look and see whether or not things are right that they’re paying or that things are honest that they’re paying,’” Trump said.\n\nHe added that law professors dispute the idea of judges taking his right to lead the country away from him.\n\n“If a judge is going to say, ‘You’re not allowed to look for [fraud, waste, and abuse],’ that’s pretty sad for our country,” Trump added.\n\nTrump is right—the American people elected him to root fraud, waste, and abuse out of the federal government. They voted for change after four years of woke elites calling the shots in Washington. This battle represents the bureaucracy fighting back against democracy.\n\nHow perverse that judges would favor unelected bureaucrats over the people’s will.","summary":"While many Americans may be familiar with the three branches of government in the Constitution, fewer are aware of the fourth branch of government—a vast...

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee set the stage for workforce reforms under the Trump administration. In a speech to members of his committee, Cassidy laid out his priorities for the new Congress, noting that \u001cthe Biden-Harris anti-worker agenda is over.\u001d\n\nWhether or not independent workers will be a priority for the Trump administration is still up in the air, as labor union members were a significant part of his winning electoral coalition last November. Teamsters President Sean O\u0019Brien is one union leader who is already flexing his power in Trump\u0019s Washington, pushing his pick for labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer. \n\nMeanwhile, Cassidy also noted that the independent workforce can finally expect not to be seen as lesser than those who participate in traditional employment. \u001cWe must also empower and protect the rights of more than 27 million gig workers nationwide,\u001d he said. \u001cThe Biden-Harris administration attempted to erode the flexibility of independent workers, threatening their ability to provide for their families.\u001d\n\nThis is great news \u0013 and not just for gig workers, but for all independent contractors in the United States, which experts have cited as closer to 60 million, or approximately a third of the U.S. workforce.\n\nYes, Lyft and Uber drivers, and people who sell their skills on sites like Upwork are independent contractors, but the larger part of those 60 million contractors are those who work independently both full time and part time, sometimes in highly specialized fields that are seldom considered by policymakers and the general public in conversation about non-traditional work arrangements.\n\nFor example, think about truckers. IW Features, the media arm of the nonprofit Independent Women\u0019s Forum, recently released a series of interviews about female truckers, entitled \u001cBehind the Wheel: Women Truckers Fight for Their Independence.\u001d The series profiles truckers Sheryl Myers, Jeanette Lonergan, and Angela Masterson, who all urge the new Trump administration to repeal a Biden-era DOL independent contractor rule within his first 100 days in office.\n\nDespite their independent contractor status, Masterson and her husband are highly qualified for their roles \u0013 as specialized AA&E (Arms, Ammunition & Explosives) drivers, both had to undergo extensive background checks and receive detailed training. They regularly deal with materials critical to America\u0019s national security, to the extent that they do not publicize their travel plans.\n\nIf this rule is not repealed by the Trump administration, Masterson notes that \u001cit would steal our business that we\u0019ve invested our lives in. It would strip us of our ability to choose when we work and when we need to be home. It would send many of us into tailspin.\u001d\n\nMasterson\u0019s livelihood and that of thousands like her could be at stake if the Biden-era Department of Labor rule dealing with so-called \u001cmisclassification\u001d of independent workers implemented in March of 2024 is allowed to remain by the Trump administration.\n\n\u001cWe want the freedom of choice as an American citizen to pursue the American dream,\u001d says Masterson.\n\nThe aforementioned Biden-era Department of Labor rule invokes a very narrow definition of freelance work \u0013 so narrow that many roles which are currently filled by independent contractors would have to be filled by traditional employees.\n\nCalifornia already has a state-level version of this federal Biden-era rule, known as AB5. In the Golden State, companies have often ceased using independent contractors to perform work, affecting the business of tens of thousands of freelancers.\n\nSheryl Myers is one of 70,000 trucking industry owner-operators impacted by AB5 in California alone. The implementation and enforcement of such a labor rule nationally would be nearly impossible to escape for Myers and other independent contractors like her, who make up 11% of America\u0019s trucking industry.\n\nIf this AB5-style Biden-era Labor Department rule is kept in place by the Trump team, it threatens the livelihoods not only of these women and their industry, but of millions of Americans who engage in independent contracting.\n\nThe question of whether or not the Trump administration will do away with the Biden-era labor policy still remains, as labor was a big part of Trump\u0019s winning electoral coalition in November 2024.\n\nTrump seems intent on keeping labor leaders in the room as he sets up his second administration, having nominated former Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer for the post of labor secretary. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the PRO Act in the 118th Congress, which was a part of Kamala Harris\u0019 campaign platform.\n\nThe PRO Act was billed as a pro-union piece of legislation, but masked within the labor union propaganda that pushed the bill forward in the last session of Congress was also the creation of an \u001cABC Test\u001d for freelancers intended to fix the \u001cmisclassification\u001d of freelance workers who were doing the work of employees.\n\nUnder the ABC Test, work is considered to be appropriately classified as freelance if it meets three requirements: that the work is \u001cdone without the direction and control of the employer\u001d; that it is \u001cperformed outside the usual course of the employer\u0019s business\u001d; and that it is \u001cdone by someone who has their own, independent business or trade doing that kind of work.\u001d\n\nThat may seem like a reasonable test \u0013 one that a determined contractor should be able to pass without too much trouble. But the results show otherwise. The test originated in California with the passage of AB5, which decimated contract work in the state.\n\n\u001cSelf-employment decreased post-AB5 by 10.5 percent on average for affected occupations,\u001d notes Liya Palagashvili, senior research fellow and director of the Labor Policy Project at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. She also notes that \u001coverall employment decreased post-AB5 by 4.4 percent on average for affected occupations.\u001d\n\nPatrice Onwuka, Director of the Center for Economic Opportunity at the Independent Women\u0019s Forum, disclosed in a recent interview that despite Chavez-DeRemer\u0019s record, President-elect Donald Trump has shown that he is not only an ally of big business but also of small businesses.\n\nYet, other conservative leaders believe that appointing a congresswoman who supported a law that has been so damaging to entrepreneurs and small businesses would be a mistake.\n\n\u001cMost freelancers want to keep their independence,\u001d National Right to Work Committee\u0019s president, Mark Mix, told me. \u001cBut union bosses can only collect compulsory dues money from those classified as traditional employees, so the union-boss-backed \u0018PRO Act\u0019 clamps down on freelancing.\u001d\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer has tried to distance herself from her support of the PRO Act, but Mix isn\u0019t buying it. \u001cSenators shouldn\u0019t confirm her unless she specifically denounces the anti-worker, pro-union boss provisions in that bill, including its ban on Right to Work laws and its shameless targeting of independent contractors so that union officials can shake them down for dues money.\u001d\n\nThe first Trump administration\u0019s much less stringent independent contractor classification rule was rescinded in May of 2021 by the Biden administration. Now Senate Republicans have a chance to bring up the change at DOL during Chavez-DeRemer\u0019s confirmation hearings, which will take place beginning next week.\n\nIndependent contracting advocates seem to have the ear of Bill Cassidy, and his committee will be the first stop for Chavez-DeRemer\u0019s confirmation. He can make sure that independent workers and small business owners are heard as loudly as big business titans in what is expected to be a new era of labor policymaking.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/02/12/senate_republicans_should_help_trump_help_independent_contractors_152344.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 20:17:47","author":"RCP,Victoria Churchill","authors":["RCP","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.172},{"id":289846526,"title":"'Ridiculous': Bondi personally strips DOJ walls of Biden, Harris, Garland portraits","text":"Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday personally stripped the Justice Department's walls of portraits of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and her own predecessor, former Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying it was \"ridiculous\" for the portraits to hang nearly three weeks into President Donald Trump's tenure Bondi's role in personally removing the portraits, first shared on X by the New York Post's Miranda Devine, was confirmed to Fox News Digital by a Justice Department official.

Grocers including Walmart and Kroger have begun to ration purchases in certain cases. The Waffle House chain — a staple in the US south and Midwest — has tacked a surcharge of 50 cents an egg on to its dishes.\n\nSupplies of fresh eggs are falling short as farmers cull millions of hens to control a variant of avian influenza that first emerged in a US commercial flock three years ago.\n\nLike petrol prices, eggs are a visible, if volatile, signpost of inflation to consumers. The consumer price index increased by 3 per cent year on year in January, with an index for eggs climbing more than 50 per cent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday. The average US resident will eat about 270 eggs this year, the US Department of Agriculture forecasts.\n\nEgg prices also have political resonance and were an attack line in last year’s campaign for the White House. Then US vice-presidential candidate JD Vance in September stood before a supermarket egg case to criticise the economic policies of his predecessor Kamala Harris, when the US city average price of large Grade A eggs was $3.82 a dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price was $4.95 in January.\n\nDemocrats have now seized on the issue. “We went to get some eggs, and we can see the prices of these eggs had now jumped to about $8. But there were no eggs,” Ted Lieu, a Democratic representative from California, said this week of a recent trip to the grocery store.\n\nThe top egg retailers are Walmart, Costco, Kroger, Albertsons and Aldi, according to Numerator. A majority — 55 per cent — of consumers have noticed shortages or out-of-stock eggs local retailers, the market research firm said.\n\nChains including Kroger, Aldi and Walmart have imposed restrictions on purchases, at certain locations or in certain package sizes.\n\n“Although supply is very tight, we’re working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,” said Walmart, which is limiting purchases of 60-count cartons to two per visit.\n\nCal-Maine Foods, the largest US producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs, said demand was outpacing supply as it reported quarterly gross profit of $356mn, a fourfold increase from a year before.\n\n“Without question, we have recently faced significant challenges within our company and the entire egg industry due to the ongoing outbreaks” of avian influenza, Sherman Miller, chief executive, said last month.\n\nFarmers have lost about 46mn laying hens in the past four months, or 15 per cent of a national flock of 304mn, said Karyn Rispoli, managing editor at Expana. “While bird flu has come and gone in waves over the past few years, this current outbreak is the most severe yet, with no signs of slowing,” she said.\n\nGino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry sciences and avian health at Penn State University, said the virus is typically spread from farm to farm by wild birds. Workers coming into contact with their droppings can carry it into a chicken barn on their boots.\n\nOnce a single case is detected, an entire flock must be culled.\n\n“The virus is very deadly,” Lorenzoni said, but the industry tries “to get there very fast and kill the animals before the virus has a chance to spread to other facilities”.\n\nEgg prices have risen not only because the flock of laying hens had declined, but because enhanced biosecurity measures such as disposable coveralls, booties and hairnets and enhanced disinfection protocols were driving up operating costs on farms, he said.\n\nAs well, market demand for cage-free eggs had been increasing costs, as each barn contains fewer animals, Lorenzoni said.\n\nThe USDA this week raised its forecast for the average wholesale price of Grade A eggs to $4.44 a dozen for 2025, up by more than half from its projection in January. The department projected US hens will lay 8.96bn dozen eggs this year, cutting its outlook from last month.\n\nPrices have remained robust in part because of solid demand over the winter holidays, said Amy Smith, vice-president at Advanced Economic Solutions, a food and agriculture consultancy. Severe winter storms in the south-east last month led households to stock up, while consumers who are taking popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have been shifting their diets towards proteins.\n\nSupermarkets have in some cases kept their retail egg price below the wholesale price as a loss leader, to attract customers to stores, said Smith and at Expana’s Rispoli.\n\n“While some price increases have been passed through, they haven’t been significant enough to curb consumer interest,” Rispoli said.","summary":"Wholesale prices have doubled over the past year as culls to stop spread of virus prompt shortages and rationing","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/6badcd10-c9b6-4067-8943-7199ad332cbb","image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1933f5a5-0ed3-4168-a228-9ba06d7f90c9.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 20:07:33","author":"Gregory Meyer","authors":["Gregory Meyer"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":289846326,"title":"What is DOGE? Here's everything you need to know about the Elon Musk-led effort to cut government spending.","text":"The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by an executive order by President Donald Trump and is one of the most ambitious efforts to slash spending at the federal level in decades.Headed by Elon Musk, the world's richest man, DOGE's mission is to make government leaner and more effective. As a temporary organization, DOGE is set to complete its work on July 4, 2026.Musk in January told the political strategist Mark Penn that he'd like to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal budget and said $2 trillion in spending cuts was the \"best-case outcome\" for DOGE.Almost immediately, DOGE attracted lawsuits from an array of Democrats and union groups concerned over Musk's team gaining access to sensitive information within several federal agencies.Here's a look at how DOGE is aiming to upend US government in Washington.For decades, Republicans have railed against what they've decried as excessive government spending that they feel has only been encouraged by layers of bureaucracy in the nation's capital.In his three presidential runs, Trump made tackling the federal deficit and cutting the size of government important themes of his campaign. However, the issue took on added resonance in 2024 as many Americans remained weary of inflation and federal spending.Last July, Musk during a conversation on X floated that Trump could establish a presidential commission on \"government efficiency\" and select him to lead it. Trump liked the idea and confirmed in August that he was considering Musk for an advisory role.Musk then took to X, where he said \"I am willing to serve,\" with an image of him standing in front of a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" lectern.In the final weeks of the campaign, Musk was a fixture on the trail, particularly in swing-state Pennsylvania, where he stumped hard for Trump.After Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris last November, he announced that DOGE would be co-led by Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk later that month said on X that DOGE jobs would have \"zero\" compensation. However, in January it was announced that DOGE would be hiring some salaried employees.The Department of Government Efficiency has the acronym of one of Musk's favorite memes, which features the image of a Shiba Inu dog and also inspired the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.As Trump was enjoying his inaugural festivities, reports emerged that Ramaswamy would be leaving DOGE to launch a gubernatorial bid in Ohio, making Musk the face of the conservative president's task force.From the start, DOGE has sought to analyze federal contracts and spending at agencies across the government, and Musk has called out expenditures on issues like foreign aid and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.However, the quick pace of DOGE's work to remold government in the vision of Trump and Musk has left many in Washington — and across the country and world — stunned.During a joint appearance in the Oval Office on Feb. 11, Trump announced that DOGE in its first few weeks had uncovered \"billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.\" Trump said a final number could potentially reach \"close to a trillion dollars,\" but neither he nor Musk gave many specifics regarding the figures. That same day, Trump signed an executive order that directs agency heads to work with DOGE to identify \"large-scale reductions in force.\"DOGE is looking to prune the federal workforce, and offered buyouts to employees, who were given a deadline to accept an offer to be paid through Sept. 30. Trump administration officials announced that more than 65,000 federal workers had opted to take the buyout. (As of Feb. 11, the buyouts remained on hold, pending further review by a federal judge.)One of the biggest targets for both Trump and Musk so far has been the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, which distributes foreign aid. Trump wants to shut down the independent government agency, which provides funding on everything from HIV/AIDS treatment to investments in water and sanitation access.The push is part of Musk's desire to \"delete\" agencies that he feels are wasteful or have outlived their usefulness.Another target is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Republicans have criticized since its creation under President Barack Obama in 2011. And DOGE has already cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education's research office, with the task force announcing that they'd \"terminated\" contracts.Republicans, who retained control of the House and retook the Senate in the 2024 elections, are overwhelmingly supportive of both Trump and DOGE.The GOP-led House Oversight Committee last November announced the formation of the Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee, which is chaired by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, with Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico serving as the ranking member.Both parties have expressed a desire to eliminate wasteful spending and boost transparency. However, Stansbury said Democrats would seek accountability for DOGE.\"We will not sit silently by and watch the Administration recklessly and lawlessly dismantle our federal agencies, fire and harass federal employees, withhold federal funds, and hack our private and sensitive data,\" she said in a statement.Then there's the GOP-led House DOGE caucus, which is co-chaired by Reps. Aaron Bean of Florida, Blake Moore of Utah, and Pete Sessions of Texas. There are some Democrats who are currently a part of the caucus, namely Reps. Jared Moskowitz of Florida and Steven Horsford of Nevada. Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle of Oregon left the caucus in February after accusing Musk of trying to \"line his own pockets and rip off Americans.\"The Senate DOGE caucus is led by Republican Joni Ernst of Iowa.Republicans are overwhelmingly in alignment with Trump's agenda, and with the threat of potential Musk-funded primary challengers in 2026, GOP lawmakers will likely be eager to support the DOGE task force's work.Still, Congress controls federal spending. And DOGE's efforts to dramatically reshape additional agencies may potentially encounter bipartisan resistance.Even when it was still being conceived, questions arose regarding whether DOGE could truly make a dent in federal spending.With a bulk of federal spending going toward Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the defense budget, it is unclear how deeply DOGE will be able to make its desired cuts. (Trump has repeatedly pledged not to touch Medicare and Social Security.)DOGE was also granted access to a Treasury Department payment system that contains sensitive information about millions of Americans, ramping up concerns about privacy.There has also been some scrutiny regarding DOGE staffing hires.Marko Elez — a 25-year-old who previously worked at SpaceX and X and was a member of Musk's team — in February resigned from the Treasury Department after The Wall Street Journal brought to light racist social media posts. (Vice President JD Vance called for Elez to be rehired.)Business Insider obtained the records of roughly 30 individuals who are now employed by the White House's DOGE office, with backgrounds ranging from software engineer to former law clark for Associate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.An array of lawsuits have been filed by critics challenging DOGE's actions.In February, 19 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against Trump and the Treasury Department alleging that there was a violation of federal law in granting DOGE staffers access to the personal financial data of Americans.White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said in a statement that the lawsuits were \"akin to children throwing pasta at the wall to see if it will stick.\"\"Grandstanding government efficiency speaks volumes about those who'd rather delay much-needed change with legal shenanigans than work with the Trump Administration of ridding the government of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" he added.Another lawsuit was filed against the Trump administration by several nongovernmental organizations that obtain US foreign aid over DOGE's attempts to shutter USAID. The plaintiffs argue that the administration \"violated the separation of powers.\"And the National Treasury Employees Union in February filed two lawsuits over the stoppage of the CFPB's work and the ability of Musk and DOGE aides to see the personal information of the agency's staffers.Business Insider has reached out to a DOGE spokesperson for comment.","summary":"The Department of Government Efficiency is one of the most ambitious efforts to reform US government.

The term is often applied to dying franchises, which turn to sensational language or scenes to try to revive the fading interest of the public. More often, you jump the shark and land in utter obscurity.\n\nThis week, the Democratic Party jumped the shark.\n\nFor years, Dems and their allies pushed that absurd claim that democracy was about to die if Joe Biden or Kamala Harris were not elected president. The public wasn’t buying it. In 2024, Donald Trump won a majority of the voters as well as control of both houses of Congress.\n\nRather than examine its messaging, Democrats decided to double down. After the election, politicians and pundits announced a new “constitutional crisis” surrounding the effort to downsize the federal government led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nKris Mayes, the attorney general of Arizona, declared this week that “We are on the brink of a dictatorship, and America has never been in a more dangerous position than she is today.” \n\nThe same media that carried the breathless accounts of the imminent death of democracy with the last election are now running “constitutional crisis” articles with many of the same “experts.”\n\nDespite Trump repeating that he “will abide by the courts” while appealing opposing decisions, NPR insisted that Trump’s circle has indicated that it is “willing to ignore court orders and defy judicial authority.” \n\nDuring his first term, Trump repeatedly lost cases — as did his predecessor, Barack Obama, and successor, Joe Biden — but he continued to comply with those rulings.\n\nThe fact is that we have the oldest and most stable constitutional system in history. It has repeatedly survived challenges from political to economic meltdowns that would have destroyed other systems. That Madisonian system relies on an independent judiciary, including Trump appointees who regularly ruled against the Trump administration, including on the Supreme Court.\n\nFor many citizens, what is most striking is not Trump’s actions, but how Democrats are seeking to prevent the very reforms that a majority of voters supported.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) warned that this “is a really, really sad day in America. We are witnessing a constitutional crisis. We talked about Trump wanting to be a dictator on day one. And here we are. This is what the beginning of dictatorship looks like when you gut the Constitution, and you install yourself as the sole power. That is how dictators are made.”\n\nActually, that is not how dictators are made but how democracies work. Trump ran on reducing the deficit and size of the government. The public is worried about a crisis — but it is not one of democracy but debt.\n\nIn 2024, the $6.75 trillion budget exceeded our tax receipts of $4.9 trillion. The rest, $1.8 trillion, had to be borrowed. As a result, the national debt has ballooned and, if left on its current trajectory, would amount to 250% of gross domestic product (GDP) within three decades. \n\nWe are becoming a debtor nation where every citizen now shoulders a $106,000 per capita burden to pay for our out-of-control spending.\n\nNevertheless, in the first DOGE subcommittee hearing in the House, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) insisted that he would “defend democracy” which is “under attack” by DOGE and the effort to carry out of Trump’s campaign pledges.\n\nWhat is truly in danger is the status quo. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) may have ironically had the most honest moment when he joined one of the daily protests and yelled how Musk’s government efficiency efforts are “taking away everything we have.”\n\nBy declaring a constitutional crisis, these figures are using “rage rhetoric” that gives a license for extreme conduct and messaging. \n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has declared a “coup” is being carried out.\n\nRep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) insisted “God d—-it shut down the Senate! . . . WE ARE AT WAR!”\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) called on citizens “to fight back” as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) called for a fight in the streets and for citizens “to rise up.”\n\nNot to be outdone in the rage fest, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) yelled, “We are gonna be in your face, we are gonna be on your a–es, and we are going to make sure you understand what democracy looks like, and this ain’t it.”\n\nBiden was repeatedly found to have violated the Constitution, including with unilateral actions through executive orders. Courts called him out for it. None of these Democratic members declared a coup or collapse of democracy. Such court challenges are common and often these early initiatives shake out with new guarantees and judicial guidelines.\n\nThe courts may oppose certain moves by Trump and DOGE, but these are decisions of process, not policy. Eventually the president will be able to pare back government spending, which is what the Democrats are really upset about — not the invented “Constitutional crisis.”\n\nJudging from the polls, the public sees that. Even the Fonz saw it, even if he still does not get it. Just before the election, Henry Winkler mocked Trump’s huge Madison Square Garden rally and told NBC “That his life’s bread; his life’s blood is the sound of appreciation or adulation or whatever.” That “whatever” is called public support. It is a lesson that the Democrats may want to learn if they ever want to see happier days.\n\nJudging from the polls, the public sees that. They didn’t believe Democrats before, and they don’t believe the Democrats now. Will they ever believe them again?\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.”","summary":"This week, the Democratic Party jumped the shark.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/12/opinion/dems-exhaust-last-of-credibility-with-false-trump-constitutional-crisis/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/u-s-president-donald-trump-98360767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 19:35:30","author":"Jonathan Turley","authors":["Jonathan Turley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":289846532,"title":"Taylor Swift being booed at Super Bowl means ‘toxic masculinity’ has returned, liberal writer claims","text":"A left-leaning writer says that Taylor Swift getting booed at the Super Bowl means that toxic masculinity is back. \"Since Donald Trump took office, there have been several times I felt chilled by the rapid increase in misogyny seeping in our culture,\" Stephanie McNeal, a senior editor for Glamour wrote in a Monday article entitled, \"Why Taylor Swift Getting Booed at the Super Bowl was Even More Chilling Than You Think.\" \"But watching Taylor Swift at Super Bowl LIX booed by a crowd of thousands on Sunday night was a new low,\" McNeal wrote.

She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\" In October 2018, Swift said she voted for Democratic Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, and endorsed him in an Instagram post with a photo of her and her mother. \"These two Tennessee women voted for the candidate who has proven himself to be reasonable and trustworthy. We want leadership, not fear-based extremism,\" Swift said in the post. \"Early voting goes till Thursday and Election Day is November 6. Please don’t sit this one out.\" Bredesen lost to Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., at the time and Blackburn was re-elected to a second term in the Senate on Nov. 5, 2024. Swift also took to Instagram to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris for president in a Sept. 10, 2024 post. \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift said. \"I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.

Comcast is the first media company to face such an inquiry. The Philadelphia cable and television giant said in a statement that it would be \"cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.\" The move comes less than a month after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr took the helm of the agency that oversees communications policy and broadcast licenses. Carr, who was elevated to the top role by President Trump, immediately dismantled the agency's DEI programs, pulling the plug on budget expenditures and staff members dedicated to promoting inclusion. In a letter to Comcast Chairman Brian Roberts on Tuesday, Carr wrote that his goal was to \"ensure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\" The landmark Communications Act and FCC rules forbid companies from \"discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or gender,\" Carr reminded Roberts in the letter. The FCC chief acknowledged the probe was part of a broader effort to scrutinize workplace incentives within the companies he regulates to end \"the scourge of DEI.\" Eliminating DEI efforts has been a top priority of the Trump administration. Trump has signed an executive order to demand merit-based opportunity across the private sector. This week, Walt Disney Co. acknowledged softening some of its DEI policies, including retiring a “diversity and inclusion” performance factor in its executive compensation calculations. The FCC review is starting at Comcast. The FCC has tremendous sway over Comcast's businesses, including the company's core cable and high-speed internet service, its wireless phone offerings and NBC-owned television stations, which require FCC licenses to operate. Carr said that was part of his motivation to start with Comcast and NBCUniversal. \"I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the commission's broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates,\" Carr wrote. Carr took aim at Comcast's statements about its embrace of diversity programs. \"For instance, Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is 'a core value of our business' and public reports state that Comcast has an entire 'DEI infrastructure' that includes annual 'DEI day[s],' 'DEI training for company leaders,' and similar initiatives,\" Carr wrote. \"NBCUniversal has similar DEI initiatives, including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.\" Comcast has a page on its website that outlines its philosophy on inclusion: \"We believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company is a more innovative and successful one,\" the company said. \"Across our workforce, products, and content, we embrace diversity of background, perspective, culture, and experience, and together with our partners, we are working to fight injustice against any race, ethnicity, gender or sexual identity, disability, or veteran status.\" Following the Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd in 2020, senior NBCUniversal executive Cesar Conde set a goal of having a 50% nonwhite workforce within NBC News. “We want to increase diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the camera, and earn the trust of every community in America that relies on us for exceptional journalism,” Conde said at the time. Last month, Carr revived complaints that alleged liberal media bias at CBS, NBC and ABC. Throughout the campaign, Trump railed against certain broadcasters, saying the FCC should yank their broadcast licenses. One of the complaints targeted NBC for featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris in a “Saturday Night Live” skit four days before the November election, saying the network wasn’t providing equal access to Trump. A second complaint took issue with ABC News’ handling of the September Trump-Harris debate. Trump complained that ABC anchors were unfair to him. The FCC inquiry has raised the stakes in a separate dispute between Trump and CBS. Trump and his supporters cried foul over the Harris \"60 Minutes\" interview in October, pointing to discrepancies between Harris’ answers in the two interview segments. CBS has defended its edits, saying they routinely condense quotes. Trump has sued CBS for $20 billion. Paramount Global Chairwoman Shari Redstone has advocated settling the Trump lawsuit. The issue has clouded Paramount's proposed $8-billion sale to David Ellison's Skydance Media firm, a deal that hinges on the approval of the FCC's Carr.","summary":"FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is concerned that diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Comcast and NBCUniversal fostered discrimination, which is forbidden under FCC rules and federal laws.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-02-12/fcc-launches-effort-to-root-out-dei-programs-beginning-with-comcast","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9adf510/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2048+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2F92%2Ff4613ef4440189aaf62ad2b50e65%2Fla-photos-1staff-776","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 18:38:21","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":289820144,"title":"DOGE sets sights on Social Security target Trump promised to ‘fight for’","text":"The Department of Government Efficiency has already taken steps to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Democrats introduced legislation seeking to block Musk and DOGE from continued access to the systems and “shield the American people from this out-of-control power grab permanently.”\n\nThe president told reporters last Friday that DOGE “doesn’t” necessarily need access to personal taxpayer information or Social Security numbers but suggested that DOGE’s ability to gain access shows the need to beef up the security of those systems.\n\n“They get it very easily,” the president said. “We don’t have very good security in our country, and they get it very easily.”\n\nFast forward to Tuesday, when Trump signed a new executive order granting Musk and DOGE expanded authority to cut costs inside of federal agencies.\n\nMusk, who was present for the Oval Office signing ceremony, told reporters that an initial audit showed individuals beyond the age of any living American and individuals with no personal identifying information present on the beneficiary list.\n\n“We’ve got people in there that are 150 years old. Now, do you know anyone 150? I don’t, OK,” he said. “They’re probably dead, is my guess, or they should be very famous, one of the two. And then there are a whole bunch of Social Security payments where there’s no identifying information.”\n\n“Obviously, we want to make sure that people who deserve to receive Social Security do receive it and that they receive it quickly and accurately,” Musk continued.\n\nThe tech billionaire’s comments added new fuel to the legal and political firestorm of Musk’s influence over the federal government, which began protests throughout Washington, D.C.\n\nThe White House and DOGE did not respond to questions about the breadth of alleged benefits fraud uncovered by the administration’s audits.\n\nSocial Security paid out benefits to nearly 72 million people in 2023, including 5.8 million new beneficiaries. The administration’s inspector general published a report in 2024 outlining $71.8 billion in improper payments made between 2015-2022, which accounts for less than 1% of payments made across that time frame.\n\nStill, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump’s economic platform could significantly move up the program’s insolvency date.\n\nCRFB said Trump’s tax and tariff proposals and deportation agenda, as illegal immigrants are still subject to employer Social Security taxes, will “increase Social Security’s ten-year cash shortfall by $2.3 trillion” and “advance insolvency by three years.”\n\nDemocrats have sounded the alarm on possible cuts to the program amid DOGE’s quest to root out and eliminate government waste.\n\n“Keep your hands off our Social Security because this has nothing — nothing — to do with government efficiency,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said at a rally outside of the SSA headquarters in Maryland on Monday.\n\n“It is America’s promise to us when we paid into Social Security,” Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) added. “And yet this is under attack even today.”\n\nThe White House has maintained that Trump has no plans to make overriding cuts to Social Security.\n\n“The president remains committed to his promise not to touch [Social Security],” White House aides said in a statement responding to Monday’s rally. “Any work from DOGE is to find fraud, which they’ve successfully done.”","summary":"The comments Elon Musk made beside President Donald Trump in the White House on Tuesday suggest that he&#8217;s lining up his next government waste target: Social Security, the nation&#8217;s largest retirement beneficiary program.

But the big picture here is most important: Last fall, Carr, who at the time was an FCC commissioner, announced that he'd be scrutinizing big media companies once he started running the agency.Now he's doing that.Earlier this month, his agency compelled CBS to hand over transcripts and video from a \"60 Minutes\" interview it ran with Kamala Harris last fall, ostensibly because it's concerned about \"news distortion.\" This is the same interview that's the focus of a lawsuit Donald Trump filed against CBS owner Paramount, which Paramount is now trying to settle. That lawsuit is theoretically separate from the FCC approval Paramount owner Shari Redstone needs in order to sell her company to David and Larry Ellison. In the real world, the two seem very intertwined.Now, Carr has added Comcast to the list of Big Media companies that need scrutiny. It's worth noting that Trump, as a private citizen, has already successfully gone after Disney, via a lawsuit he filed last year — and got Disney to settle once he'd been elected. At this point, the only media company I'd be surprised to see Trump and his administration target would be Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp., which owns Fox News, Trump's favorite channel.In theory, Carr is scrutinizing Comcast because he thinks they may be violating civil rights laws because \"there is substantial evidence that your companies are still engaging in the promotion of DEI,\" per the letter he sent to Comcast this week. (I've asked Carr for comment, as well as the full text of the note, which was summarized by NewsMax.)Why does the head of the FCC, which is supposed to enforce communications law, get to weigh in on whether a media conglomerate does or doesn't promote DEI? Carr has an answer: The FCC has oversight over several of Comcast's businesses, from \"cable to high-speed internet and from broadcast TV stations to … wireless offerings.\" (Carr does not mention Comcast's plan to spin off most of its cable networks, which shouldn't require FCC approval — but could conceivably get held up by a different Trump-appointed regulator.)In theory, this may be connected to a Trump executive order instructing his agencies \"to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences,\" and for each agency to find \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" at places like publicly traded companies, non-profits and colleges.\" (Last week, on her first day on the job, US Attorney General Pam Bondi put her office to work on the same task, and said she would also look at \"criminal investigations\" to stop DEI.)In a statement, Comcast acknowledged it received Carr's letter and said it \"will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\"But it would be naive to think that Carr is going after Comcast because he has a problem with the company's HR practices alone.Right before the election, for instance, Carr was complaining about the way Comcast's \"Saturday Night Live\" used Kamala Harris in a cameo, which he said violated the agency's \"equal time\" rules. Carr said that could conceivably put the broadcast licenses Comcast owns at risk: \"in my view, every single remedy needs to be on the table, at least as an initial matter.\"In other words, there seem to be lots of things a big media company can do that will earn the ire of the Trump administration. Maybe it's an interview. Maybe it's a comedy skit. Maybe it's the way they hire and promote people.And if you're worried that the next thing you do could upset the president of the United States, maybe you'll think carefully before you do that thing. No matter what it is. Which seems to be the point.","summary":"The list of big media companies that have drawn Donald Trump's ire keeps getting bigger.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-fcc-brendan-carr-trump-dei-investigation-paramount-disney-2025-2","image":"https://i.insider.com/67acd4f06630eb10385c63a1?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 17:56:10","author":"Peter Kafka","authors":["Peter Kafka"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":289802018,"title":"LA Times owner mulls MAGA-friendly digital news outlet featuring Candace Owens, Scott Jennings: report","text":"The billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times is reportedly in the process of launching a new MAGA-leaning digital news service that will feature controversial commentator Candace Owens and pro-Trump CNN pundit Scott Jennings.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the biopharmaceutical mogul who bought the venerable newspaper in 2018, has been working with Republican strategist Eric Beach on a new media venture tentatively called LAT Next, according to the Status newsletter.\n\nSoon-Shiong, who has demanded the Times pivot away from its left-wing bent, sparked a newsroom revolt after killing the editorial board’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nUnlike the Times, LAT Next appears to be a digital-first platform that will feature personalities catering to a conservative audience, Status’ Oliver Darcy reported on Wednesday.\n\nOwens has been involved in multiple controversies, particularly regarding her comments on Israel and Jews.\n\nMost recently, she parted ways with The Daily Wire after making remarks that were widely condemned as antisemitic, escalating her public feud with co-founder Ben Shapiro over the Israel-Palestinian conflict. \n\nDespite sharing part of the Times’ branding, LAT Next is reportedly a separate entity, though the specifics of its relationship with the newspaper remain unclear.\n\nHints of the new venture have surfaced on social media.\n\nLast week, Soon-Shiong revealed that the conservative Jennings, who has gotten into heated debates with left-leaning pundits on CNN, would be involved in the project. Jennings was also named to the LA Times editorial board after several members quit following the spiked endorsement.\n\nAdditional names being floated include Ana Kasparian, a progressive commentator who has expressed criticism of certain left-wing policies.\n\nSoon-Shiong’s plans for a pro-Trump entity is said to be causing angst among staffers at the Times — particularly in light of management’s recent buyout offer for anyone who has worked at the paper for more than two years.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Soon-Shiong, the Times, Owens, Beach, Kasparian and Jennings.\n\nDetails about LAT Next’s programming remain sparse, but sources suggest that video content will be a major focus, according to Status.\n\nOne of the key attractions is rumored to be a talk show modeled after “The View,” with Beach actively recruiting co-hosts.\n\nRob Schneider, the Trump-backing “Saturday Night Live” alum, had previously pitched Soon-Shiong on a conservative talk show that would model “The View.” \n\nSchneider discussed the idea in December at the newspaper’s El Segundo offices alongside Cheryl Hines, who is married to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services, according to Status.\n\nThe venture’s connection to the Times is causing unease among its journalists, who fear that resources may be diverted from the newspaper to support Soon-Shiong’s latest initiative, the outlet reported.\n\nConcerns about the newspaper’s direction were already mounting before the emergence of LAT Next.\n\nIn late December, Soon-Shiong held a virtual meeting with members of the Times’ opinion section after staffers expressed concern over his apparent interference in editorial decisions.\n\nAccording to sources, Soon-Shiong dominated the conversation, criticizing the opinion team for being too liberal.\n\nThe meeting, described as tense and unproductive, left staffers feeling demoralized.\n\nA little over a month later, management announced voluntary buyouts as the publication continued to lose money.\n\nThe extent of potential job losses remains uncertain, but the inclusion of relatively new hires in the buyout offer suggests significant reductions could be on the horizon.\n\nMeanwhile, Soon-Shiong continues to exert influence over the newspaper’s opinion section.\n\nHe has reportedly directed three left-leaning columnists — Robin Abcarian, Jackie Calmes, and LZ Granderson — to scale back their contributions from two articles per week to one.\n\nThis decision has fueled speculation that the opinion section is being strategically reshaped to align with a more conservative perspective.\n\nA recent profile in The Free Press described Soon-Shiong as having taken “the red pill,” a term associated with a right-ward political awakening.\n\nIn the article, he expressed regret over his past support for progressive causes and criticized the Times for what he described as a culture of bias.\n\nHis remarks, which included accusations that some reporters disguise opinions as facts, infuriated staff members, according to Status.\n\nEmployees who had recently dedicated extensive efforts to covering wildfires in California were particularly frustrated that instead of acknowledging their hard work, their employer chose to publicly disparage them, the newsletter reported.","summary":"New MAGA-leaning digital news outlet may feature the likes of controversial commentator Candace Owens and pro-Trump CNN pundit Scott

conglomerates with diversity programs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Carr warned Comcast CEO Brian Roberts that the FCC will be looking into whether the cable giant — which owns NBCUniversal — is breaking federal law, specifically the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, by running DEI programs, according to a letter obtained by The Post.\n\n“Every single business that’s regulated by the FCC…I trust that they have now got the message that the time to end their invidious forms of DEI discrimination is now,” Carr told The Post.\n\nThe probe comes as President Trump has cracked down on DEI programs, banning the policies across the federal level on his first day in office and calling for private firms to follow suit.\n\nThe agency will be evaluating Comcast’s and NBCUniversal’s many DEI practices, including DEI days and training programs, Carr wrote in the letter.\n\n“We have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,” a Comcast spokesperson told The Post in a statement. “For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.”\n\nCarr said the agency was starting with Comcast because the company “touches so many of our sectors.” The company operates cable, wireless and internet services, and owns broadcasters like NBCUniversal and the streaming service Peacock.\n\nThe FCC chair said he expects every single entity overseen by the agency to end any discriminatory DEI policies – and hinted that companies that fail to do so could face regulatory hurdles when it comes to dealmaking.\n\n“I have a very hard time seeing how a business is going to get FCC approval while maintaining invidious forms of discrimination,” Carr told The Post.\n\nHe did not confirm whether all FCC-regulated companies with DEI policies should expect to be slapped with investigations, but said there are “lots of different options on the table,” including letters and enforcement warnings.\n\n“If they haven’t already, they need to be doing their due diligence,” Carr said.\n\nSince taking the helm at the FCC last month, Carr has reinstated bias complaints lodged against ABC, NBC and CBS, which accused them of being partial to Democrat Kamala Harris in their coverage of the presidential campaign.\n\nThe DEI clampdown comes as a number of companies – including Walmart, Target, Meta and Amazon – have backtracked on their diversity policies.\n\nMost recently, Google and Disney have walked back some of their DEI programs after Trump took office.","summary":"The FCC's chairman sent a letter to Comcast's chief executive on Tuesday about his order for an

US President Donald Trump’s latest proposal to take “long-term ownership” of Gaza, to “clean out” the “mess”, and to turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East” is just the latest iteration of efforts aimed at ethnically cleansing Palestinians from their homeland.\n\nWhat makes Trump’s comments dangerous is not the immediate threat of US military intervention in Gaza followed by the expulsion of its 2.2 million residents. The real danger lies elsewhere.\n\nFirst, Israel may interpret Trump’s words as a green light to push Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank. Second, the US could tacitly endorse another Israeli offensive under the guise of fulfilling the president’s wishes. Third, Trump’s remarks suggest his foreign policy on Palestine will remain largely unchanged from his predecessor’s.\n\nSome Democrats have seized this moment to criticise Arab and Palestinian Americans who voted for Trump or abstained from supporting Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the last elections. However, the idea of ethnic cleansing was already being floated during the Biden administration.\n\nWhile then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that “Palestinian civilians… must not be pressed to leave Gaza,” Biden created the conditions for displacement through unconditional military support for Israel. This allowed one of the most devastating wars in modern Middle Eastern history to unfold.\n\nREAD: Senator Sanders calls Trump’s proposal to ‘clean out’ Gaza’ ethnic cleansing’\n\nJust days into the war, on 13 October 2023, Jordan’s King Abdullah II warned Blinken in Amman against any Israeli attempt to “forcibly displace Palestinians from all Palestinian territories or cause their internal displacement.”\n\nThe latter displacement became a reality as most of northern Gaza’s population was crammed into overcrowded refugee encampments in central and southern Gaza, where conditions have been and remain inhumane for over 16 months.\n\nAt the same time, another displacement campaign is underway in the West Bank, particularly in its northern regions, accelerating in recent weeks. Thousands of Palestinian families have already been displaced in the Jenin governorate and other areas.\n\nDespite this, the Biden administration has done little to pressure Israel to stop.\n\nArab concerns over Palestinian expulsion were real from the war’s outset. Almost every Arab leader raised the alarm, often repeatedly.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi addressed the issue multiple times, warning of Israeli efforts – and possibly US involvement – in a “population transfer” scheme.\n\n“What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to seek refuge and migrate to Egypt,” Al-Sisi stated, insisting that such an outcome “should not be accepted.”\n\nFifteen months later, under Trump, he repeated his rejection, vowing that Egypt would not participate in this “act of injustice.”\n\nA Saudi statement was issued almost immediately after Trump doubled down on the idea during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 4 February. The Saudi Foreign Ministry went further than rejecting Trump’s “ownership” of Gaza but articulated a political discourse that summarised Riyadh’s, in fact, the Arab League’s position on Palestine.\n\n“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirms that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering,” the statement said, adding that the Kingdom “also reaffirms its unequivocal rejection of any infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, land annexation, or attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land.”\n\nOPINION: Trump’s ‘extremely serious’ Gaza displacement plan is basically a new Nakba\n\nThe new US administration, however, seems oblivious to Palestinian history. Given the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948, no Arab government – let alone the Palestinian leadership – would support another Israeli-US effort to ethnically cleanse millions into neighbouring states.\n\nBeyond the immorality of expelling an indigenous population, history has shown that such actions destabilise the region for generations. The 1948 Nakba, which saw the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, ignited the Arab-Israeli conflict, whose repercussions continue today.\n\nHistory also teaches us that the Nakba was not an isolated event. Israel has repeatedly attempted ethnic cleansing, starting with its intense attacks on Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza in the early 1950s, and ever since.\n\nThe 1967 war, known as the Naksa or “Setback,” led to the ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, both internally and externally. In the years that followed, various US-Israeli initiatives throughout the 1970s sought to relocate the Palestinian population to the Sinai desert. However, these efforts failed due to the steadfastness and collective resistance of the people of Gaza.\n\nTrump’s so-called ‘humanitarian’ ethnic cleansing proposal will similarly go down in history as another failed attempt, particularly as Arab and international solidarity with the steadfast Palestinian people is stronger than it has been in years.\n\nThe key question now is whether Arabs and other supporters of Palestine worldwide will go beyond merely rejecting such sinister proposals and take the initiative to push for the restoration of the Palestinian homeland. This requires a justice-based international campaign, rooted in international law and driven by the aspirations of the Palestinian people themselves.\n\nREAD: UN says ‘any forced displacement is ethnic cleansing’\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.","summary":"Let&#8217;s be clear: the forced displacement of Palestinians is not a new idea.

The Associated Press reported on Wednesday, “the cost of groceries, gasoline and rents rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve’s resolve to delay further interest rate cuts.”\n\n“Grocery prices have skyrocketed,” candidate Trump said back in August on the campaign trail. Trump has bragged that he won the election on his promise to lower the cost of “groceries.”\n\n“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,” Trump said, as multiple news outlets, including The New York Post and CNN, have reported.\n\nAfter the election, Trump acknowledged his pledge to reduce the price of groceries.\n\n“I won on groceries,” Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker in December.“Very simple word, groceries. Like almost — you know, who uses the word? I started using the word — the groceries. When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.”\n\nBut Trump appears to have done little to even try to bring down prices, including the cost of food.\n\n“Now, maybe Americans did send Trump back to the White House to lower prices,” MSNBC‘s Jen Psaki wrote late last month, “but during his first week in office — a period of time when presidents typically use their power to make clear what their priorities are — he focused on anything but.”\n\nThe one step he did appear to take to lower prices was to sign an executive order telling agencies in the executive branch to “take actions that lower prices.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Serious Injuries to Public Health’: Judge Scorches Trump Removal of Health Websites\n\n“President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the ‘inflation nightmare,'” CBS News reported last month, on Inauguration Day “signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires ‘all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief’ to Americans.”\n\n“It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,” the executive order stated.\n\n“To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel,” CBS added. It is unclear what steps they were supposed to take, or if any did.\n\nMeanwhile, consumers appear to be growing angry, and Wednesday’s inflation news — coupled with Trump’s imposition of a new tariff on all aluminum and steel coming into the United States — is not making it easier for average Americans.\n\nOn social media, critics were quick to blame and blast the President.\n\n“Meat prices up 0.6 percent in January, egg prices up 15.2 percent. Too bad Trump is so busy doing corrupt deals with Musk and planning to take over Greenland and Gaza that he can’t pay attention to food prices,” remarked Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nFormer Biden White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates posted video of Trump’s interview with NBC’s Welker.\n\n“The thing is,” Democratic strategist and Kamala Harris alum Mike Nellis wrote, “Trump didn’t just promise to cool inflation—he said prices would go down. And they aren’t. His tariff threats are already driving prices up everywhere, from groceries to housing, cars, and appliances.”\n\n“Trump took office and inflation immediately went UP. But instead of fixing the economy, he spent his time banning DEI, renaming water, going to the Super Bowl and trying to put hotels on the Gaza strip,” observed frequent commentator Alex Cole, who has nearly 275,000 followers on X.\n\n“They’re calling it TRUMPFLATION. Beautiful word, maybe the best word.

The pictures appalled many, but delighted many more. Soon after they aired, the president was enjoying one of the highest approval ratings of his political career, with most US adults fine with his work in office so far.\n\nThis side of the Atlantic, the government’s net popularity rating has hit -48 per cent, and the spectre of Reform, now leading in one poll and hoovering up every atom of media attention, looms large in Labour minds. And so, on 10 February BBC News at Ten viewers were faced with Trump-lite images of illegal immigrants being marched up airline steps in our own set of deportation videos. Across social media, there were videos of arrests being made in houses and shops in a bid to illustrate that 19,000 illegal migrants have been deported since the election.\n\nAnd yet a media strategy clearly intended to ape the “success” of Trump’s immigration videos was chiefly successful only in reminding us of the vast differences between our two nations. Not since the US version of The Office has television so clearly highlighted the gulf between the perma-positive gullibility of Americans and the innate scepticism of Brits.\n\nIn the US, the footage was accompanied by exuberant or outraged voiceovers from glossy-haired TV hosts. In the UK, the BBC’s Chris Mason was sent to Basildon in the drizzle to show passers-by the videos on his mobile phone. The BBC story of dawn raids was framed as “This is what the government wants you to see” rather than “This is a thing that has happened”. Which is exactly what the people of Basildon thought. “That, to me, is a government gimmick,” said one resident. The story quickly became about the government’s decision to release the videos, rather than what they contained.\n\nOn YouTube, where the videos racked up thousands of views, the comments were depressingly predictable (both for Labour and humanity). “This is just a lame PR operation,” said one. “Not even a drop in the ocean,” said another. Of course, some will have been persuaded that Labour is doing something to end illegal immigration. And undoubtedly it is a big issue for “Reform-curious” voters. But the British dislike being confronted by unkindness.\n\nMeanwhile TUC polling shows government policies such as a ban on zero-hours contracts and the extension of workers’ rights are hugely popular with Reform voters. Yet it feels these stories are being hidden at the back of the policy pantry in case the Daily Mail notices them.\n\nThe lesson of all this? Yes, the threat of Reform and Nigel Farage is real and, yes, they’re clinging on to Trump’s coat-tails. But a British audience is very different to an American one. As Ricky Gervais, who co-wrote both versions of The Office, said, Americans “applaud ambition and openly reward success. Brits are more comfortable with life’s losers. We embrace the underdog until it’s no longer the underdog.”\n\nWhich could be the best bit of news Keir Starmer has had in a while.\n\nThere’s been one beneficiary of Donald Trump’s mission to create American jobs for American people: Lara Trump. The president’s daughter-in-law is taking on a role as host of a new Fox News show focusing on “the return of common sense to all corners of American life”.\n\nThere are now 19 former Fox staffers working inside the Trump administration, including the defence secretary. And the Fox founder, Rupert Murdoch, has dropped in to the Oval Office. Trump described him as “in a class by himself… an amazing guy”.\n\nHow time flies. Just four years ago Murdoch was described by insiders as “a frothing-at-the-mouth” enemy of the president, while Trump denounced Fox News as going “weak and soft”.\n\nMeanwhile the Maga-sphere’s assaults on the US media intensify. In the space of a week Trump has said CBS should ditch its 60 Minutes news show as he wages a $10bn lawsuit over how it edited a Kamala Harris interview; the billionaire casino owner Steve Wynn, a Trump supporter, has filed a petition to overturn a 60-year-old Supreme Court ruling that protects press reporting on public officials; the president has called for the firing of a veteran Washington Post columnist; and Elon Musk wants a Wall Street Journal reporter to be sacked and has called for the public-funded outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America to be shut.\n\nIn the absence of a credible – or indeed, any – voice from the Democrats, the liberal media has become the official opposition.\n\nThe revolving door of disgraced TV presenters spins once more. The football pundit Jermaine Jenas, sacked by the BBC in August for workplace misconduct, has reappeared, on TalkSport. In a video clip marking his return to broadcasting, Jenas said: “Essentially this is about me looking inwards, making some improvements and coming back a better person.” Presumably so much time spent “looking inwards” meant Jenas had no time to consider how his rapid return feels for the women who took the brave step of reporting him for sending sexually suggestive messages.\n\n[See also: How 4chan became the home of the elite reader]","summary":"Also this week: Rupert Murdoch charms the White House, while the Maga-sphere’s assaults on US media intensify.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2025/02/the-british-public-was-wise-to-labours-deportation-videos","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/02/12/2AX7BFP-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 16:42:14","author":"Alison Phillips","authors":["Alison Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.272},{"id":289788200,"title":"Former Israeli parliamentarian urges audience to keep up the fight against climate change","text":"Speaking at this year's Haaretz's Israel Climate Change Conference on Tuesday, Dr. Dov Khenin, chair of the Israeli Climate Forum, examined the role environmental issues played in U.S. President Donald Trump's resounding win against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.

But Ludwig still attempted to throw the apparatchiks spewing out the flawed government statistics a lifeline by defending their reputations:\n\nWhat we uncovered shocked us. The bottom line is that, for 20 years or more, including the months prior to the election, voter perception was more reflective of reality than the incumbent statistics. Our research revealed that the data collected by the various agencies is largely accurate. Moreover, the people staffing those agencies are talented and well-intentioned. But the filters used to compute the headline statistics are flawed. As a result, they paint a much rosier picture of reality than bears out on the ground.\n\n Ludwig then issued a scathing rebuke of those who parroted the out-of-context government figures to prop up the Biden economy: “[T]he reality is that, if the prevailing indicators remain misleading, the facts don’t apply.”\n\nWell, here are some “facts” that the American people have been forced to contend with.\n\nConsumer prices are now 21 percent higher on average than when Biden first took office. On wage growth, even the Associated Press conceded in its Jan. 14 propaganda piece promoting Bidenomics that “consumer prices rose a combined 20.8% during the course of Biden’s presidency, but people’s average weekly earnings rose just 17.4% over the same period.”\n\n Fox Business also recently reported on a new study from digital lender Biz2Credit, which the outlet said showed how “[t]he backbone of the U.S. economy – the American small business – may be breaking beyond repair without some serious intervention.”\n\nSpecifically, the outlet noted that “[d]ata from the study was pulled from more than 100,000 financing applications submitted to Biz2Credit between January 2022 and December 2024, and it shows a sharp decline in the earnings of small businesses toward the end of 2024, a trend the lender sees continuing into 2025.”\n\nIn addition, much of the GDP growth that occurred under President Joe Biden was a result of a massive sugar high brought on by his administration launching the national debt into orbit. Now the debt is a ridiculous 123 percent of GDP.\n\nInflation is transitory, they said\nInflation is coming down, they said\nBut your wages are rising, they said\nTranslation: food prices set another record high in the last month of the Biden admin... pic.twitter.com/XPY7Xg4xkI\n— E.J. Antoni, Ph.D. (@RealEJAntoni) February 12, 2025\n\nBottom line: The Biden economy was always a nightmarish streak of unbelievably stupid policies from beginning to end, even by liberal standards.

The “Love Story” singer started off the year with six Grammy nominations, but not a single win. Coupled with the Chiefs’ epic loss at the Super Bowl and that viral booing video, many are starting to wonder if their star power is starting to fade.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTaylor Swift has over a dozen Grammys at home, so it’s not like this loss will be seen as a career setback. The “Anti-Hero” singer was nominated for six Grammys, including Album of the Year, but left empty-handed. Although Taylor didn’t seem to mind cheering on her friends and dancing along to the live performances, some fans expressed concern that she might have lost that “magic touch.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“The Tortured Poets Department” is not regarded as some of her best work. Although she put out 31 new songs with the full release, her latest album failed to have the same pop culture impact that many of her other records received. Although it’s likely that she will win another Grammy at some point in the future, some fans can’t help but wonder if the exhaustion from her record-breaking Eras Tour might be taking a toll on her.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWith Taylor Swift there for good luck, many felt that the Kansas City Chiefs would be able to pull off a three-peat, which has never been achieved in NFL history. Unfortunately, the Philadelphia Eagles won 40-22 after a series of disappointing plays by the Chiefs.\n\nFollowing the game, Patrick Mahomes told reporters that he was going to “let Travis make that decision on his own” when asked if he was ready to retire. “He’s given so much to this team and to the NFL,” Mahomes said. “And he’s been such a joy, not only for me to work with, but for people to watch.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMahomes said that Travis “still has a lot of football left in him,” but admitted that his decision to retire will ultimately depend on “if he wants to put in that grind” again. Travis has routinely been criticized for putting his relationship with Taylor above the game. He was seen vacationing in Lake Como with her last year and even joined her on stage during The Eras Tour after visiting her in several different countries.\n\nHe also received criticism right before the big game when he and Taylor stepped out for a double date with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. They were seen dining out at the French restaurant Lilette on Friday night, and although they did spend Saturday night getting ready for the big day, many fans felt that a little more preparation would have gone a long way.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOther than the Chiefs’ epic loss, the other most talked about moment of the night came from the audience, who loudly booed Taylor Swift when she appeared on the Jumbotron. It’s unclear if she was being booed due to Donald Trump’s attendance at the game, considering she threw her support behind Kamala Harris in the last U.S. election, or if football fans are getting tired of hearing about Travis’ relationship with the pop star.\n\nA source later told the Daily Mail that Travis “was aware of Taylor getting booed” and “felt helpless.” Although the game hadn’t been going well for the Chiefs before that point, the insider said “Seeing the look on her face got to him.”\n\n“He always protects her, and it broke his heart. He was already having a tough night, and the fact that the stadium was predominantly Eagles fans didn’t help,” they added, noting that some Eagles fans see her as a “traitor” because she is from Pennsylvania and had been seen sporting Eagles jerseys on multiple occasions. She even worked the lyric “With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door” into her 2020 song “Gold Rush.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJust before his big Super Bowl loss, a source told Us Weekly that Travis and Taylor were looking into buying a home together in Kansas City. “When they have time, they want to look at real estate. [They’ve] talked about exploring buying a home together,” they claimed, going on to say that their relationship “just keeps getting better.”\n\nAlthough their relationship may be improving, it looks like their respective careers are on the downswing. Taylor wrapped up her highly successful Eras Tour, but walked away without a Grammy win this year. Travis lost the Super Bowl and a chance to go down in the history books as the only team to pull off a three-peat. At this point, it remains unknown if he will even return to the field.\n\nWith these disappointments fresh on everyone’s mind, some are wondering: Is the golden age of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift finally over? And to that, Kristin says no. Success ebbs and flows, and as the saying goes, you can’t win them all. It’s true that “The Tortured Poets Department” was not Taylor’s best album, but that doesn’t mean that she won’t put out another award-winning album in the future.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTravis Kelce’s football career hangs in the balance of this defeat, but it’s unlikely that he will simply vanish from TV screens after starring in Ryan Murphy’s “Grotesquerie.” And that’s not even including his hosting role on “Are You Smarter Than A Celebrity?” and his cameo in Adam Sandler’s “Happy Gilmore” sequel. He’s always known that his football career will end at some point, but he’s been making the most of his time with Taylor to get his foot in the door in the entertainment industry. As long as people like working with him, his success will continue – whether or not he and Taylor ever tie the knot.\n\nFans might be discouraged after their fan-favorite couple got a slow start to 2025, but, much to the disappointment of Donald Trump, they aren’t going anywhere any time soon. They might retreat for a few months to lick their wounds and focus on their relationship, but by next year, they’ll be dominating headlines once again.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHowever, 2025 has gotten off to a rocky start.

Soon after the boos, Trump, the game’s guest of honor, went on social media to bash Swift, as he tends to do with other famous people who oppose him politically or who challenge to his cultural authority. On Truth Social, he falsely said Swift had been booed “out of the stadium” — she in fact stayed to watch the game — and declared: “MAGA is very unforgiving.”\n\nFor one female writer attending Sunday’s game, the effect of the boos and Trump’s subsequent Truth Social posts raised “significant” questions about whether the NFL was reverting to its old “toxic” ways.\n\nStephanie McNeal, writing for Glamour, said there have been several times that she has “felt chilled by the rapid increase in misogyny seeping in our culture” since Trump was elected president for a second term. “But watching Taylor Swift at Super Bowl LIX booed by a crowd of thousands on Sunday night was a new low,” McNeal wrote.\n\nSome people have suggested that Swift was merely heckled by some rowdy Philadelphia Eagles fans as her face appeared on the Jumbotron. The Eagles fans were understandably pumped about watching their team defeat her boyfriend’s Chiefs 40-22. But what happened to Swift was something else, said McNeal.\n\n“An almost instant—and distinctly male—dissent erupted from around me,” she said she witnessed. “As soon Swift appeared on screen, the crowd seemed to delight in jeering and heckling her, and the mood shift was palpable.”\n\nMcNeal said the moment might have “felt less visceral” if not for the fact that the crowd exploded into cheers less than an hour earlier, when Trump appeared on the same Jumbotron, standing in salute as Jon Batiste sang the national anthem. While social media showed that some boos were directed at Trump, overall, “the roar and approval” for him “was deafening,” McNeal wrote.\n\nConservative pundit Megyn Kelly, who also was at the Super Bowl, sitting between Trump and Swift’s luxury boxes, confirmed the different reactions to Swift and Trump on her blog. She declared, “It was just so obvious the crowd loved Trump.” She also repeated Trump’s Truth Social post that, other than the Kansas City Chiefs, Swift was “the biggest loser of the night.”\n\nTo McNeal, the different reactions in this NFL arena “felt like a message.” It is that the Super Bowl, one of the biggest cultural events in the country, “has been reclaimed by Trump and the type of toxic masculinity he appears to be the beacon of,” she said.\n\nIf that’s the case with the Super Bowl, it marks a stunning turnaround from 2024’s game, when sports, entertainment and news outlets couldn’t get enough of celebrating Swift at the game, pumping out photos of her cheering on the Chiefs as they defeated the San Francisco 49ers, or of her embracing and kissing Kelce on the field as he and his team received their second-straight Vincent Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBefore and after the 2024 Super Bowl, much was written about the “Taylor Swift effect” and the mega-star’s ability to attract female viewers to NFL games across different age demographics. One study showed that Swift’s game-day appearances, including at the 2024 Super Bowl, boosted NFL viewership in the ages 12-17 demographic by 8%, while a league spokesperson told McNeal that its following among women jumped 21% from 2023 to 2024. Ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl, Marketwatch reported that the NFL should consider making Swift “an unofficial MVP” by reporting that she has helped the NFL earn nearly $1 billion in brand value since she began dating Kelce in the summer of 2023.\n\nThis news organization also detailed how Swift helped boost the personal and professional profiles of other wives and girlfriends of NFL players — the so-called WAGs. The 14-time Grammy award winner notably created a viral moment for Kristin Juszczyk, the fashion designer wife of 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Swift wore a red, custom-designed Kristin Juszczyk puffer jacket to the Jan. 13, 2024 game, and the 49ers spouse soon landed an NFL licensing deal to produce stylish, sports-themed fashions.\n\nTeams like the 49ers have been very public about their initiatives to mirror social attitudes about diversity and equality by working to attract Swift’s demographic of fans — girls and young women and members of the LGBTQ community — and to hire increasing numbers of women, especially in leadership positions. But now the NFL may face questions about how seriously it wants to expand its appeal when the crowd at its annual championship game loudly cheered a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault, while loudly booing a talented, accomplished and highly influential woman who had become one of the sport’s most enthusiastic boosters.\n\nCertainly, there was a bit less excitement this year about Swift attending the Super Bowl. The novelty of her dating Kelce has worn off. The pop mega-star also isn’t expected to be as visible as she has been the past two years, as she ended her blockbuster Eras Tour in December. Moreover, she wasn’t coming off the buzz of just being named Time’s Person of the Year, as was the case in early 2024.\n\nIndeed Donald Trump succeeded Swift as Time’s Person of the Year in 2024 and, critics say, has been using his presidency to dismantle decades of government efforts to improve social and economic opportunities for women, people of color and queer people. He and Swift represent “two factions of American culture currently struggling for dominance,” McNeal said.\n\nWhen it comes to the NFL, the reality is that Swift was never universally embraced by football fans, McNeal acknowledged. A large and vocal contingent of mostly male fans complained about her presence at games being a “distraction.” Kelly also tried to justify Swift being booed by blaming her, saying she’s let herself be “overexposed” to the point that the public has become sick of her. Kelly also said that Swift alienated half the country by getting political and by endorsing Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nWhether Kelly is right, some of Swift’s fans argued on X that Trump and his supporters didn’t exactly distinguish themselves, or boost the public image of the NFL, with their conduct at the Super Bowl Sunday. They said that Trump showed his “narcissism” by sharing side-by-side images of himself being cheered while Swift was booed.\n\n“A grown man, nearly an octogenarian, seeking validation like a 10-year-old on the playground. Pathetic. But true to form,” one person said, while another said that Trump is “a bully who obviously needs to tear down others because his fragile ego can’t take it.” One woman furthermore suggested that Swift haters at the Super Bowl revealed that NFL fandom might be filled with “sad, grown-ass men” who “are threatened by (Swift’s) presence.”\n\nTo McNeal, Trump and his booing supporters seemed to announce that the NFL’s “era of inclusivity” is over. She wrote: “Not only does it feel like Trump and his ilk want Swift out of football, it’s like they want to return our entire country to a time when they were in control, had all the power, and could say whatever they wanted without repercussions.”","summary":"After the NFL reveled in the 'Taylor Swift effect,' has the league and the Super Bowl been 'reclaimed by Trump? and his supporters?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/12/do-the-taylor-swift-boos-and-trump-attacks-signal-a-return-of-nfls-toxic-masculinity/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TaylorSwiftSuperbowl3.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 15:30:56","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.255},{"id":289745190,"title":"Trump pardoned my cousin for assaulting a police officer Jan. 6 — it was the right call","text":"“We didn’t eat like this,” my cousin Patrick jokes, cutting his steak at a homecoming dinner with family to celebrate his release from prison.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned Patrick on Day One of his White House return. My cousin had been serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence at the Elkton federal correctional institution in Ohio for his actions Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nPatrick is one of the “violent” J6ers Democrats and even some right-wing commentators and congressional Republicans say Trump shouldn’t have pardoned. But like many of these cases, Patrick’s has — to use the words of Vice President J.D. Vance — “gray areas.”\n\nPatrick McCaughey III was 23 years old when he drove to Washington, DC, with his father to protest what he saw as election manipulation. “I went down there expecting we would probably listen to a couple speeches and protest visibly, stand in location and make our voices heard,” he tells me. “It was my first real political event, protest, rally.”\n\nPatrick readily admits he didn’t act well that day. He used a riot shield to push against a line of officers blocking the West Terrace entrance, pinning one to a doorway.\n\nYet if Democrats and the Biden Justice Department had treated J6ers — violent or not — the same way they treated Black Lives Matter protesters, pro-Palestinian protesters or regular criminal offenders, we would not be discussing pardons today.\n\n“There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups,” Vance said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “A double standard that was not applied to many people, including of course the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.”\n\nCritics will say this is whataboutism, but for a party so focused on criminal-justice reform and “restorative justice,” the Democrats were quick to indict J6ers as “insurrectionists” and equate them with “domestic terrorists.” Many J6ers were overcharged, denied bail and a speedy trial and sentenced to excessive prison terms.\n\nThe federal prosecutors in my cousin’s case sought a more-than-15-year prison sentence. He had no criminal record. He’d never even gotten a speeding ticket. He owned no firearms. Yet when FBI agents banged on the door to arrest him at his father’s home Jan. 19, 2021, they did so with guns drawn.\n\n‘Pick the right side!’\n\nA hulky guy with glasses and an avid reader, Patrick was a high-school honors student and speaks three languages. His politics skewed right in his teens, but COVID hardened his libertarian views. He was living with his mother in Fairfield County, Conn., at the time and working in residential construction with his father. He says watching fundamental rights “being trampled upon with basic impunity” made him speak up for the first time.\n\nHe got thrown off Twitter twice for posting that masks aren’t effective. He wanted to make his voice heard.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Patrick and his father watched Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, then marched to the Capitol. Patrick separated from his father, took a selfie on the scaffolding set up for President Joe Biden’s inauguration and joined a crowd at the West Terrace entrance.\n\nSurveillance and bodycam video of the mêlée at that entrance is extensive. Patrick uses a clear-plastic police riot shield to push against the line of officers blocking the doorway. “Just go home, man,” Patrick yells.\n\n“Pick the right side,” a police officer shouts.\n\nA person behind Patrick squirts what looks like bear spray at the police. A man to Patrick’s left reaches under the helmet of one of the officers, Daniel Hodges, and grabs his face. Hodges later said the man “tried to gouge out my eye.”\n\nThe crowd yells “Heave-ho” and pushes in unison to break the line of officers blocking the entrance. Hodges screams, wedged between a door frame and the shield Patrick holds. \n\n“Let me back,” Patrick yells. He pulls Hodges’ face shield back down to, he tells me, protect him from the bear spray and tear gas. “He’s hurt,” Patrick shouts, pointing to Hodges.\n\n“I really was screaming at the top of my lungs to have them go back so that we might be able to extricate Officer Hodges from the situation,” Patrick tells me.\n\nAt trial, Hodges conceded Patrick alerted another officer that Hodges was injured, and he was whisked to safety. Yet Hodges also says he was “crushed” by the force of Patrick’s shield the whole time.\n\nPatrick never made it into the building. After Trump released a video later that day telling protesters to go home, he drove with his father back to his dad’s house in South Salem, New York.\n\nAt his sentencing, US District Judge Trevor McFadden called Patrick a “poster child of all that was dangerous and appalling” about Jan. 6. Patrick apologized to the court, saying, “My actions on January 6, 2021, will remain the greatest embarrassment of my life.”\n\nHe’s more nuanced with me. “I don’t regret going. I don’t regret my thoughts at the time,” he says. “But I think that, ultimately, I went down there to effect positive change, and through rashness or anger, I managed to defeat my own purpose.”\n\n‘Vindictive mission’\n\nI watched Jan. 6 on TV in shock and disgust. I couldn’t understand how these people — protesting in the name of MAGA — thought battling police or calling for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence helped their cause. I thought this would be a dark footnote to the Trump presidency and Trump’s reputation would never recover.\n\nI was wrong. The Democrats all but ensured Trump’s survival.\n\nFor all the Democrats’ and the media’s talk about “insurrection,” nobody was charged with that crime. Biden lied repeatedly that J6 protesters killed Officer Brian Sicknick, even though he died of two strokes caused by an artery clot the next day. Vice President Kamala Harris likened Jan. 6 to Sept. 11. The Democrats’ entire platform became about “saving democracy,” and they used this as a pretext to prosecute Trump.\n\nWhen Patrick was arrested, he thought his father would be able to bail him out after the arraignment. “I did not understand that there was going to be a judge from New York — a no-cash-bail state — who would say that I’m a monster and that I was too dangerous to be allowed out in the community,” he says. “That really was a wakeup call.”\n\nPatrick was flown to Oklahoma and spent time in several different jails before ending up in the DC jail. Patrick calls that a bright spot in his incarceration because the entire ward was filled with J6ers. Due to the risk of COVID, they were only allowed out of their cells for one hour a day, but he says they helped each other contact their families, find lawyers and created a “community much greater than any group of incarcerated people could expect.”\n\nThey sang the national anthem every day, signed each other’s pocket Constitutions and played charades once a week. In May, Patrick got out on bond with supervised release until trial. \n\nPatrick’s father says “nobody wanted to take the case,” and he was advised that his son accept a plea deal. They refused.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Patrick with several counts of assaulting an officer, including with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and a slew of other offenses. His case was joined with that of five other J6 defendants he’d never met. He was forced into a trial group with two of them over his attorney’s objections.\n\n“I feel as if it was prejudicial to my case to be joined with these people,” Patrick tells me. “The government also dragged its heels for quite some time on allowing discovery.”\n\nPatrick opted for a bench trial because, he says, “the jury pool was so against us, against January 6 defendants, that it would have been impossible to get a fair trial there.” \n\n“Being a man of principle, no, I don’t regret going,” Patrick’s father says about the Jan. 6 protest. But he calls the trial a “kangaroo court” and concedes, “I was fairly naïve moving into the whole thing — that’s where I really find fault with myself.”\n\nThat the officer Patrick pinned with the shield was Daniel Hodges also didn’t help his case. Hodges has become one of the most outspoken Jan. 6 police officers. He campaigned for Biden and then Harris, traveling to Michigan with her team. After Trump pardoned the J6ers, Hodges spoke at a press conference with Rep. Eric Swalwell, calling on members of Congress to oppose Trump’s “horrific agenda” and warning the J6ers are now free to “try it again.”\n\n“There was a lot of pressure placed upon the prosecutors and judge in my case to seek a conviction and to obtain one because there was so much media attention,” Patrick says, “combined with an officer who was only too happy to appear before Congress and to speak to the media.”\n\nHodges did not return my request for comment.\n\n“The Justice Department was energized in a way to explicitly convict. It was not a fact-finding mission. It was a retributive, vindictive mission,” Patrick says.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2022, Patrick was convicted of seven felony counts, including assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon, and remanded to prison. In April 2023, he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years. He spent the bulk of his incarceration at the Elkton federal prison in Ohio, housed mainly with child molesters.\n\nMadness of crowds\n\nAs a teenager and in my early 20s, I took part in a lot of radical-left protests. I missed the riot at the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999, but I got teargassed at a 2000 Washington, DC, International Monetary Fund demonstration. I know something about the madness of crowds. I asked Patrick about this at dinner.\n\n“It is something very fundamental to human beings that if you get enough people in a certain spirit in one area, that they’re likely to behave less like rational individuals and more like a mob,” he says. “If you get into a shoving match with the cops, it’s not the best. I know that.”\n\nPatrick says most of the people he’s met who traveled to Washington for the Jan. 6 protests had “good intentions,” though he concedes in a crowd that size there was likely a small percent who didn’t. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence Trump commuted, had a cache of weapons stashed in a Virginia hotel room that day. Eric Munchel wore tactical gear and carried stolen zip ties in the Capitol. The guy wearing the “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt is probably not a mensch.\n\nThe overzealous prosecution of J6ers, though, has made these people martyrs to some on the right.\n\nPatrick is responsible for his actions Jan. 6, 2021. I don’t condone violence. I’m not downplaying the significance of attacking the Capitol. But seven-and-a-half years is too much for the crimes he committed.\n\nA pro-Palestinian activist, Ruben Camacho, was sentenced to just 48 hours of community service for punching a female police officer at a protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 2023. Edward Schinzing was sentenced to 15 months for breaking into and setting fire to a federal courthouse in Portland in 2020, with employees and prisoners still inside. A Black Lives Matter rioter who torched a Minneapolis pawn shop, causing the death of a person inside, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. That’s five years less than prosecutors wanted for my cousin.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPatrick is now 27 years old. He’s softspoken with a dry sense of humor. Despite the pardon, his J6 conviction will follow him for the rest of his life — whenever he applies for a job or apartment or goes on a date. He was already debanked. But he is not a threat to society, and more prison time would likely only harden him, not make him a better candidate for release. Isn’t that a pillar of the Democrats’ criminal-justice reform?\n\nAt our dinner, Patrick didn’t want to dwell on the bad experiences in prison. He spoke about how J6ers looked out for each other, helped new inmates navigate the prison phone system and organized rides and a hotel room when they were released at 1 a.m. Jan. 21.\n\nHe joked about getting caught once using a cellphone and the sense of humor the guard who assigned him to a 45-day stint in the special housing unit — a modern form of solitary confinement with one cellmate — must have had for pairing him with Frank Monte, New Jersey’s number-one Trump stalker. “I stayed away from cell phones after that,” he says.\n\nPatrick plans to hike the Appalachian Trail this summer. Before Jan. 6, he’d been planning a trip to Japan. He taught himself Japanese. But he says he called the Japanese consulate last month, and it told him he can’t visit the country with a criminal conviction, despite the pardon.\n\nIn the longer term, Patrick plans to move to New Hampshire or Montana to be around more “liberty-minded people.” He wants to build his own house and start a family.\n\n“I’m not anybody special. I have a regular job. I love this country, but that’s about it. In the great-man theory of history, I’m not one of them,” Patrick says. “I’m just overjoyed I’m free, that I’m able to interact with my family, to be with my loved ones, to enjoy my full rights.”\n\nCaroline McCaughey covers politics and policy for The New York Sun.","summary":"“We didn’t eat like this,” my cousin Patrick jokes, cutting his steak at a homecoming dinner with family to celebrate his release from prison.

However, a new national poll also indicates that the public also gives a thumbs down to other moves made by Trump during his avalanche of action since returning to the White House on Jan. 20. Trump has signed 63 executive orders since his inauguration, according to a count from Fox News, which far surpasses the rate of any presidential predecessors during their first weeks in office. According to a Marquette Law School Poll national survey released on Wednesday, the most popular action sampled is Trump's executive order mandating the federal government recognize only two sexes - male and female. TRUMP HITS WARP SPEED HIS FIRST WEEK BACK IN OFFICE Sixty-three percent of adults nationwide supported the move, with just 37% opposed, the survey indicates. The gender order, signed by Trump hours after his inauguration, states that it will \"defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\" The order required that the federal government, going forward, use the term \"sex\" rather than \"gender\" and mandated that \"government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex.\" TRUMP UNPLUGGED: WHAT THE NEW PRESIDENT IS DOING THAT BIDEN RARELY DID It reversed a 2022 move by former President Joe Biden's administration to allow U.S. citizens to be able to select the gender-neutral \"X\" on their passports. During his successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House, Trump repeatedly pledged to roll back protections for transgender and nonbinary people. His campaign spotlighted an ad which ran in key battleground states that claimed former Vice President Kamala Harris \"is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\" The poll indicates a large partisan divide, with 94% of Republicans and two-thirds of independents but just 27% of Democrats supporting the executive order. Another popular move, according to the poll: 6 in 10 said they favor expanding oil and gas production. Some of Trump's numerous actions on immigration and border security also grabbed a thumbs up. Sixty percent said they support deporting immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, and 59% favored declaring a national emergency at the nation's southern border with Mexico due to migrant crossings. However, the survey also found that 57% opposed deporting immigrants who have resided in the United States illegally for a number of years, but who have jobs and no criminal record. HEAD HERE FOR FOX NEWS UPDATES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN THE WHITE HOUSE Also getting a big thumbs down - Trump's Day One pardon or commuting the sentences of nearly all the Trump supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to upend congressional certification of Biden's 2020 Electoral College victory over Trump. Sixty-five percent opposed the move by the president. An equal number of respondents also do not support Trump's repeated declarations that the U.S. will take back the Panama Canal. Additionally, Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America is opposed by 71% of adults nationwide, according to the poll. Fifty-seven percent of Republicans support the renaming, but backing drops to just 16% among independents and 4% among Democrats.

In the same year, it gave $87,246 to former Vice President Kamala Harris. According to the data, they’ve been greasing both blue and red wheels pretty equally since 1990.\n\nBut with Trump’s aggressive anti-immigrant and anti-DEI actions, any support was enough to begin boycott calls. These accelerated against Coke when rumors spread that a plant in Texas had fired Latino workers—over a thousand according to food and beverage outlet Mui Kitchen—and even reported some to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nA new trend on TikTok and Instagram is all about showing grocery store shelves stocked full of Coke products and comparing them to emptier Pepsi sections while commenters declare their intentions to boycott en masse.\n\nDid Coca-Cola call ICE on its employees?\n\nSo far, the idea that the company reported its workers to ICE for arrest remains an unconfirmed rumor. It’s been circulating on social media platforms for days, but Coca-Cola has yet to respond and no one has come forward to confirm that they were fired or arrested at a bottling plant.\n\n View this post on Instagram \n\nThe company might want to act fast, as the rumors have spread from TikTok to Instagram to X to Reddit and beyond, and Pepsi has been gaining new followers by the thousands as former Coke fans announce their intention to switch.\n\n“So, allegedly Coke fired some immigrants AND called ICE on them and now they’re being boycotted from America to Mexico and even Ireland,” reports X user @mamachell. “And I remember learning that during segregation it was PEPSI who advertised to black ppl & had them in their ads.”\n\n“Team Pepsi,” declared @Tropicxs_media. “A Latino boycott began to stop consuming Coca-Cola for not defending its employees in deportations, unlike Pepsi, which is doing so.”\n\nDid Coca-Cola cut ties with Taylor Swift?\n\nThe new boycott is dredging up an old rumor that Coke broke up with Taylor Swift over her endorsement of Harris in September 2024. Fact-checkers confirmed this was false after they traced the idea back to a satirical Facebook page called “SpaceX Fanclub.”\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, the page claimed that Coca-Cola had dropped Swift because her endorsement “clashes with the brand’s values of ‘unity and neutrality.’” This statement raised suspicions among those aware that celebrities often endorse political candidates and any company would be extremely foolish to activate the Swifties.\n\n @thecasualbrian Is Coca Cola calling ICE on its employees!

The \"Saturday Night Live\" alum, who had been longtime pals with \"The Donald,\" was asked to do a speech at the Tampa fairgrounds. At the time, the celebrity businessman was running for president. In his new memoir, \"Average Joe,\" the comic and actor wrote that he knew that publicly supporting Trump would be \"the forever death knell, the nail in my coffin in Hollywood.\" JOE PISCOPO SHOWS ULTIMATE SIGN OF RESPECT BY ATTENDING TRUMP’S TRIAL: ‘I’M A GUY OF LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP’ Piscopo, now 73, told Fox News Digital he has zero regrets about supporting Trump, even if it meant getting shut out of Hollywood. \"I made the right move, but boy, they don’t want to hear it out in Hollywood,\" said Piscopo. \"Now, I don’t care. The country’s in such a mess. And Donald Trump is doing such a great job at this point… It’s not idolization of anybody. It’s not me going gaga over anybody. It’s the right thing for America.

But that’s OK… I did what’s right in my heart.\" In his book, Piscopo wrote, \"I thought it was best for the country that Hillary [Clinton] did not become president.\" His stance on Trump’s political rival never changed. \"I don’t hate Hillary,\" Piscopo explained to Fox News Digital. \"I found Hillary rather charming when I met her.

He described arriving at the Tampa fairgrounds and witnessing \"roughly 20,000 people\" just waiting to hear Trump speak. Piscopo was stunned. \"It’s like a rock concert,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I [couldn’t] believe it. This is ‘The Donald.’ So now I’m going over my speech.

She was 11 when the first season started filming a decade ago, and now she’s starting a whole new chapter of life that includes husband Jake Bongiovi, a farm, an animal rescue sanctuary, and a movie, The Electric State, directed by the Russo brothers—plus more of the delightful Enola Holmes. Photographer Sølve Sundsbø captures Brown’s chic side with portraits shot in New York, while Suzy Exposito visits the star in her natural habitat, in Georgia, to learn more about how she handles the limelight from an iconic role and her dreams for what’s next. (Somebody cast her in a musical ASAP!)\nDuring Oscar season last year, we revived an old Vanity Fair rubric, The Power & the Glamour, for a collection of portraits capturing the movers and shakers whose work, regardless of where they’re based, wields influence in Hollywood—longtime faves and rising forces alike. We loved it so much that we are bringing it back, with a new cast of characters photographed by Norman Jean Roy. Here’s Michelle Yeoh, a cinema icon now defying gravity as a Wicked villain, two years after winning an Academy Award for Everything Everywhere All at Once. There’s fashion-world darling Jonathan Anderson, whose collaborations with Luca Guadagnino defined the looks of Challengers and Queer (not to mention creating a fresh vibe for Daniel Craig). How about the trio from SmartLess, seasoned actors Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, who all turned out to have the perfect faces for podcasting, with a reported $100 million deal from SiriusXM to prove it. And Bela Bajaria, who sits atop all film and TV content at Netflix worldwide. And Issa Rae, a quadruple threat—actor, writer, producer, and now restaurateur too—who’s a model for consolidating creative power (the better to control one’s destiny, my pretty). What’s a current Broadway star doing in the mix? Well, it’s Nicole Scherzinger, who’s generated raves for her performance in that quintessential fable of Hollywood stardom gained and lost, Sunset Blvd. As Los Angeles mobilizes for recovery and rebuilding after this winter’s wildfires, it’s good to remember how resilient the town has always been, in large part because of the people whose creativity and energy fuel it.\nAt the Democratic National Convention last summer, VF special correspondent James Pogue probed the extent of the party’s joy apparatus: He suspected, rightly, that brands, celebs, and “content-driven strategy” (to quote one young consultant) weren’t going to get Vice President Kamala Harris over the line. At an election night party at Peter Thiel’s house, he knew it for sure. In his feature “Vibe Check,” the result of months of reporting and conversations across the political spectrum, James assesses the state of the Democratic Party now.

A close friend once said, “Yes, Miriam. I think a racist can run the country fairly and objectively.” And she meant it. You think you’ve heard everything from a friend—every insecurity, every unpopular opinion, every karaoke song they should never sing again. Then, years in, you hit a political minefield and realize, there are still parts of each other you never saw coming. As I heard those words, I found myself asking the question no one talks about in friendships between white women and women of color: Are we really friends? Can we be friends if you actively vote for my demise? Can a multiracial friendship survive the misogyny, racism, and xenophobia of the Trump administration? Can we remain close after you heard of the rape allegations, the guilty verdict on 34 felony counts, the two impeachments, and countless racist dog whistles—and voted for him anyway? It’s an internal struggle I can trace back to the Barack Obama years, when a close friend described the former president as “uppity.” I explained it away, telling myself, She couldn’t possibly mean that. But that word stayed lodged, like a pebble in a shoe, and over the years, those pebbles added up until it became impossible to walk. There are quiet fault lines in Black and white female friendships, cracks that ideology splinters further. These cracks widened into fissures as I watched a Confederate flag paraded around the Capitol steps, carried by people emboldened by a president many of my white friends supported. And after yet another election where white women overwhelmingly voted against their own self-interest, I can’t help but wonder: Has the friendship line been crossed? The Weight of Silence In 2016, 47% of white women voted for Trump. Ninety-nine percent of Black women were sad. Completely frustrated but hopeful? We told ourselves that maybe they didn’t fully understand what they were endorsing. But in 2020, when 52% of white women voted for him again, sadness turned to anger, then resolve. This isn’t just a national issue anymore—it’s a white woman problem. You created this mess; you fix it. Don’t blame Black men or youth voters. In this craven quest for privilege, a monster was created that’s now eating us all alive. And yet, as my friend, you expect me to forgive. To give you that benefit of the doubt that Black women always give their white girlfriends. Well, no. Not anymore. White women’s propensity to uphold the white patriarchy isn’t just disappointing—it’s dangerous. It leaves me questioning everything I thought I knew about these friendships. Watching it play out feels unsettling in ways that words barely capture. Let’s not pretend this betrayal is new. Historically? White women have advanced their own interests at the expense of Black women, reinforcing systems of oppression while claiming solidarity. During the suffrage movement, white women actively aligned with white supremacy, prioritizing their own interests/enfranchisement over the universal right to vote—explicitly excluding Black women from the cause. And let us never forget the feminist movement; their focus on gender equality ignored the intersecting realities of race, leaving the rest of us out of the conversation. Entirely. These weren’t incidental oversights; they were deliberate choices that secured white women’s proximity to power while leaving Black women to fight battles on multiple fronts—alone. Each betrayal has been a reminder: when the fight for equality gets uncomfy, too often, white women recuse themselves. Friendship, Accountability, Reciprocity Women’s friendships are supposed to be different—deeper, richer, bound by fierce loyalty and unwavering support. My closest friendships have always been built on shared vulnerability and trust. But true friendship can’t survive without accountability. It demands reciprocity, especially now, when political choices are personal. When those values are betrayed, it chips away at trust, turning intimacy into a fragile facade held together by nostalgia and polite exchanges. How do these rifts happen? How can a friendship forged in fire suddenly feel like it’s built on sand? With some white friends, the gap between our experiences used to be easier to bridge. But now, the gap has become a gulf. And that gulf keeps getting wider and harder to cross. What I need in friendship now is empathy and accountability that transcends politics. A friend who understands that their vote isn’t just a ballot—it’s a statement about how they see me, my humanity, and our shared values. If accountability and mutual respect are missing, then what are we even holding onto? Without both, friendship becomes a social performance rather than a true connection. Black and white female friendships are deteriorating under the weight of politics. The cracks once ignored have widened with every election, every silence, every unspoken truth. The Fragile Bonds of Cross-Racial Friendship Cross-racial friendships broaden perspectives, reduce prejudice, and foster a more cohesive society. Studies show they deepen empathy, helping us challenge biases and see beyond stereotypes. But no number of books, marches, or movies can pierce the veil of privilege if white women aren’t willing to do the work. Black women continue to save democracy, even as we question if white women are tearing it down, piece by piece. The real issue isn’t about understanding anymore—it’s about accountability. Show me a white conservative woman who voted for Trump and then reached out to hear her Black friend’s fears and struggles. Go ahead. I’ll wait. Because the way they vote shows they are not worried about our feelings. They’re not losing sleep over how their votes undo the work we’ve spent generations building. A Question of Survival When silence becomes the default, the fractures in our friendship are no longer invisible. The wind whistles through those fissures, a reminder of what’s been left unsaid. With every divisive choice, the rifts widen. If friendship can’t withstand these challenges, it’s time to question what’s worth holding onto. Real friendship demands solidarity, not just when it’s easy but when it truly matters. And when you vote for someone who dog-whistles to white supremacists, I have to wonder: would you rather see me dead than equal?

Their allegiance is not to the Constitution of the United States but to Donald Trump, whom they do not so much admire as fear.\n\nOur Constitution is so obviously under attack, with one of the most basic tenets, that the “power of the purse” rests with Congress, being ignored by both Elon Musk and his puppet, Trump. The Republicans who control Congress are being controlled with the threat of “primary.” They lack the political courage to defend our Constitution.\n\nIf you receive Social Security benefits or get a paycheck, the U.S. Treasury has your Social Security number, your bank account information, and more, and now Musk and his minions have all that information. And the Republicans in Congress are fine with that. They lack the political courage to protect us.\n\nNancy Sanger, Longmont\n\nMusk volunteered to help taxpayers\n\nI find it very amusing that the Democrats are calling for the firing of Elon Musk. He isn’t an employee; he’s a volunteer. He takes no salary.\n\nCan you not find it in your hearts and minds to wonder why he is doing what he’s doing? He wants to make sure we get the most bang for our taxpayer dollars. He is finding massive frivolous spending, waste and fraud, which we have all railed against for years.\n\nWe have got to get government spending under control if we are to succeed as a country.

And “no” to his eventual control over a once-credible political party that, while it didn’t always check all my boxes, offered a much-needed balance to achieving a sustainable democracy.\n\nI said “no” with my vote, with honest discussions or comments when I felt I had to, and with service to my community. And for the past two months, yes, I have turned off the news while I attempt to reconcile what the hell just happened and how I go forward. What can I do to make a difference? I have lost friends over this.\n\nThere are many, I believe, who wake up, turn on the television, and laugh their keesters off because this is exactly what they want.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) argued that a new conflict of interest will arise if Musk and his team get access to classified information at the Pentagon since some of the information could be linked to Musk himself and his companies. The U.S. government has shelled out around $17 billion in federal contracts to Musk’s company SpaceX, according to a government website that tracks federal spending.\n\n“The serious conflict of interest ensures that there is no chance that DOGE will take any meaningful action to mitigate the right wing cultural war nonsense that Republicans have provisioned into the NDAA,” Omar said.\n\nAt the same time on Tuesday outside the Capitol, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) rallied with federal workers, union members, and labor activists at the American Federation of Government Employees, vowing to keep fighting until DOGE and Musk are kicked out of every federal agency. The fiery rally included calls from lawmakers to “f*** Donald Trump and Elon Musk.”\n\n“The attack on you, the attack on the civil service is unacceptable, unconscionable, un-American, and we are going to stand with you until each and every one of those unlawful executive orders are completely reversed,” Jeffries said. “Buried in the ground, never to rise again.”\n\nThe mixed messaging comes as top congressional Democrats have struggled to come up with a cohesive defense as they attempt to respond to the sheer volume of executive orders, personnel changes, and policy shifts since Trump took office less than a month ago.\n\nJon Reinish, a prominent Democratic strategist, compared Democrats’ response to Trump’s first weeks in office to former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed presidential campaign. \n\n“Like Harris, they’re switching messages every day so nothing sticks,” Reinish said.\n\nHe pointed to the Markey news conference on Tuesday, stressing it’s unclear what the Massachusetts Democrat is trying to accomplish with his “in the weeds civic lesson.”\n\n“It’s very disappointing to see Democrats … continue to be so out of touch when it comes to actually fighting for priorities and trying to reposition themselves in front of voters,” Reinish added.\n\nOthers in the party also questioned the strategy and worried that some Democrats appear to be on completely different pages.\n\n“It’s confusing. You have leadership condemning Musk and DOGE and their unilateral actions inside these federal agencies, but then you have this group of progressives saying DOGE why don’t you come and cut the Pentagon budget? It’s just counterproductive,” said a Senate Democratic aide speaking on the condition of anonymity. \n\n“There needs to be one unified message, repeated over and over and over. It’s a strategy that works — Republicans have used it successfully; look at their messaging on the border,” the person said. “When public perception is truly only one of the tools we have at the moment, it’s important we deploy it effectively.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) insisted that Democrats are unified when asked by the Washington Examiner about the discrepancies in strategies for combating Musk and DOGE.\n\n“We are on the same page; it ought to be done through the Congress and lawfully, not by an agency coming in and cutting. That’s unlawful. The overwhelming majority of courts have said it’s unlawful thus far, and that’s how it ought to be done,” Schumer said. “We have a rule of law, we have separation of powers; I’ve never seen it violated on such a massive scale, and that’s why the courts are undoing it.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen.

It is suing over the administration’s plans to reorganize the bureaucracy and suing to stop the administration’s deferred resignation offer for workers who do not want to return to the office. It is suing to block the administration’s efforts to shut down USAID. It is also suing to hinder the activities of the Department of Government Efficiency. “Federal employees are not the problem — they are the solution,” AFGE president Everett Kelley said.\n\nThe AFGE endorsed Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Congress in 2024.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers’ (UFCW) voter guide from the 2024 presidential election opposes Trump’s tax cuts, the one-in-two-out deregulation rule, and his rescission of a federal rule “designed to help narrow pay inequities based on race and gender.” It notes that Kamala Harris supported the inflationary American Rescue Plan Act, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, and student debt “cancellation.”\n\nThe UFCW endorsed Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Congress in 2024.\n\nInternational Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) president Jimmy Williams Jr. said his union would “do everything we possibly can to elect pro-union champions Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.” A statement after the 2024 election said that “a second Trump administration will be disastrous for members of the IUPAT and the entirety of the working class.” In a postelection interview with Jacobin, Williams criticized Democrats for “moving further right.” During Covid, the IUPAT went further than other unions and imposed a mask mandate on itself, rather than negotiating one with employers.\n\nThe IUPAT endorsed Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Congress in 2024.\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) participated in the media scare campaign about Project 2025. It told its members that the project, which the Trump administration did not endorse, represents “Trump’s plan to kill your union.” It also opposed Governor Ron DeSantis’s union reforms in Florida prohibiting automatic dues deduction and requiring recertification elections.\n\nThe IBEW endorsed Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Congress in 2024.\n\nAssociation of Flight Attendants (AFA) president Sara Nelson is among Trump’s most vigorous opponents. A political ally of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nelson is a pro-abortion zealot who stridently opposed the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The AFA lobbied for the introduction and extension of mask mandates during Covid, including for children as young as two years old.\n\nThe AFA endorsed Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Congress in 2024. It has also endorsed her for secretary of labor. Nelson said that Chavez-DeRemer “didn’t just sign on to labor issues: she led on many of them. This was one of the easiest endorsement decisions our policy committee has ever made.”\n\nIt should be equally easy for Republican senators to vote against her confirmation.\n\nChavez-DeRemer would make more sense as a token Republican in a Kamala Harris cabinet. During her one and only term in the House of Representatives, she supported the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, both of which would undo decades of Republican wins on labor policy. The PRO Act would repeal every state’s right-to-work law, and the PSFNA would require every state to recognize collective bargaining for all public sector workers.\n\nUnlike other controversial cabinet nominees, few Republican senators seem very energized about Chavez-DeRemer, except Senator Markwayne Mullin (Okla.). Mullin has reiterated his support for his state’s right-to-work law and opposition to the PRO Act while saying he nonetheless supports Chavez-DeRemer because she’ll do what Trump wants and her nomination “reflect[s] a growing GOP, and a winning coalition.”\n\nArguing that senators should ignore her entire labor policy record, not to mention her lack of qualifications for the job, simply because she’ll do what Trump wants is an abdication of the Senate’s advice and consent power. Republican senators need to stand up for their own states’ laws against a cabinet nominee who has in the past supported overriding them. Senator Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said he’d vote against Chavez-DeRemer and predicted she’d lose 15 Republican votes. She deserves to lose more.\n\nAs to the growing coalition, the union membership rate in the U.S. declined again last year and currently sits at an all-time low of 9.9 percent. Half of union members work for the government, and even in blue-collar occupations such as manufacturing and construction, 90 percent of workers are not union members. A majority of union members in the U.S. live in states without right-to-work laws, so the rate would likely be even lower if all workers had a choice.\n\nUnion members who voted for Donald Trump didn’t do so because he copied Democrats’ pro-union policies. Republicans should not echo the failed policies of the party the working class is leaving. They should not hitch their wagon to an organized labor movement that has been in decline for decades.\n\nNo matter how much some Republicans might want to wish it were otherwise, unions are still part of the resistance to Trump and fight against conservatives at the state level on issues from school choice to abortion.

But if that's what it takes to stay on Trump's good side and see to it California receives the federal wildfire relief it desperately needs — and tens of thousands of stricken Los Angeles-area residents deserve — then so be it. It's instinct in some political circles to scream and stomp and vent at every Trump provocation. That's one way to release tension, and it's not an unreasonable response to the horror show he's put on the last fortnight and a half. But, really, how politically productive has that been? It's not as though Trump kept his roughshod-running plans a secret during the presidential campaign. He still managed a clear-cut victory over Kamala Harris and even won the popular vote, though he fell shy of a 50% majority. That's not at all to suggest that capitulation is in order. Myriad legal fights are underway to check Trump's authoritarian actions, and California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, is among those who've worn a groove in the courthouse steps fighting Trump and his co-president, Elon Musk. By contrast, Newsom has chosen a more, shall we say, diplomatic approach, playing to Trump's puppylike need for constant praise and attention. The governor crashed the president's arrival when Trump flew into LAX last month to survey the fire damage in Pacific Palisades, and their forced encounter proved to be all bonhomie and bromance. An extended handshake. Shoulder clasps. “I appreciate the governor coming out and meeting me,” Trump said graciously, notwithstanding the lack of an invitation. “Thank you for being here,\" Newsom offered demurely. \"It means a great deal.” Last week, the two huddled in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, a session that touched on wildfire recovery aid and California's pushback against Trump, among other issues. Afterward, Newsom described their get-together as “real and substantive” and “positive.” “There’s a familiarity and there was a relationship that was born of a crisis around COVID,” Newsom told Taryn Luna of The Times' Sacramento bureau, noting how Trump delivered for California during the pandemic. “I wanted to go back to that space.” The fact that Trump chose to leave the first, last and only public word on their meeting to Newsom — or \"Newscum,\" as the president has childishly called him — said a great deal about the current state of their relationship. Of course, none of the blandishment would be necessary if Trump, in a heartless break with precedent, hadn't threatened to withhold disaster relief until he obtains certain political concessions: a needless overhaul of California's elections system and more water for his political benefactors in the state's farm country. But that's the world we're living in. And who knows how long the Newsom-Trump detente will last. A “large-scale” immigration enforcement action reportedly planned soon for the Los Angeles area will surely test their political cease-fire. Inevitably, every move that Newsom makes is weighed against his perceived presidential ambitions. That's silly for any number of reasons, not least the fact the campaign is political light-years away. As Lis Smith, a national Democratic campaign strategist, suggested, \"Anyone viewing this through the lens of politics in 2028 probably needs to log off.\" (For those holding their breath, the next presidential election isn't for another 1,363 days.) That said, one of very best things Newsom could do for his presidential hopes is oversee a smashingly successful recovery from January's firestorm, one of those epic crises that could very well make or break political careers. \"The most important thing for any governor or any candidate for any office,\" Smith observed, \"is that they do a good job.\" Once the Democratic nominating contest begins, candidates will surely face a litmus test gauging just how fiercely anti-Trump each has been. It's not hard to imagine some bristling at Newsom's accommodation of this most transactional of presidents, or seizing on the kind things the governor has said about Trump and using that flattery against him. But Newsom is doing precisely what he should, setting aside any personal animus and political ambition for the aid and comfort of those he was elected to serve. He shouldn't be made to eat those words.","summary":"Rather than confronting Trump, California's governor is showing restraint and using flattery to ensure the state gets the federal disaster relief it needs and deserves.

One pay stub, which was seen by the Guardian, showed that a Mexican worker was paid about $38 per day, plus a weekly bonus of about $225 before taxes. Separately, they were also paid daily food expenses.\n\nIn comparison, a former warehouse worker, who is American, said based on his experience, Uline’s American warehouse staff were earning between $30 to $35 per hour when he left the company in 2023. The American workers also received health insurance and 401(k) benefits.\n\nMost Uline warehouse positions in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania currently pay between $25 and $35 per hour, with some offering as much as $38 per hour, according to postings on the job listing website Indeed.com.\n\nThe new revelations follow a story the Guardian published in December, about a so-called “shuttle program” at the company, which Uline used to bring workers from its warehouses in Mexico to its warehouses in the US, especially Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Mexican workers traveled to the US using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who enter the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas, and not for regular work. Sources with direct knowledge of the matter alleged the Mexican employees stayed for one to six months and performed normal work at the company.\n\nUline, the shipping supply company that made $8bn in revenue in 2024, has 13 distribution centers and employs more than 9,000 people across the US, Mexico and Canada. The company’s founders are Dick and Liz Uihlein. Dick Uihlein has established himself as a billionaire mega-donor, giving tens of millions to rightwing candidates and political causes. Liz Uihlein is also a conservative donor. Federal Election Commission reports show they collectively gave $130m in support of Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle. One television advertisement funded by Dick Uihlein’s Super Pac, Restoration Pac, during the 2024 presidential election attacked the then Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, for allowing an immigrant “invasion” at the US-Mexico border.\n\nUline has declined to respond to the Guardian’s questions about its shuttle program. It is unclear whether the program is still in place or has been discontinued.\n\nSince the Guardian’s December publication of that story, additional sources have come forward to talk about their own experience at the company.\n\nOne person who had participated in the shuttle program told the Guardian that employees at Uline’s Mexico facilities were encouraged to enroll in the program amid US workforce shortages during the pandemic. The source, who declined to be named due to concerns about retaliation by the company, said he had traveled to the US on a tourist visa.\n\nUline “sold” Mexican employees on the promise of independence, leisure travel and weekly bonuses if they participated, he said.\n\nBut the terms of the arrangement were stressful, he said: employees understood they would be traveling to work in US warehouses, but they were instructed to tell immigration officials they were traveling strictly for training purposes and were given paperwork from Uline claiming the same.\n\nIn reality, “we did the same work we do here in [Mexico],” he said. “You knew you were going to work, they even told you that – but they told us to say that we were training so that we didn’t get in trouble.”\n\nMaking the trip from Mexico to the US could be stressful for those workers who understood that they were entering the US misrepresenting the nature of their travel, sources told the Guardian. There were also incidents when, they said, border officials seemed suspicious of the travel and stopped them for questioning, though the sources who spoke to the Guardian said there were no major incidents.\n\n“I was a little worried,” the person said. “They were detaining them in the airport, and asking a lot of questions.”\n\nTwo other former Uline workers, who are non-Hispanic Americans and also asked not to be named, described other aspects of working for the company that made them uncomfortable. Both alleged that the company relied not only on full-time staff from both the US and Mexico, but also on a significant number of temporary workers who were contracted through an agency in Wisconsin. The former Uline workers alleged in independent accounts that these temporary workers were exposed to frigid and sometimes freezing temperatures in the warehouse without being allowed to wear jackets, hats or gloves.\n\nUline’s permanent warehouse workers, one former employee said, had to wear a uniform of a red Uline polo, blue zip-up jacket, blue work pants and single-color shoes. In the winter, the permanent staff could wear a fleece and a thin hat, but not a thicker coat.\n\nThe temporary contracted staff, who were mostly Hispanic, were given only a vest that said Uline.\n\n“They weren’t allowed to wear hats or gloves of any kind, because the manager said it broke code. There were times, in winter in Wisconsin, when it’s single digits at night,” the person said. “And if they got caught wearing them, they were told to take them off. If they were caught a second time, they were told to go home and then wouldn’t come back.”\n\nThe person added: “They did not treat them like human beings.”\n\nThe person, who worked for Uline for about four years, recalled that one night when it was “absolutely frigid” – about -6F – he and a co-worker grabbed some extra fleece jackets that were on a table designated for Uline staff and brought them to the temporary contracted workers, only to be “screamed at” by a manager.\n\n“I told him I didn’t care and to write me up because it was -6. It didn’t even make sense. It is unethical,” the person said.\n\nAnother former worker independently corroborated the account, saying he had worked at multiple warehouse sites, but that no workers were treated as badly as temporary workers were treated at Uline.\n\n“Worse than any job I have ever seen in my life,” he said. There were frequent injuries related to the cold, he added.\n\n“You would see their hands, they could barely move their fingers and they had to work through it. They couldn’t just stop and take a break,” he said. Workers, he added, were easily replaceable, especially temporary staff.\n\n“There was a temp who had his foot run over, [and] he couldn’t tell management. He worked through it because he had a family to feed,” he said.\n\nUline did not respond to questions about the former workers’ claims about the treatment of temporary workers.\n\n Do you have a tip on this story?

That refusal has plunged the nation into a constitutional crisis caused by a president who, in his quest for total power, has discarded both the Congress and the courts. He is aiming to transfer the billions of dollars in public funds approved by Congress to meet the people’s needs and transfer the money into the pockets of his billionaire pals.\n\nThe lockouts are being enforced by individuals from mysterious police forces who, in Nazi brown-shirt style, are literally standing in doorways, barring anyone from the public from entering the public buildings. Sycophant Republicans are calling for the impeachment of the judges trying to enforce democratic rule, not Trump.\n\nAlso in defiance of court orders he is barring federal workers and even elected lawmakers from entering the buildings in which they do the work of operating critical federal agencies. No agency, not even the Consumer Finance Protection operation, the EPA, or cancer research have escaped his slash and burn operation. By cutting those operations often local economies will suffer because of the job producing and economy boosting impact of those programs in communities across the country.\n\nThe government workers Trump and Musk are attempting to roll over, however, are refusing, to remain silent. They have been gathering across the country, including in Washington DC itself to resist. The Government Employees (AFGE) announced here that they have crafted a five-pronged plan to stop the scorched-earth destruction of federal workers and programs by worker-hating, union-hating and government-hating Donald Trump, union President Clarence Kelley says.\n\nAnd marshalling public support, by pointing out how the deep slashes in government personnel and services will endanger the public—producing everything from unsafe airplanes to unsafe chickens—will be a key part of it. That danger is nationwide, says Kelley. “It doesn’t matter what the colour of the state is”—red for Republican, blue for Democratic and purple for swing. “If the chicken is bad, it’s bad.”Kelley began his keynote address to the hundreds of delegates gathered at a legislative conference here by trashing Trump, even while admitting later that approximately 30% of his members had voted for the convicted felon.\n\n“This president has contempt for the rule of law, for the Constitution and for our democracy,” Kelley declared. “We in AFGE are on the front lines” of saving all three. Otherwise, “they’re coming after us,” referring to Trump, his puppeteer, multibillionaire Elon Musk, the Trumpite MAGA forces and Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) hit squad of age 22-something numbers crunchers.\n\n“And then they’re coming after you,” meaning the rest of the country. “But they only win if we let them” do so. “We cannot be bullied unless we let them bully us. We cannot be silenced unless we let them silence us…Musk is a travesty and DOGE is a scam.”“We’re in a very trying time, but if we continue to stand strong and stand together, we will prevail,” union president Kelley declared.\n\nWhether that will actually occur is still very much an open question. The unions’ normal allies, congressional Democrats, influenced by big givers and campaign dollars, have waffled. So has the Democratic leadership, notably Senate leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. He sent a mild “we are with you” video to the conference.\n\nAnd the criminal corporate class is enthusiastic about Trump’s dictatorial plans to reduce the government’s size and reach. Such cuts would allow the plutocrats to run roughshod over the rest of us. One conference speaker said they could turn workers into slaves again.\n\nKelley unveiled the plan on the first full day, February 10, of the union’s annual legislative conference in D.C., and his members are following up with a mass march on Congress, joined by the Professional and Technical Engineers, other unions, the Jewish Labour Committee and worker allies.\n\nAFGE members will then fan out through the Capitol, lobbying lawmakers to preserve public services in the face of massive pressure from Trump and his handler, multibillionaire Elon Musk, to cut them.\n\nCongressional Democrats addressing the conferees were supportive, as was the sole Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa. But he admitted he has a selling job to do on his side of the aisle to overcome myths and lies—propagated, though he didn’t say so, by Republicans going back to Ronald Reagan and extending through Trump—about federal workers.\n\n“I’ve been trying to educate my fellow Republicans. There is a stigma attached to federal employees. They don’t know what you do behind the scenes” to keep the country going, Fitzpatrick said. “I’ve been nailing down the facts and clarifying the law.”\n\nThe latest cuts loom at the Labour Department, the Veterans Affairs Department, and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, site of a late-afternoon demonstration and a MAGA invasion February 10.\n\nA federal judge in D.C. refused to stop—at least for now—the raids by Trump’s partner in crime, multibillionaire Elon Musk, and his 22-somethings at DOL. They’re snooping through union records, OSHA enforcement records, wage and hour violations, including those by Musk’s firms, and visas for temporary farm workers and for skilled foreign workers, such as baseball players.\n\nTrump Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, a key crafter of Trump’s radical right party platform, aka Project 2025, named himself the CFPB Director, called Musk’s brigade in to rifle the files seeking data on enforcement against malefactors, and planned to shut it down.\n\nThe five-part plan Kelley discussed was also taken up by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016. Kaine handily beat a Trump-picked foe last November. The first step, said both Kelley and Kaine, is to contest Trump’s illegal and/or unconstitutional moves in court. Unions and their allies have filed at least 36 lawsuits against Trump’s schemes. And the deep-blue California legislature just approved Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for $25 million in spending on lawyers to contest Trump plans.\n\nThe lawsuits have already produced some wins against the misogynist convicted felon’s schemes to trash, lay off and fire federal workers, but also Trump’s proposal to round up, incarcerate and deport people Trump calls “illegal immigrants” and worse.\n\nUnion contracts backstop many of the lawsuits, with clauses Trump illegally violates, such as by imposing mandatory back-to-work schemes or negotiating over the union’s head with illegal direct offers of “buyouts”—for which there may be no money after March 14.“If they don’t follow the law, the contracts and the regulations” concerning layoffs, “we’ll file unfair labour practices” charges, the official name for labour law-breaking. That will be followed by grievances and lawsuits, Kelley added. In practice, Trump’s federal ICE raiders are rounding up anyone with a brown skin, legal or not, migrant or not, on streets, dragging people out of cars after routine traffic stops, and raiding schools, churches and hospitals.\n\nThe second prong of the stop-Trump schemes involve using all available tools to tie up Congress in knots so it can’t enact Trump’s plans, despite its Republican majorities in both houses. In an interview after his own speech to the conference, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said that would include using parliamentary tactics to hamstring the Senate—everything from frequent quorum calls to objecting to unanimous consent demands on routine legislation to filibusters, such as a 30-hour talkathon the 47 Democrats conducted against Vought. Ultimately, though, they couldn’t stop him and lost party-line, 53-47.\n\nBut Van Hollen also said the Republican-run House is vulnerable to stoppages, too. The GOP controls it by a 220-215 margin, including three vacant Republican-held seats up for special elections so far this year. And MAGA members of that majority, Van Hollen said, are quarrelling constantly with more traditional, practical and business-oriented Republicans.\n\nThe third part of the defeat-Trump plan is to rely on the states, especially blue states, to intervene and assert both states’ rights and take over responsibilities Trump demands the feds dump. Several governors, including Illinois’s J.B. Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, are already doing that.\n\nThe fourth and fifth parts of the stop-Trump plan go hand-in-hand: Activism and education by union members and their allies aimed at the rest of the electorate, including Trump voters. They voted for Trump, “but they didn’t vote for this,” Kelley said. And, then, after two years of campaigning and pointing out the practical effects of the cuts, defeat of the MAGAites in 2026.“This is a slow-moving avalanche,” unlike 2017 when Trump’s first win drew the massive women’s march into D.C.’s streets days after his inauguration.\n\nOne part of the avalanche is moving faster than the others, though: Unionization. AFGE, which had just over 300,000 members at the end of last year, set a goal of 325,000 net for the end of this year. In practice, Kelley said, that means it must recruit two new people for every retiree. But since voters elected Trump by a plurality—not a majority—over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s VP, the phones have been ringing off the hook at the union.\n\nIn December, Kelley reported, when the union usually loses members to end-of-the-year retirements, it gained about 1,000 members. In January, February and other months, it usually gains a net of 800-900 monthly. January’s figure topped 8,000, staffers reported to Kelley, and February’s is already at 8,264.

Brewer and his Jack Brewer Foundation have years of experience working in impoverished areas of the world like Haiti, Malawi and Central America, which Brewer said has allowed him to work closer than most and interact with the returning families. While it is President Donald Trump and border czar Tom Homan enforcing U.S. law and deporting illegal immigrants, Brewer said it is clear former President Joe Biden’s \"broken\" policies are truly to blame for the heartache and hardship. \"Three years ago, I started to follow the fatherlessness crisis that is happening right here in Guatemala, where a lot of men were leaving their households and coming to Joe Biden’s open borders – and just seeing it literally devastate families.\" CHARITY LEADERS SLAM BIDEN ADMIN RESPONSE TO US PLANES SHOT IN HAITI AMID CHAOS Brewer said Guatemala was losing much of its workforce and that a lot of those poor families trying to get to the U.S. actually did not know a \"legal\" immigration route existed, and they instead took the cartels and others at their word and paid thousands of dollars to be trafficked north. \"They’ve been told by coyotes and different people that you can just come [to the U.S.], and if you come here, if you bring your child, they'll just let you in,\" Brewer said. \"And so, you know, there's a huge education gap there on the ground.\" Brewer also met with Raul Berrios from CONAMIGUA – the National Council for Attention to Migrants of Guatemala – as well as Sergio Samuel Vela-Lopez, head of the Guatemala Penitentiary Department. Berrios, Lopez and others are trying to create an effective system for welcoming the migrants and processing those who are innocent families versus those who may have criminal records or other issues requiring government attention, according to Brewer.

Some buses, however, have been hired to take migrants closer to home, and Brewer visited one of them and spoke to its driver. \"It’s really a unique perspective, I think, and just some of the things that we've witnessed since we've been here,\" he said, adding stories ranged from familial hardships to reports that more than a dozen people have been burnt alive by Mexican cartels for failing to pay for passage. \"It’s just pretty tough to see and witness and watch.\" When a U.S. military plane arrived carrying migrants, Brewer was on the tarmac.

Then-Vice President Kamala Harris made her own trip to Guatemala City in March 2024, seeking to understand the \"root causes\" of illegal migration. \"When you look at the root causes, we're also looking at issues of corruption. Again, we're looking at the issue of climate resiliency and then the concern about a lack of economic opportunity,\" Harris said in 2021. Brewer rejected that Harris’ work made any difference, saying she and her then-boss’s policies \"empowered human traffickers\" and that half of Guatemala still lives in extreme poverty with little education. He said the former leadership at the State Department \"misguided resources\" through USAID, a practice that Trump is now aggressively cutting back on. \"We need to first put our resources into addressing the issues that are fueling a multibillion-dollar human trafficking industry.

During the Biden administration, Vice President Kamala Harris was tasked with leading diplomacy in Latin America to tackle the root causes, identified as issues like gang violence, climate change and poverty. It consisted of both government initiatives and funding from private organizations. USAID, which was frozen in recent days over concerns about misspending, played a key role in the distribution of funds. While certain operations have been halted to get a full picture of USAID funding to the region, it is possible to get a glimpse of the help it provided. JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP FROM PLACING 2,200 USAID WORKERS ON LEAVE In 2021, the first year of the Biden administration, USAID announced Centroamérica Local, a 5-year, $300 million initiative that funded organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to address the root causes of migration to the U.S. \"Under this new initiative, Centroamérica Local, USAID intends to invest up to $300 million, subject to the availability of funds, toward engaging, strengthening, and funding local organizations to implement programs to advance sustainable and equitable economic growth, improve governance, fight corruption, protect human rights, improve citizen security, and combat sexual and gender-based violence,\" USAID said in a statement at the time. \"These programs are being carried out under the Biden-Harris Administration’s Root Causes Strategy and deliver on the Agency’s goal to foster greater engagement with local organizations and communities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras and advance stability in the region.\" More was still to come. TOP DEM STRATEGISTS WARN USAID FUNDING FIGHT IS A ‘TRAP’ FOR THE PARTY In 2022, USAID announced programs in Central America to end gender-based violence, including a $6.5 million program in Guatemala and a $2.7 million program in Honduras. That built off a program announced in El Salvadaor. In March last year, Harris met with Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo and announced a planned investment of $135 million in USAID funding, alongside $170 million to aid development, economic health and security assistance. Included in the announcement was an expansion of the Central American Service Corps, which was created in 2022 at the Summit of Americas. The expanded program was funded by USAID and aimed to reach 2,800 people seen at most risk of migrating by engaging them with volunteer work, employment and training. Also announced for Guatemala was a USAID-implemented \"Feed the Future\" program to strengthen the capacity of research and education entities to scale agricultural technologies and to support research and education related to \"climate smart\" agriculture. USAID was also to implement a new \"Guatemala Biodiversity Conservation\" program to promote the conservation of biodiversity and strengthen protected areas and other areas of ecological importance. In September, USAID announced an additional $10.75 million in funding for Guatemala. USAID STAFFERS STUNNED, ANGERED BY TRUMP ADMIN'S DOGE SHUTDOWN OF $40B AGENCY That came after USAID invested over $153 million in Guatemala in 2023 to allegedly support the government in efforts to strengthen democracy and improve opportunities. According to a release, funded activities included \"integrated rural and agricultural development, sustainable economic growth, support for the construction of climate-resilient infrastructure, and digital development and e-governance.\" Harris was dogged by the \"border czar\" title throughout her unsuccessful presidential bid as she largely dropped the root causes emphasis and instead focused on the Biden administration’s efforts to secure the border. President Donald Trump’s administration has demonstrated a skepticism of the root causes strategy, both in its leaning in on border security and interior enforcement and also its moves to cut or freeze funding abroad.

And it came from the Progressive Conservative government of Doug Ford, who has been given the moniker \"Captain Canada\" by some journalists and pundits — and become an unofficial advocate for the entire country.\n\n\"I think to an extent he has,\" said Lori Turnbull, a political science professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \"Ford has moved into what some have described as a kind of leadership vacancy.\"\n\nThis new role comes at an opportune time, at the midpoint of a snap Ontario election campaign that Ford triggered, and allows him to avoid talking about issues where he's vulnerable, such as health care and education, Turnbull said.\n\n\"The argument can be made that he botched those files. Instead of defending his record as a premier, he's going to the U.S. and acting like a prime minister,\" she said. \"This is absolutely at the heart of his strategy for a third term.\n\n\"If it weren't for the threat of tariffs ... I think that the issues of health care and education would be higher on people's lists So I think it would probably be a rocky campaign for him if he wasn't able to go to Washington.\"\n\nFord has launched charm offensive\n\nOn Tuesday, Ford was back at it in Washington, D.C., to make his case against tariffs to U.S. lawmakers. It's a role he assumed as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself somewhat distracted by internal party squabbling that eventually led to an announcement of his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader.\n\nSince December, in the wake of Trump's announcement of his intention to slap 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imported goods, Ford has launched what appears to be a charm offensive. He's made the rounds of U.S. media, including interviews on CNN, Fox News and NBC's Meet The Press, talking about the critical minerals and goods the U.S. imports from Canada and how tariffs threaten the mutually beneficial trading relationship.\n\nFord wore a \"Canada Is Not For Sale\" ball cap during a meeting with Trudeau and other premiers in Ottawa last month. He has also preached Canadian unity, saying the provinces need to stick together to combat the threat, and scolded Alberta Premier Danielle Smith for refusing to sign a joint statement the prime minister and all other premiers agreed to about how to respond to Trump.\n\nSome columnists and observers have branded Ford \"Captain Canada.\" Following the election call in Ontario, the BBC wrote on its website: Ontario's 'Captain Canada' calls snap election as Trump tariff threat looms.\n\nBut when it comes to championing Canada, Ford may be uniquely positioned to do so, Turnbull said.\n\n\"Ford is able to come at this in a different way. He has that kind of folksy authenticity,\" she said. \"He's able to go into a room with a 'Canada's Not For Sale' hat, and people look at him and say, 'Look at that, like, he's so patriotic, he's standing up for Canada.'\"\n\nIf Trudeau did that, the public wouldn't have the same reaction, Turnbull said. \"He wouldn't have the same authenticity.\"\n\nFord has taken on this role in part because he chairs the Council of the Federation, an advocacy organization for all of the provincial and territorial premiers, Turnbull said.\n\n\"I think because he's the leader of the biggest province — that's not nothing,\" she said.\n\nTariff issue 'clear crisis in people's minds'\n\nThe tariff issue will also make it more difficult for his political opponents, said David Coletto, founder and CEO of Abacus Data, a polling and market research firm based in Ottawa.\n\n\"In a crisis, people often rally around their leader. And this is a clear crisis in people's minds. So that already makes it harder for the opposition parties to get any oxygen in an arena where Trump is sucking it all up,\" he said. \"And Ford has the natural advantage of being the guy who has the job right now.\"\n\nColetto said that according to his firm's polling, if the No. 1 ballot question becomes who is best to take on Trump, Ford and his party run well ahead of the Liberals and the New Democrats, whose leaders have argued that Ford's trip to Washington is inappropriate during an election campaign.\n\n\"When we asked people: Of the party leaders, who's best to stand up to a bully, Doug Ford wins by a huge margin over the other other two main party leaders. So this is where he wants the election to be about,\" Coletto said.\n\n\"It's I think why he called the early election. He saw the opportunity. And his visit to Washington [on Tuesday] is just building on his attempt to try to focus attention on that as opposed to anything else.\"\n\nStill, Trudeau remains prime minister, and having more than one political leader as public spokesperson on the tariff issue could prove problematic.\n\n\"Multiple Canadian voices dilute the message, giving more space for Trump to dominate the story,\" Gary Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CBC News in an email.\n\n\"Better for a single strong spokesperson to represent Canada,\" he said, adding that Trudeau is \"by far the most plausible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ford's role as Captain Canada came under some scrutiny when it was discovered he was pleased that Trump, a Republican, had won the U.S. presidential election over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Captain Canada has no clothes,\" former Liberal deputy prime minister Sheila Copps wrote in a column for the Hill Times.\n\n\"Doug Ford lost that standing when it was revealed last week in a leaked hot microphone recording that he was a huge Trump fan who celebrated when Donald Trump was victorious.\"\n\n(Ford had said that while he was \"100 per cent\" happy Trump won, \"then the guy pulled out the knife and f--king yanked it into us.\")\n\nColetto, of Abacus Data, said that it could still be a vulnerability for Ford, depending on how many people become aware of it, But Turnbull dismissed the suggestion. \"Who did anybody think he was going to support in the presidential election? I didn't think he supported Harris,\" she said.\n\n\"I think what he said is exactly what I would have thought had happened. [Ford] supported Trump and then he knifed him with tariffs. So now he doesn't support him.\"","summary":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who's in the middle of a provincial election campaign, has been given the moniker 'Captain Canada,' becoming an unofficial advocate for the entire country as it faces off against Donald Trump's tariffs.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doug-ford-captain-canada-tariffs-trump-1.7456440?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7456574.1739323744!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/ont-us-inauguration-20250119.jpg?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 09:00:00","author":"Mark Gollom","authors":["Mark Gollom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.003},{"id":289614956,"title":"Trump Extends Election Denial To His 2024 Victory In Bonkers Chat With Fox","text":"Dude can’t even accept an election victory without questioning it.

While I tend to irrationally object to every single thing he does.\n\nWell, maybe not so irrationally. But today, tell me how you feel about the latest sweeps to save money by shutting down humanitarian aid overseas and offering buyouts to the entire CIA workforce.\n\nBret Stephens: I’m not pro-Trump. He scares me. There are days when I wake up and think: If this goes on like this for four years, or even four months, we’re going to be living in an unrecognizable republic — one in which lickspittle Republican legislators and Cabinet members rubber stamp every crazy Trump idea, federal court decisions are simply ignored by the executive branch, Elon Musk creates a Department of Personal Efficiency (DOPE) that tracks and scores your every move, and a booming economy keeps a majority of voters indifferent to the collapse of civic and constitutional norms. We saw that model play out in the early years of Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship in Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s rule in Turkey.\n\nGail: I do like that Musk idea — not the actual agency, just the part about calling it DOPE.\n\nBret: But today I’m in the mood to provoke our readers a little. And the truth is I just don’t disagree with every single policy of Trump’s. With regards to the U.S. Agency for International Development, I’ve always had my misgivings about the way the United States delivers aid, often via self-dealing contractors to corrupt countries, and often making our supposed beneficiaries more corrupt and less self-reliant. As for the CIA, it’s not going to be abolished in this presidency or any other. Though I’m a little surprised to hear so many liberals spring to the agency’s defense.\n\nThat said, the way the Trump administration has essentially tried to shutter USAID overnight, stranding employees, cutting off critical health care programs and getting blocked by courts, is reckless, capricious and cruel. We need to rethink and reform aid delivery, not destroy it. The same goes for all the other agencies and programs to which Musk is taking a hatchet instead of a scalpel.\n\nGail: Pretty hard to argue with reform-not-destroy. Although it definitely depends on the character of the so-called reformers.\n\nBret: The federal government isn’t some tech startup where you move fast and break things.\n\nGail: You know I never argue foreign policy, Bret, but when Trump announced that he thought the United States should take over the Gaza Strip and “own it,” that struck me less as an issue of international affairs than another deeply scary sign that our president is just nuts.\n\nBret: Other than the fact that the United States will not own Gaza, I have no idea what Trump meant by it — and I’m not sure he does, either. But I also think it’s smarter to view some of his wilder utterances not as serious policy proposals but as entry points to negotiation. I’m glad Trump seems like he won’t countenance Hamas’ survival as the ruling regime in Gaza. And I don’t think it’s wrong to ask a dependent dictator like Egypt’s Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who failed to prevent Hamas from arming itself to the teeth before the war, to not wall out Palestinians in Gaza while the area is rebuilt.\n\nGail: As I said, not doing foreign policy. Let’s move back home.\n\nBret: The larger point is that Trump is asking for fresh thinking about a conflict where all the supposed solutions have been tried and failed. And he’s insisting we think anew about what the government does and how it operates abroad and at home. For instance, what is there to say about the Department of Education after 45 years of failing to improve educational standards?\n\nGail: The Department of Education has a lot of responsibilities, and if you want to argue that it’s failing on some, feel free. But the missions are themselves so important. Some agency has to keep an eye on student loans, which in their worst forms bankrupted recipients who were totally misled about what they could expect to gain from a very expensive, definitely useless-to-borderline-crooked program.\n\nI’d go on here, but since it would take 60 senators to abolish the department, I’m just adding this to all the government services Trump is going to try to ruin rather than improve.\n\nBret: Gail, if it were up to me I’d get the government out of the business of student loans entirely. We have driven generations of students into debt on the dubious promise that a college education is the right choice for everyone. Meanwhile, decades of federal investments in K-12 education, and bad brainstorms like President George W. Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act yielded pathetic results, especially for minority children. If liberals want to regain their traditional polling advantage over conservatives on education, they need to have an idea that’s more than just about throwing more billions of dollars at the problem.\n\nGail: We’ll have to continue the education discussion over this new year. Let’s talk Cabinet appointments. Trump has been getting pretty much what he wants. But the Republican majority in the House and Senate is so narrow, the House especially, that I can’t imagine them always sticking together when Congress has to begin its regular business. Do you agree? And where do you think we’ll see the first break?\n\nBret: The GOP? They’re not going to break. If they’re willing to confirm Cabinet picks like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., then they’ll go along with absolutely anything. That’s what scares me: Congress has ceased to think of itself as a coequal branch of government, and congressional Republicans have turned themselves into footstools for the president.\n\nThat means Democrats need to get their act together for the midterms. But if their central strategy is to just wait for the country to turn on Trump, I don’t think they’ll get very far. What’s your advice to them?\n\nGail: Well, there are plenty of issues to run on. On global warming, the Republicans are betraying generations to come by embracing the “Drill, baby, drill” theory of energy policy. Tax cuts for the rich don’t make sense to most Americans, and they reduce revenue to shore up programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and, yes, education.\n\nBret: It’s not for me to tell Democrats what they should run on. But I’ll never tire of suggesting what they should run from. They need to make a clean, loud, vocal, convincing break from the most progressive fringes of their party. Bail reform. Drug decriminalization. Defunding of police. De facto open borders. Sanctuary cities. Biological males in girls’ sports. Identity politics — including the excesses of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. All this stuff has left the Democratic brand politically radioactive.\n\nGail: You don’t have to be in a fringe to want to make sure everybody who’s arrested but not yet convicted of anything should have an equal opportunity to stay out of jail until their trial. And I don’t think most Democrats are pressing for de facto open borders. As we were saying earlier, there’s a difference between wanting to make something better and wanting to get rid of it.\n\nBret: People would be alive today in places like Waukesha, Wisconsin, if easy bail hadn’t let dangerous people return to the street. Democrats also need to replace incompetent progressives with competent liberals, especially at the municipal and state level. That may at last be happening with San Francisco’s new mayor, Daniel Lurie, who’s pledging to clean up the downtown after years of decline.\n\nI wonder if it might happen at the state level, too. Any thoughts about whether Kamala Harris should run for governor?\n\nGail: I would like to see how Harris does in a race where she has to compete in a tough open primary to get the nomination. She was a mediocre presidential candidate because the job got dumped on her at the last minute, but she never struck me as dim or inept.\n\nBret: Dim? I wouldn’t know. But inept? Beyond inept. If California thinks that what it most needs is more high-tax, high-regulation, high-cost, low-delivery governance of the sort that every year drives hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, along with some of its most valuable companies, from the state, then she’s the perfect candidate. Democrats need a different state to model a different kind of governance. Like Kentucky, or North Carolina, or hey, Kansas, which has a Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, who believes in balanced budgets, immigration enforcement — and the right to choose. She’s in her second term.\n\nOn a cheerier note, Gail: the Super Bowl. Who knew?\n\nGail: Hey, I always did like Philadelphia, but given the recent election saga, I can’t say I was in the mood for another whopping, nothing-but-despair-for-the-losers outcome.\n\n— Bret Stephens and Gail Collins are columnists with The New York Times.","summary":"Gail Collins: Bret, we’ve spent so much time agreeing about President Donald Trump, it’s been great — at least for argument’s sake — that you can come up with specific presidential actions where you’re now pro-Trump.
