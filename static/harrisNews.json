The UK has a shortage of such dedicated disposal sites (Image credit: Jean-Christophe Verhaegen / AFP / Getty Images) By Chas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK published 17 September 2024 \"Not in my backyard\" is a term normally used in conversations about proposed new housing or rail lines, but a version of it could soon be heard about one of the most dangerous materials on the planet. Nuclear power stations are filling up with radioactive waste, so \"swathes\" of the highly dangerous material are set to be \"buried in the English countryside\", said The Telegraph. For local communities, it isn't so much \"not in my backyard\" as \"not under my backyard\", said the Financial Times. '100,000 years of hazard' Sellafield, in Cumbria, is the \"temporary home to the vast majority of the UK's radioactive nuclear waste\", said the BBC, \"as well as the world's largest stockpile of plutonium\". It's stuck there because no long-term, high-level waste facilities have been created to deal with it. Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up The \"highly radioactive material\" releases energy that can infiltrate and damage the cells in our bodies, Claire Corkhill, professor of radioactive waste management at the University of Bristol, told the broadcaster, and \"it remains hazardous for 100,000 years\". The permanent plan to handle the waste currently at Sellafield is to first build a designated 650ft-deep pit to store it. Although the contentious matter of its location has yet to be agreed, the facility will hold some of the 5 million tonnes of waste generated by nuclear power stations over the past seven decades. Then, in the second half of the century, a much deeper geological disposal site will be dug, which will hold the UK's \"most dangerous waste\", such as plutonium, said The Telegraph. The problem is only going to get bigger because nuclear power is a central part of the government's mission for \"clean power by 2030\" and \"more nuclear power means more nuclear waste\", said the BBC. With at least three new nuclear power stations planned, said The Telegraph, the country will quickly be \"at odds with\" the 1976 review of nuclear waste policy by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which warned the UK was amassing nuclear waste so fast that it should stop building reactors until it had a solution. 'Poison portal' Some believe part of that solution will be found overseas. Earlier this year, there were warnings that Australia could become a \"poison portal\" for the UK and US as a result of a new three-nation defence pact called Aukus. The original wording of the agreement would allow for facilities to be created to dispose of waste from \"Aukus submarines\", which could have included UK and US vessels. Dave Sweeney, the Australian Conservation Foundation's nuclear free campaigner, warned at the time that Aukus partners could see Australia as \"a little bit of a radioactive terra nullius\". After pushback, the Australian government added a loophole to the legislation to \"ensure Australia will not become a dumping ground for nuclear waste\", said The Guardian. But the Australian Greens' defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the changes did not go far enough. The amendment only addresses high-level radioactive waste, he said, and \"still allows the US and UK to dump intermediate-level waste, and Australian high-level waste, anywhere in Australia\".

Here’s What a New Poll Says","text":"Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris has not affected voter’s opinion on the 2024 presidential election, a new poll says. Per a new ABC News/Ipsos poll posted by The Hill, 81 percent of voters surveyed said Swift’s support for Vice President Harris will not influence how they vote. Only six percent said they are more likely to vote for Harris since Swift’s post, and 13 percent said it makes them less likely to do so. Swift took to social media last week to voice her support for the Harris campaign. Swift expressed her admiration for Harris, calling her a “steady-handed, gifted leader” and a “warrior” for causes including LGBTQ+ rights and women’s reproductive freedoms. She also called out Donald Trump for posting fake AI images that had falsely suggested she supported him. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” she said about the doctored images. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Swift signed her Instagram post as “Childless Cat Lady,” aimed at Trump’s VP candidate JD Vance, who used that description to demean Democratic leaders without children.","summary":"A new poll shows if Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris has affected voter’s opinion on the 2024 presidential election.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-impact-voters-a-new-poll-says-1235777093/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/taylor-swift-eras-tour-wembley-8-15-2024-billboard-gp2-espanol-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:36:35","author":"Rania Aniftos","authors":["Rania Aniftos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":256565280,"title":"Theodora Gaïtas formally takes oath as Minnesota’s newest Supreme Court justice","text":"The newest member of the Minnesota Supreme Court formally took her seat on the bench Monday during an investiture ceremony. Associate Justice Theodora Gaïtas was sworn in at the Minnesota History Center in St. Paul. “I am honored to stand before you today to pledge my commitment to serving the people of Minnesota as an associate justice of the Supreme Court,” Gaïtas said. “I am also deeply grateful — thank you Governor Tim Walz and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan for giving me this opportunity.” Walz, who is the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, took a break from the campaign trail to attend the ceremony. “I can tell you with absolute confidence that Justice Gaïtas is the right person for this moment,” Walz said Monday. “I know that the state’s high court and the people of Minnesota will be well served.” Gaïtas officially joined the Supreme Court on Aug. 1 during a private swearing-in ceremony. In April, Walz appointed Gaïtas and Sarah Hennesy to replace, respectively, Margaret Chutich and G. Barry Anderson, who have retired. Gaïtas and Hennesy were the third and fourth members Walz has appointed to the high court. Walz’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, appointed the other three members of the court. Hennesy formally took the oath of office in July. Gaïtas had been a judge on the Minnesota Court of Appeals. She previously served as a judge on the Hennepin County District Court, where she presided over a felony caseload in the criminal division. A graduate of the University of Minnesota Law School, she also worked as an attorney in private practice and as an appellate public defender.","summary":"Gaïtas officially joined the Supreme Court on Aug. 1 during a private swearing-in ceremony.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/09/16/theodora-gaitas-formally-takes-oath-as-minnesotas-newest-supreme-court-justice/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:25:24","author":"Pioneer Press","authors":["Pioneer Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.522},{"id":256564870,"title":"CNN Analyst Harry Enten Brings Bad News to Kamala Harris Campaign in Latest Poll Analysis","text":"Watching the media/left-wing euphoria on national and state-level polling numbers since Democrat elites forced Joe Biden out of the presidential race and installed Kamala Harris in his place has been an exercise in frustration mixed with sprinklings of hilarity along the way.

This is something that had not been expected considering the six weeks of fawning coverage she received. The poll also showed that voters were eager for a candidate who could bring about change… and viewed Trump as a change agent over Harris 53 percent to 25 percent, which no doubt was a major blow to the Harris campaign as she’s laughably been promoting herself as the change candidate despite being the current Vice President.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWatching the media/left-wing euphoria on national and state-level polling numbers since Democrat&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN Analyst Harry Enten Brings Bad News to Kamala Harris Campaign in Latest Poll Analysis first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/cnn-analyst-harry-enten-brings-bad-news-to-kamala-harris-campaign-in-latest-poll-analysis/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/217/acdc5018-558b-4639-92bd-1db892c6a200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:19:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":256565368,"title":"Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, bans Russia Today and other Russian state media networks","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, bans Russia Today and other Russian state media networks Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said on Monday it was banning Russian state media networks, alleging the outlets used deceptive tactics to carry out influence operations while evading detection on the social media company's platforms.

A three-bedroom, two-bathroom house on a tree-lined street in Houston seemed like it could be a perfect fit. But the starter home Ellis desperately wants seems to be priced like a forever home she can't afford. Someone else put in an offer, and it was accepted.\"[It was] the one that got away,\" Ellis said.Ellis says she has a good job earning around $70,000, but her student loans have made her debt-to-income ratio a turnoff for lenders. She's previously been approved for a $200,000 loan, which falls more than $150,000 short of the homes she's been looking at in an area with good schools for her young daughter. Currently Ellis and her daughter share a room in an apartment Ellis rents with her sister. Five years ago, one in three American families could afford a starter home in 63 of America's largest 100 cities, CBS News found. Now, it's down to just 10 cities. Buyers like Ellis need builders like Sharone Mayberry, who is committed to building affordable starter home projects by taking advantage of city zoning and subsidies. Mayberry is financing a 40-unit build in Houston using nearly $5 million in city reinvestment funds. The typical price of a 1,650-square-foot, three-bedroom, two and a half-bathroom home in the development costs $250,000, which is about average for a Houston starter home.Without those subsidies, the homes would average about $350,000 to $400,000, Mayberry said, due to the price of the land.This housing crisis is at least a decade in the making, according to Chris Vincent, vice president of government relations and advocacy for Habitat for Humanity. The nonprofit, one of America's largest builders of starter homes, now focuses on advocacy as much as building.\"A lot of this is from the tailwinds, even from the '08 financial crisis,\" Vincent said. \"We've essentially not been building enough homes for the last decade to keep up with demand.\"In Silver Spring, Maryland, Carolyn Hipkins got lucky. She was making $54,000 a year when she bought a starter home rehabbed by Habitat for Humanity. The sale price was $360,000 with a 0% mortgage. \"I was so happy when I got that call on the phone. I had to control myself because I wanted to scream,\" Hipkins said.Habitat for Humanity doesn't just build single family homes anymore, either. They're the ninth largest builder of starter homes in the U.S., offering condos and apartments to a range of incomes. One in six families now spend more than half of their income on housing, according to the organization. Vincent says they're advocating for access to credit and land in \"communities of opportunity.\"The housing shortage is also a key economic issue for American voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed providing $25,000 in down payment assistance for Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years. She has also proposed building 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax incentives for developers who build starter homes, and a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the shortage. Former President Donald Trump has proposed making federal land available to help with housing supply, but his campaign hasn't offered any further details.Meanwhile, for every Hipkins, thousands of people like Ellis keep looking. Ellis is determined to buy a home, and a Post-It note in her bedroom serves as a reminder.\"You will be a homeowner,\" the note reads.It's the American dream on a Post-It note — and it has sticker shock.","summary":"Only one-third of American families can afford a starter home in just 10 of the 100 largest cities in the U.S., CBS News found.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-first-time-homebuyers-priced-out-what-can-revive-the-american-starter-home/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/16/32d402f7-a84d-41e3-a4a0-27c1fbb4e773/thumbnail/1200x630/db4b8301fe9d693f4b1fb4b8149b660f/gettyimages-1237584740.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:14:03","author":"Alicia Hastey,Mark Strassmann","authors":["Alicia Hastey","Mark Strassmann"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":256564892,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: Just like that, the Left has normalized assassination attempts","text":"I was sitting in an empty horse-racing grandstand having a cigarette, about to order a steak at the Hollywood Casino in Washington, Pa., when I saw on my feed that a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump had been confirmed. After saying a prayer to St. Michael the Archangel, I walked back into the Bistecca steakhouse, took back my seat at the bar and told the bartender and two guys there, \"Another assassination attempt against Trump.\" TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS ‘RHETORIC’ FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL ‘SAVE THE COUNTRY’ \"Are you surprised?\" one guy, a retired Teamster asked, a line that triggered a memory. \"It almost seems normal now,\" the bartender added. Then I ordered a ribeye and a glass of Merlot and we went back to watching the Chiefs against the Bengals. None of the networks cut away from the action for news coverage, my phone wasn’t blowing up with notifications, and my guess is that 90% of the people down on the floor of the casino, or in the sportsbook, had no idea anything had even happened. We all know that if such an attempt had been made on Vice President Kamala Harris’ life, the games would not only have been cut away for the news, they’d likely have been suspended. But this is about more than media bias, it’s about social callousness. Let’s take a step back and realize that this reaction to a former president and current candidate nearly being killed is absolutely bizarre, and was not the reaction just two months ago, the last time Trump was almost whacked by a loony leftist, if you are keeping track. That day, I was at a restaurant in Toledo interviewing some voters when news of the first attempt broke. People stopped in their tracks and assembled by the TVs at the bar to watch coverage. There was an electric air of shock and fear. And yet, this was the moment I was reminded of in Pennsylvania as news of the second attempt broke. One of the guys back in July, when we were watching Trump wipe blood from his face, said the exact same words: \"Are you surprised?\" To be fair, the horrible events in Butler were more dramatic. Corey Compatore tragically lost his life, and the imagery was heartstopping. But if the Palm Beach assassination attempt had happened on July 13, instead, then that Toledo restaurant would still have been stunned. The normalization of this assassination attempt on Sunday was palpable, regardless of every politician and pundit on all sides for the most part furrowing their well-plucked brows and decrying political violence. This desensitization of murder attempts against political opponents is a danger that cannot be overstated. It can only forebode a future in which not only do more attempts occur, but Americans' basic respect for the lives of those they disagree with diminishes. In the America of 25 years ago, when we did not hate each other quite so vociferously, the natural thing that would be occurring this week would be an event with Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden all teaming up to remind us of our core nonviolent values. That is very unlikely to happen though, because today the only thing that matters is winning the election. Both sides treat the other as an existential threat, not as a partner in governance, but what is the point of winning if the country is so bitterly divided that it can barely function? The younger of the two men at the steakhouse, a mustached friend of the Teamster, eventually weighed in. He had some sense of who I was, and where I am perceived to be on the political spectrum. \"I’m more to the right,\" he said.

West’s insurgent candidacy had been challenged in Pennsylvania by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration, with his secretary of state’s office arguing that the 71-year-old far-left candidate did not submit all the required paperwork on time. The state’s Supreme Court ruling affirmed a lower court order from last month knocking West off the November ballots. Monday’s ruling will allow Pennsylvania officials to begin the process of printing and sending out mail-in ballots to voters. The state has the earliest mail-in voting start date in the nation. “As soon as the court rules on that, we’ll certify the official list and then counties can complete their preparations to mail out ballots and to have voters, if they choose, go to a county election office to apply in person,” Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told the Associated Press prior to the state Supreme Court’s ruling. The Pennsylvania high court ruling means former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will appear on state ballots alongside Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver. In most state and national polls West is polling between 0% and 2%, and his left-wing policy positions threaten to siphon away votes from Harris. The race for the Keystone State is effectively tied, with the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls showing Harris with 0.1 percentage point edge over the former president. There are 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs in Pennsylvania this year. President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the battleground state by less than 100,000 votes in 2020, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 by an even slimmer margin to Trump, about 50,000 votes. West had been disqualified from appearing on Michigan presidential ballots last month by the state’s Bureau of Elections. However, the Michigan Court of Claims later overturned the ruling, certifying the far-left presidential hopeful for the Nov. 5 ballot. The Virginia Board of Elections also ruled earlier this month that West will be included on ballots despite previously disqualifying him over alleged faulty paperwork.","summary":"West is polling between 0% and 2% in most state and national 2024 polls, and his left-wing policy positions threaten to siphon away some votes from Harris. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/us-news/cornel-west-loses-bid-to-get-on-presidential-election-ballots-in-key-swing-state/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2017-washington-dc-west-african-89830684.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FpCpbTz5-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-17 00:11:24","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":256564890,"title":"Ohio sheriff asks for residents' addresses with Kamala Harris signs to send illegal immigrants to homes","text":"A sheriff in Ohio took to social media to issue a warning to the public that anyone who is showing support for Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign could eventually house some extra guests.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Portage County Sheriff's Office and Sheriff Zuchowski for comment.

The \"Murphy Brown\" star, 78, was on stage to present the award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series when she referenced a plot from the 1990's sitcom, where her character revealed she was pregnant and intended to raise her child as a single mother. The story line was condemned by critics at the time, including then-Vice President Dan Quayle, who took issue with the unmarried protagonist having a child. He argued that it glamorized the disintegration of traditional family values. \"For 11 years, I had the tremendous privilege of playing the lead in a comedy series called Murphy Brown,\" Bergen said on stage. TRUMP SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISOR SLAMS LEFT: TAKING VANCE'S ‘CAT LADY’ COMMENTS ‘BLATANTLY OUT OF CONTEXT’ \"I was surrounded by brilliant and funny actors, had the best scripts to work with, and in one classic moment, my character was attacked by Vice President Dan Quayle when Murphy became pregnant and decided to raise the baby as a single mother.\" \"Oh how far we’ve come,\" she continued. \"Today, a Republican candidate for vice president would never attack a woman for having kids,\" she quipped. \"So as they say, my work here is done. Meow!\" Bergen added. Her comment was an apparent reference to a remark made by Vance in 2021 when he declared that the U.S. was effectively being run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" He has since defended the remark as a \"joke\" that was \"willfully misinterpreted\" by Democrats, but the refrain has become a favorite line of attack by Trump critics after the former president announced him as his running mate in July. Bergen's comments seemingly drew a comparison between Vance and Quayle, who criticized CBS and Bergen for \"mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice\" during a 1992 speech at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. JD VANCE REACTS TO TAYLOR SWIFT JAB AT HIM, HARRIS ENDORSMENT: ‘FUNDAMENTALLY DISCONNECTED’ The address, dubbed the \"Murphy Brown Speech\" at the time, was in response to the Rodney King riots that ravaged Los Angeles weeks prior, which he blamed, in part, to the breakdown of the \"traditional\" family structure. \"It doesn’t help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown, a character who supposedly epitomizes today’s intelligent, highly paid professional woman, mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice,\" Quayle told the crowd. Bergen wasn't the only celebrity to throw shade on Vance.

I know Congress will be looking at this again. It seems to me that they don't have enough resources, they don't have enough people.\"\"We have a unique situation,\" he continued. \"We have Donald Trump, who has been president, who is running again. He deserves the same type of security that the incumbent president does and that, you know, the Democrat vice president does, who is running for president.\"Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe said during a news conference earlier on Monday that Trump already had the \"highest level of protection\" following the assassination attempt in July, with Rowe adding that the \"security plan worked\" in thwarting the apparent attempt on Sunday.DeWine also addressed Trump's pet-eating claim during his CNN interview on Monday, pointing out that the claim is not supported by evidence while defending a community of Haitian immigrants that has been facing repeated threats since the former president pushed the claim during his September 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.\"My job is to reflect exactly on what's going on in Springfield,\" DeWine said. \"The mayor tells us, and the chief of police tells us, that there's been no evidence at all of anyone eating a dog or any Haitians doing any of that. These Haitians that are there are legal.\"\"They work very, very hard,\" he added. \"I met this morning with a number of businesspeople who employ these Haitians and they tell me they are really essential to getting the job done. They work hard, they're family-focused.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Monday evening.Republican Springfield Mayor Rob Rue told Politico on Monday that he was \"frustrated\" by Trump's remarks and declined to commit to backing Trump and Vance in November.\"Any political leader that takes the national stage and has the national spotlight needs to understand the gravity of the words that they have for cities like ours, and what they say impacts our city,\" Rue said. \"We've had bomb threats the last two days.

The event brought together global leadership from around the world and the African diaspora, with notable attendees including President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is also a 2024 presidential candidate. This year’s theme, From Vision to Victory: Amplifying Black Voices, focused on a wide range of topics critical to Black America, ahead of the pivotal presidential election this November. Maxine hosted a powerful and engaging session titled Young, Gifted, and Black: Hip Hop Artists Thriving, Creating, & Entertaining. In this intricate discussion, she explored the intersection of artistry, self-expression, creativity, culture, politics, and hip hop, along with the opportunities for wealth-building, strategic investments, innovation, and job creation. The session featured honorable guest panelists Kevin Liles, Dr. Yolanda \"YoYo\" Whitaker, and legendary producer and DJ D-Nice. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - AUGUST 19: Rep.

Here’s How Google Chrome Deadline—You Have 72 Hours To Update Your Browser Apple Forced Into Drastic iPhone 16 Pro Downgrade They collectively spoke on the global financial influence of music and cultural industries, advocating why this should not be taken lightly and highlighting the importance of focusing on the bigger picture by supporting the next generation of Black youth pursuing careers in Hip-hop, while urging politicians, community leaders, and change-makers to think differently about Hip-hop while prioritizing policies and legislation that allocate resources to sustain the industry. Additionally, they emphasized the need to protect and uplift Black entrepreneurs, creatives, and their legacies intertwined to this genre. Here are six fundamental insights for the community to consider into business, economics, culture, and Hip-hop: Hip-Hop Creates Pathways For The Future Hip-hop creates pathways for future generations by combining artistry with economic opportunity, providing a platform for youth to use their voice while driving wealth generation across various sectors. It’s a scalable industry with significant impacts on the economy, job creation, and investment opportunities. From music production to fashion, finance, tech, health and sciences, and entrepreneurship, Hip-hop contributes to global innovation and can advance and accelerate economic growth within Black communities. However, it’s essential to separate self-expression, lyricism, controversies and individual personalities from the commerce and industrialization of the culture. While they intersect, maintaining this distinction helps preserve the authenticity of the art form, ensuring that the creative voice and story telling remains uninfluenced by commercial interests while the business side supports future opportunities and solutions. Hip-hop Is A Global Industry Throughout the years, Black entertainers have transformed hip hop into a global industry with significant influence, generating jobs and opportunities across continents through its widespread appeal and cultural impact. Ironically, Black entertainers often face wage disparities and discrimination within an industry they pioneered. As globalization continues to expand, legislative support can play a critical role in redefining the legacy of hip hop’s founders and their communities by developing and investing in more equitable and sustainable environments where Black creatives and entrepreneurs can thrive and receive the recognition and opportunities they deserve. According to a YWCA report on discrimination in the music industry, many leading genres (rooted in Black Southern American culture, identity, and heritage) are still directly affected by systemic racism, which creates unequal opportunities for Black artists and other artists of color. These artists are often underrepresented, tokenized, or pigeonholed, limiting their exposure, creative freedom, and fair compensation. Structural inequalities, such as biased hiring practices and restricted access to resources, further undermine their success. Furthermore cultural appropriation remains an obstacle, with non-Black artists frequently profiting from Black music and styles without proper acknowledgment, respect or adequate returns for their time, ingenuity and labor. By engaging in the right types of conversations, strategies and enacting supportive policies, communities can leverage hip-hop to empower themselves economically and socially. This approach not only helps Black creatives and entrepreneurs capitalize on the industry’s growth but also opens doors to endless opportunities for structural, personal, and communal advancement, encouraging them to shape their own futures and drive positive change within their communities while being able to build new institutions for themselves. Investing In Core Skills Is A Necessity For Success Maxine wants us to focus on building confidence and self-esteem through education in negotiation, direct communication, and navigating contracts. She is committed to developing culturally affirming programs that align with the learning styles and interests of youth. She envisions these programs offering instructional and educational opportunities that combine business and creative concepts, preparing students for careers in business and entertainment. By incorporating strong instructional components, the programs will help institutions and technical groups demonstrate the importance of acquiring relevant skills and perspectives. The goal is to introduce these educational programs into classroom instruction, apply learning in practical contexts, and connect business, hip-hop, and the economy in a way that promotes greater competition and creates sustainable opportunities. Strengthening Our Networks Through Transparent Engagement Panelists D-Nice and Kevin Liles discussed how strengthening our networks requires a fresh approach. They spoke about the importance of being genuine, openly communicating, and being present, noting that real connections in hip-hop and entertainment should move beyond celebrity status, attention, and popularity to find sustainable opportunities in artistry, music, and entertainment. They also advised aspiring professionals and creators to focus on developing and improving both technical and emotional skills to engage with others in meaningful ways. They stated that, from experience, this approach is what actually helps build global and impactful networks, what creates lasting connections that surpass surface-level interactions, and what is needed to encourage quality collaborations and growth. By understanding that success is not just about high-profile recognition but also about nurturing valuable relationships and skills, we open doors to more substantial and significant opportunities. There Is Power In Vulnerability And Authenticity Shifting away from self-centered mindsets and embracing how serving others by authentically honoring our dreams, passions, and values can make a difference is essential. Being open and vulnerable with ourselves and others strengthens powerful connections in our lives. Practicing kindness towards ourselves and then extending that kindness to others can help build new networks and create pathways. D-Nice, one of the panelists, shared his experience of meeting KRS-One while pursuing something he loved without any expectations or strings attached. Kevin Liles also discussed how some of his most successful partnerships and business deals came from collaborating with individuals who embraced this mindset. He also highlighted his admiration for Megan Thee Stallion’s work ethic and committment, which reflects the kindness, passion, and consistency her mother instilled in her. This approach has not only guided her through challenges and contributed to her brand's success, philanthropy, and messaging but also attracted like-minded teams, projects, and opportunities. As a result, she has created numerous opportunities, formed new networks, and made a positive impact on lives and future paths around the world. Faith Without Works Is Dead Kevin Liles referenced a powerful faith-based quote and mentioned how an idea and vision without communication and execution aren't enough. He discussed the transformative power of combining discipline with passion, how value is created from this place of empowerment, and how opportunities are then formed and made available for yourself and others. Maxine also reiterated the importance of providing the next generation of creatives and artists with both tangible and intangible resources to help bring their visions to life and teach them the technical disciplines necessary to succeed and thrive not just in hip-hop and entertainment but in any commerce-based field. Hip hop's economic power is transforming culture into significant business opportunities and job ... [+] creation. getty Hip hop is not only entertaining but should also be recognized as positive, liberating and transformative, with significant potential to support our culture and drive innovation. Its impact is essential, shaping and enriching both our artistic landscape and broader society.

Trump said on Monday that the suspected gunman “acted” on the “highly inflammatory language” of Democrats, CNN reported. The Republican nominee’s sharp remarks came a day after he escaped an attack at International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. During an interview with Fox News, the former President said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it”. Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.” The former President pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.” He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” he added. Harris, her running mate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former President was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden began his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power”. Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms”. The suspected gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, possessed an AK-47-style rifle pointing through the chain-link fence out towards the green, a go-pro camera, and two backpacks. Routh escaped from the spot but was pulled over and arrested on I-95, according to Fox News report. Following the shooting incident near his Florida Golf Course on Sunday, former US President Trump said that he is absolutely “safe and well”. He was playing golf at West Palm Beach’s Trump International Golf Club. In a fundraising email, Trump wrote, “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumours start spiralling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me,” he said in the email. Trump is “safe following gunshots in his vicinity,” the Trump Campaign said in a statement on Sunday, according to CNN. Soon after the incident took place, Trump ally Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina spoke with him, and said that he is “good spirits”. The second assassination attempt against Trump came after he was shot in the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania by a gunman who killed one person and injured others before being shot by police on July 13. –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 17 (IANS) Launching a fiery attack against Democrats, former US President Donald Trump has said that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris&#8217; &#8220;rhetoric&#8221; is responsible for the second assassination attempt against him since July, media reported.

Among those deaths, more than 2,500 children (ages one through nine) and teens (10 through 17) died by a firearm — an average of seven deaths every day. That year, the report found that firearms accounted for 30 percent of all the deaths that occurred among young people ages 15 to 17. Guns were also the leading cause of death among children and teens, accounting for more deaths than car crashes, overdoses, or cancers, per the report. Notably, a distinction was made for this year’s data, with young people ages 18 to 19 categorized as “emerging adults” due to some states allowing 18 year olds to legally purchase certain firearms. “Since 2013, the gun death rate among children and teens (1–17) has increased 106 percent,” the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions report stated. The report found that while the gun homicide rate dropped 7.5 percent in 2022, 19,651 people were killed by a gun that year — the second-highest number of gun homicide deaths recorded. The report also spotlighted how gun violence disproportionally affected Black and Hispanic/Latino young people. In 2022, Black children and teens suffered a gun homicide rate 18 times higher compared with white children and teens. That year, the gun homicide rate among Hispanic/Latino children and teens was three times higher than for white children and teens. While historically, white youth have had higher gun suicide rates than youth from other races and ethnicities, the report indicated that these numbers have begun to shift. Although gun suicide deaths were higher for white older teens than Black older teens and emerging adults (ages 15 to 19) in 2022, gun suicide rates have tripled among Black older teens and emerging adults and have doubled among Hispanic/Latinos in the same age group from 2013 to 2022. Gun violence accounted for 55 percent of deaths among older Black teens ages 15 to 17 in 2022, while American Indian/Alaskan Native people were five times more likely to die by firearm homicide compared with white people in the same age group. The report emerges amid a call among Democrats for stricter gun legislation and a contentious 2024 presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, have offered wildly different approaches to gun control. Trump has strongly aligned with the National Rifle Association and has vowed to expand gun-owners rights. Meanwhile, Harris — a gun owner herself — has supported tighter gun restrictions, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. Recent months saw the tragic school shooting at a Georgia high school that left four dead, and a second assassination attempt of former President Trump in two months, according to the FBI. In its report, the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions stated that it is the center’s “mission to provide policymakers and the public accurate and up-to-date data on gun fatalities and illustrate the enormous toll gun violence has on our country.”","summary":"More children and teens (ages one to 17) died from gun violence — accounting for more deaths than car crashes, overdoses, or cancers, Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/guns-leading-cause-of-death-children-teens-new-report-1235103693/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/guns-leading-cause-death-children-teens-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:49:53","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":256563844,"title":"Robbins: Wheels come off Trump’s campaign at debate","text":"Donald Trump’s surrogates faced something of a challenge in the aftermath of last week’s presidential debate, obliged to insist that things had gone well for him, all evidence to the contrary. And there was plenty of contrary evidence provided by the former president’s responses to questions posed by the moderators, as Kamala Harris displayed debating skills that left him looking rattled. Harris mixed broad themes with zingers aimed at making Trump go postal. The military regards Trump as “a disgrace,” he was a convicted felon who was facing a sentencing hearing that would be “a big day” for him, he was “weak” and Putin et al would “eat him for lunch.” It’s been a long time since Trump seemed mentally suited to be president, but last week over 60 million Americans saw someone who needed to be guided off the stage, if not out of the building. There were the customary insults, which made him sound like a Not Ready For Prime Time Player. “She’s a Marxist,” Trump ranted. “Everybody knows she’s a Marxist. Her father’s a Marxist professor in economics. He taught her well.” Then “People don’t go to her rallies,” the product of wishful thinking, delusion or both. “And the people that do go, she’s busing them in and paying them to be there.” Stung by Harris’ jab about the empty seats at his rallies and the video of people leaving them, Trump sounded somewhere between infantile and untethered. “People don’t leave my rallies,” he insisted angrily. “We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.” Pressed about his boasts that he had overturned Roe v. Wade, Trump resorted to simple fiction. Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz, Trump contended, “says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it’s execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay.” The nullification of Roe was opposed by the overwhelming majority of Americans, but not on Donald Trump’s planet. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states,” he claimed. On the issue of Afghanistan, Trump got some basic facts wrong, in the light most favorable to him, telling a story which sounded, well, made-up. The leader of the Taliban since 2016 has been Hibatullah Akhundzada. Not according to Trump. “Abdul is the head of the Taliban,” Trump declared. “He’s still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don’t do it anymore, you do it again you’re going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a photo of my house. I said you’re going to have to figure it out.” Why Trump’s sending Abdul a picture of his house is something all of us are going to have to figure out, and not just Abdul. Trump was just warming up, bouncing from warnings about World War III (“just to go into another subject”) to what, supposedly, is “what’s happening in the towns all over the United States,” which “a lot of towns don’t want to talk about because they’re so embarrassed about it.” What is it that’s happening all over America? Immigrants are “eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating – they’re eating – they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.” Informed that this story is unfounded, Trump remained adamant. “The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food,” he insisted. There was a feeling post-debate that Americans have had enough. Narcissists or charlatans, even demagogues, are one thing. But seeming unhinged is something else. That’s the challenge they have at Mar-a-Lago.

Coming to America, working hard, that’s what we do,” she continued. “Coming from gratitude.

They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” City officials have denied the claims of pet-eating in Springfield, but Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D.

Doesn’t that mean I should shut up about the residents of Springfield? Don’t you realize you’re engaged in basic propaganda to silence the concerns of American citizens?” he shot back on CNN.

He went 10-0 with 108 strikeouts, 13 walks and 2.39 ERA 79 innings. In 2023, however, he slumped to 7-6 with a 4.75 ERA and fell on the draft board. “He made some mechanical adjustments that, probably, he didn’t need to make,” Rockies general manager Bill Schmidt said a year ago. “He was trying to get better, making some tweaks. But he’s got to tweak them back.” He has. The right-hander fanned 10 or more in four of his 14 starts for Spokane, going 4-1 with a 2.63 ERA. In 118 innings over 23 starts overall, he is 6-2 with a 2.59 ERA, allowing 94 hits and 47 walks while striking out an eye-popping 169.

In six innings, the lefty fanned 13 without a walk, yielding one run on five hits. He also whiffed 10 or more four times before being called up, going 7-2 with a 2.16 ERA. Overall, Sullivan has a 9-2 record, 2.11 ERA in 21 starts. In115 1/3 innings, he has yielded 90 hits and only 15 walks while striking out 125. He got a $1.7 million signing bonus as the Rockies’ second pick, No. 46 overall, in the 2022 MLB Draft out of Wake Forest. “He struck out guys,” Schmidt said then. “Hitters had problems picking up his stuff. He’s left-handed with a very quality slider and angle to his fastball.” The 6-4, 190-pounder has an odd delivery that helps confounder batters. A Matter Of Odd Anatomy It is physically impossible though an absolute given that the Rockies’ arms have been the franchise’s Achilles’ heel. In 32 seasons, they have finished above .500 only eight times. The best team ERA mark was 4.14 in 2010. That was only ninth-best in the National League that year though helped Colorado go 83-79. The worst ERA was a lofty 6.01 in 1999. The 2023 club that had a 59-103 record had the next-worst ERA at 5.67. A Nied From The Start Colorado’s altitude and ballpark have traditionally frustrated pitchers and helped hitters. From their inception, the Rockies have continually sought better pitching and seldom struck the mother lode.

Mandatory Credit: Tim de Frisco /Allsport Getty Images On Nov. 17, 1992, the fledgling franchise made what was universally acclaimed as a bright move by making right-hander David Nied the first pick of the expansion draft. At age 23 that year, he had a 3-0 record and 1.17 ERA as a rookie for the Atlanta Braves. Atlanta already has future Hall of Famers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in its rotation was negotiating to add a third, which they did two weeks later in Greg Maddux. Nied started the Rockies’ historic first game, a 3-0 loss to the New York Mets. He beat the Mets in his third start, a complete game. He developed a sore arm and pitched in only 30 games the next three years, retiring at age 27. A Never-Ending Search Mike Hampton had a 91-60 record for the Houston Astros and New York Mets over seven seasons. The Rockies signed him to an eight-year, $121 million deal. The lefty went 21-28 with a 5.75 ERA and was traded to Atlanta. The next three years, he had a combined 32-20 record.

In two years in Colorado, Kile went a combined 21-30. Traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, he had a 20-9 record in 2000. These are two prime examples of successful veterans expected to help and did not. Dollander and Sullivan have high expectations as youngsters.

Kudos to 1,000 Grandmothers speaking at the Port of Oakland about the distressing signs of global heating. 2024 was the hottest summer on record. The Line and Airport fires burn in Southern California. The heat in Phoenix was unbearable. Air pollution in East Oakland is making the community sick. Flying is the fastest way to fry the planet. Planes burn tons of fuel. Each flight spews hundreds of tons of pollution into our sensitive atmosphere, heating our planet 2-3 times more than ground travel due to high altitude effects. We can’t afford to let airports and air travel expand. Don’t believe the green hype on low-carbon airports; the ground operations are nil compared to the toll of the flights. Sustainable Aviation Fuel currently fuels 0.01% of flights worldwide and there’s not enough cropland to fuel the rest. We’ve got to fly less if we want a livable future. Ariella Granett Berkeley Airport expansion will exacerbate pollution Re: “Plans to expand Oakland airport draw criticism” (Page A1, Sept. 15). I so appreciate the article for keeping our attention on possible airport expansion. I only wish it had been clearer about greenhouse gas emissions. Already aviation is responsible for 11% of Bay Area emissions. Adding 16 gates to the Oakland airport would greatly increase the climate emissions its planes produce. The airport administration likes to draw attention to its plans to reduce emissions caused by ground operations — moving planes around on the ground and attending to them and to passengers. But that constitutes only 1% of the emissions the airport is responsible for by providing facilities for planes to take off and land. It’s a distraction. By modernizing but not expanding, the airport can protect the health of its workers, East Bay residents and the planet. It needs to end mindless growth. It can make Oakland airport a leader to be proud of. Lin Griffith Oakland A vote for Trump is a vote for chaos We are a country known to be a beacon of hope to people all over the world. It pains me to see Donald Trump and JD Vance actively dimming that light and causing needless unjustified suffering. The false “eating cats and dogs” racist accusation by former President Trump against hard-working Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, was disgraceful. Trump’s rant echoed claims of the most extreme and violent right-wing groups (including neo-Nazis) in a community now terrorized with harassment and bomb threats that are causing schools to close as the people fear for their safety. Enough is enough. Chaos, violence and continuous lies — that is what is in store for all of us if Trump is elected. Please vote to save us from this ordeal. Please think hard before you vote. Your and your children’s well-being will depend on it. Matthew O’Donnell Castro Valley Trump fears another bad debate performance It is painfully obvious why Donald Trump does not want another debate with Kamala Harris. In an embarrassing nationally televised rant, Trump displayed for all to see that he is an angry compulsive liar with no redeeming qualities. His unfitness for office laid bare, the GOP has no time to pivot away from a November disaster. While some predict a close election for president, I sense a sea swell of momentum rising in the Harris-Walz campaign. Positivism and hopefulness will overcome constant chaos, negativity and conspiracy theories. Kamala Harris will become the first woman to serve as a U.S. president and a pitiful, angry old man will skulk back to Mar-a-Lago. We will have moved on. Jon James Pleasanton Pope makes false equivalence in race Trump has been impeached for crimes against our Constitution, convicted in civil court of assault against a woman, and convicted of fraud.

The network’s statement came after it declined to directly address allegations—made in an allegedly sworn statement, purportedly by one of its staff—that it helped Harris in the debate. The claims are made in a document which has itself become a viral sensation among MAGA influencers and been amplified by leading Trump allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene. The document was first published Sunday—by an X account with nearly 100,000 followers, and the name “Black Insurrectionist”—as a six-page “affidavit,” which claimed to have been written by an ABC technical worker the day before the debate. The name of the person who signed the document is obscured, but in the six pages they makes claims which—if true—would be explosive. The allegations include that Harris’ team allegedly negotiating specific camera angles to portray her more favorably than Trump. The document also claims the campaign negotiated rules with ABC without involving the Trump team, and it managed to get the network to avoid specific topics including President Joe Biden’s health; Harris’ tenure as “Attorney General in San Francisco”; and her brother-in-law and advisor Tony West. In a statement to the Daily Beast, ABC News did not address any of the specific allegations: “ABC News followed the debate rules that both campaigns agreed on and which clearly state: No topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates.” The alleged whistleblower’s claims have received support and online bolstering from right-wing figures like billionaire Bill Ackman; a pinned post on X by him is an open letter to Disney CEO Robert Iger demanding an investigation into the matter. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) also rushed to amplify the claims. “If this is accurate—and I do not know that it is—it would constitute one of the gravest violations of journalist ethics in presidential debate history,” Cruz wrote on X. “If true, multiple senior people at @abc should be fired.” The existence of the affidavit was first raised by the “Black Insurrectionist” on Thursday which posted that they would be “releasing an affidavit from an ABC News whistleblower regarding the debate.” On the same day, a website called “Leading Report,” which traffics in misinformation, boosted the claim on X that alleged Harris received questions ahead of the debate and received “assurances” only Donald Trump would be fact-checked. Ackman shared that post to his 1.4 million X followers—such as Elon Musk, who responded to the website’s post with “!!” As many conspiracy theories do, it made its way to Trump’s Truth Social feed. ABC categorically denied to The Daily Beast last week that Harris was given any questions ahead of last week’s debate, shooting down one of the talking points that Trump and other right-wingers tried to use to explain the former president’s dismal debate performance. “Absolutely not,” an ABC News spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “Harris was not given any questions before the debate.” The network’s debate rules stated that “no topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates.” The spokesperson also said no aides were in contact with moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. Trump aides have attacked the moderators as “agents of the Harris campaign” following their efforts, which have been almost universally lauded. A source familiar with the matter also dismissed the purported fact-check “assurances” as untrue. Harris’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The “Black Insurrectionist” account, having grown by nearly 30,000 followers, eventually shared the six-page “affidavit” on Sunday. The document is dated Sept. 9, the day before the debate. The person—whose name, address, and signature are blacked out, other than they live in “Manhattan New York”—alleges they have been with “ABC news” for over 10 years, but they have somehow observed “significant transformations in the nature of news reporting at the organization” since it was acquired by Disney in 1996. The person then makes their claims, including that Harris was given a “significantly smaller podium” than Trump’s and would be given “split-screen television views” that would “favorably” present her better than Trump. It also alleged it was “widely known” throughout ABC that Trump would be fact checked and that Harris’ camp demanded he would be—without looping in his team. It also alleged the network agreed not to raise certain topics, including Biden’s age and allegations that Tony West, an Obama Justice Department official and her brother-in-law, embezzled billions of dollars in “taxpayer funds.” The document also claims to have been verified by a notary public, though the document does not provide a notary seal. An article on a little-known blog indicated the alleged whistleblower had been killed in a car crash before they could unveil the affidavit. That proposition was pushed by Greene on X, who claimed that the whistleblower had died “according to news reports.” She then retracted the claim and demanded a “serious investigation” into the document. Even the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that delves in misinformation and false stories, warned its readers: “It’s clear to us that this is a complete hoax.” (The “Black Insurrectionist” account later claimed they put the website in touch with the whistleblower’s attorney.) Still, the “Black Insurrectionist” account has doubled down on the claims and has insulted users who’ve cast doubt. When one user questioned why the document had no notary seal, the account responded angrily: “It was notarized you jagoff (sic), it was blocked out. But that's OK more to come on this, even though ABC moderators have started to admit it's true, you can keep groveling.” Even that claim, however, was untrue. The account later cited a Breitbart article that claimed, “Linsey Davis Admits: ‘Fact-checking’ Was Only Planned for Trump.” It pointed to her comments in an Los Angeles Times interview—though Davis never said she wanted to limit her fact checks to Trump, or excuse Harris from fact checks. Instead, Davis said she wanted to make sure fact checks were done because “people were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators.”","summary":"Win McNamee/Getty ImagesABC News has again insisted that no topics or questions were shared with either Vice President Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, and their respective campaigns, in advance of last week’s presidential debate.\n\nThe network’s statement came after it declined to directly address allegations—made in an allegedly sworn statement, purportedly by one of its staff—that it helped Harris in the debate.\n\nThe claims are made in a document which has itself become a viral sensation among MAGA influencers and been amplified by leading Trump allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/abc-news-denies-maga-affadavit-claims-that-it-helped-harris-win-debate","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1383,w_2459,x_0,y_69/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1726525390/GettyImages-2171258280_esw0ud","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:28:30","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":256563396,"title":"Would-be assassin charged","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours, lying in wait for the former president before a Secret Service agent thwarted the potential attack and opened fire, according to court documents. Ryan Wesley Routh did not fire any shots, never had Trump in his line of sight and sped away after being shot at by an agent who spotted him, officials said. He was arrested in a neighboring county. Routh, 58, appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach to face federal firearms charges, starting a criminal case in the final weeks of a presidential race already touched by violence and upheaval. Though no one was injured, the episode marked the second attempt on Trump’s life in as many months, raising questions about the security provided to him during a time of amped-up political rhetoric and what the Secret Service chief called an “unprecedented and hyper-dynamic threat environment.” Even as Trump’s Republican allies and some Democrats demanded answers about how a would-be shooter was able to get so close to Trump, Ronald Rowe Jr., the Secret Service’s acting director, offered a fiery defense of the agents he said were “rising to this moment” despite needing additional resources. “Right now, we are redlining them, and they are rising to this moment, and they are meeting the challenges right now,” Rowe said, citing recent political conventions and other major events that required protective details. Authorities continued to examine Routh’s potential motive and movements in the days and weeks leading up to Sunday, when a Secret Service agent assigned to Trump’s security detail spotted a firearm poking out of shrubbery on the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing. The agent fired, and Routh escaped into a sport utility, leaving behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style assault rifle and a plastic bag containing food. He had been at the golf course’s tree line from 1:59 a.m. to 2:31 p.m., according to an FBI affidavit that cited cellphone data. The FBI is continuing to investigate how long the Hawaii man had been in Florida, said Jeffrey Veltri, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office. Body camera footage posted Monday on Facebook by the Martin County sheriff’s office showed Routh’s arrest. The video shows him walking backward with his hands over his head on the side of a road before being handcuffed and led away by law enforcement. Coming just weeks after a July shooting at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in which Trump was wounded by a gunman’s bullet, the latest assassination attempt accelerated concerns that violence continues to infect American presidential politics. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s challenger in the November election, denounced the thwarted attack, with Harris saying in a post on X: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” “We will work tirelessly to ensure accountability, and we will bring every available resource to bear in this investigation,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. The FBI has interviewed family members, friends and colleagues and has served a battery of search warrants to collect evidence. No motive has been disclosed, and Routh invoked his right to an attorney when questioned. Authorities did not immediately reveal any new details about Routh’s background or allege a particular motive in charging documents. Investigators are also examining Routh’s large online footprint, which suggests a man of evolving political viewpoints, culminating in an apparent disdain for Trump and intense outrage at global events concerning China and especially Ukraine. One of the two counts he faces alleges that he illegally possessed his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina. The other charge alleges that the serial number was obliterated and unreadable to the naked eye, in violation of federal law. Routh was ordered held after prosecutors argued that he was a flight risk, with additional hearings set for later this month. He spoke in a soft voice as he answered perfunctory questions from a federal magistrate, saying that he was working and making around $3,000 a month, but has zero savings. Routh said that he has no real estate or assets, aside from two trucks worth about $1,000, both located in Hawaii. He also said that he has a 25-year-old son, whom he sometimes supports. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary, said his state will conduct its own investigation into how Routh was able to get so close. “I understand that the feds are involved but we do believe that there were multiple violations of state law. We also believe that there’s a need to make sure that the truth about all this comes out in a way, you know, that’s credible,” he said during a news conference Monday morning. “I mean I look at the federal government, with all due respect to them, those same agencies that are prosecuting Trump in that jurisdiction are now going to be investigating this?”","summary":"The man suspected in an apparent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump camped outside a golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours, lying in wait for the former president before a Secret Service agent thwarted the potential attack and opened fire, according to court documents filed Monday.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/16/would-be-assassin-charged/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171592164.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:26:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":256563786,"title":"Let’s make a big change in our approach.","text":"The acting Secret Service director says the agency needs to undergo a complete overhaul of how it protects presidents — a remarkable admission following the second attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life in the past two months. “Coming out of Butler, I have ordered a paradigm shift,” Ronald Rowe said at a press conference Monday, referring to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. “The Secret Service’s protective methodologies work and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday.” But, he added, “We need to get out of a reactive model, and get to a readiness model.” Rowe did not go into detail about his vision for the nearly 160-year-old agency. His comments come at a pivotal moment for the Secret Service. The agency has been under heavy scrutiny since a gunman managed to fire several rounds at Trump at the rally in Pennsylvania, striking his ear, in what was the Secret Service’s biggest security failure since President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in 1981. One person was killed at the July 13 rally, and two others were injured. The incident on Sunday, which the FBI called an apparent attempted assassination of Trump, unfolded at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle poking out of the bushes outside the course, according to officials. The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, had been in the vicinity for nearly 12 hours, according to a criminal complaint. Routh was taken into custody later Sunday and charged with federal gun crimes. The Trump campaign asked the Secret Service for increased security on Monday morning, two sources familiar with the request told NBC News. It’s not clear how the Secret Service has responded to that request. When asked about it, Rowe sidestepped the question. “I’ve had a conversation with the former president,” he said. “The president is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that the Secret Service provides.” “We constantly evaluate based on threat,” he added. “If we need to ratchet it up additionally, we will.” The Secret Service has dramatically increased Trump’s security since the shooting on July 13, according to two sources familiar with the agency’s response. The increased security includes more people and more technology. One said the Secret Service is doing all it can to protect Trump while also preparing for the United Nations General Assembly next week and protecting President Joe Biden, Sen. J.D. Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other protectees. That source said that additional resources would require additional funding from Congress. Rowe conceded as much at the press conference. “The Secret Service operates under a paradox of zero fail mission but also that we have done more with less for decades,” he said. “And this goes back many, many decades. What I can tell you is we have immediate needs right now.” Protecting the former president at an outdoor venue like a golf course poses particular challenges, especially when Trump makes an impromptu decision to play a few holes. But multiple former FBI agents questioned how a man was able to take a position so close to the former president and stay hidden there for so long. “That to me is really unsettling,” said Evy Poumpouras, a former Secret Service agent who protected multiple presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, during her 12 years with the agency. “How did he get there, take that position for 12 hours and nobody saw that? Nobody did a perimeter sweep?” she added in an interview on MSNBC. The Secret Service is chronically understaffed: The arm of the agency that protects presidents, vice presidents and their families is nearly 10% smaller than it was a decade ago. Yet while the requests for extra personnel and equipment from Trump’s agents have been repeatedly declined over the past two years, no resource requests were denied for the Pennsylvania rally where Trump was shot, a Secret Service official told NBC News in July. The problem does not appear to be a financial issue: government filings show the Secret Service’s budget nearly doubled over the last decade while staffing agencywide rose by nearly 25%. Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who has worked on protective details for presidential candidates, including Sen. John Kerry in 2004, said it was “pretty clear at this point that we need extra personnel for President Trump.” “If this had been President Biden and he was golfing on the golf course, there would be a several-block security buffer around that golf course,” he said on Monday. “Yes, former presidents don’t get that same level of protection, but that level of protection adjusts based on known threat level.” “Why at this point, seven weeks out from an election, a major presidential candidate doesn’t have additional security personnel to secure the perimeter of his golf course?” Cangelosi added. “That’s the question that should be asked at this point.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe acting Secret Service director says the agency needs to undergo a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Let&#8217;s make a big change in our approach. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/lets-make-a-big-change-in-our-approach/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-We-need-a-‘paradigm-shift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:21:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":256563436,"title":"Democrats look to flip ‘toss-up’ California district in bid for House control","text":"Several nonpartisan political analysts indicated former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray has a fighting chance to unseat Rep. John Duarte (R-CA) during interviews with the Sacramento Bee. The pair faced off for the first time two years ago, with Duarte ultimately winning California’s 13th Congressional District race by under 600 votes. While Duarte’s narrow margin of victory indicates he’s particularly vulnerable to this year’s rematch with Gray, political pundits view his status as a first-term congressman as an additional hurdle the Republican will have to overcome. “Anything that’s good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he’s the less-tested candidate,” Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections, said. Erin Covey, a House analyst and editor at the Cook Political Report, added that Duarte “can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn’t had as much time to show voters that he’s not like other Republicans.” Republicans hold a four-seat advantage in the lower chamber as they fight to expand their slim majority this November. Last month, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which serves as the House GOP’s campaign arm, urged members to focus on defensive fundraising efforts to ward off Democratic challengers. The NRCC earlier this year touted “the Committee’s best month of June in a presidential election year.” However, the GOP’s celebration came before Vice President Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. She fueled record fundraising numbers for her party, signaling that expanding the Republican footprint in the House could be a tighter battle than previously anticipated. “We ultimately believe the most likely outcome is a single-digit gain for either party,” the Cook Political Report’s Erin Covey wrote in a Sept. 5 reflection on whether House Republicans or Democrats would claim the victory this November. Meanwhile, Inside Elections noted basically the same message in a report that found Republicans are “still slight favorites to hold the House” but estimated the range of outcomes is a mere “Democratic gain of five seats to a Republican gain of five seats.” Pundits rate California’s race between Duarte and Gray as a toss-up. The pair hail from a Latino-majority voting-age district in the politically purple San Joaquin Valley. The district also went to President Joe Biden in 2020 with 54% of the vote. Duarte earned a critical endorsement from the Central Valley Leadership Round Table last December, touting himself as “the first Republican to have been endorsed” by the coalition of Latino leaders. Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Gray, said the race would come down to a “coin-toss difference.” “In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody’s control,” he told NOTUS.

Trump's known to poll worse than he performs in elections and he's greatly expanded his lead with white evangelicals over the years, a key voting group for the Republican candidate.FiveThirtyEight's polling average gives Harris a 3-point advantage over Trump, slightly above former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 1.6 lead in 2016. In 2020, Biden had a nearly 7-point advantage at the same point in the election.\"Generally speaking Trump is currently polling between where he was in '16 and '20 as Election Day approached. That could change. The more it tightens up in the swing states—not nationally—the more likely he is to win,\" Michael Gordon, a principal at The Gordon Group and a Democratic strategist, told Newsweek.Polling from the New York Times paints a similar picture of the race. In 2020, Biden had an 8-point lead in September, a significantly greater lead than Clinton's 2-point lead in 2016. Harris is currently trailing Trump by 2 points, according to a New York Times poll from September 8.The poll was conducted before the presidential debate and Nate Cohn, chief political analyst for the New York Times noted that Harris leads in the New York Times polling average. Harris was widely regarded as the winner of the presidential debate and he noted it could be another week before any post-debate bump is realized in polls. However, it's possible the benefit she may have gotten from the debate could be tempered if people turn their attention to Sunday's assassination attempt on Trump instead of the debate.After the July shooting at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, many expected Trump to see a major boost in his polling like other presidents had after assassination attempts. Trump got promising news from some polls in the wake of the shooting, but overall, it didn't create a massive surge in support for him.Since 2020, Trump's increased his appeal with both men and women. Men were split evenly between Biden and Trump at this point in the 2020 election, but now, Trump has a 7-point lead over Harris with men, according to New York Times polling. Marist polling indicates a similar trend. In 2016, Trump had an 11-point advantage with male voters and in 2020, that lead shrunk to a 4-point lead. It's since increased to a 12-point lead, according to a September Marist poll.Harris still has a commanding lead when it comes to female voters, with a 15-point advantage over Trump. However, that's lower than Biden's 22-point lead at this point in the election and Clinton's 20-point advantage, according to Marist polling.Sabrina Karim, an associate professor at Cornell University, said in July she expects the gap between male and female voters to \"become starker\" as the election gets closer.\"Younger female voters might be more attracted to Vice President Harris, who stands in strong opposition to the hyper-masculine personality and policies of the Trump-Vance ticket. She appeals to younger women, who don't want to lose their rights and see in Harris someone who will fight for them,\" Karim said.Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, told The Hill that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris' vice president pick, could help her win over male voters. Seen as a \"man's man,\" Baker said Walz is the type of person who could connect with male voters who feel alienated by policies that have been \"very much tilted in favor of women.\"Trump prided himself on being the \"most pro-life president\" in America's history and evangelicals were critical of his 2016 election victory. He's taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade because of his Supreme Court justice nominees and he's seen his support among evangelicals increase since the 2016 election. His support among white evangelicals went from 73 percent in 2016, down to 70 percent in 2020, according to Marist polling. That support has since jumped to 82 percent, according to a September Marist poll.The Republican candidate is expected to retain his evangelical supporters, but he's sparked some anger among the key voting bloc as he tries to soften his stance on abortion.\"It's disastrous that he's attempted to run against his own track record,\" said Albert Mohler, a prominent evangelical and head of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told Politico. \"There is a real danger to the Trump campaign that pro-life voters just don't turn out for him with the intensity that he needs.\"Trump said last week that he'll vote no in November on the ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in Florida after implying he may vote to overturn the state's six-week abortion ban.Going too far on the issue of abortion, though, runs the risk of Trump losing the more moderate voters he needs to win in critical swing states.While polling can give an insight into the presidential election, Gordon said Trump's changed the game when it comes to predicting who will win.\"Among other things in the current political era, Trump has upended modern presidential polling. Both in 2016 when he won and 2020 when he lost, Trump outperformed the polls leading up to Election Day,\" Gordon said.","summary":"Trump's upended presidential polling and he finds himself somewhere between his standing in 2016 and in 2020.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-presidential-polls-election-2024-1954820","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2473005/donald-trump-polling-50-days-out-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:08:38","author":"Jenni Fink","authors":["Jenni Fink"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":256562634,"title":"Dems’ apocalyptic rhetoric about Trump only increased after first assassination attempt","text":"If Democrats didn’t believe they’d put Donald Trump in an assassin’s crosshairs the first time, they have no excuse for pleading ignorance now. Ryan Routh, the suspect who hid in the bushes at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf club waiting for his shot at former ex-president — AK-47-style rifled at the ready, serial number filed off — wasn’t some 20-year-old without a political paper trail, like the first would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks. Routh, 58, “frequently posted about politics” on X and other social media, had a Biden-Harris sticker on his truck, “and exclusively donated to Democratic candidates and causes dating back to 2019,” The Post reports. He even featured in a New York Times story last year highlighting his efforts to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight against Russia in Ukraine. Willing to fight in Ukraine himself — though the Ukrainians didn’t want him or his dubious recruits — Routh wanted to be a man of action, and he was prepared to kill for a cause. But if the cause of democracy in Ukraine was worth killing for, what about the safety of democracy right here in America? Routh took both literally and seriously Democrats and progressives who say Trump is a threat to America’s institutions and the rule of law itself. “DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose,” Routh wrote in a tweet to President Biden in April. You can’t lose if your opponent is dead — and if democracy itself is in danger, what conclusion can a desperate man of action draw? Instead of moderating their rhetoric, Trump’s critics only doubled down after the first assassination attempt. Days after the shooting, the anti-Trump Lincoln Project was again comparing Trump to Hitler. On July 19, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich called Trump “an existential danger to our democracy.” As recently as last week’s presidential debate, Kamala Harris accused Trump of “attacking the foundations of our democracy.” Democrats cut Trump no slack for calling on his supporters to protest “peacefully and patriotically” on Jan. 6, 2021, when some of them ran amok and invaded the Capitol. But Trump’s enemies don’t hold themselves to the same standard, when their own apocalyptic language incites a man like Routh to plan political murder. A man with a gun who wants to stop Vladimir Putin might well think slaying Trump would save lives — if, as Democrats and liberals in the media say, Trump is Putin’s stooge and would let him do whatever he wants to Ukraine. The political climate that inspired Routh encourages others like him. The media have been recklessly uncritical of the incendiary characterizations that Trump’s opponents — and many members of the media itself — have employed for years. Listening to the Democrats and watching MSNBC, a terrified man or woman might think the country is on the brink of dictatorship, and if ever there was a time when for pre-emptive violence, it must be now. For Democrats to denounce political violence while leading their supporters to think that freedom is finished if Trump wins isn’t just hypocritical, it’s culpable. Progressives have to find a way to argue against Trump without giving ammunition to the paranoid, self-righteous, and impulsive. Trump’s life is already in danger — just think about what happens if he wins. On election night, what will the people convinced Trump is a dictator do? This is the moment to bring the temperature down. It should have happened after the former president almost lost his life to an assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania. But little changed after that horrific incident: Democrats certainly didn’t treat it anything like January 6. They apparently aren’t examining their consciences now, either. Rachel Vindman, sister-in-law of the Democrats’ nominee for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District — and the wife of Alexander Vindman, a key figure in the first impeachment effort against President Trump in 2019 — tweeted after Routh’s attempted ambush of Trump, “No ears were harmed.” An audience member, Corey Comperatore, was killed in Butler on July 13, and the GOP nominee came within an inch of death — is this something Democrats like the Vindmans find funny? Too few Democrats take seriously the implications of their own words. They act as if Trump’s intemperance excuses greater intemperance on their part. If Trump goes too far — and sometimes he does — the Democrats have a duty not to go farther still, but to pull back. Yet they haven’t, so Trump remains in assassins’ sights.

A Trump supporter and the CEO of Tesla, Musk wrote on Sunday: \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,\" a post he ended with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow. He was quickly criticised by X users from the left and right, who said they were concerned his words to nearly 200 million followers could incite violence against Biden and Harris. Musk deleted the post but the Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, vice presidents and other notable officials, took notice. \"The Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence,\" a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. \"We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.\" The spokesperson declined to specify whether the agency had reached out to Musk, who seemed to suggest in follow-up posts that he had been making a joke.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-assassination-attempt-elon-musk-secret-service-joe-biden-kamala-harris-4611821","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--iXft_P1I--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-09-13t023113z_2_lynxmpek8c00s_rtroptp_3_xai-tesla.jpg?itok","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 23:01:00","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":256562764,"title":"'Depraved and disgraced Huw Edwards betrayed family, BBC, audiences and young victims'","text":"Depraved and disgraced, Huw Edwards betrayed his family, the BBC, audiences who trusted him and, most of all, the young victims of a despicable crime.

Poison politics The poisonous state of US politics is putting lives at risk on both sides of the divide, evidenced by another apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump. Ryan Routh, the man charged over the latest incident, is a disillusioned former Trump supporter who voted for him in 2016.

The families’ anguished objections to the resentencings meant nothing. Rosen’s comment that he hopes the families “find some measure of peace from knowing ”](a murderer) will die in prison” (“Life now instead of death penalty,” Page A1, Aug. 11) illustrates his folly. State Sen. David Cortese recently introduced a bill to allow prisoners serving life without the possibility of parole to apply for release after serving 25 years. Although this bill didn’t pass, who knows what will happen in the future that would give these worst-of-the-worst a chance for freedom?

Melissa is a dedicated advocate for education, with a proven track record of involvement in our community. Her commitment to student success and her collaborative approach make her an ideal candidate to address the challenges facing our schools. Melissa understands the importance of creating inclusive learning environments where all students can thrive. Her ability to listen, lead and build consensus is exactly what our district needs in a time of change.

Pragati Grover Saratoga Passing Prop. 6 will benefit state, economy Re: “Prop. 6 is not actually about inmate slavery” (Page A6, Sept. 12). The editorial recommending a no on Proposition 6 is incredibly disappointing and I’d very much argue misleading. These bills aren’t some bizarre push to allow prisoners to refuse to do any chores but an effort to finally expunge the last vestiges of de jure involuntary servitude and slavery from our system. The reasons are both moral (as we all agree slavery has no place in modern society), justice driven (as forced prison labor has historically been used to exploit minority groups for profit) as well as economic (studies by the ACLU have found that forced prison labor suppresses wages in the surrounding area). So this goes far beyond chores. In addition, this push isn’t new or untested. Six other states have already banned the practice, and forced prison labor isn’t a thing in the EU. It’s time for California to catch up; vote yes on Proposition 6. Christopher Dooner Sunnyvale Electoral College keeps coastal states in line For you nonbelievers let me say this about the Electoral College: Without it, a vast and significant number of Americans would have no say in our politics. All would be decided by the hugely liberal highly populated centers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. For those of you who are worried that Kamala Harris will lose, you should be more worried that she will win. Why? Because her platitudes for the multitudes will melt away and she will try to lead us so far left that you will be sorry. She may not be Marxist but her record is very far left.

Personally, I think he probably belongs in jail, but that is a matter for the justice system. I also think he is easily the worst president in American history and one of the very worst people in our national life. But my feelings have no bearing on his rights or his safety. He is an American, and I want him to be treated fairly in court. He is my fellow citizen, and I want him to walk our streets without being in danger. He is a candidate for public office in the United States, and I want our government to ensure his safety—I am willing to be taxed to pay for his security. If only Trump and his homunculus, J. D. Vance, cared as much about the safety of others as so many others care about theirs. My colleague David A. Graham has already noted the misery that Vance is bringing down on his own constituents in Ohio, using hatred against immigrants to set neighbors against one another, a conflict that has led to the closure of schools and the lockdown of two hospitals. Vance is a product of such a working-class town, but in reality he is an utterly synthetic politician, a power-seeking drone who will do almost anything to further his political fortunes. In this case, he is casting the innocent people of Springfield, Ohio, in his own obscene little drama about migrant savages roaming the streets of the heartland trying to sink their teeth into Fluffy and Fido. Sure, it’s a pack of lies—Vance admitted on CNN that he and Trump are “creating stories”—but it’s all for the greater good, you see, of advancing the career of the Hillbilly Senator. Trump, meanwhile, is turning the violence against him into fuel for more political hatred. In July, a young man—a loner with no obvious political agenda—tried to kill Trump in Pennsylvania, and almost did. And now another man is under arrest for a possible assassination attempt after being discovered near Trump’s golf course, apparently lying in wait for the former president. Once again, the suspect seems to be something of a weird loner who said on X that he voted for Trump in 2016 but in subsequent elections, according to federal campaign-finance records, began donating to Democrats. One might hope that these brushes with death would bring Trump a moment of reflection and, perhaps, even something like grace. But if Trump were capable of such a response, he wouldn’t be the man he is. After the attack in July, Trump engaged in a self-indulgent ramble at the GOP convention, but he did not blame the Democrats; he left that for his surrogates in the party. This time, he’s not even bothering with any of that outsourcing and is instead using this latest incident to blame his political opponents, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, for putting him in danger. He also blames the justice system and the charges brought against him—charges in multiple venues that have been filed in the name of the State of Georgia, the People of New York State, and the United States of America—for encouraging others to try to kill him. He posted this today on Truth Social and X, and I offer it here verbatim and in its entirety: In other words, Trump is blaming two possible attempts to kill him on pretty much anyone who isn’t an open partisan on his side, and that includes Biden, Harris, me, and millions of other Americans. Self-awareness is not part of Trump’s personality: He is complaining about overheated rhetoric while constantly spewing such rhetoric himself. He has called Harris various names, and he refers to everyone else he doesn’t like as “vermin” and “scum” and other insults. (Today he called the sitting president and vice president of the United States “the enemy from within.”) Many of Trump’s political opponents and public critics have been the targets of plots and threats, including a pipe-bombing campaign. At this point, with two apparent plots against him foiled, a more thoughtful person would consider what he could do to help turn down the temperature in the nation. But again, Trump is not that kind of man. America, however, has had such leaders. Many of Trump’s supporters on social media, afflicted with short memories and a lack of historical awareness, seem to believe that the attacks on Trump are unprecedented. Two assassination attempts in about two months is indeed horrifying, but it is not unprecedented: In 1975, President Gerald Ford survived two such attempts in fewer than three weeks. One assailant was a woman from West Virginia named Sara Jane Moore. The other was an acolyte of the murderer Charles Manson, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme. Both of them came within feet of killing Ford. Ford was a decent man and an underrated president, and he certainly had enemies, especially after pardoning Richard Nixon. (Moore was obsessed with the Vietnam War and thought that assassinating Ford would spark a violent national revolution.) But he did not blame his opponents for the attempts on his life. He did not blame America, or the courts, or anyone else. He also did not use the attacks by Moore and Fromme to fundraise: Trump used his attacks to beat the bushes for money within a few hours. Instead, Ford acceded to the Secret Service’s request that he start wearing a trench coat with a zip-in Kevlar vest. (It was very uncomfortable and he disliked wearing it.) He then went back out in public and conducted a presidential campaign, which he lost. Trump doesn’t deserve to be the target of violence any more than his opponents do, even if his own rhetoric has inspired multiple threats against public figures—and, of course, a seditious riot. We are a better country, and a better people, than Trump, and every good American citizen should insist on his protection and his safety. But he and Vance seem unable to insist on ours—a fundamental duty of elected officials—and this makes them unfit to hold any American public office.

Routh wrote that he once voted for Trump and must take part of the blame for the “child that we elected for our next president that ended up being brainless.” Routh, 58, was arrested Sunday and charged Monday after authorities say he stalked the GOP presidential nominee as he golfed in West Palm Beach, Florida, with an AK-47-style rifle in an apparent assassination attempt thwarted by the Secret Service. Through his voluminous online footprint, public records, news interviews and videos, a picture emerged of Routh as a man with a criminal past, plenty of outrage and views ranging from the left to the right, including support for Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, Nikki Haley and Trump. Voter records show he registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina in 2012, most recently voting in person during the state’s Democratic primary in March. Routh also made 19 small donations totaling $140 since 2019 through ActBlue, a political action committee that distributes donations to Democratic candidates, according to federal campaign finance records. In a tweet in June 2020, after the police killing of George Floyd, Routh said then-President Trump could win reelection by issuing an executive order to prosecute police misconduct. However, in recent years, his posts appear to have soured on Trump, and he expressed support for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. “DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose,” he wrote on X in April in support of Biden. In July, following the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, a post on Routh’s account urged Biden and Harris to visit those wounded in the shooting and attend the funeral of the firefighter who was killed. “Trump will never do anything for them,” Routh wrote. In his book, listed on Amazon and viewed by the AP, Routh noted: “I get so tired of people asking me if I am a Democrat or Republican as I refuse to be put in a category.” The world would be better if it were run by women, he wrote in the book that has links to his website and X account, because “it seems that the totality of the world’s problems revolve around men with massive insecurity and childlike intelligence and behavior.” He posted frequently on social media about Ukraine and other conflicts, and had a website seeking to raise money and recruit volunteers to fight for Kyiv. A photo of the wiry, wild-haired Routh on his site shows him smiling, wearing a T-shirt and jacket adorned with U.S. flags. “This is about good versus evil,” Routh said in a video circulating online. And in a tweet, he said, “I am going to fight and die for Ukraine.” Video shot by the AP showed Routh at a small demonstration in Kyiv’s Independence Square in April 2022, two months after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of the country. A placard he was holding said: “We cannot tolerate corruption and evil for another 50+ years. End Russia for our kids.” That same day, he also visited a makeshift memorial to “Foreigners killed by Putin.” But Routh never served in the Ukrainian army or worked with its military, said Oleksandr Shahuri of the Foreigners Coordination Department of the Ukrainian Ground Forces Command. Shahuri told AP that Routh periodically contacted the International Legion of Ukraine with what he described as “nonsensical ideas” that “can best be described as delusional.” Routh appeared in a video standing in front of the U.S. Capitol and expressing frustration that Ukraine wasn’t taking more of the Afghan commandos he tried to recruit. “They’re afraid that anybody and everybody is a Russian spy,” he told news website Semafor in 2023. Earlier this year, he even tweeted at singers Bruno Mars and Dave Matthews to organize a “We are the World”-style effort for Kyiv. “We need an emotional tribute song for Ukraine as support stalls,” he wrote. “I have lyrics and music.” Routh also tweeted to former basketball star Dennis Rodman, asking for help lifting sanctions against North Korea to ease tension with the country. In another, he invites a dozen protesters in Hong Kong to stay at his Hawaii home to escape a Chinese crackdown. Routh lived most of his life in Greensboro, North Carolina, where his run-ins with law enforcement included a 2002 felony conviction for possessing explosives, detonation cord and a blasting cap, according to court records. The News & Record of Greensboro reported that the arrest came after Routh fled from a traffic stop and held off police for three hours with “a fully automatic machine gun” at a roofing business. State records listed him as the business owner. Court records show authorities seized the explosives and an undefined number of firearms from Routh. As part of a plea deal, Routh agreed to undergo a mental health evaluation and comply with any treatment recommendations. The documents provided to the AP by the county clerk of court on Monday do not include the results of that evaluation. Records also show Routh was convicted of a felony count of possession of stolen goods in 2010, as well as misdemeanors including illegally carrying a concealed weapon, a hit-and-run, speeding and driving with a revoked license. Court records from the 2010 felony case say detectives determined Routh was storing stolen building supplies and other items at his roofing business warehouse, where he was living at the time. Money from the sale of the stolen goods was used to purchase crack cocaine, according to a police affidavit used to get a search warrant. In both the felony cases, court records show judges sentenced Routh to either probation or a suspended sentence, allowing him to escape prison time. It was not immediately clear how Routh was able to obtain a weapon. In most states, it is generally forbidden for a person convicted of a felony to purchase or possess a firearm. In 2018, Routh moved to the small town of Kaaawa, Hawaii, about 45 minutes outside Honolulu, to go in business with his adult son building small wooden sheds. According to his LinkedIn page, the structures would “help address the highest homelessness rate in the United States due to unparalleled gentrification.” “All of us are tired of seeing the homeless people all over the island with nowhere to go,” he told Honolulu’s Star-Advertiser in 2019. No one answered the door Sunday at his blue stucco house near the beach that is colorfully painted with wooden cutouts of fish. A white pickup truck with a Biden-Harris bumper sticker and a flat tire was in the driveway. Neighbor Christopher Tam said Routh kept to himself and was respectful, cordial and kind. “It’s just been very surprising,” Tam said. “If he did have anything to do with it, it’s very shocking to us.”","summary":"Ryan Wesley Routh portrayed himself online as a man who built housing for homeless people in Hawaii, tried to recruit fighters for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, and described his support and then disdain for Donald Trump — even urging Iran to kill him.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/16/radical-suspect-ryan-wesley-routh-urged-trump-assassination-before/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24260640585004.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:57:46","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":256562568,"title":"Suspect in Trump assassination attempt may have lain in wait for 12 hours","text":"WASHINGTON: A man suspected of hiding for nearly 12 hours in an apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course was charged with two gun-related crimes on Monday (Sep 16), a day after authorities said he was spotted in the bushes with a rifle as the former US president played nearby. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, was unharmed as the suspect never had Trump in his line of sight and did not fire any shots. But the incident raised questions about how an armed suspect was able to get so close to him, just two months after another gunman fired at Trump during a Jul 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear with a bullet. Trump's visit to his golf course in West Palm Beach was not on his public schedule, Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters on Monday afternoon, and it was not clear whether the suspect knew Trump would be there. The Secret Service opened fire after an agent sweeping the course saw a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes a few hundred yards away from the former president, who was on the fairway of the fifth hole. The gunman fled in a sports utility vehicle, according to the complaint. Officers found a loaded assault-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag of food left behind. A suspect, identified on Monday as Ryan Routh, 58, was arrested about 40 minutes later driving north on Interstate 95. The licence plate on his vehicle had been reportedly stolen from another car. Records show a phone associated with Routh was located at the golf course starting at 1.59am (5.59am GMT) on Sunday morning, eleven-and-a-half hours before the incident. The suspect was on the \"public side\" of a fence along the golf course's boundary, Rowe said. Routh was the subject of a 2019 tip to the FBI alleging that he was a convicted felon who illegally possessed a firearm, Jeffrey Veltri, the agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, told reporters. The complainant was unable to verify the information when the FBI investigated the tip, Veltri said. Routh made a brief appearance in federal court in West Palm Beach on Monday, where he was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow. The defendant invoked his right to an attorney when investigators sought to question him, Rowe said. In 2002, Routh pleaded guilty in North Carolina to possession of an unregistered fully automatic gun, defined in state law as a weapon of mass destruction, according to the county district attorney's office, and was sentenced to probation. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010. Trump's campaign schedule will remain unchanged, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. Trump blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, for the apparent assassination attempt. He claimed the suspected gunman was acting on Democrats' \"highly inflammatory language\", though authorities have not yet offered evidence of any motive. \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country - both from the inside and out,\" he said, according to Fox. Both Biden and Harris decried the incident, and Biden also spoke with Trump on Monday. \"President Biden just spoke with former President Trump, and conveyed his relief that he is safe. The two shared a cordial conversation and former President Trump expressed his thanks for the call,\" the White House said in a statement. Trump, in a statement to CNN, called it a \"very nice call\".","summary":"The suspect never had Trump in his line of sight and did not fire any shots.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-golf-suspect-lain-wait-4611816","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--AVS9Mbes--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-09-16t140509z_1_lynxmpek8f0hr_rtroptp_3_usa-election-trump","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:57:07","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":-0.687},{"id":256564834,"title":"Secret Service chief makes remarkable admission: We need a 'paradigm shift'","text":"The acting director of the U.S. Secret Service said the agency needs to undergo a complete overhaul of how it protects presidents — a remarkable admission following a second apparent attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump within two months. “Coming out of Butler, I have ordered a paradigm shift,” Ronald Rowe said at a news conference Monday, referring to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. “The Secret Service's protective methodologies work and they are sound, and we saw that yesterday.” But, he added, “we need to get out of a reactive model, and get to a readiness model.” Rowe did not go into detail about his vision for the nearly 160-year-old agency. His comments come at a pivotal moment for the Secret Service. The agency has been under heavy scrutiny since a gunman managed to fire several rounds at Trump at the rally in Pennsylvania, striking his ear, in what was the Secret Service's biggest security failure since President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in 1981. One person was killed at the July 13 rally, and two others were injured. The incident on Sunday, which the FBI called an apparent attempted assassination of Trump, unfolded at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle poking out of the bushes outside the course, according to officials. The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, had been in the vicinity for nearly 12 hours, according to a criminal complaint. Routh was taken into custody later Sunday and charged with federal gun crimes. The Trump campaign asked the Secret Service for increased security on Monday morning, two sources familiar with the request told NBC News. It's not clear how the Secret Service has responded to that request. When asked about it, Rowe sidestepped the question. “I’ve had a conversation with the former president,” he said. “The president is aware that he has the highest levels of protection that the Secret Service provides.” “We constantly evaluate based on threat,” he added. “If we need to ratchet it up additionally, we will.” The Secret Service has dramatically increased Trump’s security since the shooting on July 13, according to two sources familiar with the agency’s response. The increased security includes more people and more technology. One source said the Secret Service is doing all it can to protect Trump while also preparing for the United Nations General Assembly next week and protecting President Joe Biden, Sen. J.D. Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and others. That source said that additional resources would require additional funding from Congress. Rowe conceded as much at the news conference. “The Secret Service operates under a paradox of zero fail mission but also that we have done more with less for decades,” he said. “And this goes back many, many decades. What I can tell you is we have immediate needs right now.” Protecting the former president at an outdoor venue like a golf course poses particular challenges, especially when Trump makes an impromptu decision to play a few holes. But multiple former FBI agents questioned how a man was able to take a position so close to the former president and stay hidden there for so long. \"That to me is really unsettling,\" said Evy Poumpouras, a former Secret Service agent who protected multiple presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, during her 12 years with the agency. \"How did he get there, take that position for 12 hours and nobody saw that? Nobody did a perimeter sweep?\" she added in an interview on MSNBC. The Secret Service is chronically understaffed: The arm of the agency that protects presidents, vice presidents and their families is nearly 10% smaller than it was a decade ago. Yet while the requests for extra personnel and equipment from Trump’s agents have been repeatedly declined over the past two years, no resource requests were denied for the Pennsylvania rally where Trump was shot, a Secret Service official told NBC News in July. The problem does not appear to be a financial issue: government filings show the Secret Service’s budget nearly doubled over the last decade while staffing agencywide rose by nearly 25%. Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who has worked on protective details for presidential candidates, including Sen. John Kerry in 2004, said it was “pretty clear at this point that we need extra personnel for President Trump.” “If this had been President Biden and he was golfing on the golf course, there would be a several-block security buffer around that golf course,” he said on Monday. “Yes, former presidents don’t get that same level of protection, but that level of protection adjusts based on known threat level.” “Why, at this point, seven weeks out from an election, a major presidential candidate doesn’t have additional security personnel to secure the perimeter of his golf course?” Cangelosi added. “That’s the question that should be asked at this point.”","summary":"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe says the agency needs to undergo a complete overhaul of how it protects presidents.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/secret-service-chief-makes-remarkable-admission-need-paradigm-shift-rcna171390","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240916-Ronald-Rowe-Jr-se-550p-f83f0f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:57:06","author":"Elizabeth Chuck,Jake Traylor,Julia Ainsley,Rich Schapiro","authors":["Elizabeth Chuck","Jake Traylor","Julia Ainsley","Rich Schapiro"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":256561780,"title":"Second Apparent Assassination Attempt on Trump Provokes Calls for Tighter Security","text":"Two failed attempts to assassinate former President Donald Trump in just over two months has exposed apparent holes in the shield that is supposed to protect him. Now, leaders from both major political parties are calling for tighter security as Trump continues his presidential campaign. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who heads a bipartisan task force probing the July 13 Pennsylvania assassination attempt that wounded Trump, said the Sept. 15 attempt in Florida underscores his concerns. “This should be a wake-up call to America about just how dangerous ... things are right now” for the nation’s top political leaders, Kelly told The Epoch Times in a Sept. 16 interview. He said those concerns should be particularly acute for Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “Two times now, there’s been an attempt to assassinate him,” the Pennsylvania congressman said, begging the question: “What is it that is taking place right now that there’s not enough security ahead of time?” Democrats, including President Joe Biden, joined Kelly and other Republicans in decrying violence against the former president, who is in the thick of a presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election. The Secret Service “needs more help,” and Congress should respond to that need, Biden told reporters on Sept. 16. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said the Senate is prepared to provide more funding “if the Secret Service is in need of more resources.” Such statements trouble Kelly. “Have we become that casual about protective services?” he asked. He notes that other former presidents are still “walking around out there,” and heightened protection is warranted, particularly following an assassination attempt. Johnson said, “President Trump needs the most coverage of anyone. He’s the most attacked. He’s the most threatened, even probably more than when he was in the Oval Office. So we are demanding in the House that he has every asset available, and we will make more available if necessary. I don’t think it’s a funding issue. I think it’s a manpower allocation.” The July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, was well-publicized, giving the suspected gunman “all kinds of lead time” to stake out the grounds and make other plans for the shooting, Kelly noted. In contrast, only a select few people should have known about the former president’s Sept. 15 outing at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, Kelly said. “How did that guy know to be on that golf course that day?” Kelly said that suggests the gunman “somehow ... got information from somebody” before Trump’s arrival. The Epoch Times asked the Trump campaign how far in advance the former president’s golf outing was planned but received no response before publication. “On a Sunday afternoon, when the president decides to go golfing at his own golf course, and somehow this shooter turns up at that same spot, in the same time with the same objective as the shooter at Butler had—and that was to kill the [former] president of the United States,” Kelly said. A Secret Service agent spotted a gun barrel protruding through the perimeter fence and fired at the spot where the apparent would-be assassin was lying in wait; the man fled without firing a shot. Police stopped Routh’s vehicle a short time later and arrested him. He faces two federal firearms charges. Trump and many others have commended the Secret Service for their quick action, which included shielding Trump after an agent spotted the rifle. The Secret Service was commended for rapidly shielding Trump in Butler, too, although the agency faced criticism for failing to secure the rooftop where the suspected gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had positioned himself when he fired at Trump. Multiple rally attendees had alerted police about Crooks before the former president appeared on stage at the Butler Farm Show, prompting questions and concerns over why the candidate was allowed to take the stage. Kelly reiterated that his task force is committed to finding answers about the attacks on Trump; Johnson said congressional hearings about the Butler assassination attempt could be convened next week. “We take for granted too much the fact that we are safe and secure, and we’re always going to be that way because we’re America. I think we’ve shown that we’re very vulnerable in a lot of different areas, and we'd better wake up about what’s going on in our country, in our nation, in a world that’s very much upside-down right now,” Kelly said. “I’m telling people: ‘Please do not take for granted that our freedoms and our liberties are always going to be there, that we’re going to be able to defend them.” In a Sept. 16 report, Hawley stated that the lead agent for Trump’s Butler visit and rally “failed a key examination during their federal law enforcement training to become a Secret Service agent.” In addition, Secret Service agents who were supposed to team up with state and local officers on reports of suspicious persons “were absent from the Butler rally.” Finally, Hawley represented that the hospital where Trump was treated for the injury to his right ear was “poorly secured.” The Epoch Times has sought comment from the Secret Service but received no response prior to publication.","summary":"Republicans and Democrats alike express concerns and call for additional measures to protect the former president in the 2024 election campaign.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/second-apparent-assassination-attempt-on-trump-provokes-calls-for-tighter-security-5725074","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/16/id5725087-GettyImages-2167846419-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:47:44","author":"Janice Hisle","authors":["Janice Hisle"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":256562432,"title":"Elon Musk deletes post about Harris and Biden assassination after widespread condemnation","text":"Article content Elon Musk has deleted a post on his social media platform X in which he said “no one is even trying to assassinate” President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the wake of an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump while he was playing golf. Musk, who has nearly 200 million followers on the social media site he bought for $44 billion in 2022, has increasingly embraced conservative ideologies in recent years and endorsed Trump for president. While he has removed posts in the past, Musk has also kept up and even doubled down on other such inflammatory comments. Last week, he made a joke about impregnating Taylor Swift after the singer posted an endorsement for Harris. Early Monday, after taking down the post about the apparent Trump assassination, the 53-year-old billionaire wrote on the platform: “Well, one lesson I’ve learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn’t mean it’s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.” The original post was in response to DogeDesigner, one of the 700 accounts that Musk follows, who asked: “Why they want to kill Donald Trump?” Musk’s reply was quickly condemned by many X users, and “DeportElonMusk” began trending on X on Monday morning. “Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about,” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates in response to Musk’s post. “This rhetoric is irresponsible.”","summary":"'One lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X'","url":"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/elon-musk-assassination-tweet","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Elon-Musk-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:41:48","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":256561714,"title":"Hillary Clinton condemns Elon Musk’s ‘creepy’ message to Taylor Swift: ‘Another way of saying rape’","text":"Hillary Clinton has condemned Elon Musk’s “rotten and creepy” social media message to Taylor Swift, describing it as “another way of saying rape.” Clinton argued that Musk was acting as a mouthpiece for Donald Trump after Swift endorsed his rival Kamala Harris in the upcoming US presidential election.

It just is beyond my imagination. “When I see Trump, or I see him, this whole cast of MAGA characters, and especially the so-called masters of the universe in the technology world… misogyny is such a part of their worldview, and they gravitate toward toughness and brutality and machoism.

They can’t stand it. “I think [Swift’s endorsement] was really going to trigger Trump. If it had happened before the debate it would have overpowered the debate. The fact that it happened right after the debate and just added to Kamala’s momentum must have just set them all off.” Following the endorsement, Trump angrily declared “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on his Truth Social platform. “We’re pretty sure it’s Safe (& Sound) to say Donald Trump’s week has him Down Bad. Mr Not-at-all-Fine has spent this week working through his feelings, whining about his Champagne Problems,” the statement began. It went on to recount Trump’s week of “rambling, yelling and constant conspiracy theories,” which included his recent visit to New York’s 9/11 memorial ceremony, where he was accompanied by far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has a history of pushing 9/11 conspiracy theories. “Call It What You Want, but It’s Nothing New for the Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” the statement added.","summary":"The former US Secretary of State offered her view on Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala Harris","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/hillary-clinton-elon-musk-taylor-swift-donald-trump-rape-b2613914.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/16/23/MixCollage-16-Sep-2024-02-58-PM-5956.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1t1scSfa-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:41:43","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":256564838,"title":"Donald Trump misrepresents his push to repeal the Affordable Care Act","text":"WASHINGTON — To hear Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance tell it, he wasn’t trying to eliminate the Affordable Care Act as president. He “saved” it. In the presidential debate and in recent TV interviews, Trump and Sen. Vance, R-Ohio, have depicted the former president as selflessly choosing to protect the ACA, or “Obamacare,” during his four years in office as a way to put country over politics. “Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It’s not very good today. … I had a choice to make when I was president: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away,” Trump said at the recent ABC News debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. “And I saved it. I did the right thing.” On NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday, Vance echoed his remarks by saying Trump “actually protected those 20 million Americans from losing their health coverage” and “chose to build upon” the ACA when he “could’ve destroyed” it. Vance added: “It illustrates Donald Trump’s entire approach to governing, which is to fix problems.” Both Trump and Vance are misrepresenting the facts. As president, Trump fought to repeal and undo the ACA using executive action, legislation and lawsuits. “Trump was not successful as president in undoing the ACA, but it was not for lack of trying,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonpartisan research group. “Trump encouraged congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, and then took administrative steps to try to weaken it when the legislative route failed.” On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order proclaiming: “It is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.” He ordered agencies to “exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions they deemed burdensome. Trump made good on his promise to pursue repeal. It was the first major item on the Republican-led Congress’ agenda in 2017. In May, the House passed the American Health Care Act, a bill to undo ACA subsidies and regulations, which was projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to lead to 23 million fewer people with insurance. Trump celebrated its passage in a triumphant Rose Garden ceremony alongside House Republicans. “Make no mistake: This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Trump said at the time. The effort fell one vote short in the Senate as three Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona — joined Democrats to vote it down. Trump has since repeatedly criticized McCain for his now-iconic thumbs down on the Senate floor. The legislative push was never revived, with one exception: Trump and Republicans succeeded at zeroing out the ACA’s tax penalty for most Americans who failed to buy insurance. But Trump persisted in seeking other ways to take aim at the ACA. He leaned on his executive power and his administration slashed funding for programs to advertise and promote ACA sign-ups. Enrollment dipped the following year, in 2018, with some blaming the cuts in funding. “He cut outreach by 90% and funding for community-based navigators by 84%, making it harder for people to sign up,” Levitt said, referring to individuals who helped Americans sign up for Obamacare plans. “He expanded short-term insurance plans that do not have to follow the ACA’s rules, including coverage of pre-existing conditions.” That fall, Democrats put a dagger in the legislative efforts to undo President Barack Obama’s signature achievement when they won control of the House, in part by campaigning on protecting the ACA. But even as other Republicans sought to abandon what they came to see as a losing political fight, Trump was undeterred. In 2020, he endorsed a lawsuit that would have wiped out the ACA entirely. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Trump administration formally asked the justices to rule for the challengers and terminate the law, despite the political risks as he sought re-election. The court upheld the ACA the following year. By then, Trump had lost the election and Joe Biden was president. Now, as he seeks a comeback in 2024, Trump has occasionally brought up his desire to revisit the ACA battle, calling for replacing the law last fall and declaring that “Obamacare Sucks.” This year, Trump’s campaign has softened its rhetoric against the ACA while still calling for alternatives. Trump admitted he doesn't have a replacement plan. “I have concepts of a plan,” Trump said at last week's debate, adding that there are “concepts and options” for a better and cheaper system that he’ll outline “in the not-too-distant future.” Asked when Trump will roll out his plan, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not provide a timeline. “As President Trump said, he will release more details but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the market place,\" Leavitt said. \"This is a stark contrast to Kamala Harris’ support for a socialist government takeover of our health care system which would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” Harris is running on a platform of preserving the ACA, without offering specifics on how she would make good on her call for expanding coverage. She has abandoned her 2019 position of putting all Americans in Medicare. On the campaign trail, the Democratic nominee is seizing on Trump’s debate remarks. “He has ‘concepts of a plan.’ Concepts of a plan,” she said Thursday at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Which means no actual plan.” “And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act,” she said. “So, understand what that means. He’s going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering.”","summary":"Republican Donald Trump and JD Vance are rewriting history on Obamacare, insisting Trump \"saved\" the Affordable Care Act when he fought repeatedly to undo it.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-misrepresents-repeal-affordable-care-act-obamacare-rcna171293","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240916-donald-trump-jd-vance-se-1120a-8e9875.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:41:32","author":"Sahil Kapur","authors":["Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":256563914,"title":"Where the Secret Service Goes From Here","text":"More Must-Reads from TIME How Kamala Harris Knocked Donald Trump Off Course Introducing TIME's 2024 Latino Leaders George Lopez Is Transforming Narratives With Comedy How to Make an Argument That’s Actually Persuasive What Makes a Friendship Last Forever? 33 True Crime Documentaries That Shaped the Genre Why Gut Health Issues Are More Common in Women The 100 Most Influential People in AI 2024 Contact us at letters@time.com","summary":"Agency rethinking how it protects current and former Presidents","url":"https://time.com/7021813/secret-service-funding-trump-shooter/","image":"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171706336.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:40:17","author":"Brian Bennett","authors":["Brian Bennett"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.611},{"id":256561546,"title":"Donald Trump's 'Off-the-Record' Golf Trip Explained by Secret Service","text":"Former President Donald Trump's visit to his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday was an \"off-the-record\" plan, according to U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr.A suspect, 58-year-old Ryan Routh, has been taken into custody in connection to the apparent assassination attempt against Trump while the former president was playing golf at the Trump International Golf Club in southern Florida over the weekend. It is the second assassination attempt on the former president amid this year's election, following a shooting at his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left Trump with an injury to the tip of his right ear.No injuries were reported after the incident over the weekend and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation.Law enforcement said that a Secret Service agent spotted the suspect poking the barrel of a rile out of a bush-lined fence within 500 yards of the former president on Sunday. That agent opened fire at Routh who fled the scene by vehicle and was later taken into custody in a nearby county.As Rowe Jr. explained to reporters during a press briefing Monday afternoon, Trump was not originally scheduled to be at the golf course Sunday and described the trip as an \"off-the-record movement.\"\"The protective methodologies of the Secret Service were effective yesterday,\" Rowe Jr. said who assumed the position after the former USSS director Kimberly Cheatle resigned amid increased scrutiny for how the service handled security at Trump's Butler rally.Rowe Jr. told reporters that there was \"no posting up of\" the location because the former president \"wasn't supposed to have gone there in the first place.\" He emphasized, however, that the Secret Service takes a \"layered approach\" to securing the former president, including agents \"sweeping\" the area ahead of Trump as he was playing golf.\"That's what identified this individual who was in that woodline,\" Rowe Jr. said Monday. \"And the swift action of that agent doing his job, pushing out ahead, sweeping while the president was behind him, several hundred yards and several holes away, out of sight from the gunman.\"Rowe Jr. added that at this point in the investigation there is no information on if or how Routh knew Trump was going to be at the golf course.Trump returned to Florida over the weekend after several campaign stops along the West Coast late last week. The Associated Press reported that the Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump as he played Sunday but that there are \"several areas around the perimeter of the property\" where golfers can be seen from the club's fence line.The AP added that Secret Service agents and other law enforcement are often in golf carts and ATVs securing the area several holes ahead and behind Trump as he plays golf, which is a frequent pastime of the former president's. The agents often also bring an armored vehicle onto the course in the case that Trump needs to take shelter quickly.Rowe Jr. told reporters Monday that the current security presence at and around the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach County is \"not much\" different from when Trump was in office between 2017 and 2021.\"There is heavy uniform presence out there,\" he added.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for additional comment on Monday.The acting USSS director repeatedly praised his agents for \"rising to meet an unprecedented and hyper-dynamic threat environment\" in light of Trump's assassination attempt earlier this summer. Rowe Jr. also highlighted President Joe Biden's efforts to increase assets for the Secret Service following the rally in Butler. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump this November, have denounced political violence following Sunday's incident.\"We have great support, not only from President Biden,\" Rowe Jr. said, but from members of Congress as well.\"I've been up to the Hill last week,\" he added. \"We are continuing to have those conversations. But the long and short of it is this, coming out of Butler, [Pennsylvania], I have ordered a paradigm shift.\"","summary":"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. told reporters that the former president was not originally scheduled to be at the golf course Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-off-record-golf-trip-explained-secret-service-1954808","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2472966/trumps-off-record-golf-trip-explained.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:38:38","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.654},{"id":256561626,"title":"Springfield schools evacuated yet again over ‘threats’ after Trump’s lies about Haitian immigrants","text":"Two more schools and two college campuses in Springfield, Ohio have been evacuated amid a surge in anti-immigrant invective driven in part by former president Donald Trump and his allies. Leaders at Wittenberg University and Clark State College said on Monday that they would hold all classes virtually this week and cancel all on-campus events after receiving threats. The Springfield City School District (SCSD) also told local broadcaster WHIO that students at Simon Kenton Elementary School and Kenwood Elementary School had been moved to other facilities due to information received from local police. SCSD officials did not describe the nature of these threats, only saying that these were the fifth and sixth SCSD buildings to receive such threats in the past week. “Late [on] Saturday Sep 14, the college received an email threat via the admissions link on our website, which raised concerns about a possible shooting,” said Clark State College in a public bulletin. “On Sunday, we received an email of a bomb threat to the Springfield campus.” Wittenberg likewise said it was facing “ongoing threats” which were currently being assessed by local police and the FBI. Haitian immigrants in Springfield have been targeted by a storm of racist conspiracy theories over the past few weeks, following months of agitation from far-right groups apparently including the Ku Klux Klan. Last week, after Trump and his running mate JD Vance embraced false claims that Haitian residents have been eating their neighbors' dogs and cats, threats of violence temporarily forced the closure of government buildings, a cultural festival, two elementary schools, and a middle school. Ohio governor Mike DeWine said on Monday that law enforcement agencies had investigated “at least 33 separate bomb threats”, all of which turned out to be fake, and said at least some of them had come from overseas. “I want to say to the parents in Springfield: these threats have all been hoaxes. None of them have panned out,” said DeWine. \"We have people, unfortunately, overseas who are taking these actions. some of them are coming from one particular country. We think that this is one more opportunity to mess with the United States, and they're continuing to do that. \"So we cannot let the bad guys win. Our schools must remain open.\" Between 12,000 and 20,000 Haitians are estimated to live in Springfield, according to The New York Times. Many have moved there in the last few years thanks to a successful push by city and business leaders to attract new workers to the once-struggling town, whose population had dwindled from about 80,000 in the early 1970s to under 60,000 in 2015. That effort, combined with word of mouth within the Haitian community, has made the city a magnet for people and families granted a temporary right to remain and work in the US due to worsening gang violence and civil war in the Caribbean republic, which was founded in 1804 after a successful slave revolt. The influx has reportedly revived Springfield's economy but increased the strain on local schools, health services, and housing, causing intense debate that was only exacerbated when a Haitian man driving without a valid licence crashed into a school bus in August 2023. Last week, Trump spuriously declared during his nationally televized debate with Kamala Harris that Haitians in Springfield were “eating the dogs... they’re eating the cats”. Ohio senator JD Vance defended his words, as did many Republicans. Nevertheless, these claims appear to have zero basis in fact. Multiple viral photos, posts, and videos trumpeted as proof of Haitian animal abuse have turned out to be nothing of the sort, and the author of one widely-reported Facebook post has admitted that she “[didn’t] have any proof” for its claims. Springfield mayor Rob Rue told CNN on Sunday that he and other officials had also received threats. \"It would be helpful,\" he said, if politicians \"understood the weight of their words and how they could harm a community like ours.\"","summary":"Ohio governor Mike DeWine said there had been at 33 hoax bomb threats in recent days, at least some of which came from overseas","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/springfield-ohio-schools-threats-haitians-b2613918.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/16/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EbPkO2aQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:35:29","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":256561350,"title":"Trump blames assassination attempts on Dems, political rhetoric, migrants","text":"Someone is to blame for the political violence stalking former President Donald Trump’s campaign for a second term, and it isn’t necessarily the guy allegedly found with a gun outside his West Palm Beach golf club over the weekend, according to the former president. Even while Ryan Wesley Routh — the 58-year-old man allegedly at the center of an apparent second assassination attempt against former President in as many months — was in court to face federal weapons charges on Monday, the 45th President took at Democrats and his political rivals in series of statements. “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust,” the Republican nominee wrote, capitalization his. “Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse,” he wrote. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he felt Routh, who fled the scene of the alleged crime after secret service agents opened fire on him, had chosen to attempt violence because he “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” President Joe Biden has described Trump as a “threat to the very soul of this nation” and argued against his “demagoguery.” “Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to democracy,” Biden said the day before the first assassination attempt, after relating Trump’s stated plan to “be a dictator on day one” if he’s reelected. Vice President Kamala Harris said in April that “it’s on us to recognize the threat he poses—the choice is clear in November.” “Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms,” she said in July. However, despite Trump’s rush to blame his political opponents for the elevated state of rhetoric in the race, both he and his campaign have used identical or similar language to describe Harris and Biden. Trump and his team have additionally spent the length of Biden’s presidency declaring that the United States is already a failed nation and that the country has been lost because of Democratic policies. He said as much again at the debate. “FACT CHECK: The Greatest Threat To Democracy Is Joe Biden,” his campaign wrote in a late June press release. In August, after it became clear that Harris had secured the delegate support required to replace Biden at the top of the party ticket, Trump’s campaign said that “Democrats are the real ‘threat to democracy.’” “’Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.’ No, she is a threat to — she is a threat to democracy,” Trump said during a rally in Tucson held September 12. “We must defeat comrade Kamala Harris, a radical left lunatic. And we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda once and for all. If they get in, we’re never going to be able to turn this country around,” he said just days later. In handing out blame on Monday, Trump also turned his attention to the “millions of people, from places unknown” whom he claims Harris has allowed to “INVADE and take over our Country.” “Our borders must be closed, and the terrorists, criminals, and mentally insane, immediately removed from American cities and towns, deported back to their counties of origin. We want people to come into our country, but they must love our nation, and come in legally and through a system of merit. The world is laughing at us as fools, they are stealing our jobs and our wealth. We cannot let them laugh any longer,” he wrote in all caps, presumably meaning “countries of origin.”","summary":"“The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust,” the Republican nominee wrote, capitalization his.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/16/trump-blames-assassination-attempts-on-dems-political-rhetoric-migrants/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24257650242452.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:34:17","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":256561464,"title":"These states will decide the election.

This incident on Sunday comes just nine weeks after the July assassination attempt of the former president. Below is a timeline detailing how the events unfolded. Sunday, Sept. 15 Approximately 1:59 a.m. Suspect’s phone appears near the scene Phone records indicate that suspect Ryan Wesley Routh’s mobile device was located in the vicinity of the Trump International Golf Club tree line from approximately 1:59 a.m. to approximately 1:31 p.m., according to the criminal complaint. Approximately 1:31 p.m., Secret Service spots a rifle and fires shots A Secret Service Special agent was walking the perimeter of the golf club, where Trump was golfing at, when the agent spotted a rifle poking out of the tree line at 1:31 p.m., the criminal complaint said. Officials confirmed Trump was “one or two” holes behind the alleged gunman – about 300 to 500 yards away – and the Secret Service fired four to six rounds before the suspect fled. Approximately 2:14 p.m., suspect stopped, detained A witness previously informed officials they saw someone jump out of the bushes before providing the suspect’s vehicle information. Authorities then located the suspect’s vehicle traveling northbound on I-95, and Martin County units initiated a motor vehicle stop at around 2:14 p.m., the complaint said. The suspect was handcuffed outside the vehicle, and the witness was flown to the scene to positively identify the suspect, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. RELATED: What we know about Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Trump ‘attempted assassination’ Just before 2:40 p.m., Trump spokesperson confirms he is safe Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, confirmed that Trump was safe “following gunshots in his vicinity.” Just before 3:30 p.m., the White House confirms awareness The White House confirmed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were both been briefed on the incident and they are “relieved to know that [Trump] is safe.” 3:42 p.m. Harris extends her support On X, Harris said she was “glad” Trump is safe and that “violence has no place in America.” 3:57 p.m. Trump confirms his well-being In a Trump campaign fundraising email, Trump said he was safe, in addition to promising that “nothing will slow [him] down” and that he “will NEVER SURRENDER!” Approximately 4:09 p.m., Trump’s motorcade heads toward Mar-a-Lago Trump’s motorcade was seen traveling toward Mar-a-Lago, per the pool camera. Around 4:40 p.m., incident is confirmed to be investigated as an assassination attempt The FBI released a statement confirming it was “investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.” At 5 p.m., authorities release photos from the scene During a 5 p.m. press conference, officials released photos of the suspect’s equipment. They said he had a loaded SKS-style 7.62×39 caliber rifle with a scope, two backpacks, one with a ceramic tile and a GoPro camera. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw initially described the weapon found in the tree line as an AK-47-style rifle. 5:21 p.m. Vance sends a prayer of gratitude Sen. JD Vance revealed on X that he spoke to Trump before the news was public, who he said was “amazingly, in good spirits.” He added that he will be sending a prayer of gratitude. 5:51 p.m. Walz emphasizes Harris’ support After previously reposting Harris’ tweet, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz released his own X statement that read, “Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe. Violence has no place in our country. It’s not who we are as a nation.” Around 6:30 p.m., lawmakers request a briefing with U.S. Secret Service Reps. Mike Kelly and Jason Crow, who are among the lawmakers investigating the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump, confirm they’ve requested a briefing with the U.S. Secret Service to learn the details of the incident and how the response played out. Just before 6:40 p.m., Trump reiterates his resolve In another fundraising email, Trump said his “resolve is only stronger after another attempt on [his] life.” Around 10 p.m., ABC News obtains suspect’s name Sources identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58. Routh has a lengthy rap sheet, including a 2002 conviction for possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as well as many social media profiles currently under investigation. Monday, Sept. 16 At 1:41 a.m. Elon Musk deletes controversial Biden-Harris administration tweet In a since-deleted tweet, Elon Musk wrote, “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Harris.” In a statement later on Monday, the White House said Musk’s rhetoric is “irresponsible” and that violence should “never be encouraged or joked about.” Approximately 8:52 a.m., acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. arrives to meet Trump Acting director of the Secret Service Ronald Rowe Jr. arrived at Trump International Golf Club, as seen by the pool camera, where he was expected to meet with Trump and brief the former president on the assassination attempt. Approximately 9:21 a.m., Biden says Secret Service ‘needs more help’ Biden told reporters, “the [Secret] Service needs more help and I think the Congress should respond to their needs, if in fact, they need more servicemen.” Later on Monday, Biden added, “I’ve always condemned political violence, and I always will.” Before 10 a.m., Trump blames incident on Biden-Harris ‘rhetoric’ Speaking to Fox News, Trump said the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it” and that “their rhetoric is causing [him] to be shot at.” Around 10:36 a.m., suspect appears in federal court, charges filed Routh appeared in a federal court in West Palm Beach Monday and was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, according to the complaint.

While discussing the 2024 presidential election on Kara Swisher’s podcast, the former secretary of state opened up about why she thinks Swift’s recent endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was essential — even if it did lead Trump to post “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on Truth Social shortly afterward. “That sends a strong message,” Clinton said. “I’m a huge admirer. I think this has real impact.” “Her fanbase is so intense and incredibly influenced by her,” she continued before bringing up Swift’s successful sexual assault lawsuit against radio DJ David Mueller in 2017 and her feud with Scooter Braun over the 2019 sale of her masters. “She’s a singer who charts the course of her life — which they relate to as their own lives — but she’s also somebody who stood up to a guy who groped her. She stood up to get her music back from someone she thought had illegitimately taken it from her.” Clinton’s remarks come just days after Swift finally broke her silence on the 2024 election with an Instagram post backing Harris on Sept. 10, just moments after the presidential debate concluded. In addition to praising the VP for being a “steady-handed, gifted leader” in a long letter to fans, the 14-time Grammy winner also called out the Trump campaign for posting AI-generated images falsely painting her as a MAGA supporter. Since then, the Republican nominee has suggested that Swift will “pay a price” in the “marketplace” for siding against him, in addition to declaring his “hate” for her. Musk, an avid Trump supporter, also issued a response to her endorsement, joking on X: “Fine Taylor, you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” Calling the Tesla founder’s words “rotten and creepy,” Clinton theorized why Swift might’ve struck a chord with right-wing conservatives. “The fact that [Swift’s endorsement] happened right after the debate and just added to Kamala’s momentum must have just set them all off,” she told Swisher. “They gravitate toward toughness and brutality and machoism. And here’s Taylor Swift, a self-made billionaire who brings joy to people and who imparts life lessons, particularly to girls and women. They can’t stand it. “I can’t understand why [Musk] says what he says,” Clinton added of the tech billionaire, calling his tweet to Swift “another way of saying rape.” “It just is beyond my imagination.” Listen to Clinton talk about Swift’s endorsement below.","summary":"At a time when Taylor Swift is facing backlash from Donald Trump, Elon Musk and more MAGA supporters, Hillary Clinton is throwing her support behind the pop star.

Responding to a post that asked: ‘Why they want to kill Donald Trump?’, Musk provocatively remarked: ‘And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden or Kamala,’ in reference to the current President and Vice President. The post sparked immediate outrage as users across the political spectrum denounced his comments. Undeterred, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO doubled down, responding with a ‘100’ emoji to a comment that said: ‘Trump threatens the machine. Biden/Kamala are the machine.’ But he ultimately conceded and removed the posts, admitting his remarks had been poorly received and clarifying that his comment was not intended to be serious. ‘Just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn’t mean it’s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X,’ he reflected. Before deleting the offending post, Musk sought to defend himself, claiming he wanted to highlight the importance of unity and make the point that no one is trying to harm Biden or Harris. Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg labeled the post ‘appalling and indefensible’, while comedian Maz Jobrani even suggested the Secret Service investigate Musk. ‘You may want to pay this guy a visit. He ain’t right in the head!’ Jobrani quipped, tagging the Secret Service in his post. Musk’s ill-conceived comments followed another heated incident involving the New Hampshire Libertarian Party (NHLP), which was widely condemned for a tweet suggesting Kamala Harris should be killed. In that inflammatory post, the NHLP suggested that killing the Democratic party presidential candidate would make someone ‘a hero’. That tweet was also condemned by commentators across the political spectrum, with Libertarian presidential nominee Chase Oliver distancing himself from the statement and calling it ‘abhorrent.’ Although the party account eventually took down the tweet, they defended their right to make such comments under the US First Amendment. Musk just last week courted controversy when he labeled the government of Australia ‘fascists’ for proposing laws that would fine social media giants for spreading misinformation. Australia introduced a ‘combating misinformation’ bill earlier in the week which includes sweeping powers to fine tech giants up to five percent of their annual turnover for breaching online safety obligations. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hit back at Musk, saying social media ‘has a social responsibility’. ‘If Mr Musk doesn’t understand that, that says more about him than it does about my government,’ he told reporters Saturday. The exchange between Musk and Australian officials is the latest in a long-running spat with the Australian government over social media regulation. Australia’s government is exploring a raft of new measures that would see social media companies take greater accountability for the content on their platforms — including a ban for those under 16 years old. The country’s online watchdog took Musk’s company to court earlier this year, alleging it had failed to remove ‘extremely violent’ videos that showed a Sydney preacher being stabbed. But it abruptly dropped its attempt to force a global takedown order on X after Musk scored a legal victory in a preliminary hearing, a move he celebrated as a free speech triumph. Musk, a self-described ‘free speech absolutist’, has clashed with politicians and digital rights groups worldwide, including in the European Union, which could decide within months to take action against X with possible fines. In Brazil, where X has effectively been suspended after it ignored a series of court directives, Musk has responded by blasting the judge as an ‘evil dictator cosplaying as a judge’.

While discussing the 2024 presidential election on Kara Swisher’s podcast, the former secretary of state opened up about why she thinks Swift’s recent endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was essential — even if it did lead Trump to post “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on Truth Social shortly afterward. “That sends a strong message,” Clinton said. “I’m a huge admirer. I think this has real impact.” “Her fanbase is so intense and incredibly influenced by her,” she continued before bringing up Swift’s successful sexual assault lawsuit against radio DJ David Mueller in 2017 and her feud with Scooter Braun over the 2019 sale of her masters. “She’s a singer who charts the course of her life — which they relate to as their own lives — but she’s also somebody who stood up to a guy who groped her. She stood up to get her music back from someone she thought had illegitimately taken it from her.” Clinton’s remarks come just days after Swift finally broke her silence on the 2024 election with an Instagram post backing Harris on Sept. 10, just moments after the presidential debate concluded. In addition to praising the VP for being a “steady-handed, gifted leader” in a long letter to fans, the 14-time Grammy winner also called out the Trump campaign for posting AI-generated images falsely painting her as a MAGA supporter. Since then, the Republican nominee has suggested that Swift will “pay a price” in the “marketplace” for siding against him, in addition to declaring his “hate” for her. Musk, an avid Trump supporter, also issued a response to her endorsement, joking on X: “Fine Taylor, you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” Calling the Tesla founder’s words “rotten and creepy,” Clinton theorized why Swift might’ve struck a chord with right-wing conservatives. “The fact that [Swift’s endorsement] happened right after the debate and just added to Kamala’s momentum must have just set them all off,” she told Swisher. “They gravitate toward toughness and brutality and machoism. And here’s Taylor Swift, a self-made billionaire who brings joy to people and who imparts life lessons, particularly to girls and women. They can’t stand it. “I can’t understand why [Musk] says what he says,” Clinton added of the tech billionaire, calling his tweet to Swift “another way of saying rape.” “It just is beyond my imagination.” Listen to Clinton talk about Swift’s endorsement below.","summary":"\"Her fanbase is so intense and incredibly influenced by her,\" Clinton says of the pop star","url":"https://www.billboard.com/culture/politics/hillary-clinton-taylor-swift-endorsement-elon-musk-response-1235777018/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hillary-Clinton-dnc-2024-56782-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:13:06","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":256565102,"title":"Tense Teamsters Meeting With Harris Ends With an Endorsement Still Dangling","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris held a sometimes tense meeting with Teamsters leaders on Monday, defending the Biden administration’s labor policies against pointed questions and concluding with a promise that she would win the presidency and treat the union fairly with or without its backing. While Ms. Harris has the endorsement of most of the nation’s unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose truck drivers, freight workers and other members are divided in their political allegiances, has held out. Sean O’Brien, the union’s combative president, said after the meeting that he could announce an endorsement — if there was an endorsement — as soon as Wednesday. John Palmer, a Teamsters executive board member and vice president at large, said the meeting had lasted a little more than an hour. He praised Ms. Harris for parrying questions on the role President Biden played in averting a rail strike in late 2022 and the ways the White House could have been more helpful in a Teamsters dispute last summer with United Parcel Service. Ms. Harris repeatedly castigated her opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, for appointing anti-union members to the National Labor Relations Board when he was president and reminded the Teamsters that Mr. Biden had shored up pensions for thousands of union members.","summary":"The Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, indicated he could announce as soon as Wednesday which presidential candidate — if any — the union would back.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/teamsters-harris.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/16/multimedia/16pol-teamsters-topart-btlw/16pol-teamsters-topart-btlw-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:10:34","author":"Jonathan Weisman","authors":["Jonathan Weisman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":256560854,"title":"Suspect in Trump assassination attempt may have lain in wait for 12 hours","text":"Ryan W Routh, the 58-year-old man suspected of planning to assassinate Donald Trump, has been charged with two gun-related crimes in federal court a day after being spotted with a rifle on the perimeter of the former United States president’s golf course in Florida. Phone records suggest the suspect may have been lying in wait for nearly 12 hours, hiding in the bushes with an AK-47-style assault rifle, according to court documents filed on Monday. Routh was arrested on Sunday after allegedly fleeing the crime scene and is being held in custody on charges of illegally possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. US Secret Service agents stationed on the golf course ahead of Trump opened fire on the suspect after they noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through a fence that lines the course. The gunman fled in an SUV, leaving behind the rifle, which was fitted with a scope, as well as two backpacks and a GoPro camera, according to police. The man was stopped soon after by heavily armed law enforcement officers on Interstate 95, a busy highway in a neighbouring county, and put up no resistance. Police say the licence plate on his vehicle had been reported stolen from another car. Second assassination attempt in two months Trump is scheduled to unveil a new cryptocurrency business on X on Monday night at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, where he lives, before resuming his presidential campaign for events in Michigan on Tuesday and New York on Wednesday. The incident has raised new questions about the violent nature of US politics and how an armed suspect was able to get so close to Trump, just two months after another gunman fired at him during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear with a bullet. Trump’s personal schedule is not made public, so investigators will be trying to find out how the gunman knew of his golfing plans. However, the Republican presidential nominee is an ardent golfer and it is no secret that he likes to fit in a round whenever he is visiting his Florida home. The Secret Service, which protects US presidents and presidential candidates, has been under intense scrutiny since the botched handling of the July attempt on Trump’s life. The service bolstered Trump’s security detail following the July 13 attack, in which the gunman was shot dead by responding agents. Trump was also due to meet the new head of the Secret Service in person on Monday after the former chief resigned in the wake of the July shooting. Trump posted a message on social media on Sunday thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe, calling them “brave and dedicated Patriots” and adding that it was “certainly an interesting day!” He also blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, for the apparent assassination attempt. He claimed the suspected gunman was acting on Democrats’ “highly inflammatory language,” though authorities have not yet offered evidence of any motive. Biden and Harris were briefed on the matter and each issued a statement condemning political violence. Harris added that she was “deeply disturbed” by the day’s events and that “we all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence”. Biden said he had directed his team to ensure the Secret Service “has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety.” Searching for clues Routh has at least two prior felony convictions, both in North Carolina, according to court records. In 2002, he pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered fully automatic gun, according to the county district attorney’s office, and was sentenced to probation. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010. The FBI is likely combing through Routh’s prolific social media posts searching for clues regarding his alleged planning of the crime and his motive for wanting to kill the president. Records show Routh lived in North Carolina for most of his life before moving to Hawaii in 2018. In 2020, he made a social media post backing Trump’s re-election, but in more recent years, his posts have expressed support for Biden and Harris. Routh is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and travelled there after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, seeking to recruit foreign fighters, according to an interview with The New York Times last year. Ukrainian officials distanced themselves from Routh on Monday and The International Legion, where many foreign fighters in Ukraine serve, said it had no links with Routh. Profiles on X, Facebook and LinkedIn with Routh’s name contained messages of support for Ukraine as well as statements describing Trump as a threat to US democracy.","summary":"Ryan Routh charged with two gun-related crimes after being spotted on perimeter of former US president&#039;s golf course.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/16/suspect-in-trump-assassination-attempt-may-have-lain-in-wait-for-twelve-hours?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AFP__20240916__36GD2AR__v1__Preview__UsVoteTrumpGunSuspect-1726465289.jpg?resize=1200%2C630","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:09:30","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":256562710,"title":"Vance and Walz to speak at gathering of CEOs this week","text":"A Vance spokesperson said the Ohio senator will speak Thursday morning. A spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment. “Continuing our mission of engaging with policymakers on a bipartisan basis, we invited both Sen. Vance and Governor Walz to speak with CEOs at our September meeting, and we are pleased that both accepted,” said Business Roundtable spokesperson Michael Steel in a statement. The CEO coalition originally invited Vice President Kamala Harris to speak at the quarterly meeting, according to a person familiar with the arrangements, granted anonymity to discuss private planning. But the campaign elected to send her running mate instead. Harris is relatively unknown to many corporate interests in Washington, and her expedited presidential campaign has spent relatively little time courting corporate America, which is now rushing to understand her policies and build relationships with her orbit. Business Roundtable’s favor could offer some political expediency to the next administration. The group includes the leaders of some of the country’s biggest corporations, including Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, and Apple CEO Tim Cook. It spends millions of dollars each quarter to lobby Washington, leveraging a small army of lobbyists of both political parties. Several of the companies involved with the group have worked closely with the federal government to propel the Biden administration’s agenda.","summary":"The two vice presidential nominees have previously bashed elite corporate interests.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/16/vance-walz-business-roundtable-00179392","image":"https://static.politico.com/2f/03/4a84312f4eb79de22719ddbeec49/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1127678005","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 22:08:48","author":"Hailey Fuchs","authors":["Hailey Fuchs"],"language":"en","source_country":"eu","sentiment":0.5}]}
