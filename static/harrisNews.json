The Minnesota governor’s for-profit endeavor, Educational Travel Adventures, Inc., which catered to student groups seeking to travel to communist China, was shut down by the Nebraska secretary of state for “non-payment of occupational taxes” in April 1998, the Washington Free Beacon reported on Monday. The company, co-founded by Walz and his wife, Gwen, owed a measly $26 to the state when it was dissolved. It was first registered in Nebraska by the Walzes in 1995. Despite his company going defunct, Walz continued organizing student tours of China, including at least two trips in 1998 and 2001, according to the outlet. In 2002, Walz founded another entity with the same name in Minnesota, which he touted during his 2006 run for Congress. “Walz established a small business called Educational Travel Adventures, Inc. through which he conducts annual educational trips to China for high school students,” reads an archived press packet from Walz’s congressional run, which notes the governor was part of “one of the first government sanctioned groups of American educators to teach in Chinese high schools.” Reports indicate that Walz stopped leading the student trips to China in 2003. In 2008, Walz reinstated Educational Travel Adventures in Nebraska – a year after taking office in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District – after paying $235 worth of back taxes and interest, according to the Washington Free Beacon. After the Nebraska-based company was once again in good standing, Walz quickly moved to dissolve it. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) raised concerns about Walz’s travel company last month, in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Comer demanded information from the FBI “about the Chinese entities and officials Governor Walz has engaged and partnered with” as well as any “warnings or advice the FBI may have given to Governor Walz about US political figures being targeted by or recruited for CCP influence operations.” The Oversight Committee chairman also expressed concern that the Chinese Communist Party may have subsidized some of Educational Travel Adventures’ trips to China. Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate has other ties to China as well. He was a visiting fellow and lectured on international relations at the state-run Macau Polytechnic University until at least 2007. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) has asked the Pentagon to investigate the association and inform Congress about whether Walz complied with foreign travel reporting requirements during his numerous trips to China – some of which took place while Walz was a senior-ranking member of the Minnesota National Guard. Walz also married his wife on the fifth anniversary of the end of the deadly Tiananmen protests, and the couple spent their honeymoon in China. “He wanted a date he’ll always remember,” Gwen told the Scottsbluff Star-Herald in 1994. The Harris campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Nebraska’s secretary of state shut down the Minnesota governor’s for-profit endeavor,  Educational Travel Adventures, Inc., for  \"non-payment of occupational taxes\" in April 1998, the Washington Free Beacon reported on Monday. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/us-news/tim-walzs-china-travel-company-was-shut-down-over-a-26-tax-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-vaikx6g2g-1725926380807.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725912021&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OFdlehaR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:30:47","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":256029206,"title":"Harris, Trump campaigns spin expectations ahead of ABC News debate","text":"CHICAGO -- Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview that aired Monday that she expects former President Donald Trump to lie during the ABC News presidential debate on Tuesday.

US Presidential Democratic nominee's biographer CHARLIE SPIERING says she is terrifyingly ill-equipped for power and an incompetent lightweight","text":"John Nance Garner didn't think much of the job he held under Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. 'The vice presidency isn't worth a bucket of warm spit,' he once declared. But he was wrong. Over the years, the role has regularly been a platform for the Oval Office. Some 15 vice presidents have gone on to take the top job, including Joe Biden, who served eight years as Barack Obama's deputy. As America prepares to go to the polls this autumn, there is a strong chance that Biden's own controversial sidekick, Kamala Harris, could follow him into the White House. Tonight, Harris takes part in her first -televised debate against Donald Trump. It will be a vital test, particularly because – owing to the unorthodox nature of her selection after Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would not stand against Trump – she has not endured anything like the usual media examination that a presidential -candidate has to suffer. As a seasoned political journalist and author of Amateur Hour: Kamala Harris In The White House – a comprehensive investigation into how this eccentric San -Francisco attorney was fast-tracked to becoming potentially the next leader of the free world – I find the lack of scrutiny applied to this -shallow and desperate political -figure to be maddening. Since winning the nomination, 'Calamity Kamala' has given just two short, lacklustre media interviews that did nothing to enhance her authority. Senior Democrats in Washington tell me that her -campaign is increasingly riven and dysfunctional. She calls herself 'a joyful -warrior' with an upbeat message – yet I hear of repeated power struggles with the Biden team. Three generations – Biden's -doddery cronies, her own -experienced coterie and legions of Gen Z and millennial activists – are all pulling in different directions. One former official told me that Harris is reluctant to take drastic action against Biden's crew in particular: 'She won't get rid of them because that would create too much of a distraction.' Her aides have been trying to shield her from Press scrutiny over this and much else by running out the clock towards election day. But one well-connected Democrat tells me that many fear this approach is backfiring: 'It's not a great long-term play for her. She needs to prove she can be unscripted.' The trouble for Harris is that, without an autocue, she flounders. She could easily perform badly in tonight's debate, given her limited grasp of policy and her notorious habit of descending into meaningless verbiage and gaffes under pressure. She might, however, land some blows if she lives up to her carefully crafted image as a tough prosecutor: a skill she claims to have honed as district attorney and attorney general in California, with a highly aggressive and interruptive style of questioning. But if she does emerge victorious, the presidency will be within her grasp – a scenario unthinkable until recently. So how on earth did we get here? Branded the most unpopular vice president in modern history, Harris has for years been viewed by some around Washington as an incompetent lightweight, whose trademark unhinged cackle could not conceal her inability to communicate effectively, and whose obsession with identity politics failed to hide her lack of convictions on policy. Even some in America's liberal Press regarded her as a national joke who stumbled from one embarrassment to another. Many of her most incomprehensible pronouncements went viral on social media: take her 2022 assertion that 'it is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day'. Her record may be devoid of real achievement, but her greatest -political talent has always been her gift for self-advancement. In my opinion she combines naked political ambition with an instinctive cunning, a lack of scruples and a willingness to jump on every fashionable bandwagon. Hailed as America's 'diverse' political saviour after the division of the Trump years and Biden's flailing tenure, with spectacular cynicism Harris has recently been presented by the party machine as a bold new voice for the country – even though she was integral to Biden's -administration for four long years. At the Democrats' recent convention in Chicago, she officially accepted the presidential nomination amid scenes of hysterical -adulation. Praise was lavished on her by Biden, Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary -Clinton, while Harris basked in the personal endorsement of billionaire megastar Oprah Winfrey. The Chicago convention -succeeded in generating a feelgood factor around Harris, but this is beginning to dim. Already, polls show that her early 'bounce' is slowing – a New York Times survey at the weekend showed Donald Trump overtaking her by 48 per cent to 47 per cent, marking the end of what the liberal paper called her 'euphoric August'. Harris may have hoped that -enveloping herself in lavish tributes from celebrity Democrats would help to dodge troubling questions about her candidacy. More fool her. The 59-year-old has one of the thinnest CVs of any -modern presidential contender – and people have noticed that. It is genuinely alarming that with the world in turmoil, from war in Ukraine to escalating conflict in the Middle East, this comparative -novice could soon be in power. When she ran to be California -senator in 2017, it looked at one stage that she might secure the Democratic nomination for that role without a fight, even though she had no experience of Washington. Long-serving Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez believed that such a coronation would be a democratic outrage, so she decided to stand against Harris. 'This is too important a state and too important a position for someone to get on-the-job training,' said Sanchez. Those same words could be applied far more accurately to the presidency of the United States. The West is confronted by an array of tyrants and terrorists, but our destiny could be imminently in the hands of an amateur. Unlike Roosevelt's vice president John Nance Garner, Harris has conducted no major negotiations or presided over the passage of any significant legislation. Even among Democrats in the Senate, she was unpopular because of her hectoring, partisan style and her obsessive focus on her own career. Other vice presidents, such as Richard Nixon under Dwight Eisenhower, Walter Mondale under Jimmy Carter or Dick Cheney under George W. Bush, had an important influence on US foreign policy, but Biden never respected Harris enough to give her such a role. Like so much else she does, her fleeting forays into foreign affairs have been cringeworthy: among many of her gaffes, I might cite the moment that she referred to North Korea – one of the West's most implacable foes – and its 'alliance' with the US. Her explanations of the Ukraine war and the role of Nato in the world smacked of childish -simplicity, while her behaviour during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan similarly -commanded little confidence. She claimed that she was the last person in the Oval Office when Biden made his decision to pull out, but then she went -missing for days as the operation unfolded. Her handling of one of the few major tasks she was given as 'Veep' – dealing with the immigration crisis on America's southern border – was equally maladroit. Handed the grandiose title of 'border czar' in 2021, she -celebrated by offering journalists biscuits, baked with her image, on a flight to Guatemala, her first big trip outside Washington. On landing, she pointedly told migrants 'do not come' to the US. It may have been an indicator of her irrelevance that the huddled masses ignored her and instead streamed across the border in ever greater numbers – allegedly almost ten million since Biden came to power. As the crisis worsened, her -political stature was further diminished when she was interviewed by the liberal network NBC and asked why, given the scale of the problems at the -border, she had not visited the region herself as 'czar'. 'And I -haven't been to Europe!' she replied, laughing awkwardly. Two other issues as vice president suggest to me her comprehensive unsuitability for high office. One is her historically -dismal relations with some of her own staff – allegedly because of a mix of impatience and insecurity. Throughout her time as VP, there was a steady exodus of talented people who could not put up with her -management style. One staffer told the Washington Post that Harris would refuse to analyse briefing materials, then scold her team if she appeared unprepared. 'You're not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work,' they added. Shocked Washington insiders have told further tales of dysfunction and even abuse. She berated staff who failed to fulfil her erratic demands, or handed her the wrong type of pen. 'With Kamala, you have to put up with a -constant amount of soul-destroying -criticism and also her own lack of confidence,' said one of her former aides. Another told Politico -magazine that her office was 'not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated'. Her team have denied these reports. After her shambolic primary bid in 2019 one campaign manager said: 'I have never seen an -organisation that treated its staff so poorly.' Her eccentric use of English has often featured politically correct jargon mixed with cloying -platitudes and repetitions. One of her most infamous -comments came at a White House reception in March 2023 to mark Women's -History Month, just the sort of woke event in which she delights. 'So, during Women's History Month, we celebrate and we -honour the women who made -history throughout history, who saw what could be unburdened by what had been,' she told her -puzzled audience. It is, all told, a worrying CV for the highest office. So it is perhaps ironic that, even though she does not come across as a serious operator, she takes herself and her image very seriously. One of her first and most telling acts as vice president was to complain about a photo of herself on the cover of Vogue magazine, claiming that she should not have been depicted wearing trainers. Her defenders have claimed that she is cleverer than she likes to appear, and certainly it is true that her language was sharper and more concise when she was a young prosecutor. She climbed the political ladder in California, demanding that Democrats give her positions of power while coolly dismissing her political rivals. But when she first got to Washington, experienced political figures described her to me as a 'show horse' in obvious pursuit of the presidency, not a 'work horse' trying to prove her abilities as a senator. Harris's parents divorced when she was seven and she was largely raised by her Hindu mother, with her Jamaican-born father -working as a senior professor at Stanford University. This mixed-race upbringing has been useful for her career amid the American Left's fanatical embrace of identity politics, -particularly after the unrest that followed the death of George Floyd in 2020 and the -resulting Black Lives Matter movement. Always looking for applause from the Left, Harris has accused the immigration authorities of acting like the Ku Klux Klan, and ludicrously compared the pro-Trump protests in Washington on January 6, 2021 to the -Japanese bombing of Pearl -Harbour and the 9/11 atrocities. Throughout her career, Harris has repeated her motto that she 'eats 'no' for breakfast' when she is told by others that she is not ready for higher office. Tonight, in the presidential debate, viewers will see the real Kamala Harris: a politician of loquacious mediocrity. Does that mean she will lose the election in November? By rights, the presidency should be a step too far for a candidate of her -calibre. But there is no predicting the American electorate – and I fear the prospect of this individual becoming president is all too likely – and all too terrifying.

Clearly there was an overreaction to economic data last week. It raised overblown fears of a potential recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “A pause gives you the opportunity to be more rational.” Analysts at major banks variously put the odds of a U.S. recession at 20 percent (Goldman Sachs), 25 percent (UBS Global Wealth Management), and 35 percent (JP Morgan Chase), while Morgan Stanley on Monday cut its oil forecast, saying traders are pricing in a demand slowdown on par with a mild recession. Some market strategists said that Monday’s buying spree in stocks was classic dip-buying behavior as investors went shopping for bargains. Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth in New York, said investors were looking at “high quality stocks that are cheaper.” As an example, Blancato pointed to shares of chipmaker Nvidia, which closed up 3.5 percent on Monday after falling 15.3 percent last week. Wednesday’s CPI inflation report is expected to show slight drop in the headline pace of inflation in August to 2.6 percent year-over-year, while on a monthly basis it is expected to remain unchanged at 0.2 percent.

After being introduced by North Wales Borough, Pa., Mayor Neil McDevitt, who has been deaf since birth, Biden issued remarks from the South Portico of the White House in which he praised the accomplishments of the ADA but also noted more work is needed to provide dignity and pride for the disabled. \"More than three decades after ADA's passage, many of us can still recall an America where a person with disabilities could be denied service at a restaurant or grocery store,\" the president said. \"An employer could refuse to interview you or hire you because of a disability. \"But for more than 61 million Americans living with disabilities, these laws are a source of opportunity, respect, pride and dignity.\" The ADA, signed in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in several areas, including employment, transportation, public accommodations, communications and access to state and local government' programs and services. The law is meant to ensure that the disabled have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, extending civil rights protections to the disabled in much the same way as they are provided to people on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age and religion. While its provisions have been in effect for 34 years, Biden cautioned Monday there is much work yet to be done and touted the efforts made his administration, including this year's Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Of course, these laws did not bring an end to the work we need to do,\" he said. \"That's why Kamala and I have been so determined to move our nation forward for Americans living with disabilities and transforming the way the economy works for all Americans.\" Specifically, Biden cited his administration's work in helping to integrate the disabled into the U.S. workforce and economy. Since he and Harris took office, he said, Americans with disabilities have seen a historic high in employment, a record low unemployment and high labor force participation. The number of people with disabilities in registered apprenticeships has nearly tripled, from less than 2,500 at the end of FY20 to more than 6,800 today, he said. The Department of Labor has taken the lead in a \"whole-of-government approach\" to advancing employment opportunities for people with disabilities, Biden said, pointing to $435 million invested to promote competitive integrated employment.

The Mail on Sunday revealed on Saturday that the Italian heart-throb, 34, will join Ballando con le Stelle. But it has now been revealed that the dancer, who is at the heart of a BBC investigation into claims he bullied his former partner Amanda Abbington, will star alongside Giada Linni, the wife of another disgraced Strictly dancer. Graziano's wife, 29, announced on social media on Monday that her contract for the Italian dancing competition has been renewed. Taking to Instagram she said: 'Finally I can officially announce that I will be part of the cast of the masters of @ballandoconlestelle 2024 for my 4th season.'

Her announcement was met by an outpouring of support from her husband's former colleagues on Strictly Giada, who met her husband in 2014 and went on to tie the knot in 2022, has been supportive following Graziano's sacking from Strictly. Two weeks ago Giovanni feared that the bosses of the Italian show would not sign him due to him not yet being exonerated as the BBC continues to take its time revealing the outcome of its investigation. Read More Amanda Abbington 'has no regrets over Giovanni Pernice bullying probe on Strictly' However, following reports that Amanda has little evidence and her claims being 'thin', they have decided to hire him, leaving the embattled star overjoyed. Ballando con le Stelle launched in 2005 - a year after Strictly began in the UK - and is filmed in a magnificent 19th century theatre at the RAI Auditorium at the Foro Italico in Rome. It will mean that he will spend a significant amount of time away from his home in West London this autumn. As Giovanni rebuilds his career in his native Italy, Graziano is still hiding out in Sicily with his mother, his wife, and the rest of the family after losing his job over claims he kicked, hit, and spat at celebrity partner Zara McDermott during training. Graziano is now staying in a remote family farmhouse surrounded by vineyards where he has been a virtual recluse since the bombshell news of his sacking broke.

He allegedly spat and kicked her in training which was captured on video, leaving Strictly bosses with little choice but to axe him as they bid to clean-up the show which has been left rocked by the scandals. The probe was sparked by allegations of bullying from 2023 celebrity contestant Amanda.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Brian Marks For Dailymail.com Published:00:53 BST, 10 September 2024 |Updated:01:18 BST, 10 September 2024 e-mail View comments Jennifer Lopez was looking her best as she displayed her washboard abs as she touched down in Los Angeles on Monday. The 55-year-old actress and singer rocked a sport ensemble that put the spotlight on her trim tummy as she deplaned. She was arriving back in Los Angeles after a trip up north to the Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere over the weekend of her new film Unstoppable. The awkward event featured Lopez and one of the film's producers, Matt Damon — who shared an intimate conversation with the actress — but her estranged husband Ben Affleck skipped out on the premiere. Although her outfit on Monday appeared to cover up the sides of her torso, Jennifer's revealing dress on the TIFF red carpet left fans wondering if she had gotten a 'commitment' tattoo removed, after she and Ben got complementary ink. Jennifer Lopez was looking her best as she displayed her washboard abs as she touched down in Los Angeles on Monday. The 55-year-old actress and singer rocked a sport ensemble that put the spotlight on her trim tummy as she deplaned She was arriving back in LA after attending her Unstoppable premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on Friday. At the festival, fans noticed that she no longer appeared to have a 'commitment' tattoo she got to match one of her ex Ben Affleck's designs Read More What Grammys tiff? Jennifer Lopez and husband Ben Affleck both unveil TATTOOS to celebrate 'commitment' to each other on Valentine's Day The Out Of Sight star's travel ensemble featured a low-cut white cropped tank top with spaghetti straps, which highlighted her age-defying flat stomach and trim waist. She made the look slightly more modest with a pale gray sweatshirt that she wore draped over her shoulders, with the sleeves hanging down her front. Jennifer stayed on point with a matching set of pale gray low-rise sweatpants. Instead of athletic shoes to match her low-key look, she opted for a pair of off-white sneakers, and she kept her caramel-colored hair styled simply with a messy bun. J.Lo appeared to display a more minimal makeup look than usual, and she blocked out the light with chunky black sunglasses. After she descended from the private jet, her assistants ushered her to a black SUV before driving off. Jennifer's revealing tank top should have exposed her 'commitment' tattoo that was debuted early last year at the height of her romance with then-husband Ben Affleck. She had the ink placed high up on her left rib cage, so it is usually covered by her clothing.

It complemented a tattoo Ben got that she also posted. His ink showed two crisscrossing arrows that appeared to be tied together at the junction. Her initial, 'J,' was inked above the crossing point, and Ben's last drawn below it to symbolize their marital and romantic bond. However, when Jennifer posed in a stunning dressed covered front and back in sparkling mirrors at the Toronto International Film Festival, the tattoo didn't appear to be visible. The dress featured separate front and back sheets of mirrors, and they were tied together with thick bows over her sides that left little to the imagination. But there wasn't any obvious sign of the eternity symbol on J.Lo's exposed rib cage. It's unclear if she had already started the process of getting the tattoo removed or if she had simply covered up the ink with makeup for the time being.

They were seen clasping hands and sitting during some down time. Matt and his longtime friend Ben had produced the film together, but the Gone Girl star opted to skip the Toronto premiere to remain in Los Angeles with his children. Despite how J.Lo and Matt appeared to be having a heart-to-heart in photos of the event, an insider told DailyMail.com that the Ocean's Eleven star 'shut down any attempt' that Jennifer made to bring up her estranged husband Ben. 'It was her timing that was so awkward because she would have known that pulling Matt aside at the event to have an intimate talk was going to get picked up and go viral,' they added. The insider stressed that Matt would 'always have Ben's back no matter what,' and they clarified that he was not praying with Jennifer, after some fans interpreted his bowed head as a shared prayer. Jennifer was seen at the premiere and with Matt while wearing the sizzling 'revenge dress' to celebrate her first red carpet event since her divorce filing. She filed the paperwork last month, citing 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split. Although she was the one to file, and Ben appears to have opted not to do so, he was reportedly well aware of her plans. Jennifer was seen at the premiere and with Matt while wearing the sizzling 'revenge dress' to celebrate her first red carpet event since her divorce filing She filed the paperwork last month, citing 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, though the two had pretended to have a healthy marriage for months after her listed separation date Jennifer's sizzling dress at TIFF left little to the imagination and exposed her sides and ribcage. The tattoo was not visible on her left ribcage, though it's unclear if she has had it removed or if she covered it up with makeup Jennifer's tattoo, which she shared on social media, featured an infinity-liek symbol with an arrow piercing its loops It complemented a tattoo Ben got that she also posted. His ink showed two crisscrossing arrows that appeared to be tied together at the junction. Her initial, 'J,' was inked above the crossing point, and Ben's last drawn below it to symbolize their marital and romantic bond According to an insider, the estranged couple had agreed on the divorce terms before she filed, and neither party was looking to surprise the other. The reporting is largely in line with the couple's decision to fake a healthy marriage for months with occasional public outings together, despite having already split behind the scenes. It's unclear if the two had a prenuptial agreement in place, which wouldn't have been noted in the divorce filing, though it appears that the main sticking point for the two independently wealthy people will be their Beverly Hills mansion, which they have now put on the market while Jennifer searches for a new home. Ben has already moved into a more modest home in Brentwood, close to where his ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives, which will make shuttling their children back-and-forth simpler.

The store has sold a “January 6 Box” of spices which included blends named “Justice” and “Outrage.” Penzeys has also posted signs in its windows, including a “Welcome Future Fake Electors” sign at its Milwaukee location during the Republican National Convention in the city. Its website even has a page titled “About Republicans” slamming the party. Though Trump is likely accurate in calling Penzey’s Spices “Trump Hating,” his other claims are more suspect. Harris is much closer to the center than Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Both Sanders and Warren are regarded as progressive, while Harris has been labeled a “reliable ally of the Democratic establishment” by the New York Times. While Harris’ political momentum has stalled in the most recent polling, according to Politico, it hasn’t reversed, and the outlet reports that she’s still gaining popularity. NPR has also pointed to Harris’ previous debate performances and her past as a prosecutor as boons in Tuesday’s debate that could put her above Trump. But regardless of whether she wins or loses the debate, it would be difficult for her to do as poorly as Biden did during his June 27 debate with Trump. Less than a month after that disastrous debate, Biden exited the race. Though Trump ultimately agreed to tomorrow’s debate with Harris, Trump made an attempt to change the venue to Fox News from ABC, and even initially pulled out before changing his mind.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump suggested Democrats put President Joe Biden back in play as the nominee a day before the scheduled debate with Vice President Kamala Harris by claiming Harris was doing poorly in the polls, asking “How about a Biden comeback?”\n\nOn Monday, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social, calling out Harris’ Saturday afternoon campaign stop at Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh.\n\n“Comrade Kamala Harris goes to an ultra Left Wing, Trump Hating, spice shop, which I hear has terrible, overpriced product, and calls for ‘unity.’ As people begin to realize that she is a Marxist, FAR MORE LIBERAL than Crazy Bernie Sanders, or even Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren, her poll numbers are beginning to crash.

A congressional aide said the long-awaited report had reached lawmakers on Monday and they had not yet had a chance to review it. Two other sources, requesting anonymity to discuss a classified matter, confirmed that it had been delivered. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Congress has approved nearly $175 billion of aid and military assistance for Ukraine and allied nations in the 2 and 1/2 years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. After months of delay, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a $95 billion supplemental spending bill in April that included $61 billion in funding for Ukraine, as well as billions for Israel, civilians in conflict zones around the world and to “counter communist China” in the Indo-Pacific. As part of that bill, Congress asked the Biden administration to submit a detailed strategy for Ukraine by early June. Biden’s support for Ukraine is backed by Democrats and many Republicans in Congress. Some Republicans, however, have criticized his administration for restricting how Ukraine can use U.S. equipment, for example by refusing to supply weapons that could strike targets deep inside Russia, for fear it would escalate the conflict. Weeks after the deadline passed with no report, some members of Congress said they were frustrated and would consider blocking further funding. In a statement emailed to Reuters in late August about the report, Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he supported assisting Ukraine but did not do so blindly. “Since the earliest days of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s war on Ukraine, we have asked the Biden-Harris Administration for a strategy on how the U.S. and our allies can help Ukraine win the war,” Risch said. “When they did not respond to our requests, we mandated in law that a strategy be sent to Congress, but the deadline has passed with no response. President Biden and VP (Kamala) Harris owe a strategy not just to us, but to the American people, and their dereliction suggests they don’t have one or are afraid to share it.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration has sent Congress a classified report on its strategy for the war in Ukraine, three sources said on Monday, months after a June deadline mandated in a multibillion-dollar spending bill lawmakers passed in April.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/09/breaking-news/congress-sent-long-awaited-ukraine-strategy-report-sources-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-09T234745Z_1_LYNXMPEK880RM_RTROPTP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-REPORT.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:10:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":256029078,"title":"Harris has most to lose in debate because ‘she’s exposed herself so little’: Sarah Bedford","text":"“She’s exposed herself so little to voters,” Bedford told Your World with Neil Cavuto. “She has raised the stakes for this [debate] because this is the one chance that she’s really given voters to see how she performs when she’s off the teleprompter, and if she blows that or if she fails to make a really good impression, there’s not a lot of runway left for her to recover.

Kennedy Jr.'s name will appear on Michigan's Nov. 5 presidential ballot, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Monday. The high court's decision reverses a Michigan Court of Appeals opinion Friday that allowed RFK Jr. not to appear on the ballot in the battleground state. In a majority ruling, the court wrote that Kennedy \"has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.\" Kennedy, 70, had qualified after being nominated by the Natural Law Party, a minor party with ballot access in Michigan. But on Aug. 23, he suspended his campaign and endorsed Republican and former President Donald Trump. Kennedy doesn't want his name on ballots in battleground states in fear it would hurt the former president's chances against Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democrat opponent. Trump lost to Joe Biden by about 150,000 votes in 2020 but beat Hillary Clinton by about 10,000 votes in 2016. \"In about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started that process and urge voters not to vote for me,\" Kennedy said on Aug. 23. Besides Michigan, battleground states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin. In North Carolina, Kennedy has won an appeal to remove his name from the ballot. This has delayed sending out ballots, which had been scheduled for last Friday. Courts have ruled he is off the ballot in Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas. Wisconsin is keeping his name on the ballot. Before his announcement, Kennedy's campaign had said there were enough signatures to appear on 47 ballots and officially gained access in 22 states. The vote in the high court's opinion wasn't revealed. It only shows that Justice Elizabeth Welch, a Democratic nominee, wrote a separate concurring comment and Justices Brian Zahra and David Viviano, both Republican nominees, wrote dissenting comments. \"When plaintiff made his request, defendant faced a deadline for ballot printing that was two weeks away,\" Welch wrote. Democratic nominees have a 4-3 edge on the court. In their dissenting comments, Zahra and Viviano said \"no provision in law\" supports Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's rejection of Kennedy's request to remove his name from the ballot. \"Now countless Michigan voters may be deluded and deceived into casting their ballots for a candidate who has no intention to hold the office,\" the dissenting justices wrote. In an earlier ruling in the Michigan Court of Claims, Judge Christopher Yates ruled that minor party presidential candidates cannot withdraw from the ballot. The ballots also will include independent candidate Cornel West. In a separate decision, Michigan's high court declined to take up an appeal that sought to have him disqualified. Military and overseas ballots must be mailed by Sept. 21, with absentee ballots on Sept. 26.","summary":"Despite his objection, Robert F.

Maybe, next time Google “Strasberg” and find out he died in 1982? The Telegraph hilariously reported that Harris is “preparing for the debate with a stand-in Trump, Lee Strasberg, an acting teacher who has been wearing a wide-shouldered boxy suit and red tie.” The Times reference that inspired it merely said that the Trump stand-in was “in full Lee Strasberg method-acting mode, not just playing Donald J. Trump but inhabiting him, wearing a boxy suit and a long tie.” Strasberg — who, we once again will point out, died in 1982 — counted future Oscar winners as his students, including Marlon Brando, Sidney Poitier, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Shelley Winters and Al Pacino. They studied together at the legendary Actors Studio in New York City. After the error was called out on social media by Wired’s David Gilbert, the Nieman Journalism Lab’s Joshua Benton and others, The Telegraph scrubbed the Strasberg reference from its story, merely noting that the vice president “is preparing for the debate with a stand-in Trump, an advisor who has been wearing a wide-shouldered boxy suit and red tie.” The Harris and Trump debate will air live on ABC from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. EDT/6 p.m. PDT. The debate will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks, moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. There will be no audience. In the rules for the debate released last week by ABC News, it’s noted that, as is often the case, candidates are not permitted to ask each other questions. Microphones will be muted for each candidate when their opponent is speaking, which proved to be a Trump advantage during his debate with President Joe Biden. Also, per ABC News, “Moderators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a ‘civilized’ discussion.”","summary":"The Telegraph seems to have misunderstood a reference in the New York Times to the legendary Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982\n\n\nThe post British Paper Mistakenly Reports Kamala Harris Doing Debate Prep With Long-Dead Acting Coach appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/lee-strasberg-debate-prep-kamala-harris-telegraph/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/kamala-harris-lee-strasberg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:06:20","author":"Sharon Knolle","authors":["Sharon Knolle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.173},{"id":256028714,"title":"ABC News Feels the Heat as Harris and Trump Ready for the Debate Stage | Analysis","text":"With two months to go before the presidential election, the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is widely considered to be a toss up.

Former President Trump and Harris will face off for the first time on Tuesday in Philadelphia, in a debate moderated by ABC News. While the Harris campaign had insisted on moving forward with the debate as previously negotiated between the Biden and Trump Teams, it appears they were expecting the rules to change to make the microphones live throughout the event. \"Kamala Harris had planned to object, fact-check and directly question Donald Trump while he was speaking during their debate next week,\" Politico reported on Friday. \"But now, with rules just finalized to mute the candidates when their opponents speaks, campaign officials said Harris advisers are scrambling to rewrite their playbook.\" TRUMP, HARRIS CAMPAIGNS CLASH OVER DEBATE RULES: ‘WE SAID NO CHANGES’ The Harris campaign, according to the report, had wanted un-muted microphones \"so that the vice president could lean on her prosecutorial background, confronting the former president in the same way she laced into some of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees and Cabinet members during Senate hearings.\" Four of her own campaign officials now reportedly claim that she will be \"handcuffed\" by the rules set by her predecessor. Some Democratic strategists said the debate terms were bad from the start. One told Politico, \"It was a bad set of rules for someone [Biden] who needed to be protected, who never should’ve been on the debate stage. And now they’re stuck with it.\" Democratic strategist James Carville, by contrast, suggested the rules don’t tip the scales either way. \"[Trump] won’t be able to do his shenanigans either,\" he said. \"So it seems kind of like a wash to me.\" The same report also claimed, \"Some Democrats privately dismiss the Harris campaign’s frustration as largely gamesmanship and expectation-setting around Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia.\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller reportedly expressed joy on behalf of the campaign that Harris \"finally accepted the already agreed-upon rules of the debate that they wrote in the first place,\" later adding, \"Americans want to hear both candidates present their competing visions to the voters, unburdened by what has been. No notes, no sitting down, no advance copies of the questions.\" The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Harris' campaign had repeatedly pushed back on the rule about microphones, trying to goad Trump into backing out of the original agreement to mute mics, even initially refusing to sign off on the rules in an attempt to renegotiate. The campaign sent a letter to the network last week officially agreeing to the original debate rules while still complaining about the terms. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,\" the letter read.

Someone tried to assassinate Donald Trump. The new Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, reinvigorated the party’s presidential hopes, sparking widespread joy among a previously dejected base while generating an unprecedented fundraising groundswell. On the surface, it may have seemed like the race fundamentally changed: Harris had an impeccable campaign launch, and Trump has been in absolute hell — angrily posting away his feelings while repeatedly complaining that Harris replaced Biden as the nominee. And yet, despite all the upheaval, the broader contours of the 2024 election remain eerily similar: The race is deadly close — and Trump may well still be the favorite. The stakes of Tuesday’s presidential debate in Philadelphia — the second of the campaign, and the first between Harris and Trump — could not possibly be higher. With the race between the vice president and the former president trending uncomfortably close — particularly in recent private and public polls conducted in the handful of battleground states that will decide the election — various officials in each camp say Tuesday night’s contest could make or break their candidate’s chances at taking the White House. Those on Team Harris believe the debate is crucial to preserving the democratic order in the face of Trump’s fascistic whims. “There is no room for error. None,” says a Harris ally, who adds that a lackluster performance could “cost us the election.” In the estimations of Democrats working on her campaign, the debate is very likely to set the tone — in the political press and elsewhere — for the final two-month sprint of the 2024 contest. And if Harris fails to define herself to the American people on live television, it could prove catastrophic, in a presidential election that appears destined to be fought at the margins. New polling from The New York Times and Siena College indicates many voters still want to know more about Harris and her plans for what she would do as president. A majority of likely voters think Harris deserves blame for rising prices and for “problems at the border,” as the Times/Siena survey put it — suggesting that Republicans’ attacks on Harris and attempts to define her may be resonating. So much for coasting on positive vibes. The Harris campaign finally published an issues page on its website Sunday, a month and a half since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, two days before the debate. Now, she needs to communicate her policy vision directly to the millions of Americans who will tune in on Tuesday, all while standing a few feet away from Trump. “It will be devastating if we screw this up,” one Harris adviser tells Rolling Stone, adding: “It really is one of those ‘failure is not an option’ kinds of evenings, isn’t it?” As Harris and Trump have prepared for Tuesday night in Philly, their campaigns have actively brainstormed tactics and canned lines that each side thinks would work best at getting under the other candidate’s skin — in the hopes of provoking an overreaction or stumble that sticks in the minds of voters. In the lead-up to the debate, Trump’s team and allies have pressed him to be “happy Trump” at the debate, not “mean, bully Trump,” according to the Times. According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, when some members of Team Harris were reviewing recent and older videos of Trump — at events, during media interviews, onstage at televised debates — they noticed that Trump is sometimes not as easily baited as some would assume. “Donald Trump is famous for being easily lured into acting like the oaf and bully that he is, but if you watch him at points during, and also after, his time in office, you will be able to spot the times when he knows somebody is trying to get a rise out of him, and then he just refuses to give them what they want … at least for that short amount of time,” one of these sources says. In the weeks leading up to the Philadelphia debate, this led to further brainstorming among these Harris 2024 officials, who wanted to flesh out every angle for the kinds of onstage barbs and attacks that stood a chance at effectively triggering the former president. The two sources declined to share what the new ideas were, which they added were shared with the vice president, as they aim to catch Trump off-guard on Tuesday.","summary":"After two months of upheaval, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is a dead heat — and the stakes of Tuesday’s debate couldn’t be higher","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/kamala-harris-trump-debate-2024-election-1235098271/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/kamala-trump-debate-walk-up.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:00:00","author":"Andrew Perez","authors":["Andrew Perez"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":256029310,"title":"James Earl Jones - known for his iconic voice in Star Wars and The Lion King - overcame a speech condition as a kid","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Sep 10th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Actress Alice Evans is kicked out of court after risking contempt charges by confronting ex-husband Ioan Gruffudd during child support hearing in LA and taking photos of the Fantastic Four star on her phone Unions pile pressure on Starmer over 'cruel' winter fuel payment axing for 10 million people TODAY - as poll shows half of elderly Brits will now heat their home less... but Rachel Reeves insists pensioners will be £1,700 better off Rachel Reeves tells struggling pensioners losing £300 winter fuel cash to blame the Tories and warns Labour MPs there are 'more difficult decisions to come' Racing commentator John Hunt returns to work 60 days after his wife and two of his daughters were killed in crossbow attack - and issues heartbreaking statement Emily Maitlis reveals request from Prince Andrew after notorious Newsnight interview had finished - and how it haunted her career ahead of A Very Royal Scandal's launch The truth about what happens if you drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week - and how much it shortens your life by (and it's shorter than you think) Revealed: The universities that give you the highest graduate salary... and the lowest.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.com Published:00:51 BST, 10 September 2024 |Updated:00:59 BST, 10 September 2024 e-mail 1 View comments The entertainment world is in mourning today as the legendary actor James Earl Jones - who has perhaps the most iconic voice in Hollywood history - has passed away at 93 on Monday. While he is a three-time Tony Award winner, two-time Emmy Award winner and a Grammy winner - just an Oscar shy of the EGOT - Jones is certainly best known for voicing two of cinema's most iconic characters: Star Wars' Darth Vader and The Lion King's Mufasa. Ironically, the screen icon rose not only from humble beginnings in Depression-era Mississippi, but he also overcame a speech impediment as well. Jones was born in Arakbutla, Mississippi in January 1931, though from the age of 5 on, he was raised by his maternal grandparents on their farm in Dublin, Michigan, moving north as part of the Great Migration. The move - with his mother and 13 cousins - was so traumatizing that it lead to a speech impediment... which Jones told Daily Mail back in March 2010 that he originally thought was a 'curse.' The entertainment world is in mourning today as the legendary actor James Earl Jones - who has perhaps the most iconic voice in Hollywood history - has passed away at 93 on Monday While he is a three-time Tony Award winner, two-time Emmy Award winner and a Grammy winner - just an Oscar shy of the EGOT - Jones is certainly best known for voicing two of cinema's most iconic characters: Star Wars ' Darth Vader and The Lion King's Mufasa. The Lion King's Mufasa, voiced by the late legendary actor James Earl Jones 'I had an Uncle Randy - who passed away last year - who was my brother really. I was the youngest grandchild and he was the youngest child and only four years older than me,' Jones began. 'Randy stuttered while we lived in Mississippi and I feel that I mocked him. I used to imitate him. I don't know whether I was imitating him to keep him company or to embarrass him. And then I ended up stuttering myself. I feel I was cursed,' he said. Read More James Earl Jones, 91, signs over the rights to his iconic Darth Vader voice in Star Wars franchise sparking speculation he's retired from the role While he was not actually cursed, there is still no exact cause known for why people start to stutter, though for Jones it was so bad for him he was practically mute for eight years of his childhood. 'As a small child, I would communicate to my family, or at least those who didn't mind being embarrassed by my stutter or my being embarrassed,' Jones explained. 'I did communicate with the animals quite freely, but then that's calling the hogs, the cows, the chickens. They don't care how you sound, they just want to hear your voice,' he added. 'Stuttering is painful. In Sunday school, I'd try to read my lessons and the children behind me were falling on the floor with laughter,' Jones said, though he admitted that stuttering is 'funny' to him. 'Well, I knew I was funny. I still know why it is funny. I think stutterers are funny. And I know it's rude and politically incorrect to laugh at stutterers. But I think it is OK because I know why they're funny,' he said. Jones would explain, 'They make people nervous. People think, when on earth are they going to get the word out, so they start laughing out of their own nervousness.' 'I had an Uncle Randy - who passed away last year - who was my brother really. I was the youngest grandchild and he was the youngest child and only four years older than me,' Jones began 'Randy stuttered while we lived in Mississippi and I feel that I mocked him. I used to imitate him. I don't know whether I was imitating him to keep him company or to embarrass him. And then I ended up stuttering myself. I feel I was cursed,' he said Jones would explain, 'They make people nervous. People think, when on earth are they going to get the word out, so they start laughing out of their own nervousness' The actor said that the stuttering continued when he started school, and it got so bad, 'that I gave up trying to speak properly.' 'There was another pupil who sat behind me who was also a stutterer and the teacher, who was young, would shake him, and I'd say, \"L-l-lll-l-let me teach him\" and I took over his studies, or when he had to talk. I understood him. I understood that shaking him was not going to help. She was relieved,' Jones added. The one teacher that truly helped him though was an English teacher and poet named Donald Crouch, who Jones calls, 'the father of my voice.' 'He was a contemporary of Robert Frost, and memorized a poem every day in case he ever went blind so he might have poems he could read in his head,' Jones recalled... adding later that ironically Crouch 'I had started writing poetry in high school and he said of one of them, \"Jim, this is a good poem. In fact, it is so good I don't think you wrote it. I think you plagiarised it. If you want to prove you wrote it, you must stand in front of the class and recite it by memory. Which I did. As they were my own words, I got through it,' Jones revealed. The teacher said that if Jones, was interested in being 'involved with words,' he would have to say them in front of the class and work on his stuttering. His teacher argued that if James Earl wanted to be 'involved with words' he would have to be able to say them and read to the class and work on the stuttering problem. 'And he got me engaged in the debating class, the dramatic reading class and so on. He got me talking, and reading poetry - Edgar Allan Poe was my favourite,' Jones said. The actor said that the stuttering continued when he started school, and it got so bad, ' that I gave up trying to speak properly' By the time he went to study drama at the University of Michigan, Jones had enough of a handle on his stuttering... though it never fully went away for good By the time he went to study drama at the University of Michigan, Jones had enough of a handle on his stuttering... though it never fully went away for good. 'I've learned that sometimes the synapses in your brain trip up, like stumbling on a sidewalk,' he explains, with consonants like M still a struggle for him. Jones made his stage debut in the 1950s and quickly became known as one of the best Shakespearean actors of his era, starring in Othello, King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream, to name a few. He won his first Tony in 1969 for playing boxer Jack Jefferson (based on real-life boxer Jack Johnson) in The Great White Hope, then earning his first Oscar nomination for reprising that role in the 1970 film adaptation. When George Lucas thought David Prowse's voice was unsuitable for Darth Vader, Jones was brought in for what would be one of the most iconic voice roles ever. Jones retired from acting in 2021 after reprising his role as King Jaffe Joffer in Coming 2 America. He also signed a deal in 2022 with Respeecher and Lucasfilm, authorizing the companies to use his archived audio for future Darth Vader voice performances.

Director Shaun Peterson’s feature Lover of Men: The Untold History of Abraham Lincoln is now playing in theaters. The movie uses interviews with prominent Lincoln scholars, in addition to never-before-seen photographs and letters, to suggest that the revered politician had romantic relationships with men. The film focuses on four men — including close friend Joshua Speed — with whom Lincoln shared a bed at separate points in his life, according to this research. “I’ve been researching this for a very long time, since around 2007,” Peterson tells The Hollywood Reporter. “[There was] fluidity that existed throughout human history, before the words and ideas ‘homosexual’ and ‘heterosexual’ were invented around 1870. That’s what really captivated me, is this idea that these binaries are very new. The binaries were used against people, whether it was the psychological community in the early days or the church, and then where we find ourselves today.” Producer Robert Rosenheck has been creative partners with Peterson for 20 years. Although Rosenheck is a lifelong Lincoln fan, he hadn’t been aware of the conversations surrounding whether the politician was queer until Peterson mentioned his plans for the project, at which point the producer jumped on board. “I said, ‘We need to make a movie that is not about Abraham Lincoln’s queerness — it’s got to be about something larger,'” Rosenheck recalls. “It tells a universal story. So if you’re a queer person, you see this film, and you experience a catharsis when you realize that America’s greatest president was queer. But if you’re not a queer person, the story is a universal one about tolerance and how we ‘other’ people.” Rosenheck is aware that social media users have voiced questions regarding why a film should emphasize apparent speculation about someone like Lincoln, who was private with key elements of his personal life. Lincoln had been married to Mary Todd Lincoln for more than two decades at the time of his assassination in 1865. “We get all kinds of reactions to the film,” the producer says. “Surprisingly, we’ve gotten a lot of people on the left who are skeptical, [and] people on the right who have seen the film and go, ‘Wow, I didn’t realize all that history. That’s fascinating.’ So it’s definitely a conversation starter and a mind-opener to see the film.” The team behind Lover of Men edited the film with a focus on getting it finished in time for this November’s presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and in fact, the movie hit theaters just days before Tuesday’s presidential debate. Seeing the project as a rallying cry for Americans to continue to encourage diverse voices and identities, the filmmakers acknowledge that conservative pundits, including Elon Musk, Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones, posted negatives remarks about the movie’s concept prior to its release. “I would just invite them — and anybody that has questions about the film — to watch the film, give it a chance, look at the evidence and look at the possible message,” says Peterson. “Just go into the film with an open mind because we’re at a time where we need some open minds. We are living history right now, everything that’s going on, and so it’s important to look back at our past in order to inform our future.” As for how the Lover of Men team feels about such right-wing pundits trolling the movie, Rosenheck says, “We’re thrilled when people like Elon Musk notice the film, and the reason that they notice the film is because it is compelling. This story is provocative. There are very few original stories.

However, Hogan will likely need strong support from moderates, including anti-Trump voters, to win in November.During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday, Hogan doubled down on his criticism of the former president. The former governor insisted that he was unconcerned after being asked by Tapper if he was was worried that Trump would \"come after\" him due to his \"election integrity\" stance if he wins back the White House.\"I'm not afraid of it, that's for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I've always been willing to stand up. He's lashed out at me a few times. But look, I've battled life-threatening cancer, a few mean tweets from Donald Trump aren't going to bother me.\"Hogan also denounced Trump for threatening unnamed Democrats, including \"donors,\" in a Truth Social post over the weekend with \"long term prison sentences\" for participating in a nonexistent scheme of \"rampant Cheating and Skullduggery\" in the 2020 election.The former governor touted his record of opposition to Trump since he announced his first presidential run in 2015, despite remaining a member of the same political party as the ex-president.\"I've been one of the most outspoken critics since the moment that Donald Trump came down the escalator... One of the only Republicans who never caved,\" said Hogan. \"I was disgusted by the talk about the stolen election and disgusted by what happened on January 6.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Monday evening.Hogan has said that he will vote for neither Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris in November. He previously refused to back both Trump and President Joe Biden at the ballot box in 2020, instead writing in former President Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004.Regardless of his outspoken criticism of Trump, the former president endorsed Hogan's Senate run during a Fox News interview in June, quickly prompting the former governor to say that he \"didn't seek\" the endorsement and has \"no interest in it.\"While it remains to be seen whether Hogan's apparent strategy of appealing to moderates by leaning into his Trump criticism will help him win the Senate race, a poll released by AARP last month showed the former governor tied with Democratic candidate Angela Alsobrooks.Due to the map of Senate seats up for grabs this election cycle being particularly favorable to Republicans, the election in blue-leaning Maryland is considered by most political observers to be a must-win contest for Democrats and their hopes of maintaining tenuous control of the upper chamber.","summary":"Hogan is a frequent GOP critic of the ex-president, calling on Trump to resign following the January 6 Capitol attack.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/larry-hogan-not-afraid-trump-senate-1951191","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2467633/larry-hogan-not-afraid-donald-trump-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:51:56","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":256028552,"title":"Oprah to Host ‘Unite for America’ Virtual Event for Kamala Harris","text":"Coming soon to a livestream near you: Oprah Winfrey. The television host and producing powerhouse will hold a virtual rally next week to corral support for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, according to a press release. Winfrey will headline “Unite for America,” billed by organizers as a “call to action” for pro-Harris grassroots groups. To produce the event, she is partnering with Win With Black Women, as well as more than 140 other organizations, including Cat Ladies for Kamala, Swifties for Harris, and White Dudes for Harris. Around 400 in-person voters will also attend the event, which will be beamed out to platforms including YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Twitch, and Instagram. The vice president’s campaign has found considerable success in the realm of virtual programming, with pro-Harris groups hosting giant, hourslong Zoom calls that have resulted in millions of dollars’ worth of donations. More than 44,000 people attended a call in July organized by Win With Black Women, while 190,000 people flocked into White Dudes for Harris’ Zoom event that same month. “I cannot think of anyone better to host this event than Oprah Winfrey, who has brought Americans of different generations, backgrounds, and experiences together in conversation for decades,” Jotaka Eaddy, the founder of Win With Black Women, said in the release. Winfrey made a surprise appearance at last month’s Democratic National Convention to offer Harris her endorsement in her first-ever convention speech. “Let us choose truth, let us choose honor, let us choose joy,” Winfrey told the roaring audience. “Because that is the best of America.” The 70-year-old also inadvertently made a viral star out of a woman in the crowd to whom the cameras cut after she made reference to “childless cat ladies,” a phrase disparagingly dropped by Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance earlier this summer. Although she has historically remained taciturn on political matters, Winfrey offered President Joe Biden and Harris her support in 2020, and helped campaign for former President Barack Obama in 2008. (She did not give him another endorsement during his 2012 re-election bid, saying it wasn’t necessary.) Winfrey herself was not quoted in Monday’s release. Over the weekend, she reunited with friend and fellow Montecito resident Meghan Markle for a “light-filled evening” at the opening of an independent bookstore in Santa Barbara. “Unite for America” will stream on Sept. 19.","summary":"Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty ImagesComing soon to a livestream near you: Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe television host and producing powerhouse will hold a virtual rally next week to corral support for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, according to a press release.\n\nWinfrey will headline “Unite for America,” billed by organizers as a “call to action” for pro-Harris grassroots groups.

A recent survey, however, shows that this positive momentum may be fading, as nearly 30 percent of voters still feel they don’t know enough about Harris and almost half of voters consider her views as “too liberal or progressive.” With 60 days until election day, the survey found that while Trump is maintaining support for his presidential bid, voters remain uncertain about where Harris stands on key policy issues. According to the survey, 28 percent of voters wanted to learn more about Harris, compared with only 9 percent who said the same for Trump. Voters think Trump is closer to the center of the political spectrum, which provides an advantage for the former president. A near majority of voters said Trump is “not too far” to the left or right on policy issues, while around one-third said he’s too conservative. In contrast, nearly half of voters said Harris is “too liberal or progressive” and 41 percent believed she’s “not too far either way.” Harris and Trump will face off for the first time on Sept. 10, in a debate that could significantly shape the presidential race. Both candidates are expected to use the debate to appeal to undecided voters and energize their supporters to turn out in November. In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN on Aug. 29, Harris faced questions about her shifting positions on fracking and border security. Her evolving stance on key issues will likely face scrutiny during the Sept. 10 debate. Harris and Democrats enjoy an advantage in terms of voter enthusiasm, with 91 percent of Democrats expressing enthusiasm compared with 85 percent of Republicans, according to the survey. In addition, voters trust Harris more when it comes to abortion and democracy issues. Meanwhile, Trump has an advantage on issues such as the economy and immigration. The NYT survey was conducted nationwide among 1,695 registered voters from Sept. 3 to 6. According to the poll, voters remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. Only 30 percent of likely voters believe the country was on the right track. In terms of representing change, 53 percent of the likely voters see Trump as the candidate who will bring about change, while only 25 percent view Harris as representing change. Harris has been preparing for the high stakes debate at a hotel in Pittsburgh since Sept. 5. She has also been using her downtime to get out and meet with supporters. On Sept. 7, the vice president visited Penzeys Spices, a small business in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, where she met with workers and local customers. When asked whether she was ready to face Trump, Harris told reporters, “Yes, I am.” ABC will host the debate in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center. The two candidates will be standing throughout the event, which will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks, according to the network. The debate will begin at 9 p.m. EDT.","summary":"Voters remain uncertain about where Harris stands on key policy issues, the survey found.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-poll-shows-harriss-august-momentum-fading-5721161","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/09/id5721059-EpochImages-5075234700-xl-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:46:25","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":256027970,"title":"How Harris and Trump are preparing for debate","text":"How Harris and Trump are preparing for debate Debate day is one day away and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump deadlocked in a new national poll.

Harris spent the weekend cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh where she focused on honing crisp two-minute answers, per the debate’s rules. ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch Meanwhile, Trump has publicly dismissed the value of studying for the debate. The former president is chose instead to fill his days with campaign-related events. “He can say outrageous things. It won’t detract from his support. Harris, on the other hand, has the potential to drop, lose some enthusiasm, or she could gain it all, right?” said Wayne Steger, political science professor at DePaul University. Steger said while Harris, a former prosecutor, is detail-oriented, she must keep policy issues simple. READ MORE: What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate “If she can paint Donald Trump as not having new ideas and she’s the future, then she creates that change candidate, and then, I think, is the frame she wants to go for,” he said. Trump is expected to improvise using the same predictable themes he used against President Joe Biden: immigration and inflation. “I think that Kamala Harris will see a lot of this coming, and of course, her strengths as a former prosecutor are being prepared and having a game plan about how to respond when the expected and the unexpected happens,” said Northwestern University Director of Debate Dan Fitzmier. MORE 2024 ELECTION: Where Harris, Trump stand on key issues Debate experts say Trump’s strength is debate experience and his love for the camera, but the rules are different from past debates. There will be no opening statements, no studio audience, no pre-written notes or huddling with staff during commercial breaks, and microphones will be muted when it’s not the candidate’s turn to speak. Since the last presidential debate resulted in a sitting president dropping out of the race, Tuesday’s debate will be quite significant. “Debates are consequential again, and for so many years, we kind of got used to them being a little boring. In this case, there’s gonna be a huge audience,” Fitzmier said. The 90-minute debate will have two commercial breaks. As of now, the ABC debate is the only one scheduled between Harris and Trump. A vice-presidential debate is set for Oct. 1.

Homelessness cannot, as a “thing,” be solved. It is a multifaceted state of living and is not fixed by simply finding cots and lockable doors for everybody who meets some definition of being “homeless.” If we look at all the factors that lead to a person being disconnected from society, the core state of being homeless, there are many contributing factors but there is no simple cause. There’s no way to “attack” this “problem” when it’s not really a problem, it’s a symptom. “Homeless” will only be reduced by our making structural changes in schooling, families, employment markets, financial markets, business models, health care and communities. Chris Brown Oakland Prop. 36 will drain funds from useful programs Re: “Prop. 36’s smart response to crime, addiction” (Page A8, Sept. 8). The newspaper’s Sept. 6 editorial leads with the claim that Proposition 36 is a “smart response to crime, addiction and homelessness.” That claim is insulting to those who suffer from addiction or housing insecurity. By increasing the jail and prison populations, resources would be redirected from substance abuse programs and housing services to the courts, jails and prisons. Whether the costs of Proposition 36 are in the “low hundreds of millions” as estimated by the LAO or over $4 billion per year, as estimated by Californians for Safety and Justice, it is indisputable that resources for support and rehabilitation will be reduced if Proposition 36 passes. Proposition supporters apparently believe that more punishment is needed to address real social problems. For those of us who disagree, the answer is no on Proposition 36 and continued, expanded funding of successful efforts to reduce the social problems of addiction and homelessness. Jean Moses Oakland Reelect Karla Brown mayor of Pleasanton I have been a proud and happy resident of Pleasanton now for over 33 years. Mayor Karla Brown is a diplomatic listener and balances multiple competing interests in a true executive manner. She really cares, which matters the most.

Neil Kripalani Pleasanton Second Amendment’s misreading costs lives We have slowly become acclimated to insanity. The latest school shooting, four dead, nine wounded, will pass with hardly a notice. No surprise, only threadbare repetitions of empty outrage. Students no longer feel safe at school, not in our misunderstood era of bogus interpretations of the Second Amendment. When the founders wrote the Second Amendment was this what they had in mind? “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” Why do defenders of this amendment always leave out the first half? It’s about well-regulated, state-run militias ready to be called on to defend the republic, written by patriots who feared national armies being used to crush the people. Does anybody think about what that means? It’s not about private gangs of gun owners. Please, read your Constitution. Michael Steinberg Berkeley We shouldn’t fear GOP, Dems cooperating My current political heroes are Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Liz Cheney and her father, Dick Cheney, who has surprisingly joined this elite group with dedication and spunk. This is the last chance to bring back the original Republican Party that I voted for about as much as I voted for my party, which is Democratic. In those days we looked at the pluses and minuses of both sides and decided who to vote for, which was sometimes a difficult choice. For example, Reagan and Gorbachev worked together to ensure no nuclear war. In the future, I hope that the two opposing sides in a similar situation will forget their egos and self-interests and accomplish this type of cooperation again. As Einstein once said, he isn’t sure what the next world war will be fought with, but the following war will be fought with sticks and stones. Gerald Bohm Concord Modern tech makes it hard to make friends Re: “America’s loneliness epidemic has a cure” (Page A9. Sept. 8). We’re lonely because we’ve allowed those old-fashioned things like schools and families to become much less important because of cell phones and social media. But schools usually required learning as a result of interaction with others — not just looking something up on Wikipedia. Families teach children how to love and trust, and how they can apply those abilities as they grow up. Cell phones and social media are certainly here to stay. However, unless we recognize that personal interactions are also very important, it will become more and more difficult to simply “make a new friend.” Daniel Mauthe Livermore","summary":"East Bay Times Letters to the Editor for Sept. 10, 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/09/letters-1862/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SJM-L-ENCAMPMENT-0818-3.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:30:37","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":256027642,"title":"Harris adviser lays out debate preparations","text":"Harris adviser lays out debate preparations Vice President Kamala Harris is in Pittsburgh ahead of Tuesday's debate with former President Donald Trump.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Carolina Piras For Mailonline Published:00:21 BST, 10 September 2024 |Updated:00:24 BST, 10 September 2024 e-mail 5 View comments Beyonce is reportedly set to 'unveil a series of UK stadium gigs for next summer' going head-to-head with Oasis' stadium tour. The music icon, 43, is rumoured to have already planned five dates at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in London - and will be rivalling the iconic band's epic reunion stadium tour. A source told The Sun: 'Beyonce is about to raise the roof. The demand for tickets will be just like Oasis' and will rival fans' rush to get their hands on a seat. 'Oasis and Beyonce are top tier and demand for tickets will be fierce. Over seven million people tried to get Oasis tickets — and Beyonce's fans will be out in force too.' Summer 2025 will be full of major artists filling UK arenas as Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Usher and Sabrina Carpenter are also reportedly planning live dates next year. The insider explained: 'The boost to the economy is going to be phenomenal.' Beyonce is reportedly set to 'unveil a series of UK stadium gigs for next summer' going head-to-head with Oasis' stadium tour She will be rivalling the iconic Oasis' epic reunion stadium tour (Liam and Noel Gallagher pictured) Meanwhile, Oasis have 'verbally agreed' to play stadiums in America as part of their epic reunion tour. Read More Noel Gallagher is worth '8 times more' than his younger brother Liam - but BOTH are 'set to earn £400million' with highly anticipated Oasis reunion Liam, 51, and Noel Gallagher, 57, are set to sign a multi-million pound deal to play their biggest-ever US concerts, as the band have 'financial incentive' to expand the tour. A source told The Mirror: 'Their promoters at Live Nation are incredibly keen for this to happen, and Liam and Noel have verbally agreed plans. The question of if they will manage to go the duration of the tour without falling out has been raised, but there is now a massive financial incentive for them to keep the show on the road.' The report claims the band will play the 70,000 seat SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles as well as other huge venues across the United States. Billboards in New York's Times Square appeared to tease US dates. Electronic messages featured the Amazon Music logo and a picture of the Gallagher brothers with the message: 'If we need to put up a billboard to get these guys to come to the States, here it is.' It comes after Oasis have announced details of how fans who missed out on tickets in last weekend's ticketing farce can get a second chance at securing a spot at the Manchester band's reunion gigs. A source told The Sun: 'Beyonce is about to raise the roof. The demand for tickets will be just like Oasis' and will rival fans' rush to get their hands on a seat' Oasis have 'verbally agreed' to play stadiums in America as part of their epic reunion tour The rock outfit has revealed that true fans who had been sitting in the queue on Ticketmaster as the scramble for briefs began may receive an invite to buy tickets for the extra Wembley dates announced last week. Posting on their official account on X, formerly Twitter , the band said in a statement that registered Ticketmaster account holders who had been waiting to snap up spots at a specific show could receive a follow-up email inviting them to join the ballot. However, entry to the ballot will not guarantee fans a chance to buy tickets - with the band warning that entry into the box office will be 'strictly limited'. The invitations are being dished out for the two further gigs at Wembley Stadium on September 27 and 28 next year, added due to the overwhelming demand. Liam and Noel Gallagher, pictured here at the V Festival in Chelmsford in Essex in August 2005, have not played together after Oasis broke up in 2009 The band has been trying to reestablish goodwill with fans who were left bitterly disappointed when they failed to secure tickets for the limited run of reunion concerts announced on August 27. Millions of fans sought to secure some of the approximately one million tickets available for the 17 dates on the tour, which include two shows in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Dublin and five in Manchester and London apiece across July and August. But queues for some shows numbered more than 600,000 - and shortly after sales began scalpers began listing tickets on resale websites such as Viagogo for as much as £10,000.

At a Rotary Club meeting in a church south of Atlanta, the Georgia Secretary of State wants to assure any \"hardcore Republicans\" that he hasn't \"gone to the dark side\". What he means by that is the Democratic side of politics. Raffensperger is the Republican who pushed back when Donald Trump famously called him in January 2021 and said he wanted to \"find \"11,780 votes\" in Georgia. That would have given Trump one more vote than Joe Biden, who flipped the state in the 2020 presidential election from Republican to Democrat. Raffensperger's stance alienated the MAGA wing of his own party and led to threats against him and his family. But he stood firm and got re-elected as secretary of state. He has since overseen a series of voting reforms that he argues should strengthen trust in the electoral system and leave less room for conspiracy theories to flourish. The changes include more restrictions on the locations and opening hours of absentee ballot boxes. Photo identification is now required for all forms of voting, and it's illegal to give food or water to anyone waiting in line to vote. Democrats decried the changes as an assault on democracy. Raffensperger argues they benefit all Georgians. \"I want to really give you great confidence in Georgia, because we have a great story to tell,\" he tells the assembled Rotarians. But the actions of the Republican-dominated state election board are threatening to undermine those assurances. Taking on Trump's 'pitbulls' The board, which oversees and regulates elections in Georgia, has been making some other changes. The five-member board has been overhauled by Republicans in Georgia's state legislature. Raffensperger, its previous chairman, was removed from it. Three other Republicans have effectively been put in control. They have set about pushing through a series of new rules empowering local officials to investigate ballot counts at their own discretion. Raffensperger describes those new rules as \"a mess\". \"They're talking about opening up those ballot boxes at the local precincts, instead of bringing back to the headquarters in a secured box,\" the secretary of state told the ABC on the sidelines of the Rotary event. Marc Elias, a top election lawyer for the Democrats, told a podcast that the rules were akin \"to saying at a football game that we're going to give the scoreboard operator the opportunity to investigate for themselves whether a touchdown was scored\". The national and state Democratic parties have launched legal action demanding the rules be overturned. Raffensperger appears to agree with them, even if he won't say so outright. \"I do not support the rules as they are,\" he says. At a recent rally in Georgia, Trump called out the board's Republican members by name and called them \"pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory\". One of the so-called pitbulls is Janelle King, a former deputy director of the state Republican Party who was appointed to the board earlier this year. \"President Trump gets excited, he says a lot of things,\" she told the ABC. \"We get attacked 24/7, all day long, so I welcome positive comments.\" King insists she is not a MAGA extremist and says she's had no conversations with Trump or his team about the rule changes. She dismisses concerns they will lead to delays in certifying the vote. \"Why do we have to overturn a rule that gives election officials more confidence in their decisions?\" she says. \"These are the things that strengthen our elections.\" But Raffensperger fears they are \"really going to jam up the works\". \"When you have too much time, it's a great friend to conspiracy theories,\" he says. 'Out of its way to basically rig the election' Democratic state senator Nabilah Islam Parkes describes the board's new rules as \"unethical\" and \"illegal\". She's written to Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp asking him to remove the board members. \"I'm worried that the state election board is going out of its way to basically rig the election for this November 5,\" Senator Islam Parkes said. \"Last time around ... Donald Trump tried to overthrow our votes, and now him and his MAGA allies are doing similar things at the state election board.\" Kemp asked his attorney-general, Chris Carr, to determine whether he was obliged to open an investigation into the board's activities. Carr found he wasn't, leading Senator Islam Parkes to accuse him of \"providing cover for the MAGA election board members\". Critics of the state election board are urging voters to keep pressuring Kemp to take action. Back in 2020, Kemp also pushed back on Trump's attempts to challenge the outcome of the election, leading to a public falling out. Recently there seems to have been a thaw in relations and, so far at least, Kemp has given no signal he's prepared to intervene in the dispute about the board's actions. Battle for the 'Black vote' The latest polls indicate another very close race in Georgia, with Trump neck and neck with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The Republicans think they have a good chance of taking back the traditionally conservative state and Trump is making overtures to African Americans who make up one third of Georgia's population. It's here in Georgia that the former president was booked last year on criminal charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results in the state of the 2020 election. The case is currently on hold pending appeals, but Trump is making hay with the mugshot he got at the local jail. \"The mugshot, we've all seen the mugshot, but you know who's embraced it more than anyone else? The Black population,\" the former president said earlier this year. \"It's incredible.\" Azad Ahmadi, an Atlanta businessman and committee chair on Georgia's Black Republican Council, describes that comment as \"awkward\". \"But I get it,\" he says. \"It's not a matter of Black men identifying with being criminals. \"This is about Black men feeling like they've been marginalised, and he's one of the few white men in America that can relate to that.\" African Americans have traditionally been part of the Democrats' core constituency. In 2020 Joe Biden secured 92 per cent of the Black vote nationwide. Even a small shift in voting patterns could have seismic consequences. Azad, a 41-year-old army veteran, said he realised before the 2016 election that the Republican Party was more aligned with his \"core values\" than the Democratic Party. He was also drawn to Trump's background as a property tycoon. \"I decided that one of the things that this country needed was a businessman, and so that was very appealing to me at the time.\" For a while Azad says he kept his thoughts to himself. He jokes that, even in 2020, when he mentioned his support for Trump at his barber shop, he thought he was going to have to shoot his way out of there. Now, he says, the conversation is more open. Maurice Combs doesn't buy that. The Atlanta master barber says Trump's claims that Black men relate to his mugshot are \"like a slap to the face\". \"Because he's privileged,\" says Maurice. \"I got friends that can't vote because they're convicted of a felony and he can run for president.\" Maurice began sweeping floors in a barber shop as a teenager, and he's been working in the profession for three decades. The 51-year-old is not convinced more Black men will vote for Trump this time around. \"I don't know what Black men he talking about. Might be the guys around him that say yes to everything he say.\" Maurice doesn't think too highly of politicians in general, but says he will be voting for Kamala Harris. \"In America, we always have to go for the lesser of two evils, and I have to do what I think is going to be better for my people in the long run.\" But Harris can't rely on the support of Black voters, even here in the Deep South. Azad Ahmadi's fiancée, 34-year-old Alexandra Knoten, thinks that for the first time in her life she'll back a Republican presidential candidate. \"Your initial thought is, wow there's an African-American woman in the position to be president. \"And then that facade kind of went out the window. It's like, where has she been the whole presidency when Biden was here? I mean, it's like she was a ghost.\" When she was growing up in Louisiana, Alexandra said she just accepted that everybody around her voted Democratic. That's just the way it was. \"It's kind of like, your grandmother is a Democrat, your mother's a Democrat, so you're automatically a Democrat.\" Some of her relatives still can't believe she's \"really gonna vote for Trump\". But the sales and events manager says she also felt better off under Trump than Biden. \"I think my monthly cost in gas is about almost $1,000 or more a month, and I didn't have that issue when Trump was in office.\" A brewing political storm Georgia's secretary of state is having people from his office drop in on voting offices across Georgia to test their electronic election systems, sometimes with the media in tow. \"We want everyone to understand that we have fair, secure, accurate elections here in Georgia,\" Raffensperger tells a group which includes the ABC and crews from the US, UK and Germany. The company whose voting machines Georgia uses, Dominion, settled a defamation case against cable news giant Fox last year for $US787.5 million ($1.17 billion). Dominion sued Fox News and Fox Corporation over the airing of conspiracy theories involving the machines. Raffensperger assures the assembled media that the test at the Spalding County offices has confirmed everything is working perfectly. He wants to prevent a repeat of the chaos that followed the last vote. After he resisted Trump's attempts to find him more votes in 2020, Raffensperger says he was doxed. In 2022, he told a congressional committee that threatening messages his wife received were often sexualised and were \"disgusting\". Raffensperger also testified that someone broke into the home of his widowed daughter-in-law and her two children. (Raffensperger's son died in 2018 of a fentanyl overdose.) \"We were very concerned about her safety also.\" Asked at the time why he didn't just quit and walk away, he said he \"had to be faithful to the constitution\". \"I think sometimes moments require you to stand up and just take the shots.\" If one of those moments arises again, Raffensperger says he won't hesitate to do what he thinks is right. \"I'm always prepared to follow the law and follow the constitution,\" he told the ABC. \"I'll do my job.\"","summary":"A shake-up of the state election board in Georgia means it's now controlled by Republicans, who are changing voting rules.

The grassroots groups, which include White Dudes for Harris, Win with Black Men, Comics for Kamala, Republicans for Harris, Latino Men for Kamala and several others, quickly emerged after Harris replaced President Joe Biden in the Democratic ticket for the 2024 presidential race. With many identity-driven groups hosting lengthy, celebrity-studded online meetings, the 140 groups have raised millions for the vice president’s election bid. “This ‘Unite for America’ call will be a powerful moment that demonstrates the urgency that we all feel in this moment and more importantly the impact of our collective activation to move our nation forward with Vice President Kamala Harris as our 47th President,” Jotaka Eaddy, founder of Win with Black Women (WWBW) said in a statement. “I cannot think of anyone better to host this event than Oprah Winfrey, who has brought Americans of different generations, backgrounds, and experiences together in conversation for decades.” To date, over $20 million has been raised during the multiple Zoom calls for the Harris campaign, according to event organizers. The event on Sept. 19 from Winfrey and the leaders of Win With Black Women will “serve as a call to action to work in communities throughout battleground states to register people to vote and build support,” according to a press release. Winfrey will also bring in voters from all over the country to discuss why they support Harris, what they believe is at stake in this election, and why voting in this presidential election matters to them. The idea for this event was born when Winfrey and Eaddy connected and discussed how to create a sense of unity among the electorate and create a call for voters across the country, the release for the event states. The event is set to take place on Sept. 19 at 8 p.m. and will be viewable on Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok, Twitch and other online platforms. Anyone interested in viewing the event can to join the conversation at UniteForAmerica2024.com With the announcement on Monday of Winfrey and WWBW’s event, several leaders of the groups for Harris released statements regarding the value they anticipate will have for Harris’ campaign and for voter turnout in the general election. “We understand the importance of showing up for progress that benefits all women,” said Shannon Watts, organizer of White Women: Answer the Call and Show Up for Kamala Harris. “There is no better person than Oprah Winfrey to lead this event and bring together so many diverse groups of people who are fiercely determined to uplift every community in our nation and elect Kamala Harris.” “You have seen so many groups come together because we realize that an injustice to one of us is an injustice to all of us,” said Regina Montoya, co-lead of Latinas for Harris. “The next several weeks will be crucial for the future of all of these groups, which is why we are thrilled to join and show our solidarity. We are ready to Unite for America and show what these groups are capable of.” “We couldn’t be more excited to be participating in Unite for America,” said Ross Morales Rocketto of White Dudes for Harris. “We stand on the shoulders of the incredible work of Win with Black Women and Win With Black Men. We exist to create space in the Democratic Party for white men to do their part to help elect Kamala Harris to become the 47th President of the United States.” “As the official AANHPI affinity group working with the Harris Walz campaign to mobilize the South Asian community nationwide, we know the importance of South Asian voters as a key voting bloc in many battleground states,” said Harini Krishnan of South Asians for Harris. “From knocking on doors to recurring phone banks to combating misinformation through digital media campaigns to assembling a voter protection team, we are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that South Asian voters are the margin of victory this cycle in electing Kamala Harris as our first Black and South Asian woman President.” “JD Vance and the Project 2025 agenda would reduce us to our roles as mothers or the expectation of becoming one, but our value extends far beyond that,” said Blaire Postman of Cat Ladies for Kamala. “We’re proud to stand with everyone on this call to create a future where women are defined by their impact, not outdated stereotypes.” “This Unite For America rally represents a resurgence of joy, hope, and optimism,” said Pastor Mike McBride of Win With the Black Church. “That is because we are not gathering just to celebrate an individual – we’re proud to be coalescing around a shared set of values, like justice, equity and the betterment of our communities.”","summary":"Win with Black Women, the collective of community leaders working to elect female leaders of color is partnering with Oprah Winfrey for a live-streamed event that will unite the many grassroots political groups that have hosted Zoom events for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, they announced on Monday.  The grassroots groups, which include White Dudes for [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/oprah-winfrey-win-with-black-women-unite-zooms-kamala-harris-live-event-1235996278/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OprahWinfreyGettyImages-2090152403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:35","author":"Kevin Dolak","authors":["Kevin Dolak"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.044},{"id":256026948,"title":"What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate","text":"The June 27 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was arguably one of the most consequential in modern history, catalyzing Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21, less than a month later. The contest has completely changed since then, with Vice President Kamala Harris ascending to the top of the ticket and surpassing Trump in the polls, signaling that she may be overcoming some of the deficits that voters saw in Biden's campaign. Now it's time for another debate. Harris comes into this debate riding relatively high on climbing approval ratings and a small lead in national polling, as well as a wave of enthusiasm among her base following the Democratic National Convention in late August. Her performance Tuesday night in Philadelphia could either continue the upward trajectory or bring it to a halt, particularly as more undecided voters are likely to tune in than usual. With that in mind, we dug into the numbers to see what's on voters' minds heading into the first Harris-Trump presidential debate. Recent polling suggests that voters view Harris's campaign fairly favorably so far and think she's favored to win the debate. Meanwhile, Trump still has an edge on some of the most important issues on voters' minds, but he may be vulnerable to the same age-based attacks that his side once lobbed at Biden. From the time she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris's favorability has shot up. In 538's latest average, it's about 46 percent, just short of her disapproval rating. That's much better than where she was right before Biden dropped out, when she was underwater by around 15 points: Harris' favorability surge represents a notable improvement over Biden, who's been mired at around a -15 net favorability rating for most of this year, and it's also notably better than Trump, whose rating has remained mostly flat since the start of 2024. In our most recent average, he remains almost 10 points underwater (53 percent view him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably). In an ABC News/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 23-27, 56 percent of adults said Harris is doing an excellent or good job on her campaign, compared to 41 percent who said the same of Trump, and 53 percent said she is very or somewhat qualified to serve as president, compared to 47 percent who said so of Trump. And in the all-important horse race, she's currently ahead of Trump in 538's national polling average by about 3 points in head-to-head matchups - though her momentum looks to have stalled or slipped slightly in the last couple of weeks: We appear to be at the tail end of a honeymoon period for the Harris campaign, and polls suggest that's because her candidacy energized some of the many voters who were disillusioned and unexcited about the rematch between Trump and Biden. Indeed, in that same ABC News/Ipsos poll, 64 percent of her supporters said they strongly supported her, compared with only 34 percent who said the same of Biden in early July. Forty-five percent in the August poll also said they were very or somewhat satisfied with the choice between Harris and Trump for president, compared to only 28 percent who said the same about Biden and Trump in July. Voters seem to be bringing some of their good vibes about Harris into their debate expectations too. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, a plurality of respondents (43 percent) said they expect Harris to win Tuesday's debate, compared to 37 percent who said they expect Trump to win. That's reversed from the last debate, where voters expected Biden to perform poorly (and do worse than Trump) even before the debate. While higher expectations are a good sign for how Harris's campaign has been doing, they likely also mean that she has a higher bar to clear than Trump when it comes to impressing voters and meeting expectations. That's one reason this week's debate could be critical in whether Harris's honeymoon period translates into sustained gains, or fizzles out. So, what might voters be looking to hear from Harris and Trump in the debate? When it comes to the issues, both candidates will be looking to hold their ground on issues that they have an advantage on, while cutting into their opponents' lead on areas of weakness. Trump in some ways starts off with the high ground on key issues. The ABC News/Ipsos poll showed Trump with an advantage of 8 points over Harris when it comes to whom Americans trust more to handle inflation and the economy. Trump also had a 9-point advantage on the issue of immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and a 7-point advantage on handling the war between Israel and Hamas. Harris has an even larger advantage over Trump on her strongest issues in this poll: 16 points on abortion and race relations, and 10 points on health care. But other recent polling has shown that voters rank those issues as less important in determining their vote than the economy and immigration. (Health care and abortion ranked just after those two issues on a similar list, while race relations was among the least important to voters.) We'll expect both candidates to talk up signature issues like abortion (for Harris) and immigration (for Trump), but we'll also be looking out for how Harris tries to shift the narrative on the economy and immigration - and how well Trump stays on topic to bolster his advantage on those issues. Of course, debates are often as much about style as substance: Voters will be keeping a close eye on how the two candidates act on stage, or who seems more \"presidential.\" And when it comes to personal attributes, Harris generally outperformed Trump. Respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll were particularly likely to view her as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, 43 percent to 25 percent, and she came out ahead when respondents were asked which candidate represents their personal values and understands the problems of people like them. Notably, Harris also beat out Trump by a large margin when it came to who Americans think has the better \"physical health\" and \"mental sharpness\" to serve effectively as president, with more than twice as many saying Harris was in better physical health (57 percent to 25 percent). That difference underscores one of the most obvious ways Harris's candidacy changed the dynamic of this race - she's around 20 years younger than both Biden and Trump - and raises the question of whether Trump will face some of the same age-based concerns that drove Biden out of the race. Little about this presidential contest has been traditional, and after a first presidential debate blew open the presidential race in June, this debate is expected to attract more eyes than usual. In an unusually abbreviated race between Harris and Trump, the candidates have had a short amount of time to make their cases to voters, and this week's debate will be one of the most high-profile, and-high stakes, opportunities to do so. The country will be watching to see if Harris meets high expectations, and how Trump responds in their first head-to-head matchup.","summary":"Harris' favorability surge represents a notable improvement over Biden, who's been mired at around a -15 net favorability rating for most of this year.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-what-polls-say-ahead-presidential/15283512/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15283605_kamala-trump-538-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/090924-cc-abcnl-3p-polling-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:12","author":"FiveThirtyEight,Monica Potts","authors":["FiveThirtyEight","Monica Potts"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.109},{"id":256026832,"title":"What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate","text":"The June 27 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was arguably one of the most consequential in modern history, catalyzing Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21, less than a month later.

In an unusually abbreviated race between Harris and Trump, the candidates have had a short amount of time to make their cases to voters, and this week's debate will be one of the most high-profile, and-high stakes, opportunities to do so. The country will be watching to see if Harris meets high expectations, and how Trump responds in their first head-to-head matchup.","summary":"Harris' favorability surge represents a notable improvement over Biden, who's been mired at around a -15 net favorability rating for most of this year.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-what-polls-say-ahead-presidential/15283512/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15283605_kamala-trump-538-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/090924-cc-abcnl-3p-polling-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:12","author":"FiveThirtyEight,Monica Potts","authors":["FiveThirtyEight","Monica Potts"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.109},{"id":256027536,"title":"Ahead of Trump-Harris debate, Minnesota Democrats focus on former president","text":"Elections Ahead of Trump-Harris debate, Minnesota Democrats focus on former president Donald Trump, abortion rights and the “Project 2025\" conservative policy framework are the focus for the DFL headed into the debate. By Josie Albertson-Grove The Minnesota Star Tribune September 9, 2024 at 11:14PM Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet for the first time in a televised debate on ABC on Tuesday. (Haiyun Jiang and Eric Lee) Ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate and less than two weeks before early voting begins, Minnesota’s Democratic leaders are keeping their focus on the former president and abortion rights. Despite Gov. Tim Walz’s nomination as the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate, almost all the talk at a Monday news conference by Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and DFL Party Chair Ken Martin was focused on the conservative Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025,” a collection of policy proposals the think tank wants to see enacted if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and the possibility that abortion would be banned nationwide. Flanagan said policies like abortion bans are already being enacted in some parts of the country. “Half the women in this country do not have access to safe, legal abortions,” she said. “We know that because they are coming here.” The combative tone was a marked contrast to the “politics of joy” chord that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has sought to strike, especially since Walz joined the ticket. “It is happening right now and we don’t have to wait until day one” of a second Trump administration, Flanagan said. Tayler Rahm, a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign in Minnesota, said he also expected to see a marked contrast between Harris and Trump. “I think people tomorrow are going to watch two completely different candidates,” Rahm said Monday. He said he expected Trump to talk about how prices were lower during his presidency, and about border security and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza that began while Harris has been serving as vice president. Rahm said whatever policy proposals Harris brings up, he wants to know what she has been doing for three and a half years as vice president to advance them. The Democrats also attacked Trump on style. Related Coverage Nation Little debate that Pennsylvania is key as Harris and Trump prep for Philly showdown “Just disagreeing on policies is not weird,” Carter said, echoing Walz’s well-worn quip about Trump and his vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance. “Going on and on and on about Hannibal Lecter is weird,” Carter said, referring to the fictional horror movie villain Trump has spoken about often in campaign speeches this summer, comparing the movie character to undocumented immigrants. Flanagan and Carter both said they anticipated Trump would be disruptive during the debate.","summary":"Donald Trump, abortion rights and the “Project 2025″ conservative policy framework are the focus for the DFL headed into the debate.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/ahead-of-trump-harris-debate-minnesota-democrats-focus-on-former-president/601141500","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/6XECBHHP3RFVPLOC5UOGADXS3E.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:11","author":"Josie Albertson","authors":["Josie Albertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":256027168,"title":"The important action Kamala Harris needs to take against Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump is now exposed","text":"A liberal columnist says Kamala Harris has to repudiate the unpopular positions of Joe Biden and say how she’ll be a change from her current boss to beat Donald Trump. Harris has struggled to differentiate herself from Biden, who was underwater in the polls before he dropped out of the race. Jonathan Chait, a reliably left-wing pundit who pushed for the Dems to dump Biden after his debate disaster in Georgia, now says Harris has to ‘cut Biden loose’. He slammed Harris’ CNN interview for ‘turning the page buy contrasting herself exclusively against Donald Trump, rather than her current boss’. Chait then asks, ahead of Tuesday night’s pivotal debate: ‘Why is this a struggle? Why not directly repudiate unpopular Biden positions?’ He goes on to cite polls released by the New York Times Sunday which says 61% of voters want someone to bring ‘major change’ from Biden. However, only 25% of those surveyed would see Harris as being a major change from the president. He says that these polling figures and Biden’s unpopularity before he dropped out of the race make him a ‘liability’ for Harris. Because of this, Chait argues ‘Harris’s strategy should focus entirely on catering to the public with no attention whatsoever to Biden’s feelings’. He finishes his New York Magazine piece by disagreeing with a Trump spokesperson who claims Harris is tethered to Biden completely as the VP. ‘The vice-presidency is a strange office, lacking any formal authority. Its inhabitants have generally lamented the powerlessness of the job. Harris really ought to stop thinking about her position as a confining dilemma and realize that it is a liberating opportunity to define her campaign as whatever she wants it to be, unburdened by what has been.’ The latest polls – which include the Times’ poll Chait cited – have tilted the Daily Mail’s election model in Donald Trump’s direction giving him a decisive lead over Kamala Harris a day before he goes head to head with his Democratic rival on the debate stage. The algorithms show he now has a 55 percent chance of becoming president, a 4.5-point boost since last week. The model works by crunching all the latest polling numbers—national and state—along with decades of historical trends and economic data before feeding the results through the electoral college to work out who is most likely to hit the 270 votes needed to win the election. Our result comes hard on the heels of a New York Times/Siena College poll giving Trump a one-point lead at the weekend, suggesting Harris’s honeymoon is coming to an end. Feeding that and other recent surveys into the model, developed for us by J.L. Partners, shows that the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania has now moved clearly into the Trump column. Tuesday brings a potentially decisive moment when Harris meets Trump in a televised debate. The Harris campaign’s goal for the debate is to create a viral moment similar to what Harris experienced during her questioning of Brett Kavanaugh in his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and during her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, when she famously told him: ‘I’m speaking.’ Those moments played over and over again on social media, casting her in a good light. Her advisers expect many Americans will see the debate through those types of social media moments. Trump, however, will be on mute while Harris answers questions, denying him the opportunity to interrupt and her the opportunity to snap back at him. Harris is locked up with staff in Pittsburgh, going through five days of intense debate prep before the September 10th showdown in Philadelphia. The debate will be the first time she and Trump actually meet. The two have been in the same room before – Harris, as senator, attended Trump’s State of Union addresses in the House chamber when he was president but the two have never been formally introduced. The pressure is on. Joe Biden’s performance in the first presidential debate resulted in his departure from the race. While no one expects the same result for Harris, she will need to show she can take on the former president.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA liberal columnist says Kamala Harris has to repudiate the unpopular positions&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The important action Kamala Harris needs to take against Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump is now exposed first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-important-action-kamala-harris-needs-to-take-against-joe-biden-to-beat-donald-trump-is-now-exposed/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/09/23/89465421-13831391-image-a-1_1725922061091.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:13:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":256026470,"title":"Ariana Grande Applauds Megan Thee Stallion for Encouraging People to Vote for Kamala Harris","text":"Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion may have collaborated on “34+35,” but their stance on whether people should vote in the upcoming election is as simple as 1+1.

In late July, a network of influencers who had been recruited to push conservative messages about Donald Trump or President Joe Biden throughout the summer, received an email requesting they make colorful sexual insults about Harris, according to Semafor. In return, they would be paid tens of thousands of dollars via Zelle, a digital payments network. The email, titled “War Room – Kamala Messaging” was followed by a Zoom invitation from the person who organized the group, a man calling himself James Bacon. On the Zoom call, individuals kept their cameras off and did not identify themselves by name, the report noted. However, Semafor reports that one person on the call was able to identify an individual who spoke up in protest of making sexual allegations about Harris and later left the call - disgraced Republican congressman George Santos. The unidentified person who participated in the calls claims Santos broke the usual anonymity to say he disapproved of the messaging which included comparing Harris to the “Hawk Tuah girl” - a woman who went viral for talking about sex - and other crude sexual allegations. Santos confirmed to The Independent that he was invited to the call and joined out of curiosity but was quickly taken aback by the organizers’ suggestions to call Harris “a hoe” and openly objected to it. He said the message the organizers provided was “lewd, disgusting and unbecoming of the political process” so he logged off. “Nothing in this world would make me smear VP Harris or anyone running for office with slanderous sexual innuendos, it’s beneath the standards of what the American people deserve,” Santos said. “If you’re getting paid, I don’t care how much it is. Nothing justifies calling a person running for President of the United States ‘a hoe’,” he added. The former New York congressman said the call was the first time he was invited to the group by Bacon. The Independent has reached out to an email associated with a man named James Bacon for comment. It is unclear if the person behind the social media network is actually named James Bacon. A man named James Bacon who served as a former aide to Trump and has been an adviser to The Heritage Foundation, told Semafor he was unfamiliar with the social media influencer group. The individual who was on the call claimed Bacon’s voice at public appearance did not match the one on the Zoom calls. Days after the influencers received the email and call request, Santos said he was so “bothered” by it that he tweeted criticizing the “talking points” of the election, specifying “conservative influencers talking about Kamala’s sex life and race.” Criticisms about Harris’s sex life and history began swirling on social media around the time she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket. This included allegations of infidelity, using sexual relationships to advance her political career and more. In late August, Donald Trump reposted on Truth Social an unsubstantiated suggestion that Harris gave sexual favors in exchange for power. Four people who made posts or videos accusing Harris of sex-related improprieties around the time of the email being sent, denied involvement with the influencer network being paid to push similar rhetoric, Semafor reported. However, one individual who spoke with the news outlet said they were paid upwards of $20,000 for their work. Zelle receipts viewed by Semafor confirmed their information. This individual claimed the payments were connected to an anonymous, wealthy American, but offered no evidence to substantiate this claim, the report noted. The participant indicated the payments were connected to an unnamed wealthy American but there was no evidence linking them, per the report. Besides making sexual smears against Harris, the mysterious group also encouraged influencers to attack Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump’s New York criminal trial, accuse Biden of being weak and claim Democrats were weaponizing the government against conservatives.","summary":"Ex-congressman George Santos told The Independent he was invited to join call but objected to making such slurs about Harris","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/influencers-paid-sexual-smears-harris-b2609542.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/09/15/newFile-7.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/72WTN4Z6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:04:31","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":256026684,"title":"How to watch the Harris-Trump presidential debate on TV and online","text":"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are set to meet Tuesday, Sept. 10, in Philadelphia, for what might be their only debate before the November election. It will be Harris’ first debate as a presidential nominee. Former President Trump — a veteran of the debate stage after winning the Republican nomination in 2016, 2020 and 2024 — debated current President Joe Biden 75 days ago. In that content, Biden’s halting performance led to calls for him to step down as the party’s nominee, which he eventually did, leading the party to nominate Vice President Harris as its presidential candidate.

Vance visits to western Pennsylvania leave bellwether-county voters undecided","text":"ERIE, Pa. — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump deployed their running mates to a Rust Belt bellwether county to make their case to swing voters in a critical battleground state. But was anyone swung? History shows Erie County picks presidents — it went for Barack Obama twice, Trump in 2016, then Biden in 2020. Sen. J.D. Vance made his pitch there for the Trump ticket at the end of August, and voters said his story of growing up in a left-behind Ohio town resonated with them. Then Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made his Erie working-class overtures last week for the Democratic ticket. “I’m on the fence on both candidates,” Vince Palermo, a 45-year-old Millcreek Township small-business owner, told The Post at a gas station across the street from where Walz’s “New Way Forward” jet landed just moments before. Filling up his tank, Palermo noted that under Trump’s administration, “we didn’t have these price gouges.” Now “everything goes up.” Palermo, formerly on the Erie County Democrats’ board, registered as a Republican in 2020 and voted for Trump “to see what an outsider could do.” But in 2024, he’s struggling to support Trump and believes his attacks on judges have “made a mockery” of the criminal-justice system: The ex-prez “just doesn’t care.” Still, Palermo admitted it was “tough” to say if he could be swayed toward Harris. “I don’t think she has enough experience,” he said — unlike Hillary Clinton, for whom he voted in 2016. Palermo wasn’t too impressed with Walz’s Erie remarks but conceded the VP hopeful is “more of a person” than current VP Harris, noting he turned down salary increases as governor in 2023 and 2024. “He comes across as an average Joe, but I have my suspicions of the average Joe talk,” he said. Dems picked him “just because he has gray hair.” Palermo wasn’t the only undecided voter who stopped for gas in Millcreek Township that day. Chuck Jones, 40 and a box stacker from Erie, said he voted “straight Democrat” in 2020 but isn’t sure where his vote is going this year. “Everybody’s not who they say they are,” Jones told The Post. “They tell you one thing one minute, another the next minute.” Harris in her first interview as nominee said she wouldn’t ban fracking, which is big business in Pennsylvania — and denied she was flip-flopping after saying at a CNN town hall when running for president in 2019, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Lehualani Rounds, a 43-year-old Erie health-care worker, told The Post Harris “is too showy. She’s fake.” She plans to vote for Trump again because he “doesn’t sugarcoat things.” She’s not alone in her feelings on the race’s theatrics. Barry LaCastro, 50 and the business agent for Erie’s local International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union, isn’t impressed with the Vance-Walz mudslinging: “Why can’t you just run on your platform?” “People like me are tired of the name-bashing,” LaCastro told The Post, as his men broke down the set of the Walz rally and loaded equipment onto trucks headed for Pittsburgh. Harris is in a “verbal tug of war” because she says she’ll bring down costs, but “you are vice president,” he said. Still, “my soul can’t vote for” Trump and his “venom,” LaCastro said, even if he liked Trump’s economy. While his employees are evenly split between Harris and Trump, he said 30% are like him: undecided. Palermo knows a lot of “very disappointed” Americans “who are not going to vote.” He voted twice for Obama because “he could relate to the people.” He had the “essence of Kennedy.” “I’d like to see someone who can bring us together,” Palermo declared. Harris “just doesn’t have it, and I don’t know if she’s ever going to get it.” Kasheen Henderson, 58, a retired pipe fitter who’s voted predominantly for Democrats and works with a renters’ association to keep rents down in the area, is also undecided. “I’m up for grabs when it comes to this election. I don’t trust either party right now. I can point the finger at Trump a million times. Kamala, we can do the same,” adding the VP doesn’t have the experience he’s looking for in a president. “She’s a beautiful woman. She’s intelligent. Can she run this country? No,” Henderson said. His vote will come down to trust: “Too many people promise too many things.” His pocketbook will also play into his decision — he’s “not saving any money right now.” “How can I vote this person in when she’s part of that administration?” Henderson was set to meet with Walz while he was in town for the renters’ association, but the VP hopeful canceled. He says if and when the group does meet with Walz, “I might be able to make up my mind.”","summary":"ERIE, Pa. — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump deployed their running mates to a Rust Belt bellwether county to make their case to swing voters in a critical battleground state.

Given the hospital’s commitment to children’s health and well-being, this support seems counterintuitive. Numerous studies have highlighted the negative impacts of artificial turf. Artificial turf fields contain chemicals that can harm children through touch or inhalation. These chemicals also leach into the environment and pose risks to water quality and ecosystems. Additionally, artificial turf are heat islands, leading to increased temperatures and air pollution. And it coats our Earth with nonrecyclable plastic. It is concerning that Stanford Children’s Hospital would support a practice that endangers the very children they are dedicated to serving. I urge the hospital to reconsider its position and prioritize the long-term health and safety of our community. Dr. Susan Lessin Foster City Harris’ tax plan is fair and reasonable Re: “Harris’ economic plans show that she’s unfit” (Page A6, Sept. 5). Simply disagreeing with the tax policies of Kamala Harris does not make her unfit to be president. On the other hand, being an adjudicated sexual predator and a convicted felon should make someone entirely unfit to serve in the Oval Office Our corporations are not being overtaxed; they are making staggering profits. The so-called “death tax” is an estate tax, and it only applies to people with an actual estate to bequeath. Taxing “unrealized capital gains” is quite fair because the extremely wealthy do not actually earn any wages. Why shouldn’t someone with incredible wealth and massive disposable income pay the same percentage in taxes as the middle class? It must be great to have enormous wealth and receive all the benefits that taxes provide but rely on loopholes, tax shelters and lobbyists to avoid paying their fair share. Jerry Gudeman Santa Clara More abortions are bad for the United States Kamala Harris has made abortion a premier issue. However, the United States already has a declining number of younger people. China has already shown that limiting population creates serious problems. If abortion becomes even more common, birth rates will increasingly drop. This will reduce the pool of working taxpayers who are needed to expand the already bloated welfare state. Is this wisdom? Thinking people do not vote for Harris. John Burke Ben Lomond Rice already has failed test of leadership Re: “Wrong woman in state’s ‘favourite daughter’ role” (Page A6, Sept. 6). Regarding Condoleezza Rice as presidential material, she had her leadership opportunity. As secretary of state, Rice gave face to the Bush administration’s false assertion that Iraq had (or soon would have) weapons of mass destruction. This falsehood justified the go-to-war strategy of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and war strategist/intellectual Paul Wolfowitz. For her part, Rice stared Americans in the face and told us, “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.” Take a look around and see where we are now. The lie-induced Iraqi war cracked the Middle East. Rice owes Americans 10 years of silence, not tenure in the White House. James P. Walsh Los Gatos GOP lacks the courage to solve gun violence Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Thursday “lamented that school shootings in the U.S. have become ‘a fact of life.’“ It should not be a fact of life. What cowardly resignation. But that does not surprise me, given that the Republican ticket lacks backbone and leadership to deal with this national disgrace. They continue to defend the NRA and the gun lobby while spouting “thoughts and prayers.” Banning assault weapons and standing up to these lobbies is a huge first step in dealing with this national disgrace. However, that requires common sense and courageous leadership — things that are clearly lacking with Vance, Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans. Diego Certa Campbell It’s up to citizens to demand gun control Once again, we are hearing of the horrific experiences of schoolchildren due to the negligence of our country to create stricter gun control laws. Children should not have to carry the burden of frequent active shooter drills or live through school shootings in an environment where they are supposed to flourish as individuals. We need to be a country open to change for the betterment of our society and the safety of our children. Be the voice of the children who suffered from gun violence in a supposed safe place.

Speaking at the 2024 Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday, Pelosi was pressed by podcast host Kara Swisher on why the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump is so close. \"There are people who will never be, shall we say, inclined to support Democrats because of - they just have a different orientation toward women, people of color, LGBTQ, you know, they just are not ever going to be there,\" Pelosi said. \"So, say that's about like 30% or something like that… of the Republicans. \"And then you have very, very rich people who do not really want to pay taxes or have any regulation of clean air, clean water, any of that. So you have to deal with that. Now, it's not as many very, very rich people, but it's a lot of money that goes into a campaign.\" PELOSI PRAISES CA BILL GIVING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MONEY TO BUY HOMES: ‘AMERICAN DREAM’ ‘AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE’ \"But here's where I think we have to be as respectful and understanding as possible,\" she continued. \"There are people who are concerned. They have fear of globalization. They saw the factory down the road move overseas. They're fearful of innovation. Their father is a truck driver, and now they're gonna have auto-\" \"Autonomous truck,\" Swisher interjected. \"Yeah,\" Pelosi replied. \"And so the innovation, globalization, and they include immigration… So, understandably, these people have a concern about the future for themselves, but also for their children.\" CNN PANEL REACTS TO PELOSI REVEALING SHE AND BIDEN HAVEN'T SPOKEN SINCE HE DROPPED OUT: 'SHE'S IN CHARGE' Pelosi later told Swisher that she believed Trump has as much support as he does because he's a good \"snake oil salesman.\" Pelosi's comments resemble Hillary Clinton's infamous \"basket of deplorables\" comment during the 2016 election about Trump supporters. \"You can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call a basket of deplorables,\" Clinton said at a campaign event. \"They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up.\" During the same conversation, Pelosi suggested Trump would be a no-show at the ABC News Presidential Debate on Tuesday.

As evidenced in the very first 2024 debate between Trump and President Joe Biden, the head-to-head showdown can make or break a candidate. In the case in late June, Biden’s disastrous performance led to him to ultimately end his campaign amid pressure from top Democrats. All eyes will be on the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, who have remained close in polls ahead of the November election. After much back-and-forth on the rules and logistics, both parties agreed on the first debate and that will take place less than two months before Election Day. When is the Harris-Trump debate? The first debate between Harris and Trump will start at 9pm ET on Tuesday, September 10, and be hosted by ABC News. It will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is one of seven swing states that are critical in determining the election results. Harris and Trump are tied in the state. The debate will be moderated by the network’s World News Tonight anchor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis. It is set to run 90 minutes and will also be streamed on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. What are the debate rules? The rules largely mirror those that were in place during the Biden-Trump debate hosted by CNN. ABC News has said that microphones ‘will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate’. Harris’ campaign had argued that she would be ‘fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President’. The rule that microphone would be muted when an opponent is speaking was requested by Biden’s campaign. Trump’s campaign requested the rule again, and Harris’ campaign pushed back on it but lost. Who is favored to win the first presidential debate? An ABC-affiliated survey has the odd of who will win the debate at Harris at -300 and Trump at +200.

The Blue State governance model keeps giving taxpayers the blues, which is why more of the young and mobile want out.” Mideast watch: US Navy Can’t Stop the Houthis As the “Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group returned to the U.S. without dislodging the Iran-backed Houthis,” the “U.S. Navy has suffered its most significant setback,” reports Steve Cohen for The Hill. Keeping “these sea lanes open has been a key part of the Navy’s raison d’etre.” Yet “ships are still being diverted around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope” thanks to Houthi attacks. The effect “on the global economy is significant,” with “container shipping down 90 percent since December 2023.” Despite all “the effort, dedication, and skill shown by sailors and air crews, it was too little to get the job done,” as the “Houthis continue to control the Red Sea.” The primary reason? “The Biden administration concluded the cost” of deterring the Houthis “is not worth the political juice.” Conservative: Bernie Gives Away Kam’s Game Sen. Bernie Sanders on “Meet the Press” Sunday “said the quiet part out loud,” namely that “Kamala Harris’s sudden attempt to shift toward the center is nothing more than a political charade to win votes, not a genuine change of ideology,” fumes PJ Media’s Matt Margolis. The host “asked Sanders directly if Harris was abandoning her progressive ideals,” and “instead of offering a robust defense of her flip-flopping, Sanders tried to rationalize it. ‘No. I don’t think she’s abandoning her ideals. I think she’s trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election.’ ” It’s plain: “This is Sanders admitting that Harris is scamming the voters, not standing on principle.” Foreign desk: Red Lines for Our Allies? President Biden has restricted Ukraine from targeting Russian sites with US weapons, creating “red lines” that put our ally “at a disadvantage” in that war, rails Commentary’s Seth Mandel. Those lines remain even as Ukraine hopes “to survive long enough to get to end-stage negotiations,” where its recent foray in Kursk can improve its hand. Similarly, “the Biden administration delayed [Israeli military] operations in Rafah,” where six hostages were recently executed. So Israel had to “jump through hoops” to “get around the president’s red lines” there. Yet “Hamas has no red lines. Russia has no red lines. Only our democratic allies have red lines, under Biden and Kamala Harris. And we wonder why terrorism and authoritarianism are on the march.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"In response to the murder of American Hersh Goldberg-Polin by Hamas, President Biden sent “a letter of condolence” to his parents, scoffs HR McMaster at The Free Press.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/opinion/bidens-provocative-weakness-people-flee-high-tax-states-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-9qxhdyocu-1725921198567.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725906903&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 22:54:47","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":256026042,"title":"Donald Trump to return to Bay Area for fundraiser","text":"Former president — and presidential hopeful — Donald Trump is scheduled to return to the Bay Area for a fundraiser on Friday, Sept. 13. The San Francisco Republican Party promoted the event on its website but provided few details, noting only that it will take place beginning at 11:30 a.m. in Woodside, a bucolic wealthy town on the Peninsula. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fundraiser will be hosted by tech billionaire Tom Siebel, a relative of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. Tickets are reportedly going for around $500,000. Trump and his GOP running mate, JD Vance, have held several fundraisers with Bay Area billionaires in the past. Trump raised $12 million at the home of San Francisco billionaire David Sachs in June. At the end of July, Vance appeared at a fundraiser hosted by crypto billionaire Mike Belshe at the Four Seasons in East Palo Alto. The wealthy Bay Area is a popular fundraising spot for both parties. Democratic presidential hopeful Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in deep blue San Francisco in August. While Harris, who spent part of her childhood in the East Bay, has far outpaced Trump in fundraising in her home state, raising $136 million compared to Trump’s $41 million, California remains the fourth-largest contributor to the GOP war chest, according to Open Secrets. While the Bay Area isn’t among the top metropolitan contributors to the Republican presidential campaign, exclusive Los Altos has emerged as a leading ZIP code, contributing $3 million to the Trump campaign so far. While there’s no word if vice presidential contender Vance will also be in Woodside, the Republican campaign has been leaning on his Silicon Valley links. Before he became well known for his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, he was a junior venture capitalist who worked closely with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Vance counts billionaire investor Marc Andreessen and Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk as tech-industry connections. “He is a bit of an unusual Republican national candidate,” said Hoover Institution policy fellow Bill Whalen, “in that he could come out here and talk the language and walk the walk of Silicon Valley.” Harriet Blair Rowan contributed reporting.","summary":"Trump will travel to Woodside on Friday.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/09/donald-trump-to-return-to-bay-area-for-fundraiser/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-NEWS-NY-TRUMP-TRIAL-ZUM.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 22:53:42","author":"Ryan Macasero","authors":["Ryan Macasero"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.422},{"id":256026006,"title":"Jack White, Meg White Blast Donald Trump With Lawsuit: ‘This Machine Sues Fascists’","text":"They’re definitely not going to be friends — ever. The White Stripes rocker Jack White followed through with his recent promise to sue Donald Trump, filing a copyright infringement lawsuit Monday along with bandmate Meg White over Trump’s unauthorized use of the duo’s classic rock anthem “Seven Nation Army” in a campaign video. According to the complaint obtained by Rolling Stone and filed in federal court in Manhattan, Trump and his team engaged in “flagrant misappropriation” of the hit song when they used its “highly-distinctive and immediately recognizable introductory riff” as the soundtrack to a video showing Trump boarding a plane. The lawsuit alleges Trump’s team shared the video on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Instagram. “This machine sues fascists,” White wrote in an Instagram post Monday that announced the lawsuit. In a related post last month, White shared the disputed video clip, vowed to sue, and offered a “double fuck you” to Trump after one of his aides allegedly pushed a staffer at Arlington National Cemetery during a visit to the burial ground on Aug. 26. “Oh….Don’t even think about using my music you fascists. Law suit coming from my lawyers about this [to add to your 5 thousand others],” White wrote in the post. “And as long as I’m here, a double fuck you DonOLD for insulting our nation’s veterans at Arlington you scum. You should lose every military family’s vote immediately from that if ANYTHING makes sense anymore.” Trump, his campaign, and his spokesperson Margo Martin are listed as defendants in the new complaint. (Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.) One of the lawyers representing Trump in his battle with the Isaac Hayes estate over Trump’s use of “Hold On, I’m Coming” at campaign events said he was representing Trump for the White Stripes matter as well. “This office is handling the matter,” Trump lawyer Ronald Coleman with Dhillon Law Group said in a reply email sent Monday afternoon. “We have not had an opportunity to review the claims.” The presidential candidate is no stranger to public criticism from a long list of artists opposed to his use of their music. In a recent case similar to this one, Beyoncé threatened legal action after a Trump spokesperson used her song “Freedom” in a video showing Trump getting off a plane. While Beyoncé did give Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign permission to use the song, a source close to the musician told Rolling Stone they “absolutely did not give permission” to Trump’s campaign, and that Bey’s label had threatened to issue a cease and desist. Other musicians and estates who don’t want Trump using their music include Céline Dion, the Foo Fighters, Neil Young, ABBA, the Village People and Sinéad O’Connor’s estate. In their Monday lawsuit, the White Stripes said “Seven Nation Army” is “among the most well-known and influential musical works of all time.” They said Trump and his campaign sought to use the song to “burnish” his public image and “generate financial and other support for his campaign and candidacy on the backs of plaintiffs, whose permission and endorsement he neither sought nor obtained in violation of their rights under federal copyright law.” The duo went on to blast Trump for the alleged infringement considering he’s a “self-professed sophisticated and successful businessman with decades-long experience in the entertainment industry.” They said it was especially egregious after they “publicly denounced” his use of the same song during his 2016 campaign, adding they were “disgusted by that association.” “Plaintiffs vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by defendant Trump when he was president and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” the lawsuit reads. The complaint alleges the infringing videos attracted at least 65,000 views and 700 reposts in a matter of hours after first appearing on X. “Through discovery, plaintiffs will determine the amount of financial contributions that are attributable to the infringing Trump videos,” the lawsuit states.","summary":"“Plaintiffs vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by defendant Trump when he was president and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” the lawsuit reads","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/donald-trump-sued-jack-white-meg-white-the-white-stripes-1235098125/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/trump-jack-white.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 22:50:28","author":"Nancy Dillon","authors":["Nancy Dillon"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048}]}
