Television’s top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot. Asked for comment, the former president’s campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, “Fake news,” adding that there were discussions but nothing was ever locked in. “60 Minutes” said Trump’s campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump’s absence to viewers. Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker. There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted.. The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual “60 Minutes” time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday. Cheung said “60 Minutes” insisted upon doing live fact-checking for the interview, “which is unprecedented.” CBS had no immediate comment on his claim. Trump’s interview with “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session. CBS News was hosting Tuesday’s vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump declines to be interviewed for &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; election special first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-declines-to-be-interviewed-for-60-minutes-election-special/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1727829995_rewrite-this-title-Trump-won039t-participate-in-interview-for-03960.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 00:47:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.11},{"id":258138400,"title":"Trump Backs Out of 60 Minutes Special, Harris Will Go On as Planned","text":"Ex-president Donald Trump has pulled out of the 60 Minutes primetime election special that’s been an American staple for over half a century, but VP Kamala Harris’ interview will air as planned on Monday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. 60 Minutes shared: A Programming Note: 60 Minutes is scheduled to air a primetime election special on a Monday edition of the broadcast on October 7 at 8 PM. For over half a century, 60 Minutes has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls. This year, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to sit down with 60 Minutes. Vice President Harris will speak with correspondent Bill Whitaker. After initially accepting 60 Minutes’ request for an interview with Scott Pelley, former President Trump’s campaign has decided not to participate. Pelley will address this Monday evening. Our election special will broadcast the Harris interview on Monday as planned. Our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands. Trump doesn’t like 60 Minutes after Lesley Stahl asked him reasonable questions in 2020, causing him to storm off. Trump is very used to getting to say things that directly contradict what he said in the previous sentence, and rarely is it clarified or even noticed as problematic. The legacy media has been criticizing Harris for not doing interviews with them, while Trump does not get equivalent critiques, which is odd for a man who pulled out of the third debate and has now fled 60 Minutes. An interview with Lesley Stahl and Scott Peley of 60 Minutes is too formidable for Trump. What does that say about Trump’s treatment by the legacy press? It suggests they aren’t formidable, or else he would not go there with information. The media will continue to talk about Vice President Kamala Harris‘ avoidance of interviews, while leaving out that what they mean is interviews *with them*. Apparently, they don’t trust local journalists or 60 Minutes or Dana Bash from CNN to do a good interview. Vice President Kamala Harris will be featured by “60 Minutes” on October 7, and Trump will be hiding somewhere.","summary":"Ex-president Donald Trump has pulled out of the 60 Minutes primetime election special that’s been an American staple for over half a century, but VP Kamala Harris’ interview will air as planned on Monday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. 60 Minutes shared: A Programming Note: 60 Minutes is scheduled to air a primetime election &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump Backs Out of 60 Minutes Special, Harris Will Go On as Planned appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/trump-backs-out-of-60-minutes-special-harris-will-go-on-as-planned/","image":"https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-atlanta-trump-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 00:36:50","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":258138376,"title":"Flights Being Organised to Get Australians out of Lebanon","text":"The Federal government is working to get Australians out of Lebanon amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Labor ministers Penny Wong and Clare O'Neil have both indicated the government is working on securing flights out of Lebanon. In a post to X, Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said several Australians in Lebanon were put on commercial flights on Oct. 1 and Oct. 2. Wong said the government has secured extra seats for flights on Oct. 3 and is working to access more flights in the coming days. “Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is contacting registered Australians with updates. Australians in Lebanon who wish to leave should ensure they are registered via DFAT’s crisis portal,” she said. Housing Minister Clare O'Neil also revealed there are more than 15,000 Australians still in Lebanon on Oct. 2. “Clearly to those people in Lebanon, it is not a safe place for you to be. Please get on commercial flights if you have those openings available,” she said during an interview with Sunrise. The DFAT crisis portal enables Australians and their immediate families in Lebanon, Israel, and Gaza to register for assistance.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has provided full support for Israel in a statement responding to the escalating conflict. “As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,” she told reporters. “I’m clear-eyed, Iran is a destabilising, dangerous force in the Middle East and today’s attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact.”","summary":"Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said the government is working to access more flights in coming days.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/flights-being-organised-to-get-australians-out-of-lebanon-5733565","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/02/id5733629-GettyImages-2175085613-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 00:36:25","author":"Monica O’shea","authors":["Monica O’shea"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.003},{"id":258138350,"title":"A man from Texas claims he broke a Taylor Swift-signed guitar he won at an auction for $4,000 as a prank.","text":"There were more splinters than teardrops left on a Taylor Swift-autographed guitar after a Texas man smashed it apart as “a joke” — after he paid thousands for it at auction, the man said Tuesday. Gary Estes, 67, says he paid $4,000 for the instrument at the Ellis County Wild Game Dinner in Waxahachie, an annual charity event that benefits agricultural-based education efforts for local youths. When he went to get the guitar, Estes took a hammer to it in a moment captured on video that has gone viral — but he insisted he has no will against Swift. “There was nothing malicious or anything about it,” Estes told NBC News on Tuesday. “It was just a joke at an auction that we had to raise money for kids, right? And that’s all it was. There was nothing mean about it, nothing bad about it. It was just a joke that they were making up on the stage, and we just followed through with a joke.” Auctioneer Craig Meier, a spokesperson for the event, said the guitar-smashing played well in the room.”It was a funny, light-hearted thing. I know maybe it seemed to be malicious, but everybody was laughing,” Meier said. “There were people there, at the time, who joked around that he’s mad because he doesn’t know how to play the guitar.” But after having talked to the man, Meier said it was an obvious political statement. “Taylor Swift, it became a political thing, and that was kind of the gist of it, just a light-hearted bit of a dig at Taylor for coming out politically and entertainers using their influence to influence politics,” Meier said. Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 11, leading to bad blood with GOP nominee Donald Trump who sees her as an anti-hero. Trump carried Ellis County with 66.19% of the vote of the vote in 2020, while the winner, Joe Biden, and his VP pick, Harris, got 32.17%. Estes, who owns an electrical wiring business, said he’s a supporter of Trump and wasn’t pleased with Swift’s endorsement of Harris. “Yes, you can connect the dots there,” Estes said. The dinner and auction made about $250,000, Meier said. Auctioned items included weapons, big game hunting experiences, food and the “hot mama package” — a day of pampering at a day spa and a Smith & Wesson .380 that went for more than $4,000. Swift never owned or played the smashed guitar. Swift, like many other celebrities, regularly signs items that are distributed to charitable causes, said Meier, who procured the guitar in the summer. “At the end of the day, thank you, Taylor Swift,” Meier said. “Whether he hung your guitar on the wall or whether he hit it with a hammer, it really doesn’t make any difference. In the end of the day, the kids are the ones that are going to benefit from it. I don’t care if he set it on fire, put it in a shrine in his house, he paid $4,000 for it.” Representatives for Swift and the political group “Swifties for Kamala” — a grassroots organization not officially affiliated with her — could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. Swift is on a brief hiatus from her record-breaking Eras Tour, which is scheduled to end in December. The final show, as of now, is set for Dec. 8 at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThere were more splinters than teardrops left on a Taylor Swift-autographed guitar&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A man from Texas claims he broke a Taylor Swift-signed guitar he won at an auction for $4,000 as a prank. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/a-man-from-texas-claims-he-broke-a-taylor-swift-signed-guitar-he-won-at-an-auction-for-4000-as-a-prank/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2023-07/230711-taylor-swift-al-1039-c64f78.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 00:31:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":258139190,"title":"Iran Says It Has Finished Attack On Israel Amid Fears Of Spreading Conflict","text":"an said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was finished barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran's escalation as fears of a wider war intensified.Washington said it would work with longtime ally Israel to make sure Iran faced \"severe consequences\" for Tuesday's attack.The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.\"Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation.

It is expected to be the final debate for both the presidential and vice presidential candidates ahead of the Nov. 5 election. “I think it’s going to be an uphill battle for Tim Walz, frankly, because he is facing a tougher political landscape,” Bedford said. “The risk for him is that he reinforces this perception that he and Kamala Harris don’t stand for anything, that they don’t have any concrete beliefs, that they’ve shifted all of them for political expediency. And the fact that his personal biography has been riddled with misstatements really also reinforces that perception that they’re sort of a shape-shifting ticket on the Democratic side.” Bedford added that Vance’s risk is that he would come off as too aggressive when making his arguments throughout the debate. “Certainly, I think Walz has the toughest challenge,” Bedford said.","summary":"Washington Examiner investigations editor Sarah Bedford suggested that Sen.

The Saturday Night Live alum, who returned to the show for the season 50 premiere on Saturday to play the president in a cold open, discussed his preparation for the part on his podcast Superfly. \"It's been top secret,\" Carvey said. \"I've kept it under wraps for weeks.\" Carvey said that the SNL producer Lorne Michaels asked him to play Biden after the Wayne's World star began cultivating an impression of the president on his other podcast Fly on the Wall. \"Like with George Bush senior, 'Not gonna do it,'\" Carvey said, recalling his impression of the 41st president from the '80s and early '90s. \"I tried to do that treatment to Biden,' and I did it on here with our YouTube clips,\" Carvey noted. Carvey's Biden took the stage in Studio 8H alongside Maya Rudolph's Kamala Harris, Jim Gaffigan's Tim Walz, Andy Samberg's Doug Emhoff, James Austin Johnson's Donald Trump, and Bowen Yang's J.D. Vance. The Master of Disguise star noted that he sought to fill a perceived void of Biden impressions. \"I didn't see it out there enough, a Biden impression,\" he said. \"A lot of brilliant Trumps, Shane [Gillis], James Austin Johnson. Biden is trickier.\" The current president has been played by a wide array of SNL cast members and guest stars, but the show has struggled to solidify one performer to play him consistently. Kevin Nealon first depicted then-Senator Biden in 1991, and Jason Sudeikis played him when he served as vice president during the Obama administration. Woody Harrelson, John Mulaney, and Sudeikis later played Biden throughout the Democratic primary prior to the 2020 presidential election, and Jim Carrey portrayed him once he secured the nomination. Cast members Mikey Day and Alex Moffat also portrayed Biden, and upon joining SNL in 2021, James Austin Johnson became the de facto Biden impersonator on the show. Casting Johnson as Biden presents a problem, however, when sketches also include Donald Trump, who he also regularly impersonates. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Carvey said he wants to prioritize \"getting that high-energy part\" of Biden. \"That didn't come out til maybe 6 months into his first term where they asked him some question, he got kinda mad,\" he explained. \"'I can do whatever you want!' You know? That rhythm.\" Carvey also explained that he prioritizes comedy over political statements. \"The true north star is to try to make it funny and not really get it to be a political message, per se,\" he said. \"I didn't write it down or, you know, sharpen my pencil that he would say, 'I can't believe it's not butter!' with declarative intent,\" Carvey continued, referring to the unexpected conclusion of an incoherent stammering marathon that his Biden embarked on after attempting to say \"Build back better.\" The comedian said there were several phrases in the mix for the \"Build back better\" bit — including one from Carvey's podcast cohost David Spade. \"It was 'Pirates of the Caribbean,'\" he recalled. \"Then it was he would say, 'I can't believe it's not butter,' and then you gave me one, 'Bed, bath, and beyond!' which is a good one, too, because beyond is good with Biden,\" he told Spade. Carvey performed in SNL's cast from 1986 to 1993, and has returned to the show four times as a host (and even more times as a surprise guest). SNL will return Saturday, Oct. 2 with host stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze and musical guest Coldplay.","summary":"&#34;I&#39;ve kept it under wraps for weeks.&#34;","url":"https://ew.com/dana-carvey-discusses-his-surprise-snl-joe-biden-impression-8721678","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/AQyoqgjrHHPZzQpQIBT-1pRcfTc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MayaRudolphandDanaCarveyonSNLseason50premiere-60453b0e06424d159c6cef37e159cd70.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/m5Id2QAJ-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-02 00:16:32","author":"Wesley Stenzel","authors":["Wesley Stenzel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.377},{"id":258138060,"title":"Trump boosts bid after Helene","text":"Donald Trump is using the destruction of Hurricane Helene to boost his presidential bid against Kamala Harris, political analysts said on Tuesday, after the Republican candidate spread falsehoods about the federal response during a visit to a storm-hit city. Trump is leveraging the potential political danger of the hurricane to the presidential campaign of Democrat Harris, his 2024 White House rival, the analysts said. Trump visited the city of Valdosta in the battleground state of Georgia on Monday and falsely stated that Democratic President Joe Biden had been unresponsive to the hurricane’s destruction. Harris is also Biden’s vice president. Trump said he brought “truckloads of things” to Georgia, including oil, water and equipment, and that he partnered with evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham’s relief organization to deliver them. Natural disasters have damaged U.S. administrations in the past and Trump is trying to tie Harris to this hurricane, which tore through the U.S. Southeast including the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina, said Andrew Reeves, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied how natural disasters affect U.S. politics. Georgia and North Carolina will play a key role in the outcome of the Nov. 5 election between Trump and Harris. North Carolina’s hardest-hit area, Buncombe County, voted for Biden in 2020, while most of the other counties in the western part of the state went to Trump. Georgia’s Lowndes County, where Valdosta is located, voted for Trump in 2020. But even a few thousand votes in each state could decide which presidential candidate wins those states and potentially determine the outcome of the White House race. More than 3,500 federal workers are involved with response efforts in affected states, according to the White House. Analysts said it was abnormal for a presidential candidate who is not in office to visit a disaster area. Natural disasters, especially hurricanes, have shaped U.S. politics in recent years and could alter the course of the race this year as well, said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. It is not the first time Trump has sought to use a disaster for political gain. While visiting the site of a toxic train derailment in Ohio in 2023, Trump criticized the Biden administration’s response as a “betrayal.” Presidents and presidential candidates usually do not visit a storm-hit region immediately because of fears they will distract from rescue efforts and drain resources from local law enforcement officials and emergency responders. Biden said he would visit North Carolina on Wednesday and Georgia and Florida soon after. He may also ask Congress to return to Washington for a special session to pass supplemental aid funding. Harris has also said she intends to visit the area soon. Leavitt declined to say how the funds will be spent. In 2019 a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million for misusing his namesake charitable foundation, resulting in funds being used to advance his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump defended the charity at the time, saying the foundation was an “incredibly effective philanthropy” that had made “some small technical violations.” The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. In Georgia, Trump falsely claimed that Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, “was having a hard time” getting Biden on the phone. Kemp told reporters that Biden had called him the evening before and said he was grateful for the federal assistance Biden had offered. Biden said Trump had been lying. Reeves’ research has found that sitting presidents received a modest bump of half a percentage point when they approved disaster aid close to their reelection. During Trump’s 2017 visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Maria, the then-president threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents impacted by the storm. The move drew criticism from some local officials. While campaigning for reelection in 2012, President Barack Obama joined Republican Governor Chris Christie to tour parts of New Jersey that were affected by superstorm Sandy. Christie was at the time a top defender of Obama’s Republican rival, Mitt Romney. Republican President George W. Bush’s approval ratings fell after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 and never recovered.","summary":"Donald Trump is using the destruction of Hurricane Helene to boost his presidential bid against Kamala Harris, political analysts said on Tuesday, after the Republican candidate spread falsehoods about the federal response during a visit to a storm-hit city.

Not surprisingly, the reception has a fund-raising component to it, with the US Presidential election, which remains too close to call between Democratic candidate and US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Trump, coming up next month. “The event is expected to raise over $5 million. There is a lot of support and contributions, for the event, from Americans; with only a few big Indian American donors including Swapnil Agarwal, CEO & managing partner Nitya Capital, Houston,” Agarwal, who had earlier hosted a fund-raiser for Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, told the Times of India.“There is a lot of support for Republican Party within the Indian American community, especially among business owners and CEOs, of both small and large businesses. The establishment dislikes Trump and Trump voters dislike the establishment. Hence ‘support for Trump’ is tough ball game. Like mainstream American community, there are some conservatives within the Indian American community who are Trump’s staunch supporters, while other traditional conservatives do not like him at all. However, all agree that the Republicans are needed to win and govern the country now,” Agarwal said about his support for the Republican Presidential nominee.He feels that the upcoming US Presidential election is not about choosing the most likable person but about choosing between two vastly different ideologies and policy framework including US foreign policy in the current decade of conflicts. “Trump, during his past presidential tenure between 2016 and 2020, has proven that his administration can deliver on immigration, foreign policy, world peace, law and order, and domestic economy in an effective manner. There was no major conflict during the Trump administration, and America was on a path to prosperity until the pandemic hit in 2020,” Agarwal said. He added that the current situation, under the Biden/Harris administration, since 2020 in USA has been marked by chaos during withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, handling of Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas conflict, high inflation, huge influx of illegal immigrants in US and bumps in US-India relations. “A weak foreign policy has emboldened America’s foes. Switching Biden for another progressive candidate, Kamala Harris, is not going to solve the problem. I always support capitalism and have almost no appreciation for the policies of liberals leaning towards the extreme Left, especially profligate spending that has produced the highest inflation in 40 years. Given the choice of the two Presidential candidates this year, we need to think about the country we want to leave to our next generations, before voting,” he said.Having worked closely with the campaign of Indian American Republican Presidential candidate and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, before she dropped out of the race, Agarwal feels that her campaign did not resonate among the Indian community in the US. “I do not think that Haley dropping out has had any impact. It was not easy to gather support for her from the Indian American community as many did not consider her a visionary leader and a strong contender against Trump. She offered a good conservative alternative in my opinion, but there was nothing new she had to offer. People perceived her as an establishment candidate and perception plays an important role in politics. If she had been picked by Trump as a VP candidate, a much wider support for the Trump ticket, from the Indian American community, was likely,” he said.Though Agarwal has hosted an event in support of the Republican vice-presidential candidate, he has not interacted with Vance’s Indian American wife Usha Chilukuri Vance and feels that she is not actively involved in her husband’s campaign. “Vance spoke very highly about her during my personal interaction with him. He owes his success to his wife and appreciates the values Usha [Vance] represents having grown up in a Hindu household. J.D. Vance is highly impressed by Hinduism. He had a separate Hindu ceremony officiated by a Hindu priest, honouring his wife’s cultural heritage at his wedding. He talked about the shared principles that guide their family life despite their diverse religious backgrounds,” Agarwal said.","summary":"Jiten Agarwal, CEO of QuantAi, is hosting a significant reception for Donald Trump in Houston, aiming to raise over $5 million.

JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz put their Middle America appeal to the test Tuesday night in what’s likely the final debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. With barely a month to go until the Nov. 5 election, the candidates are out to show they’re fit to be a heartbeat away from the presidency — and to boost their respective running mates at the top of the ticket, GOP former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The debate, which begins airing at 8 p.m. on CBS, comes hours after Iran launched missile attacks on Israel as tensions rise across the Middle East. That crisis is sure to provide debate fodder along with the vice presidential candidates’ respective military records. Vance, the best-selling author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” served in the U.S. Marine Corps, while Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, served in the Army National Guard. Vance has attacked Walz over a 2018 campaign video in which the Minnesota governor referenced “weapons of war that I carried into war.” Neither man saw combat. CBS moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan are also likely to quiz the candidates on the war in Ukraine, a U.S. economy still reeling from inflation and the immigration crisis at the southern border — as well as Vance’s insistent false claims that Haitian immigrants have eaten pets in Springfield, Ohio. Most political prognosticators say vice presidential debates rarely impact election outcomes, but that could change in a year where most polls have put Trump and Harris in a statistical dead heat. Harris and Trump debated last month and haven’t agreed on a second on-stage matchup. Vance and Walz aren’t scheduled to square off again before the election either.

Alongside its operations in Gaza, Israel has escalated its military efforts in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah militants backed by Tehran. The campaign has killed hundreds and displaced more than a million people, according to local reports.This regional tension was sparked by a devastating October 7 attack carried out by Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza, which led to Israel’s ongoing military offensive.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government. “The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,” Johnson said. The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda. Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days. But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he’s meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he’s met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn’t lose their homes. “Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can’t afford to do it much longer,” Johnson said. The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a “strong” child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would “respect the dignity of work, and it doesn’t pay people more for staying out of the workforce.” Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law. Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and “Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.” Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying “we’re going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.” “It’s hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It’s a difficult task, but it’s a task that can be achieved,” Johnson said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Speaker Johnson outlines plan for Republicans as they strive to maintain control of the House. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/speaker-johnson-outlines-plan-for-republicans-as-they-strive-to-maintain-control-of-the-house/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Speaker-Johnson-lays-out-agenda-for-Republicans.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:50:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":258136578,"title":"Skirting court’s race-quota ban, NY’s deceptive ‘abortion’ law and other commentary","text":"Higher ed: Skirting Court’s Race-Quota Ban The Supreme Court ban on “race-based affirmative action was expected to change elite universities’ demographics substantially,” yet “several top universities, including Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Penn, and Duke, have seen little to none of the expected shift in the racial composition,” reports Matthew Liley at City Journal. Universities “are either breaking the law,” or they misled the Supreme Court when “they declared race-neutral methods insufficient to achieve their diversity goals.” One way they may have maintained their racial demographics is via “diversity targets” — i.e., “awarding applicants bonus points based on socioeconomic factors.” Another, more sinister, possible reason: “Their admissions officers are ignoring the ruling” and still considering race by pushing “race-neutral admissions policies that are neutral in name only.” From the right: NY’s Deceptive ‘Abortion’ Law “New York state Democrats are using the political salience of abortion” to push woke madness, argues James Lynch at National Review. Proposal 1 — also known as the New York Equal Rights Amendment — would implement a “sweeping expansion of the state constitution’s equal-protection clause” via “vague and all-encompassing language” around race, national origin and gender. It “would allow progressive groups to pursue litigation to erode parental rights, permitting confused children to receive puberty blockers without parental consent and enabling males to play sports against women and girls.” It would also “defang efforts to enforce immigration law and could even be used to help illegal immigrants gain access to welfare benefits.” In other words, it would “codify the most extreme elements” of left-wing ideology into the state Constitution.

Take Gilad Kariv, who “founded the Knesset caucus for Renewing the Negotiations and Promoting the Two-State Solution.” He insists “the murderous events of Oct. 7 haven’t shaken his ‘long-term commitment’ to a two-state solution,” yet he “says his goal of a sovereign Palestinian entity should be understood as ‘the end state’ of a long and exacting political and security process.” In the long run, a two-state solution is “a necessary solution if we want to keep Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.” But “the elimination of [Hezbollah’s Hassan] Nasrallah” is “a necessary first step toward a future solution.” Media watch: ‘Biased’ Debate Hosts — Again The two moderators who were chosen for Tuesday’s debate between GOP veep pick J.D. Vance and the Dems’ Tim Walz have long been “heavily biased CBS broadcasters,” fumes The Washington Examiner’s Paul Bedard. “According to the latest study of media bias by Media Research Center’s watchdog outlet, ‘NewsBusters,’ 85% of CBS coverage has been pro-Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris, while 81%” has been critical of Vance and former President Donald Trump. Specifically, moderators — managing editor Norah O’Donnell and Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan — have a “long anti-Trump record,” the study, by Rich Noyes, found. “In a similar survey before the Trump-Harris debate, Noyes found that host ABC was biased in favor of Harris, and the post-debate criticism of the moderators proved that.” Libertarian: Subsidizing Hurricane Risk-Takers While FEMA is “helping survivors in flood-stricken regions,” its National Flood Insurance Program is “perversely” incentivizing Americans “to reside in these high-risk areas,” laments Reason’s Jack Nicastro. Without NFIP-subsidized insurance, rates would increase, becoming unaffordable for some homeowners. Yet, “unaffordability is a feature of insurance markets, not a bug. High insurance rates discourage risky behavior,” like living in flood zones. By contrast, “artificially lowering insurance rates deprives homeowners of the very information that indicates the risk of such devastation.” The solution: “Stop subsidizing NFIP and allow its more than 50 partnered insurance companies to set rates that fully reflect the risk of extreme weather events like Hurricane Helene.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Universities “are either breaking the law,” or they misled the Supreme Court when “they declared race-neutral methods insufficient to achieve their diversity goals.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/opinion/skirting-courts-race-quota-ban-nys-deceptive-abortion-law-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/2023-cambridge-massachusetts-u-s-89393946-e1727826529578.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:50:00","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.257},{"id":258136550,"title":"Biden reaffirms support for Israel after Iran attack","text":"Biden reaffirms support for Israel after Iran attack From the White House situation room, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris monitored Iran's attack on Israel with their national security team.

Walz, 60, a liberal governor and former high school teacher, and Vance, 40, a bestselling author and conservative firebrand senator, will portray themselves as sons of America’s Midwestern heartland but polar opposites on the issues gripping the U.S. Walz has called his Republican opponents “weird,” and Vance came under fire for past comments disparaging some Democrats as “childless cat ladies.” Aides to the two men expect fireworks during the 90-minute debate at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York as they defend themselves and speak up for the candidates at the top of each ticket, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump. Harris and Trump are expected to watch the televised debate, which begins at 9 p.m. (3 p.m. Hawaii time), and Trump said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media. Harris was widely viewed as the winner of her sole debate with Trump on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia, which was watched by an estimated 67 million people. That square-off did little to change the trajectory of an extremely close election battle. While Harris has edged ahead in national polls of the electorate, most surveys show voters remain fairly evenly divided in the seven states that will decide the November election. Political analysts say vice presidential debates can be fiery but generally do not alter the outcome of an election. The main takeaway from the last V.P. debate, the 2020 encounter between then-Senator Harris and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was a fly that landed on Pence’s head unbeknownst to Pence himself. “I can’t think of any of them that seemed to have made a real difference in the election,” said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz of Vanderbilt University. With no more debates planned, however, the stand-off will allow Walz and Vance to make closing arguments on behalf of their campaigns – just as early voting ramps up across the country. MUD-SLINGING Each will fling mud. Walz, who has sought to cultivate a homespun image as a former high school football coach, is expected to get Vance to defend his 2021 comments criticizing Harris and other Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” Walz is also likely to go after Vance for spreading a fictional story of Haitian immigrants eating household pets in Springfield, Ohio, a false claim that Trump has repeated and that local officials say has drawn bomb threats. The Democrat will seek to introduce himself to U.S. voters who may not be familiar with him, while aiming to keep the conversation focused on Harris’ agenda, said a Walz adviser who asked to remain anonymous to discuss strategy. Trump advisers said Vance can be expected to try to force Walz to defend the Biden-Harris administration’s policies on immigration and the economy, as well his own handling of the riots in Minneapolis in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white policeman. Vance will also bring up questions about Walz’s military service, said Tom Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who joined a Trump campaign call about the debate. Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his final rank in the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. Walz has in the past described himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest non-commissioned officer positions in the Army. While he achieved that rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title. The Harris campaign says also Walz “misspoke” in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota when he referred to “weapons of war, that I carried in war.” Walz was never deployed to a war zone. Vance is a former Marine who served as a military journalist. He was deployed to Iraq but never saw combat. Walz has been preparing for the debate with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has stood in for Vance. Buttigieg, a Midwesterner like Vance, has worn a red tie to mimic the Ohio senator’s attire. “It’s about the governor being the governor and staying true to who he is, not turning him into a slick debater like Vance,” the adviser said of the debate prep. Vance tapped Tom Emmer, a U.S. congressman from Minnesota, to stand in for Walz during mock debates, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Despite Vance’s having written “Hillbilly Elegy,” a popular 2016 memoir, U.S. voters have a negative view of him, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with 51% of registered voters saying they view him unfavorably, compared with 39% who view him favorably. That’s a contrast with Walz, who 44% of registered voters view favorably, with 43% reporting an unfavorable view in the Sept. 20-23 poll.","summary":"Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance, U.S. politicians whose histories and rhetoric have amassed more headlines than many past No. 2 candidates, will go head to head today at the only vice presidential debate before the Nov. 5 election.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/01/breaking-news/walz-vance-to-spar-in-vice-presidential-debate/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241001_brk_deb01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:45:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.148},{"id":258136462,"title":"I was traveling with Kamala Harris as the Iran-Israel news broke. This is what happened next","text":"It seems whenever I sign up for pool duty with Vice President Kamala Harris, chaos reigns in the Middle East — and today was no different. Back in May, I traveled aboard Air Force Two with the vice president to Detroit when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to invade Rafah. That same day, Hamas said it would agree to a ceasefire with Israel, but that quickly got binned. After waiting for ages in a van outside The Wright Museum in Detroit, Harris finally gave us a brief statement. For those not in the White House Press Corps, pool reporters are the designated journalists who agree to take a day off from their regular duties to follow around either the president, vice president or their spouses and send reports to the press corp, since we cannot all be around the principal constantly. It’s simultaneously dull work, comprising mostly sitting and waiting for the person you are following, and then transcribing whatever they say and emailing it to everyone — and occasionally exhilarating. Most importantly, it’s a way to be a good neighbor to our fellow reporters. I already knew Tuesday was going to be busy. It’s election season — the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz would be on Tuesday evening and I would be going over to Virginia to cover a debate watch party. Last night, I covered Montana’s Senate debate. Nonetheless, when I received a notification request to cover the vice president on Monday evening, I signed up, figuring it might be fun. Almost immediately, I regretted my decision. As I arrived at the White House gates, my credential didn’t work — because, as I learned, it had just expired — which meant I had to get a provisional pass and then scurry in the pouring rain to get into the van. Turns out that we didn’t need to rush, the vice president wasn’t going anywhere. Iran had launched a barrage of rockets into Israel, killing at least six people. Harris was in the situation room with President Joe Biden. Of course, us poolers (there’s ones for photo, video and print) were in the dark about this, sitting in the black van that usually follows the black SUV carrying the vice president. The photographers took out their cameras to snap people filing in and out of the West Wing since we were parked outside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most administration employees work. At one point, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg walked into the West Wing, likely to discuss the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and the destruction left in its wake in the Atlantic seaboard. Meanwhile, I got briefed that Harris would make her way to North Carolina and Georgia to survey the damage. Former president Donald Trump was raging on Truth Social about how the planet was on the brink of a third world war. All the while, we sat. And waited. Finally, the vice president stepped out of the West Wing and we were off. Soon, we arrived at the Josephine Butler Parks Center, a historic building also used for weddings, where she would was conducting an interview. The White House did not disclose with whom. Times like this make me feel almost useless since I had no scintillating details to give my colleagues, despite it being a crisis-fueled day for the vice president. Finally, Harris elected to give us a two-minute statement. “I condemn this attack unequivocally. I'm clear eyed, Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East, and today's attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact,” she said, confirming she was in the Situation Room with Biden and supported Biden’s decision to shoot down Iranian rockets. “ As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran backed terrorist militias,” she said. “My commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering.” All the while, I could not help but be reminded of how during Harris’ Democratic National Convention speech just after she got confirmed as the nominee, Harris said how she would “ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” That comment caused her to receive some flack from the left flank in her party, alongside the fact that she has done little to differentiate herself from Biden’s unequivocal support for Israel. Previously the debate between Walz and Vance was seen as today’s main event, but after the Iranian attacks it’s likely to be treated as an afterthought. Nearly three hours after Harris spoke to us, the whole time spent sitting in the van waiting, we got word that our duty had finished. The vice president was off on Navy One, and I was back into the rain, ready to see who would succeed her.","summary":"Political reporter Eric Garcia gives an inside view of the unsexy work of being on pool duty during an action-filled day","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-israel-iran-news-live-b2622277.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/00/MixCollage-01-Oct-2024-07-39-PM-5551.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:43:31","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.016},{"id":258136120,"title":"Adams is just the latest pol caught at the trough in the United States of Global Graft","text":"Mayor Adams’ corruption indictment involving the government of Turkey seems like weak tea compared to other recent scandals. But it also indicates just how intertwined America’s ruling class has become with foreign governments — and foreign money. Adams is charged with getting over $120,000 in business-class international air travel and other perks from Turkey, while accepting campaign donations from illegal foreign sources — and getting public matching funds on that basis. Prosecutors allege he used his authority to perform various favors for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s regime in return. (Adams asserts, plausibly, that the prosecution is payback for his criticism of Biden-Harris immigration policies — though that doesn’t mean he’s not guilty — and that the Turkish goodies were merely “gratuities.”) But Adams isn’t even the tip of the iceberg: He’s more like one of the little frozen chunks floating around it. Because in truth, American politics, all the way to the top, is riddled with corruption and foreign cash on a scale that dwarfs Hizzoner’s alleged misdeeds. Across the Hudson, the trial of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) revealed an extravaganza of gold bars and envelopes full of cash (along with a Mercedes and, weirdly, basement carpeting) in exchange for favors. This was after a previous jury deadlocked on an earlier set of charges against Menendez involving gifts and trips to the Dominican Republic. Menendez resigned from the Senate after being convicted of federal bribery charges for acting as an agent of the Egyptian government. Hunter Biden’s ties with the Ukrainian firm Burisma and a number of Chinese companies are well-known — as are the allegations that Joe Biden was a direct beneficiary. An analysis of Hunter’s laptop and other documents revealed he raked in at least $11 million from those and other shady overseas sources between 2013 and 2018. Just this week, we learned that whistleblowers from within the Department of Homeland Security have raised serious concerns about Kamala’s running mate Tim Walz’s numerous visits to China while a member of the US military, and his expressed admiration for China’s communist system. You can’t make this stuff up, and sadly you don’t have to. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office has over the last four years brought a dozen cases involving covert Chinese influence in American government and institutions. A secret Chinese police station even operated for a while out of a building in Manhattan. Linda Sun, a former aide to Gov. Hochul (D-NY), has been charged with serving as a Chinese government agent, pushing PRC policies in Albany and working against Taiwanese officials in exchange for large sums of money and periodic deliveries of salted duck. (Hey, it’s a delicacy). She allegedly prevented New York state from denouncing the Chinese genocide of the Uyghurs. China’s approach has been called “geostrategic corruption,” which it uses around the globe, not just in the United States. But it certainly does use it quite extensively here. And other countries are apparently following China’s lead: Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) has been charged with taking money from a Mexican bank and a state-owned Azerbaijani oil company to push favorable policies in Congress. It seems you can’t turn over a rock at just about any level of our government without finding some kind of foreign influence at play — it’s “just the way business is done” nowadays. But why is that? Perhaps it’s that the world is so much more interconnected: Fifty years ago, China had few links to the United States. A Clinton-era initiative made it a major trading partner, opening up many more avenues for interaction — and graft. At the same time, American politics became more open to influence. Party organizations have weakened, the end of the Cold War eased interactions with historical adversaries, and big money took an increasing role in politics, and in American social hierarchies generally. A partisan press has soft-pedaled scandals among favored politicians — see its handling of the Biden family’s questionable business dealings. And complaints about money from overseas can easily be deflected with bogus claims that the charges are racist or based on cultural stereotypes. (Recall how such accusations stifled the — accurate — suspicions that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab.) But while the normalization of payola may be lucrative for our ruling class, it’s a major vulnerability for the rest of us. A more interconnected world is also a world in which more potential adversaries will try to take advantage. Israel decimated Hezbollah by transforming its trusted devices, like pagers and walkie-talkies, into instruments of doom. Foreign money may be doing the same thing to the United States, turning trusted politicians and institutions against our best interests. It needs to be stopped.

Earlier on Tuesday, Carter’s grandson, Jason, told CBS News that the 39th president is excited to vote for fellow Democrats, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, in the upcoming election, but noted that his advanced age and health conditions have left him struggling to complete some tasks, like talking on the phone. “He’s very limited in what he can do,” Jason told CBS. “He can’t talk on the phone.” Jason said that despite his limitations, the former president continues to keep up with the news. He said his grandfather was looking forward to his 100th birthday, but was more excited to vote for Harris in November. “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” Carter reportedly earlier told his son, Chip, according to the Associated Press.

Tim Walz for his links to China. The “Tiananmen Tim” website — created by Make America Great Again Inc. and shared exclusively with The Post — blasts the Democratic No. 2 for “putting China first [and] America last” as well as lying about being in Hong Kong while the Chinese Communist Party was brutally putting down pro-democracy protests at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. Walz claimed at least three times between 2009 and 2019 that he was in East Asia at the height of the tumult, but two reports by a local paper in his home state of Nebraska place the future governor in the Cornhusker State until August of that year. Walz is the subject of a congressional investigation over his relationships with China and has profusely supported the Communist country in the past. The website notes that Walz has said he has visited China more than 30 times and even went on his honeymoon around the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Walz’s China ties may come up in the debate against GOP rival Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), as Trump adviser Jason Miller posted about the Tiananmen Square revelation on X. “Tiananmen Tim! Funny they’re changing this now – we were planning on calling him out for this at the debate tomorrow night! Anything else you want to fess up to, Tim???” Miller wrote. The debate will be the first time Vance and Walz spar with each other face-to-face and will be the last time candidates on the 2024 tickets will debate before the Nov. 5 election. Both Trump and Harris have vowed to be tough on China if they take office as the US fights to retain its trade dominance. The MAGA Inc. site also notes that Walz has previously said he doesn’t necessarily support having an “adversarial relationship” with China and that he “recognizes that some in the Chinese Government advocate for a greater rule of law.” The Minnesota governor worked in China teaching English during his younger years and later set up a travel company called “Educational Travel Adventures,” that helped American students travel there. “It will be total malpractice if Tiananmen Tim’s China First, America Last record isn’t brought up during tonight’s debate. The most radical presidential ticket in US history is bought and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party,” MAGA Inc. spokesperson Kaelan Dorr told The Post. “The fact that Tim Walz’ questionable ties to the CCP aren’t disqualifying in Kamala’s eyes is indicative of the same poor judgement that has opened our borders, tanked our economy, and created chaos and destruction across our country.”","summary":"A super PAC supporting former President Donald Trump launched a website Tuesday trolling Minnesota Gov.

Join our columnists","text":"JD Vance and Tim Walz meet Tuesday night in the first and only vice presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. Historically, the face-off between running mates hasn’t mattered in terms of the outcome in November. Nevertheless, vice presidential debates have yielded some of the most memorable political moments in recent history. For many, the evening will serve as an introduction to Ohio Sen. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Walz. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, roughly a quarter of those polled said they had never heard of the two men. Los Angeles Times columnists Lorraine Ali, Mark Z. Barabak, Anita Chabria and Doyle McManus will be watching the debate live, discussing the highlights and lowlights as they happen. How to watch the debate| Debate moderators| What to know 5:45 p.m.: Can JD Vance feign normalcy for 90 minutes? What will it take for Tim Walz to appear more folksy than he already does? Coveralls? A wrench in one hand, and a Farmer’s Almanac in the other? So many deep questions heading into tonight’s debate between the senator from Ohio and the Minnesota governor. The name of the game is appealing to working-class voters in the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin (the rest of us are superfluous), but what that looks like depends on the candidate. Is it about demonizing immigrants or big business? Lamenting abortion bans or the high price of eggs and milk? Breaking news also presents challenges. Who will dare to go near the expanding war in the Middle East, where Israel just launched a ground invasion into Lebanon and Iran launched missiles toward Israel? Gaza has been a hot potato on the campaign trail, and this is a conflict that the winning party will inherit. And remember, this is a VP debate so the potential is high for it to be about as exciting as watching your dog sleep. Consider memorable outtakes of past VP debates: Former Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan nervously drinking copious amounts of water during his debate with VP incumbent Joe Biden in 2012 (see the \"SNL\" sketch), or the fly that lodged itself in former Vice President Mike Pence’s hair as he sparred with Harris in 2020 (see the \"SNL\" sketch). But with an incredibly tight election on the horizon, this could be the rare VP debate that makes an impact — or lends itself to another great \"SNL\" sketch. —Lorraine Ali 5:30 p.m.: In the battle of Midwestern dads, I think we’ll see each one try to steal a little mojo from the other. JD Vance will try to come across as amiable and reasonable (a ginormous stretch after his Springfield rants) while Tim Walz will try to go tougher and throw some not-so-pleasant-guy punches against Vance, and Donald Trump. How that switch lands with viewers will determine the winner. Do we like a bully who can play nice, or a nice guy who can take on a bully? I’ll let you figure out who is who. Along with the usual topics — immigration, abortion and the economy — current events, including Tuesday’s attack on Israel by Iran and the federal response to the devastation of Hurricane Helene, will likely pop up. But enough guessing, here we go. —Anita Chabria 5:20: p.m.: The most important thing to remember about a vice presidential debate is that the two candidates onstage aren’t really running against each other. They’re just surrogates (OK, super-surrogates). Their main job is to represent the candidates at the top of the tickets. That’s why Lloyd Bentsen’s “Jack Kennedy” line, while brilliant, didn’t affect the election of 1988. It’s why campaign insiders consider Joe Biden’s solid 2012 performance against Paul Ryan a model to emulate, even though it didn’t feature any memorable quips. Biden made a better case for his boss, then-President Barack Obama, than Obama had made in his lackluster first debate against Mitt Romney So Tim Walz’s main mission is to make the most effective case he can for a Harris presidency, and remind voters of everything they dislike about Donald Trump. JD Vance’s mission is to make the case for a Trump presidency and reinforce undecided voters’ doubts about Harris. I’d expect Vance to spend most of his time talking up Trump’s first-term economy and attacking both Harris and Vance as “dangerously liberal.” Polls suggest those have been the Trump campaign’s most effective messages to the few remaining undecided voters. And I’d expect Walz to deliver a folksy explanation of Harris’ economic plan and a middle-class attack on Trump’s economic proposals (tax cuts for corporations, high tariffs that would push prices up). Wild Card: Will Walz remind voters that Trump is 78 years old (in contrast to Harris’ youthful-by-current-standards 59), making it more possible that Vance, with his weird views on childless cat ladies, could end up in the Oval Office? —Doyle McManus 5:10 p.m.: Allow me to kick things off with some thoughts on what I'll be watching for, then you all can chime in. As noted, it’s virtually certain that nothing said or done at CBS News headquarters in New York will matter a whole lot once the studio lights fade. Recall, from 1988, Dan Quayle and the infamous “You’re no Jack Kennedy” rejoinder, which Democrat Lloyd Bentsen leveled after the youthful Quayle compared himself to the youthful president. The gibe blew Quayle off the debate stage; then, just a few weeks later, Republicans won the White House in a landslide. That said, it could be an interesting and, dare I say, entertaining evening — depending on your tastes in entertainment. Tim Walz and JD Vance share a Midwestern pedigree and that’s pretty much it. Walz is all avuncular, with his can-I-help-shovel-your-walk approachability and good cheer. His attacks — “They’re weird!” — tend to singe, not burn. Will he take a more aggressive tack tonight? Vance has certainly given him plenty to work with, whether it’s his denigrating remarks about “childless cat ladies” or the phony horror stories he’s conjured about supposedly pet-eating Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. Vance, who’s approached his understudy role with fists up and teeth bared, seems to have the tougher challenge of the two, making himself appear more likable while taking on Walz and, especially, Kamala Harris. But maybe Vance doesn’t care about his popularity with voters beyond the MAGA base. He may simply play to an audience of one, Donald Trump, who only has one mode and one method: attack, attack, attack. —Mark Z.

Vance and Tim Walz face off in what could be an unusually important undercard debate Tuesday as they compete for decisive votes in America’s heartland just weeks before the election. The showdown between Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor chosen by Kamala Harris, and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio who is Donald Trump’s running mate, is likely to be the last of the 2024 campaign. Trump has refused a second debate with Vice President Harris, meaning this could be the final chance to see the two tickets go head to head. Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, each claim to be the true voice of the crucial Midwestern swing states—including Michigan and Wisconsin—that could decide an election that remains on a knife edge with five weeks to go. Both have been out of the spotlight lately, but Walz offered a brief message on X: “Looking forward to tonight.” History suggests vice presidential debates rarely move the dial much. However, Tuesday’s contest may have added significance in an election campaign that has seen Harris step in for US President Joe Biden unprecedentedly late in the game. The race has seen Vance and Trump use increasingly divisive rhetoric and even falsely accuse immigrants of eating people’s pets, meaning the debate is almost guaranteed to make for fiery television. “It will whet a lot of people’s appetites for November 5,” Thomas Whalen, an associate professor of social sciences at Boston University, told AFP. But the debate itself risked being overshadowed by Mideast tensions, after Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, which said it largely repelled the attack. Trump, visiting swing state Wisconsin on Tuesday, made zero mention of Vance or the VP debate in a rambling address. But he did insist that “if I were in charge, today’s attack on Israel never would have happened.” Should Harris and Walz win, he warned, “the world goes up in smoke.” Harris for her part, pledged her “unwavering” commitment to the security of Israel after Iran launched what she called “a reckless and brazen attack” on America’s ally. She said she “fully” supported Biden’s order for the US military to shoot down some of the missiles. The CBS clash also comes as several states dig out from enormous storm Helene, which has left at least 130 people dead and brought misery to thousands more. The devastation, and how to address such disasters, are likely to come up during the debate. – ‘High drama’ – Walz and Vance were each picked by their bosses to reach out to voters in the Midwestern battlegrounds where, thanks to the country’s idiosyncratic electoral college system, a few thousand votes could determine who wins the White House race. Both are military veterans with strong blue-collar credentials. Vance authored the Rust Belt memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” while Walz boasts a folksy persona as a former teacher and football coach. The similarities end there. The combative Vance shares Trump’s penchant for courting controversy, whether by smearing Democrats as “childless cat ladies” or by boosting false claims that Haitians living in an Ohio town ate residents’ pets. His goal will be to overcome polls that initially had him as one of the least popular VP nominees in history, after a series of previous comments on women and abortion were unearthed. “Vance has to be careful, because I think a trap has been laid for him,” said Whalen. The cheery Walz will be seeking to introduce himself to a public that barely knows him, after Harris’s swift rise to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. He became a hit with Democrats for branding Vance and Trump “weird” and for his progressive politics, but that will be a target for Vance as he and Trump seek to paint Walz and Harris as “Marxists.” Vance “is going up against a moron, a total moron,” Trump said in an interview Monday on Fox Nation. Televised debates have already proved their ability to shock this year, with Biden forced to drop his reelection bid after a disastrous performance against Trump in June brought long-simmering concerns about his age to the fore. Whalen said few vice presidential debates have “had any appreciable difference” in the past, but Tuesday’s clash could produce “high drama” for viewers who love political theatre.

Israel’s defence system stood firm as Iran launched warheads towards Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in revenge for Israel’s campaign against Tehran’s Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, including the assassination of its leader last week. In the most dramatic development of the Middle Eastern conflict, air raid sirens sounded as 181 missiles began raining down on Israel, with some rockets dramatically exploding into bright orange flames near Tel Aviv. But as Iran unleashed a salvo of missiles, ordered by its supreme leader Ali Khamenei, falling projectiles burned like comets against the night sky after the rockets were intercepted by Israel’s ‘Iron Dome’ defensive system. Israel has vowed that its air force will strike ‘powerfully’ overnight, sparking fears from world leaders that the Middle East is on the brink of being plunged into an all-out war. The US has confirmed that its troops helped down the incoming missiles, and now the UK has revealed British forces also ‘played their part’. Defence Secretary John Healey ‘condemned’ Iran’s attack, adding: ‘British forces have this evening played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.’ Mr Healey continued: ‘I want to thank all British personnel involved in the operation for their courage and professionalism. The UK stands fully behind Israel’s right to defend its country and its people against threats.’ His statement came after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer made a rare urgent speech at the Downing Street podium to condemn Iran, although he remained tight-lipped on the UK’s involvement. MailOnline understands that the UK played a similar role to when it defended Israel from an Iranian attack in April. On this occasion, RAF fighter jets shot down a number of drones, with support from several other countries including the US. It comes as: Israel launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon overnight on Monday with the aim of driving Hezbollah forces away from the border;The operation will be ‘limited’ and last for ‘days, not weeks’, Israeli officials told the US;British nationals scrambled to escape the war-torn country, with the UK government chartering an aircraft from Beirut todayTwo terrorists armed with an assault rifle and a knife killed six people in the Jaffa neighbourhood of Tel Aviv minutes before the Iranian missile attack; The expected assault, hailed as ‘heroic’ by Iran-backed Hamas, marks a major escalation in the Middle East, and was ‘twice the scope’ of Tehran’s bombardment in April, which saw more than 170 explosive drones and 120 ballistic missiles launched. The sickening attack, which Israel has vowed to exact revenge for, forced civilians to seek shelter as huge chunks of molten metal crashed to the ground. In a major embarrassment for Iran, the US said that the missile volley was ‘defeated and ineffective’, with just one reported death – a Palestinian man who was killed by shrapnel in the West Bank. Despite Iran claiming a new type of hypersonic missile was also used for the first time, IDF Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said there were no Israeli casualties and just a few hits in the centre of the country and in the south. ‘We are on high alert both defensively and offensively,’ Hagari said in a TV broadcast. ‘We will defend the citizens of the State of Israel. This attack will have consequences. We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide.’ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran’s massive missile attack on Israel ‘a big mistake’ and vowed to make Tehran ‘pay for it’. ‘Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it,’ said Netanyahu hours after the attack, warning: ‘Whoever attacks us, we attack them.’ In a separate statement, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who was at the command and control centre monitoring the interception of Iranian missiles, also vowed to punish Iran for the attack. ‘Iran has not learned a simple lesson – those who attack the state of Israel, pay a heavy price,’ he said in a statement issued by his office. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan condemned the ‘significant escalation by Iran’, but added: ‘In short, this attack seems to have been defeated and ineffective’. And Sir Keir Starmer, who was on the phone to his Israeli counterpart Netanyahu when the attack began, said: ‘I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink and I am deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation.’ With the world holding its breath over an all-out war in the Middle East, the White House said President Joe Biden had ordered the US military to ‘aid Israel’s defence’ and shoot down Iranian missiles. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in next month’s US presidential election, were both monitoring Iran’s attack on Israel from the White House situation room. The US had earlier warned that it was preparing for Iran to launch ballistic missiles in yet another major escalation in the Middle East. These can reach their targets in just 12 minutes. Some 181 missiles were fired into Israel in what Iran confirmed was a revenge attack for Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Iran claimed that 80 per cent of the missiles hit their targets, but the US and Israel have said the attack appears to have been ineffective. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps said its ‘Fattah’ hypersonic missile, which translates as ‘conqueror’ or ‘bringer of victory’ in Arabic, was part of the salvo. The salvo of rockets, seen raining down on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, came as Israeli police battled a terrorist attack in Jaffa, southern Israel, with Israeli media reporting that at least six people were shot dead. The attack on Israel comes just hours after the IDF launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon to carry out raids against Iranian-backed Hezbollah targets. As missiles bombarded Israel, the IDF said: ‘A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel. You are instructed to remain alert and precisely follow the Home Front Command’s instructions. ‘The IDF is doing and will do everything necessary to protect the civilians of the State of Israel.’ In a chilling warning of further bloodshed, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said that should Israel retaliate Tehran’s response would be ‘more crushing and ruinous’. They added: ‘In response to the martyrdom of (Hamas leader) Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and (Guards commander) Nilforoshan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories (Israel).’ But this statement was followed by a defiant announcement by Israel that its fighter jets are poised to attack other targets in the Middle East ‘in a powerful way’. Hamas also praised Iran’s missile attack, releasing the statement: ‘The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) blesses the heroic rocket launches carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran against wide areas of our occupied lands.’ It added that it was ‘in revenge for the blood of our heroic martyrs’. On Tuesday night, it appeared almost the entirety of the Iranian missiles were intercepted, either by Israel’s allies, or by its own network of defensive systems such as the Iron Dome. A military spokesperson said Israel recorded ‘a few hits in the centre and other areas in the south of the country’. One Palestinian was reported to have been killed near the West Bank city of Jericho when a projectile landed nearby during the rocket barrage, said Hussein Hamayel, the Palestinian governor of the area. He said the man, originally from Gaza, was killed by falling shrapnel. US Navy destroyers deployed to the eastern Mediterranean took down multiple missiles, according to security sources, while Israel’s neighbour Jordan came to its aid. Jordan’s Public Security Directorate said its air defences and the Royal Jordanian Air Force had intercepted Iranian missiles and drones aimed at Israel. A large-scale attack by Iran on Israel could now be the catalyst for an all-out war in the Middle East. In the UK, Downing Street said it ‘completely condemns Iran’s actions’. In a rare emergency briefing, Sir Keir Stamer said he ‘utterly condemned’ Iran’s attempt ‘to harm innocent Israelis’ and ‘push the region ever-closer to the brink’. He said: ‘We stand with Israel, and recognise her right to self defence in the face of this aggression. Iran must stop these attacks, together with its proxies like Hezbollah.’ The PM added: ‘We support Israel’s reasonable demand for the security of its people. ‘I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink and I am deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation.’ He said the situation in Lebanon ‘is incredibly grave’ and warned British nationals to leave immediately. Sir Keir refused to confirm or deny whether the British military would be helping Israel, telling reporters: ‘This is an evolving situation but what I will say is that we stand with Israel and her right to self defence and relevant updates will be provided in due course.’ Moments before Iran unleashed its missiles, Lord Admiral West, the former Head of the Royal Navy, questioned how large the scale of the attack would be and spoke about the implications this could have. He told MailOnline: ‘If it’s pre-warned and fired on a limited scale, just for Iran to say to all their own people and to the terrorists in the region, ‘Look, we’re not taking this lying down the fact that the Israelis have attacked Hezbollah and gone into Lebanon’, that’s one thing. ‘If it is a huge and major ballistic missile attack tied in with other actions as well, that’s a different kettle of fish, and that could lead to a larger Middle East war.’ Lord West said that while the US have stepped in to assist Israel, it was unlikely that the UK would be able to help defend ballistic missiles. He added: ‘If it’s only ballistic missiles, then there’s little that we can do with our aircraft to shoot down ballistic missiles. ‘If it’s purely ballistic missiles being fired, then you can’t shoot them down from a fighter aircraft. ‘And that’s all we’d have available in that area. Now, the Type 45 destroyer could shoot down a ballistic missile that’s aimed at it, or something close to it, but not things that are being fired into Israel.’ Shadow Security Minister Tom Tugendhat MP also condemned the attack, saying: ‘Iran’s barbaric attack on Israel shows that the regime in Tehran is intent on killing as many innocent men, women, and children in Israel as possible. ‘They are trying to murder Jews, Muslims and Christians in the only democracy of the Middle East. The world must unite in condemning this heinous act of state terrorism. ‘This is just the latest action from a regime that, for the past 45 years, has murdered its own citizens and hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Syria and Yemen. Today, my thoughts are with the people of Israel and everyone in the Middle East who is suffering at the hands of Iran’s brutal leaders.’ The ballistic missiles were fired from Iran while Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon also launched rockets and fired small arms into Israel. It followed Israel’s ground assault on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon and its killing of the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on Beirut last week. The remarkably minimal impact of the barrage of misiles was in part due to Israel’s sophisticated warning systems, its shelters and air defence networks such as the Iron Dome and David’s Sling. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in the centre and the south of the country received messages on mobile phones to take cover and avoid gatherings. Last night, Professor Michael Clarke, previously of the Royal United Services Institute, said the Middle East faced a full-scale conflict. He said: ‘This might not be the only attack. If I was making decisions in Iran I wouldn’t be just firing one salvo. ‘I also suspect there will be a lot more terrorist incidents on behalf of Iran. In the past fortnight Israel has had its adversary on the back foot. The question is are they over-reaching themselves? Should we [the UK] support it fully? ‘The wider world is saying be careful Israel, we are closer to a regional war than we were two weeks ago, or even 48 hours ago. A ceasefire does not appear to be on Israel’s agenda.’ Fears of an Iranian attack were raised as the Israeli military warned the residents of more than two dozen Lebanese border communities to immediately evacuate their homes after announcing the start of ground operations against Hezbollah late last night. Israeli citizens elsewhere were warned by the Home Front Command to ‘stay next to a protected space’, ‘minimise moving around the area’ and ‘avoid gatherings’. Meanwhile IDF spokesman Avichay Adraee told Lebanese citizens to flee north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometres (36 miles) from the border, raising fears that the IDF may intend to send its forces deep into southern Lebanon or step up the intensity of airstrikes. ‘You must head north of the Awali River to save yourselves and leave your houses immediately,’ said the statement. Iran in April launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in a one-off retaliation for an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate compound in Syria. But all those projectiles were downed by Israeli, Jordanian, British and US defences, and analysts said the move was more a symbol of intent on Tehran’s behalf and not designed to cause real damage. The latest Iranian attack comes in response to Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last Friday and the punishing airstrikes of the past week that have displaced more than 1 million people from their homes across southern and eastern Lebanon. Tehran had appeared uncharacteristically reluctant to trumpet its support for Hezbollah in recent weeks even as Israel dramatically ramped up its military offensive against the Iranian proxy. However, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon this afternoon issued a cryptic statement affirming that Tehran will continue to ‘stand by’ Hezbollah. ‘The Lebanese people are aware and can fully distinguish between their friends who stood by them in the darkest of circumstances, and those who provide cover for their enemy to besiege and target them,’ it said. ‘The influential role of Iran will become more and more clear to the world when the star of victory over Zionist terrorism shines,’ it added. ‘Iran is continuing its approach steadfastly, unaffected by all the noise that is happening.’ Israel’s defence forces (IDF) claimed to have launched ‘localised’ cross-border raids on southern Lebanon late last night, which Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said were designed to prevent Hezbollah from conducting an ‘October 7-style massacre’. ‘Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages next to Israeli villages into military bases ready for an attack on Israel,’ he said. Clips and images released by the IDF showed tanks, artillery and helicopters pounding targets just across the border, along with a video showing special forces seemingly preparing under the cover of night for a raid. However, Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have contested Israel’s version of events, denying the claim that IDF troops had stepped foot on Lebanese soil. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched waves of rockets at targets across Israel yesterday, prompting officials to close beaches and limit the size of public gatherings. Air raid sirens sounded across northern and central Israel this morning as air defence systems sprang into action to down the Hezbollah rockets – but some projectiles appeared to sneak through. Pictures and videos shared to social media showed the remnants of downed projectiles lying in the streets, while smoke was seen rising from buildings struck in Hezbollah’s attacks after explosions rang out in Tel Aviv. The Lebanese group claimed it launched a barrage of Fadi 4 missiles at Israeli Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, the IDF 8200 intelligence unit in Glilot, as well as a series of other military targets. The Israeli military said their ground operations in Lebanon began in earnest on Monday night and involved the elite 98th division, which was deployed to the northern front two weeks ago from Gaza where they had been fighting against Hamas for months. It said its air force and artillery supported ground troops engaged in ‘localised and targeted ground raids’ against Hezbollah in southern Lebanese villages. Israeli officials have insisted the raids will be limited in scale, adding they do not intend to launch a ground assault on Beirut or occupy swathes of Lebanon. The operation, which comes nearly a year on from Hamas‘ October 7 attacks, was given the green light yesterday – three days after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was confirmed dead following a devastating attack in Beirut. But Rear Admiral Hagari added this afternoon that IDF special forces units had been conducting small scale raids to destroy Hezbollah tunnels along the border ever since October 7. Close to 3,000 militants from Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad were allegedly waiting in southern Lebanon villages to attack Israel in the days after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught. But they were forced back by Israeli airstrikes, allowing IDF commandos to conduct some 70 raids undetected in which they destroyed weapons caches, collapsed tunnels and gathered intelligence, Hagari said. It was revealed this afternoon that the IDF also mobilised four additional brigades to be deployed in missions along the northern border in the wake of the latest ground incursions. ‘This will enable the continuation of operational activity against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation and the achievement of operational goals, including the safe return of the residents of northern Israel to their homes,’ the army said in a statement. The statement did not provide details about the new brigades being called up, but one brigade typically consists of 1,000 to 2,000 soldiers, while an armoured tank brigade has about 100 tanks. Meanwhile, Israel’s air force continued to pound targets across Lebanon with brutal airstrikes yesterday, while also hitting Damascus in Syria and various locations in Gaza. Dystopian images that emerged early this morning showed Israeli flares and munitions lighting up the night sky in southern Lebanon, softening up Hezbollah positions in preparation for the IDF incursion. Despite the IDF’s claims, Hezbollah denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon at all, casting doubt on the situation on the ground. In its first statement since Israel announced the start of ground operations, the Lebanese group’s spokesman Mohammed Afif dismissed what he said were ‘false claims’ of an Israeli incursion, simply stating that his forces ‘were ready’ to respond to an invasion. Many observers dismissed this as a propaganda tactic, but no videos or photos of Israeli troops in Lebanon had emerged at the time of writing. Nevertheless, Israel has dealt heavy blows to Hezbollah in the past two weeks. It successfully pulled off a ruthless covert operation that saw thousands of rigged communication devices explode in the hands of Hezbollah members, and proceeded to launch a devastating campaign of airstrikes. Hezbollah chief Nasrallah – a towering figure who turned the group into Lebanon’s top military and political force – was assassinated last week along with several other senior commanders in one of those strikes. Now, Israel has indicated it is primed for an invasion of Lebanon, with the stated aim of enabling thousands of its citizens who fled Hezbollah rockets to safely return to their communities near the northern border. The deployment of boots on the ground overnight to conduct raids on southern Lebanese villages closest to the border represents a significant escalation in Israel’s war against its enemy to the north. The IDF said that its incursion, dubbed ‘Operation Northern Arrows’, will continue ‘according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas’. The IDF’s incursion into southern Lebanon came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning to Iran, whom Hamas and Hezbollah are both backed by. He said: ‘There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country.’ Hezbollah’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said Monday the group will fight any Israeli troops who try to occupy parts of Lebanon. Lebanon’s prime minister meanwhile said his country was facing ‘one of the most dangerous phases of its history’, urging the United Nations to provide aid for one million people displaced by Israeli air strikes. ‘Around a million of our people have been displaced because of the devastating war that Israel is waging on Lebanon,’ the National News Agency reported Najib Mikati as saying. ‘We urgently call for more aid to reinforce our ongoing efforts to provide basic support to displaced civilians,’ he added in a meeting with UN representatives. Mikati later this morning launched an appeal for more than $400 million in aid to address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in his country in coordination with the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said. The US said it was informed beforehand about Israel’s raids, which have been described as ‘limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border.’ The invasion is said to have forced Lebanese troops to retreat three miles from their positions along the counrty’s southern border with Israel. Meanwhile, the Lebanese health ministry said early this morning that 95 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in the past day, with another 172 injured. An overnight Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted Mounir Maqdah, commander of the Lebanese branch of the Palestinian Fatah movement’s military wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, according to two Palestinian security officials. The strike hit a building in the crowded Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon, the sources said, adding the militant commander’s fate was unknown. In Syria, three civilians were killed and nine others injured in an Israeli airstrike on the capital Damascus, Syrian state media said on Tuesday citing a military source. As the Israeli bombardment continued into the night, residents living in southern Beirut were ordered to evacuate ‘immediately’. ‘You are located near interests and facilities belonging to the terrorist Hezbollah, and therefore the IDF will act against them forcefully,’ IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X. ‘For your safety and the safety of your family, you must evacuate the buildings immediately, starting at a distance of no less than 500 meters.’ The intensive air strikes of the past two weeks have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government. British nationals have been urged to leave Lebanon immediately, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy warning the conflict could ‘escalate in a major way’. Lammy told reporters on Monday night: ‘I have been urging since coming to office in July for British nationals to leave Lebanon. And indeed the previous government from October 2023 was urging UK nationals not to travel to Lebanon. ‘Notwithstanding that we sent a rapid response team. 700 troops are in Cyprus. We will do all we can to assist people to get out. ‘We have secured places on commercial flights that are flying tomorrow so that UK nationals can get out.’ Asked what he would say to British nationals who have not yet taken his advice, he said: ‘I urge them to leave because the situation on the ground is fast moving. ‘While we will do everything we can to protect British nationals and those plans are in place to do so, we cannot anticipate the circumstances of the speed with which we could do that If things escalate in a major way over the coming hours and days.’ The UK Government has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on Wednesday and vulnerable British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18 will be prioritised, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. Mr Lammy said: ‘The situation in Lebanon is volatile and has potential to deteriorate quickly. ‘The safety of British nationals in Lebanon continues to be our utmost priority. ‘That’s why the UK Government is chartering a flight to help those wanting to leave. It is vital that you leave now as further evacuation may not be guaranteed.’ Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost every day since the war in Gaza began. The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people in Israel and Lebanon. Israel says it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for Israelis displaced from border communities to return to their homes. Hezbollah has promised to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. Early on Monday, Hezbollah vowed to keep fighting even after its longtime leader Nasrallah and other top officials were recently wiped out by Israeli strikes. Giving his first address since the group’s leader was killed, deputy Naim Qassem said: ‘Hezbollah’s front will continue, everyone on the battlefield is ready and, despite the losing of our leader and commanders, we will not move aside nor will we forsake our duty in support of Gaza and in defence of Lebanon,’ he said. ‘If the Zionists enter Lebanon, we are ready and prepared for a ground battle, and we will be victorious.’ Israel’s order restricting entry and exit from the northern communities of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi does not necessarily mean Israeli troops will invade Lebanon immediately. Areas can also be declared closed military zones if an imminent threat is detected.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe UK Government has confirmed that British forces &#8216;played their part&#8217; in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: UK Confirms Involvement in Middle East Conflict as British Forces Support Israel&#8217;s Defense; Iron Dome Successfully Thwarts Iran&#8217;s Missile Attack first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/uk-confirms-involvement-in-middle-east-conflict-as-british-forces-support-israels-defense-iron-dome-successfully-thwarts-irans-missile-attack/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/01/19/90332447-13912927-image-a-2_1727808055210.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:19:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.149},{"id":258134864,"title":"Former Florida Judge Backs Supreme Court Changes","text":"Term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices would not reduce judicial independence and could enhance accountability, according to Barbara J. Pariente, former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court.In an opinion piece for the Brennan Center for Justice published on Tuesday, Pariente wrote that lifetime appointments may lead to a lack of accountability, as they were initially intended by the country's founders to ensure independence when life expectancy was much lower.She says that Florida's system, which includes mandatory retirement ages, regular retention votes, judicial conduct codes, financial disclosure requirements and possible disciplinary actions, contributes to judicial independence.Pariente believes that such mechanisms are more effective in maintaining impartiality than lifetime appointments without genuine accountability.\"I take great pride in my judicial career and the hundreds of opinions I authored. I always understood my role was to render fair decisions uninfluenced by popular opinion or political pressure,\" she wrote for the Brennan Center. \"I spoke extensively to student groups and civic groups on the importance of judicial independence—that judges were not 'Republican' or 'Democrat' or pro-death penalty or anti-death penalty but, rather, take an oath to be impartial.\"The U.S. Supreme Court, facing mounting pressure over accusations of ethics violations, primarily aimed at Justice Clarence Thomas and fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito, issued its first formal code of conduct in November 2023. The code, however, was immediately met with criticism for lacking any concrete means of enforcement, leaving many to question its practical influence on the justices' behavior.In a move addressing ongoing concerns about judicial integrity, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan reaffirmed her stance on the need for a robust enforcement mechanism for the High Court's recently adopted ethics code.Speaking last month at New York University School of Law, Kagan outlined her vision for strengthening the code's implementation, pushing back against critics who claim such measures would be ineffective.Kagan, a member of the court's liberal minority, has been at the forefront of calls for reform. Her proposal involves creation of a panel of lower court judges appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts. This panel would be tasked with handling allegations leveled against the justices, effectively serving as a filter to separate legitimate concerns from baseless accusations.Newsweek has emailed the Supreme Court's public information office for comment Tuesday afternoon.Pariente says that the essence of the judicial system is to render decisions based on law and facts, not public or political influence, and this independence can be preserved without lifetime appointments through structured term limits and accountability measures.In the opinion contribution, the former Florida jurist highlighted several controversial cases that she authored during her 20-year tenure, including one stemming from the 2000 presidential race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.Pariente said that she faced \"public pressure\" from Democratic voters to rule in favor of Gore's legal team in the case involving Palm Beach County's so-called \"butterfly ballot.\"The evidence of the confusion was that numerous Democratic voters in Democratic strongholds inadvertently cast their ballots for third-party candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Gore, thereby providing an unintended advantage to Bush. The proposed solution was to permit a new vote in Palm Beach County, which Pariente ruled against.\"I was a Palm Beach County resident and had voted by absentee ballot. Despite the fact that there was a great deal of public pressure—especially from the voters in my home county to decide this case favorably for Gore—I was convinced that the law did not provide a basis for a revote,\" Pariente wrote.A month of intense legal disputes culminated in a contentious 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore, which halted a Florida recount. Bush secured Florida by a mere 537 votes, equivalent to a margin of 0.009 percent, and won 271 electoral votes to Gore's 270.After today's Supreme Court handed down several controversial rulings and with some justices being accused of unethical behavior, President Joe Biden's administration unveiled a three-part reform plan on July 29 that would check the court's powers. The plan would create a constitutional amendment ensuring former presidents are not immune from crimes committed while in office; establish a single 18-year term limit for justices, who at the moment are allowed to serve on the nation's highest court until retirement or death; and create a binding, enforceable code of conduct that would require justices to disclose gifts, not publicly participate in political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have a conflict of interest.Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, supports Biden's reform plan.\"In the course of our nation's history, trust in the Supreme Court of the United States has been critical to achieving equal justice under law,\" Harris said in a statement on July 29. \"Yet today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent.\"","summary":"The Supreme Court faces mounting pressure over accusations of ethics violations, primarily aimed at Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/florida-judge-pariente-supreme-court-changes-1962293","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2485065/justices-state-union.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:12:05","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.258},{"id":258134796,"title":"Trump declines to take part in ’60 Minutes’ election special interview","text":"NEW YORK – CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with “60 Minutes” for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone.

Lane, 26, was arrested after what the suit calls a “horrific” attack and has been charged with felony strangulation and misdemeanor assault, court records show. Six days after the attack, Hubert-Ross had a previously scheduled audition for a “very well known broadcast television show, the suit says. She went to the audition, but was covered in bruises and suffering from the mental trauma of the attack — and was not offered the role, the lawsuit adds. Photographs included in court documents show Hubert-Ross with extensive bruises and scratches. Lane, according to the suit, attacked Hubert-Ross in a jealous rage which erupted after the pair met earlier that night at O’Hanlon’s Bar on E. 14th St., with another friend that Hubert-Ross had a “romantic encounter” with years earlier. Later that night, Lane also confessed to sending “intimate” texts to his ex-girlfriend during a time in which he had agreed to “exclusively” date Hubert-Ross, the suit says. After his infidelity was exposed, Lane yelled expletives at Hubert-Ross and then “violently threw her into a stove” before dragging her into the bathroom and throwing her into the tub, the suit alleges. Lane ignored Hubert-Ross’ pleas that they simply break up and for him to stop hurting her further, and responded instead, “You ruin f—king everything,” court papers claim. During the vicious attack, Hubert-Ross managed to call her mother, who she put on speaker phone and who witnessed the sickening abuse, the lawsuit says. The comedian also texted a friend, who called the police. Responding cops then arrested Lane, the suit says. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office believed at Lane’s arraignment hours later that the case was strong and that the attack was extremely violent, according to a law enforcement source. Prosecutors asked a judge to set bail at $20,000 cash or $60,000 bond. But Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Valentina Morales ordered Lane released while issuing an order of protection. Lane is due back in court November 20. His attorney in the criminal case did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and it was unclear Tuesday who was repping him in the civil case. Hubert-Ross’ lawyer, Brett Gallaway, said in a statement that Lane “will now be forced to answer for his crimes,” adding that “we look forward to ensuring he pays for his cowardly actions.”","summary":"Comedian Sienna Hubert-Ross has alleged in a new $20 million Manhattan lawsuit that the son of a Morgan Stanley banker tried to kill her in a \"jealous rage.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/us-news/kamala-harris-impersonating-comedian-files-20m-nyc-suit-against-morgan-stanley-bankers-son-over-attempted-murder/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/comedian-sienna-hubert-ross-performs-90831148.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7tF5FcMV-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:07:27","author":"Ben Kochman,Carl Campanile","authors":["Ben Kochman","Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":258134456,"title":"Trump Claims Harris Has a ‘Migrant Phone App’","text":"{\"@context\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/ns\\/activitystreams\",{\"Hashtag\":\"as:Hashtag\",\"sensitive\":\"as:sensitive\"}],\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/politicalwire.com\\/2024\\/10\\/01\\/trump-claims-harris-has-a-migrant-phone-app\\/\",\"type\":\"Note\",\"attachment\":[],\"attributedTo\":\"https:\\/\\/politicalwire.com\\/@politicalwire\",\"content\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EDonald Trump falsely claimed that Kamala Harris has a \\u201cmigrant phone app\\u201d which she uses to coordinate with drug cartels.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ESaid Trump: \\u201cI will shut down all entries through Kamala\\u2019s migrant phone app. She\\u2019s got a phone app. It\\u2019s meant for the cartel heads.

The former president has claimed on the campaign trail that his last term saw “the best economy in the history of our country.” (He glosses over the economic crisis of 2020.) He has presented a slate of far-fetched ideas for how to bring down the cost of living and strengthen business. (See: “Drill, baby, drill”; his promises to impose massive tariffs; his idea to deport immigrants to open up more housing; and his suggestion that he himself wants to “have a say” in toggling interest rates, which he later walked back.) Until a few months ago, voters—who say that the economy is the biggest campaign issue on their minds—appeared to be buying his pitch. In polls, Americans overwhelmingly said that they trusted him more than President Joe Biden to handle the economy. But much has changed in recent months: Once Kamala Harris became her party’s nominee, she quickly distinguished her campaign’s economic message from Biden’s, a strategy that has resonated with some voters. Last month, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years, effectively signaling to Americans that inflation is over—and triggering a stream of positive news coverage to that effect. Voters’ perceptions of the economy writ large have proved stubborn, but the American public seems more and more willing to entertain the idea that Harris could be a better leader than Trump on the issue. Scarred by a period of high prices and inflation, Americans have been reluctant to accept the message—from Biden or from pundits—that the economy is good, actually, even though inflation cooled off significantly by 2023 and the unemployment rate has been near historic lows for much of the past three years. (Consumer sentiment has risen considerably since a mid-2022 nadir, but it’s still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels). Harris’s strategy so far has not focused on defending Biden’s record; instead, her campaign has attempted to differentiate her from the president—even as Trump has tried to present her as an extension of Biden’s legacy. “Whether or not Harris is ultimately saddled with Biden’s economic baggage may come down to who wins this narrative war,” my colleague Rogé Karma, who covers economics, told me. Harris has focused on acknowledging the high cost of living and offering paths to combat it—a departure from Biden, who spent the past year trying desperately to convince voters that the economy was strong, Rogé said. Harris’s approach (which Rogé has called “Bidenomics without Biden”) seems to be working so far: One poll found that she had a one-point lead over Trump on the economy in September, just three months after Biden was running 11 points behind Trump on the issue. Other polls also show Trump’s edge as the trusted economy candidate shrinking. “The economy as an issue has gone from being the winning issue for Trump to a virtual tie,” Rogé explained. Harris has gained on Trump, but this trend is not guaranteed to continue until November. One primary predictor of success for the incumbent party, Gabriel Lenz, a political-science professor at UC Berkeley, told me, is the growth of what economists call “real disposable income,” or Americans’ income after taxes and transfers—spending money, in other words. Right now, that metric is on the fence: “We’re not seeing that incomes are going up relative to inflation as much as they could be,” Lenz said. News stories can also shift voter perception in the final weeks of an election, even in our calcified political moment, Lenz argued. Historical precedent has been set for that: In 1992, for example, the economy was picking up before the election, but the fact that media coverage remained negative may have influenced the incumbent George H. W. Bush’s loss, Lenz suggested. (It didn’t help that Bill Clinton’s team did its best to tie Bush to that negative narrative: That election featured the infamous Clinton-campaign line “It’s the economy, stupid.”) The broad realities of the American economy haven’t meaningfully changed since Harris entered the race, and Americans don’t suddenly feel rosy about it. But the messenger has changed, and that may be enough to compel some voters in this final stretch. Because many Americans are so far distinguishing Harris from the Biden administration’s economic policy, she has been able to take advantage of good economic news in a way that Biden never quite could.

Living the last 19 months in home hospice care in Plains, the Georgia Democrat and 39th president has continued to defy expectations, just as he did through a remarkable rise from his family peanut farming and warehouse business to the world stage. He served one presidential term from 1977 to 1981 and then worked more than four decades leading The Carter Center, which he and his wife Rosalynn co-founded in 1982 to “wage peace, fight disease, and build hope.” “Not everybody gets 100 years on this earth, and when somebody does, and when they use that time to do so much good for so many people, it’s worth celebrating,” Jason Carter, the former president’s grandson and chair of The Carter Center governing board, said in an interview. “These last few months, 19 months, now that he’s been in hospice, it’s been a chance for our family to reflect,” he continued, “and then for the rest of the country and the world to really reflect on him. That’s been a really gratifying time.” James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924 in Plains, where he has lived more than 80 of his 100 years. He is expected to mark his birthday in the same one-story home he and Rosalynn built in the early 1960s — before his first election to the Georgia state Senate. The former first lady, who was also born in Plains, died last November at 96. President Joe Biden, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter’s 1976 campaign, praised his longtime friend for an “unwavering belief in the power of human goodness.” “You’ve always been a moral force for our nation and the world (and) a beloved friend to Jill and me and our family,” the 81-year-old president tells Carter in a tribute video filmed in front of Carter’s presidential portrait at the White House. Outside the North Portico, the Bidens are placing a display of large lettering declaring “Happy Birthday President Carter” and the number 100. Carter has asked Biden to eulogize him at his state funeral when the time comes. The Carter Center on Sept. 17 hosted a musical gala in Atlanta to celebrate the former president with a range of genres and artists, including some who campaigned with him in 1976. The event raised more than $1.2 million for the center’s programs and will be broadcast Tuesday evening on Georgia Public Broadcasting. In St. Paul, Minnesota, Habitat for Humanity volunteers are honoring Carter with a five-day effort to build 30 houses. The Carters became top ambassadors for the international organization after leaving the White House and hosted annual building projects into their 90s. Carter survived a cancer diagnosis and treatment in his early 90s, then several falls and a hip replacement in his mid-90s before announcing at 98 that he would enter hospice care. Townspeople in Plains planned another concert Tuesday evening. The last time Jimmy Carter was seen publicly was nearly a year ago, using a reclining wheelchair to attend his wife’s two funeral services. Visibly diminished and silent, he was joined on the front row of Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta by the couple’s four children, every living former first lady, President Joe Biden and his wife Jill and former President Bill Clinton. A day later, Carter joined his extended family and parishioners at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, where the former president taught Sunday School for decades. Jason Carter said the 100th birthday celebrations were not something the family expected to see once his grandmother died. The former president’s hospital bed had been set up in the same room so he could see his wife of 77 years and talk to her in her final days and hours. “We frankly didn’t think he was going to go on much longer,” Jason Cater said. “But it’s a faith journey for him, and he’s really given himself over to what he feels is God’s plan. He knows he’s not in charge. But in these last few months, especially, he has gotten a lot more engaged in world events, a lot more engaged in politics, a lot more, just engaged, emotionally, with all of us.” Jason Carter said the centenarian president, born only four years after women were granted the constitutional right to vote and four decades before Black women won ballot access, is eager to cast his 2024 presidential ballot — for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat who would become the first woman, second Black person and first person of south Asian descent to reach the Oval Office. “He, like a lot of us, was incredibly gratified by his friend Joe Biden’s courageous choice to pass the torch,” the younger Carter said. “You know, my grandfather and The Carter Center have observed more than 100 elections in 40 other countries, right? So, he knows how rare it is for somebody who’s a sitting president to give up power in any context.” Jason Carter continued, “When we started asking him about his 100th birthday, he said he was excited to vote for Kamala Harris.” Early voting in Georgia begins Oct. 15, two weeks into James Earl Carter Jr.’s 101st year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJimmy Carter&#8217;s grandson says the 100th birthday celebrations were not something the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jimmy Carter Achieves Historic Milestone as First American President to Reach 100 Years Old first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/jimmy-carter-achieves-historic-milestone-as-first-american-president-to-reach-100-years-old/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Jimmy-Carter-is-first-American-president-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 23:00:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.232},{"id":258134090,"title":"Letters: Cell phone ban | Natural burials | Harden networks | Equitable economy | Fighting fentanyl","text":"Schools must prepare students for phone limit Re: “Schools must limit student smartphone use by 2026” (Page B2, Sept. 24). While I understand the controversy and skepticism with this new law, I strongly encourage parents to collectively support our schools and advocate for these restrictions. We must educate our children and teenagers on the responsibilities of smartphone use and the mental health dangers it imposes on them. Although awareness and usage limitations should start in the home, we have a social responsibility to protect the overall well-being of young students in our communities. This is an opportunity for parents to come together with their school administrations to curate a restriction plan that is feasible for both families and teachers. As stakeholders in our students’ education, we must understand the serious complications overexposure to smartphone devices and social media causes on our young people’s minds. I hope the school administrations will build education awareness for parents and students as the first step in their restriction plans. Michaela Gonzales San Jose Natural burials would preserve Coyote Valley Re: “Despite need cemetery opponents unite” (Page B1, Sept. 26). Why not make this proposed site a natural burial ground? The deceased is washed, wrapped in clean cloth and placed in the ground in a natural setting to return to the Earth as nature intended. A small plaque marks the grave. No embalming, no sealing the body in an air-tight casket so it can rot slowly, no vast lawn to water, mow and maintain, and no crematorium to pollute the air with noxious fumes from the furnace. Of course, this would mean no big bucks for the funeral industry, but this vast swath of land in the Coyote Valley would stay the same as it is today. Lona Ingraham Santa Clara Cellular firms must harden their networks Re: “Bay Area emergency services, businesses proceed as usual despite Verizon outage” (Page B4, Oct. 1). Again today we saw a critical infrastructure fail. My phone was dead from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., meaning no 911 calls could be made. And I’m sure the economic impact, although not yet known, could be astronomical. But this is not what concerns me. What scares the hell out of me is what will happen when the next big earthquake happens and the towers fall and the power fails. This could mean that phone service could be off for weeks or months. But we have no idea what Verizon has done. Our phone and internet service providers need to be required to harden their infrastructure against the worst possible earthquake and fire scenarios. They need to be fully transparent. They need to test their networks before the big one. Jim Koren Cupertino Equitable economy key to homelessness fight Re: “California goes to war against campers and encampments” (Page A7, Sept. 27). Joe Mathews criticizes politicians for working to shut down homeless camps. Ironically, it is loud criticism in the press over the last several years, building to a crescendo during the election season, that has politicians desperate to get the problem out of sight. The catch-22: Nobody wants to deal with the filth and crime, yet nobody with a heart wants others to suffer due to the high cost of housing. Further, nobody wants to pay higher taxes to build and maintain low-cost public housing, nor wants such housing in their neighborhoods. We ordinary folks who work, pay taxes and have a place to live are not the problem here. Extreme wealth and high-level corporate salaries, along with resistance among the wealthy to paying their fair share of taxes for a healthy, humane society, have created this mess. Only a reordering of our economy toward greater equality will solve the problem. Will Beatty San Jose Citizens must demand end to fentanyl death toll More than 73,000 people died from fentanyl in 2022. In an age of AI, drones, detection gadgets and the greatest military in the world cannot stop this. I call upon every citizen of this great country to rise and demand that our federal and state governments stop this daily carnage. We must harness our military, technology, border policing, public health education, international diplomacy and abundant resources to make this our national priority.

American University professor Allan Lichtman, 77, dished out his forecast for the November election last month, based on a model centering on 13 keys to the White House. Lichtman’s keys turn a blind eye to polls and pundits, which are closely followed indicators as the November election nears. Instead, his keys were developed from 120 years of presidential election results and are called based on answering true-false questions around the performance of party currently in the White House. His 13 keys are: Midterm gains, incumbency, primary contest, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, White House scandal, incumbent charisma, challenger charisma, foreign policy failure and foreign policy success. Early last month, Lichtman had Harris losing only three keys – midterm gains, incumbency and incumbent charisma. The foreign policy failure and foreign policy success keys appeared shaky, but even if Harris lost them, she would have five false keys instead of six, which would deem her as the loser. ‘Even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House,’ Lichtman told The New York Times.

The Senate Leadership Fund, aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and the Great Lakes Conservative Fund have launched ad campaigns worth more than $22 million and $8 million, respectively. Although Rogers and his campaign are barred from coordinating with the groups under campaign finance laws, the support will enable him to either keep pace with or surpass Democratic spending for Slotkin as voters prepare to head to the polls. 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: VANCE AND WALZ TO GO TOE-TO-TOE IN CBS CONTEST Ads aired by Democrats for Slotkin so far total $49 million, with at least another $20 million in reservations, per ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Republicans sit at $39 million aired for Rogers so far and another $21 million reserved, though it appeared not all of the latest pledged super PAC money had yet been reserved. The cash dump came on the heels of Slotkin privately sounding the alarm about Democrats’ prospects in the Great Lakes State, telling donors that Vice President Kamala Harris was “underwater” in Michigan based on Slotkin’s internal polling. The Slotkin campaign did not respond to a request for comment about her remarks or the influx of conservative ad money against her. The Slotkin campaign has reacted to the new support for Rogers by highlighting it in email fundraising pitches. One of them warned that “Republicans are throwing everything they can at Michigan.” Another said McConnell and other Republicans were trying to “buy this election for our opponent” and requested a $3 donation. The Rogers campaign celebrated her “underwater” comments as a “terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.” However, Slotkin still appears to have a steady polling edge. Candidates will often amplify the competitiveness of their race as a way to motivate donors and voters, making it difficult to decipher their true level of concern. Slotkin leads Rogers, backed by former President Donald Trump, by an average of nearly 5 points in recent surveys. Internal Republican polls have shown the two are far closer and within the margin of error. The seat is held by longtime Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), who is retiring after nearly 30 years in Congress and a lifelong career in politics.","summary":"Tens of millions of dollars are streaming into Michigan’s battleground “toss-up” Senate race for Republican nominee Mike Rogers just weeks before Election Day as he takes on Rep.

The program’s interview with Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris will air on Monday as planned, the network said. 60 Minutes said their invitation to the Republican nominee still stands. Trump previously sat down for an interview with the program before the 2020 presidential election, where he raged against the questions asked by host Lesley Stahl before abruptly walking out. “When you started with me, your first statement was: ‘are you ready for tough questions?’ That’s no way to talk,” Trump told the host before a producer warned them they were running out of interview time. “I think we have enough of an interview here,” Trump told an aide. “That’s enough.

JD Vance, as possibly tops on Trump’s list of “biggest failures.” The ad recaps Trump’s most notorious business failures, including Trump Shuttle (his airline that went under), Trump University (his fraudulent educational venture that ended up in lawsuits), Trump Steaks (which disappeared from store shelves), and Truth Social (his faltering social media network). It ends with a recap of the negative reception Vance has faced since Trump announced him as his pick for VP. A selection of audio clips play over footage of Vance, with snippets like “They think he’s the worst,” “weird,” “twisted,” and “creepy authoritarian.” The ad ends with the awkward exchange between Vance and a donut shop employee that went viral, with the unimpressed worker responding “okay” when Vance introduced himself and announced he is running for vice president. The rollout of Vance’s candidacy has not gone well for the GOP, but on Tuesday Republicans released a video promoting him along with the hashtag #HillbillyEnergy, a reference to his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.” The video has a lot of work to do, as Vance’s favorability ratings have been underwater since he made his debut alongside Trump. In an aggregate of polls, Vance’s unfavorable rating outpolls his favorable rating by 11 points. By comparison, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, has a net positive favorable rating, with favorable ahead of unfavorable by 3.7 percentage points. Much of Vance’s problem can be attributed to resurfaced comments he has made over the years. He complained that the Democratic Party is run by “childless cat ladies” and said people who choose not to have children are “psychotic.” Vance also promoted the false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing and eating people’s pets, even after officials reportedly told him the story was not true. Walz has been more closely associated with championing the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community. One of his signature achievements in his home state of Minnesota was signing legislation that made school meals free. The Harris campaign also released an ad slated to air as part of the campaign’s $370 million ad buy in multiple states. Titled “Concepts of a Plan,” the ad focuses on Trump’s failure to articulate a vision on reforming health care during his disastrous debate performance against Harris. When he was in the White House, Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, along with congressional Republicans. His allies behind the extremist government blueprint known as Project 2025 have also suggested ideas like cutting health care coverage and curtailing access to abortion care. In several speeches, Vance has suggested that a second Trump administration would seek to “deregulate” health care. Democrats have responded to the idea by accusing Trump and Vance of scheming to undermine protections for preexisting conditions that were put in place under the Obama administration. The Biden-Harris administration reversed course from Trump and sought to expand coverage for people under the federal health care law. Harris was similarly the key swing vote that led to passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin costs and allowed Medicare to negotiate on drug costs for millions of consumers.","summary":"A new ad released ahead of Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate brands Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen.

Both candidates will remain behind their podiums for the entire 90-minute debate.JD Vance vs Tim Walz: Debate StylesAlthough Vance is relatively new to politics compared to his opponents, he has quickly established himself as a proficient debater. He is known for his aggressive tactics and his ability to turn criticisms to his advantage.In debates, including his 2022 encounter with Tim Ryan, Vance demonstrated a knack for keeping opponents off balance by reframing their attacks. Ryan called Vance \"skilled\" and highlighted Vance's tactical and strategic approach to debates during an appearance on Slate's What Next podcast.Vance has earned a reputation for shifting the narrative in his favor by reframing criticisms, a technique that Ryan experienced firsthand. Ryan acknowledged Vance's ability to \"say whatever he needs to say to advance himself,\" indicating a flexible and opportunistic approach to public discourse, regardless of the truthfulness of his statements.Since joining Trump, Vance has become a prominent \"attack dog\" for the Republican campaign, frequently targeting Democrats and defending Trump against criticism. This aggressive style is something he's likely to bring to the stage during Tuesday's debate.Speaking to reporters last week, Vance said he didn't \"have to prepare that much\" for the debate because he had \"well-developed views on public policy.\"On the other hand, Walz is less known for his debating prowess. While he has experience as a two-term governor, his debate performances tend to lean more on his approachable, folksy demeanor. Walz is quick to defuse tough questions, though he can struggle to keep his temper in check when pressed on his record.Critics have occasionally referred to his responses in debates and press appearances as \"word salad,\" suggesting his answers are unclear and don't always reach a clear point.Walz has been rigorously practicing with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in as Vance. Others helping in the preparations include Rob Friedlander and Zayn Siddique, who helped Harris prepare for her debate with Trump, along with other aides to Walz and the campaign.What's at Stake for JD Vance and Tim Walz?Historically, vice-presidential debates have had minimal impact on election outcomes, and the campaigns for both JD Vance and Tim Walz have been managing expectations ahead of their debate.Despite some memorable moments from past vice-presidential debates, research shows that vice-presidential candidates tend to have a limited effect on voter decisions.Still, the debate will offer viewers a glimpse into the competing strategies of the two campaigns, with each candidate aiming to bolster their ticket's chances of winning the White House. As running mates often act as the \"attack dogs\" in campaigns, Vance and Walz are expected to adopt this role, aggressively going after the opposing ticket.","summary":"JD Vance and Tim Walz will meet on Tuesday night for their first, and possibly only, vice presidential debate.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/vice-presidential-debate-watch-live-jd-vance-tim-walz-1962307","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2485078/jd-vance-tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 22:49:25","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":258133728,"title":"Tim Walz, JD Vance to face off in U.S. VP debate. Here’s what to expect","text":"Tim Walz and JD Vance will face off on the debate stage Tuesday evening in a matchup that both their parties are hoping will demonstrate their vice-presidential candidate’s ability to connect with voters in battleground states that will play a critical role in deciding the U.S. election in November. The debate, hosted by CBS News in New York, will kick off at 9 p.m. Eastern. “They will both be trying to connect with those key Midwestern voters, that’s part of why each one of them was chosen,” said Matthew Lebo, a specialist in U.S. politics at Western University in London, Ont. “Thinking about especially male voters in those key Midwestern swing states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.” Those states swung Republican when former president Donald Trump won the 2016 election, and in 2020 they helped put President Joe Biden in the White House. Tuesday’s matchup could have an outsized impact. Polls have shown Trump and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close contest, giving added weight to anything that can sway voters on the margins, including the impression left by the vice presidential candidates. It also might be the last debate of the campaign, with the Harris and Trump teams failing to agree on another meeting. The role of a presidential running mate is typically to serve as an attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket, arguing against the opposing presidential candidate and their proxy on stage. Both Vance and Walz have embraced that role. Walz, the 60-year-old Democratic governor of Minnesota, has embraced his folksy, plain-spoken demeanour since he joined the ticket earlier this summer. He’s leaned into his Midwestern roots and the title “coach Walz” from his former football coach days. The strategy has seen him garner high favourability in polls but he will be facing a formidable opponent in Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio. The 40-year-old has become a mainstay on cable news shows since he was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate in July. Formerly a Trump critic, Vance was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022 after becoming one of the former president’s loudest supporters. Before entering the political sphere, Vance rose to fame with the 2016 publication of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” The Republican campaign released a video ahead of the debate to show Vance’s “hillbilly energy.” In the video, which features photos from his childhood, Vance talked about jobs disappearing from communities and the sense of hopelessness that left behind. Both men are expected to play on their working-class narratives during the debate to give credibility to their party’s plans for the economy and inflation. Political experts have said Harris dominated the presidential debate last month by prodding Trump into tirades that strayed far from his intended goals of focusing on immigration and the economy. Aaron Kall, the director of debate for the University of Michigan, said it’s unlikely Vance will fall for the same strategy, and he expects Tuesday night’s debate will lean more into policy. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be barbs. Walz was given credit for coining the label “weird” to describe his Republican opponents and the attack has stuck to Vance, with numerous viral videos and memes targeting the senator’s past comments and encounters with voters. “They really couldn’t be more diametrically opposed, kind of like Harris and Trump,” Kall said. “I think there’s going to be a lot of fireworks, given their personalities.” —With files from the Associated Press","summary":"The debate hosted by CBS News will give Vance and Walz the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10789338/walz-vance-debate-us-election/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930150944-20240930130952-03a1191df12ec809fa351d51ded9f4d701da7a714a461d6a9fcf1c24c3f5c182_97e538.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 22:48:28","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.368},{"id":258134262,"title":"Kamala Harris' \"60 Minutes\" interview to air on Oct. 7, Trump declines","text":"Kamala Harris' \"60 Minutes\" interview to air on Oct. 7, Trump declines \"60 Minutes\" announced a primetime election special will air on Oct. 7 with Vice President Kamala Harris, who will sit down with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker.

Slotkin’s first vote in Michigan was for herself — making her the carpetbagger she calls opponent Mike Rogers","text":"DETROIT — The first time Rep. Elissa Slotkin, 48, voted in Michigan was in 2018 — and it was a vote for herself, in her first run for Congress. The Democrat has branded her Republican opponent in this year’s Senate race, Mike Rogers, a carpetbagger, given his recent Florida residency after he retired from Congress. But as the race heats up — both in polling and spending — Republicans believe questions about Michigan ties can be turned around on Slotkin. “Elissa Slotkin lied about being a small-business owner, a farmer and where she lives,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Maggie Abboud told The Post. “The only thing Michiganders can count on Slotkin doing is lying about every aspect of her life.” The Slotkin-Rogers contest has tightened over the last month. Slotkin herself admits the race is a dead heat and says her polling shows that in Michigan, the Kamala Harris candidacy is “underwater.” In 2018, during her first congressional run, it was Slotkin who was called the carpetbagger. She had no sooner moved back to Michigan than she announced plans to run for Congress. After being born in New York in July 1976, Slotkin moved to the Holly, Mich., home where she now lives. After graduating Cranbrook prep school in suburban Detroit, Slotkin studied at Cornell University, then grad school at Columbia. From there she did stints with the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon. Her time in national security spanned from George W. Bush through Barack Obama. Slotkin left the government in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump was inaugurated president. In July that year, she announced her candidacy for Michigan’s 8th District. But the next month, Slotkin still took a homestead exemption on her condo in Washington, D.C. She quit taking it after her opponent called it out. These days Slotkin takes a farming tax credit at the Holly home — as recently as last month — despite doing no farming there. After years of portraying herself as a farmer and a friend to farmers, Slotkin was passed over by the Michigan Farm Bureau, which gave its 2024 endorsement to Rogers. Slotkin’s grandfather bought the land in 1956 as a cattle farm. So the tax credit is literally grandfathered in, despite the fact cattle haven’t roamed there since Jimmy Carter was president. “She sure paid her property taxes in Washington, DC, all those years,” Rogers previously told The Post when asked about the exemption. “She doesn’t take her credit there. But she took one here on the backs of law enforcement and firefighters and schools.” The agricultural zoning saves Slotkin about $2,700 annually in property taxes. The nationally watched Michigan Senate race could decide who controls Congress’ upper chamber. Despite its importance, Axios calls Slotkin-Rogers “America’s quietest toss-up Senate race.” The contest will get louder in the weeks to come, as former FBI special agent Rogers tries to overcome a four-to-one fundraising disadvantage. The Senate Leadership Fund, controlled by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, will contribute $22.5 million to the Rogers cause, its first investment in Michigan in 2024. Another super PAC, the Great Lakes Conservative Fund, has pledged $8 million to help Rogers. The Detroit Regional Chamber PAC had endorsed Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats, in their 2018 and 2020 races against John James. And it endorsed Slotkin in past House races. But this time around, with the Senate race tightening, chamber head Sandy Baruah says, “Slotkin or Rogers? Either way, Michigan wins.” Slotkin and Rogers will debate Oct. 8. Election Day is Nov. 5.","summary":"DETROIT — The first time Rep. Elissa Slotkin, 48, voted in Michigan was in 2018 — and it was a vote for herself, in her first run for Congress.

Donald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk were all sued Friday for allegedly causing Haitians “from Florida to California” to suffer from emotional distress, harassment, and threats of violence. The federal defamation lawsuit, filed in Miami, accuses Vance of being the hoax’s “ringleader,” with him spreading unfounded rumors even after he was told by Springfield’s city manager there was no truth to them. The lawsuit has demanded compensatory and punitive damages in a jury trial. “No one in this country is above the law, not even the president or former president of the United States,” the lawsuit said. “Nobody is entitled or has the right to defame an entire group of people, putting their lives in danger, uprooting their daily lives by publicly spurring lies and falsehoods against them.” The lawsuit was first reported by the Springfield News-Sun and was obtained by the Daily Beast on Tuesday. The lawsuit detailed the hoax’s timeline, which began with racially-charged rumors in right-wing circles that went mainstream after Trump repeated the rumors as fact during his Sept. 10 debate with Kamala Harris. “They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump declared in primetime. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” The Office of the Haitian Diaspora is the group behind the lawsuit. In it, they pulled out old comments from Trump where he allegedly showed “racial animus against Haitian immigrants.” That included his quip from a White House meeting in 2017 when he bizarrely allegedly stated that Haitians “all have AIDS,” as well as his infamous comment a year later where he allegedly said Haiti was among a group of “s---hole countries.” Both comments were denied at the time. The lawsuit claims Musk contributed to the defamation of Haitians when he posted on Sept. 8, “Apparently, people’s pet cats are being eaten.” Others to be sued by group included Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA), who posted and deleted a gross tirade against Haitians; Dave Yost, the Republican Attorney General of Ohio; Donald Trump Jr., who allegedly spread the debunked rumor on Fox News; and Bernie Moreno, the GOP’s U.S. Senate candidate in Ohio. The lawsuit called on defendants to stop making false claims about the Haitian community. Trump, Vance, and their associates have gone quiet on the hoax in recent days, however the lawsuit suggests the damage is already done. The hoax spread so far that it led to the brief closure of schools, government offices and hospitals as bomb threats rolled in after the debate. “The Defendants’ false statements and lies about Haitian migrants are not protected speeches,” the lawsuit states. “They are hate speeches, designed to defame and put the lives of Haitian migrants in danger.” In another line, the lawsuit claimed the group’s comments weren’t just insulting, but were made with the intent to cause real harm to the Haitian community. “The falsehoods were not only baseless, but were intended to harm the reputation and integrity of the Haitian migrants and their community,” it said.","summary":"Mike Segar/ReutersA nonprofit is biting back against the MAGA group who spread baseless rumors that Haitian immigrants were swiping and eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. \n\nDonald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk were all sued Friday for allegedly causing Haitians “from Florida to California” to suffer from emotional distress, harassment, and threats of violence. \n\nThe federal defamation lawsuit, filed in Miami, accuses Vance of being the hoax’s “ringleader,” with him spreading unfounded rumors even after he was told by Springfield’s city manager there was no truth to them.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/haitian-group-sues-donald-trump-jd-vance-and-elon-musk-over-pet-eating-conspiracies","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2991,w_5318,x_0,y_237/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1727820987/2024-09-11T133555Z_826085923_RC2DY9AN1RU2_RTRMADP_3_USA-SEPT11-NEW-YORK_eejepi","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 22:36:56","author":"Josh Fiallo","authors":["Josh Fiallo"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.547},{"id":258133108,"title":"Rudy Giuliani's Daughter Says She Lost Her Aging Father to Donald Trump: 'I've Been Grieving'","text":"Rudy Giuliani's daughter Caroline is urging Americans to be wary of former President Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential election after seeing her father's life \"crumble\" because of his and Trump's relationship. In a new essay for Vanity Fair published on Sept. 30, Caroline, an outspoken Democrat, implored the public not to vote for Trump after seeing what happened to her father and announced her support for Vice President Kamala Harris in the high-stakes presidential race. \"After months of feeling the type of sorrow that comes from the death of a loved one, it dawned on me that I’ve been grieving the loss of my dad to Trump. I cannot bear to lose our country to him too,\" Caroline, 35, wrote in part for Vanity Fair. \"I know that some people may question whether I truly care about my father, since another Trump presidency could theoretically mitigate some of the problems he’s facing,\" she continued, seemingly referring to her father's latest legal woes. \"It distresses me to think that my dad might even wonder this. But if you zoom out, Trump being the president was the worst thing that ever happened to my dad, to my family, and to our nation’s modern history.\" \"The consequences will only be more severe — and irreversible — a second time around,\" Caroline warned. A Los Angeles-based writer and filmmaker, Caroline is one of Giuliani's two children with his second wife, Donna Hanover. Last week, Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and ex-personal lawyer for Trump, was officially disbarred in Washington, D.C., for his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani, once heralded as \"America's Mayor\" who sought to unite the country in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, served as Trump's personal lawyer during the frenzy following the 2020 election, which led to a near-unraveling of his legal career. \"Watching my dad’s life crumble since he joined forces with Trump has been extraordinarily painful, both on a personal level and because his demise feels linked to a dark force that threatens to once again consume America,\" Caroline wrote for Vanity Fair. Writing that she and her father share \"a cartoonishly complicated relationship,\" Caroline emphasized that she loved her father, 80, and \"the last thing I want to do is hurt him, especially when he's already down.\" Acknowledging that time with parents is finite, she added that that fact \"makes this the most difficult piece I’ve ever written,\" but underscored that the weight of the upcoming race is \"bigger than any of us.\" Giuliani's daughter voiced her support for Harris and Tim Walz's ticket and said she'd \"never forget\" the night her father confided in her that he was thinking about becoming Trump's lawyer, where she begged him to reconsider. \"I held nothing back. I voiced all of my concerns about Trump’s open racism, rampant misogyny, and total lack of empathy... For the rest of that night, I held onto hope that a daughter’s emotional entreaty might actually sway a father,\" Caroline wrote.

Caroline also openly supported President Joe Biden and Harris’ campaign in the 2020 race, and backed several Democratic candidates over the years, including Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama. Over the summer, she posted an undated photo of herself and Harris on Instagram with an adamant message. \"PLEASE join me in uniting behind @kamalaharris to stop Trump. IT’S NOW OR NEVER,\" she said.","summary":"Caroline Giuliani endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election in a new essay","url":"https://people.com/rudy-giuliani-daughter-says-she-lost-aging-father-donald-trump-8721544","image":"https://people.com/thmb/aat690ECyMD7ObSqp1ckPXpSETc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(691x402:693x404)/Rudy-Giuliani-daughter-100124-2-ca5289a7abee4d3494e86cb30ed46a6f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 22:35:24","author":"Janine Henni","authors":["Janine Henni"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":258133884,"title":"World Leaders react to Iran’s attack on Israel","text":"Many world leaders have called for a de-escalation following Iran’s large-scale air attacks on Israel on Tuesday, with many expressing deep concern over the prospect of a broader regional conflict. Iran fired several waves of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening in a sudden assault that raised the likelihood of a direct all-out war between two of the most powerful militaries in the Middle East. Iran said the attack was in response to the Israeli killing of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Hezbollah, an Iran ally, is facing an ongoing war with Israel which has killed dozens of Hezbollah leaders in the past week. Israel has also announced a ground invasion of Lebanon to battle Hezbollah. Israel pounded Lebanon from the air throughout Tuesday and continued the attacks even after the Iranian missile attacks. The Israeli military said Iran fired about 180 missiles during its assault, a significant barrage that forced Israelis to take cover in bomb shelters for more than an hour, according to the New York Times. Many of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s air defence system, while some fell in central and southern Israel, according to the Israeli military. Tehran has confirmed it launched dozens of missiles at Israel and warned of additional attacks if Israel retaliates. The attack has generated a reaction from the international community. Both the UN and EU have reiterated calls for a ceasefire, with the UN Security Council due to meet tomorrow, Wednesday. Reactions The White House said US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are monitoring the Iranian attack against Israel from the White House Situation Room and receiving regular updates from their national security team. Mr Biden said he directed the US military to aid Israel’s defence against Iranian attacks and shoot down missiles that are targeting Israel, adding that the US is “fully, fully, fully supportive” of Israel. Based on current information, Mr Biden said the attack appears to have been “defeated and ineffective”. In a televised briefing, White House National Security Advisory Jake Sullivan said the US was working with Israel to make sure there were consequences for Iran for the attack. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada unequivocally condemns Iran’s reckless attack against Israel. “We fully support Israel’s right to defend itself against this attack. And, we repeat our call for de-escalation across the region, for the safety of all civilians,” he wrote on X. BBC reported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have said Iran “made a big mistake tonight, and will pay for it.” The Israeli PM said Iran “does not understand” his country’s “determination to retaliate” against its enemies. “They will understand,” he said. “We will stand by the rule we established: whoever attacks us – we will attack” them. The EU condemned Iran’s missile strike on Israel in the “strongest terms”, according to European Commission Vice President Josep Borrell. In a post on X, Mr Borrell said: “The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks spiralling out of control. An immediate ceasefire across the region is needed.” The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer also condemned Iran’s attack on Israel “in the strongest terms” during a call with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon. ALSO READ: Iran attacks Israel with missiles Mr Starmer “expressed the UK’s steadfast commitment to Israeli security and the protection of civilians,” a spokesperson of the Prime Minister told BBC. Meanwhile, Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian has defended Iran’s attack tonight and warned Israel in a post on X. Mr Pezeshkian said that based on Iran’s “legitimate rights” with the purpose of “peace and security for Iran and the region”, a “decisive” response “in defence of Iranian interests and citizens” was given to Israel. He said Israel must know that “Iran is not a war-monger but will firmly stand against any threat.” Mr Pezeshkian warned Israel that tonight’s attack was just a “glimpse” of Iran’s capabilities. He warned Israel not to “engage in conflict” with Iran. The Palestinian group Hamas, which has been at war with Israel for over a year, praised Iran’s “heroic” missile attack on Israel. In a statement, the group, which is fighting Israel in Gaza, said “We congratulate” the rocket launches carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran “against wide areas of our occupied lands.”","summary":"Iran fired several waves of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening in a sudden assault that raised the likelihood of a direct all-out war in the Middle East.\n\n\nThe post World Leaders react to Iran’s attack on Israel appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.","url":"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/741109-world-leaders-react-to-irans-attack-on-israel-2.html","image":"https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-01-233057.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-01 22:34:43","author":"Ayo Akerele,Kabir Yusuf","authors":["Ayo Akerele","Kabir Yusuf"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.221}]}
