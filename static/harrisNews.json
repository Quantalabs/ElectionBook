The villages and the towns and the architecture — everything you see is charming and it’s just a simpler way of life.”\n\n“It’s clean,” she continued. “Everything here is just better — the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here.”\n\nThe former daytime talk show host also shared she and de Rossi might get married again in the UK. The two tied the knot in August 2008 at their home in Los Angeles.\n\n“The Baptist Church in America is trying to reverse gay marriage,” she explained. “They’re trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it. Portia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we’re going to get married here.”\n\n“I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are,” she added. “I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences.”\n\nDeGeneres later hinted at a possible return to show business, though said it would not be in the format of her former talk show, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”\n\n“I just don’t know what that is yet,” she said of what her potential next move. “I want to have fun, I want to do something. I do like my chickens but I’m a little bit bored.”\n\nDeGeneres, 67, and de Rossi, 52, sold their two-bedroom, two-bathroom beach bungalow in Montecito, Calif., for $5.2 million in March. \n\nShe has given glimpses of her new farmhouse life in England, also changing up her look by dying her hair brunette.\n\nDeGeneres recently showed her support for fellow comedian Rosie O’Donnell — despite their past beef — after Trump threatened to revoke O’Donnell’s citizenship, despite not having the power to do so.\n\nShe shared a screenshot of O’Donnell’s clapback, writing, “Good for you @rosie.”","summary":"\"I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences,\" the comedian said.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/07/20/celebrity-news/ellen-degeneres-finally-confirms-she-fled-the-us-over-trump/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/108484939.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 00:55:55","author":"Antoinette Bueno,mliss1578","authors":["Antoinette Bueno","mliss1578"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.292},{"id":343544098,"title":"From West Philly To The World: Dion Ringgold’s Blueprint For Impact","text":"Dion Ringgold\nCourtesy of Jemima Olu-Owotade\n\nDion Ringgold is a man who holds numerous titles. A quick scroll through his Instagram feed will prove as such, likely leaving you to deal with a range of feelings from inspiration to empowerment. Whether he’s leaning into his editorial expertise as he jets across the country to interview some of the world’s biggest stars or juggling professional obligations while being an active husband and father, Ringgold is a multifaceted individual through and through. As the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of InClub Magazine, a national media publication that explores the intersection of faith and culture, Ringgold continues to position himself and InClub Magazine as changemakers —a foundation that the outlet was built upon from its inception.\n\n“I started InClub Magazine because I hated the media, more specifically the way my community was portrayed,” Ringgold told ForbesBLK. “To be completely transparent, it was the limited representation of the wider diaspora of the experiences and interests of Black Americans — I did not see myself or my interests highlighted. There were very few places that I saw, myself, a Black kid from West Philadelphia who loved art, film, and reading.”\n\nNearly a decade in its existence, it’s no secret that Ringgold’s leadership and creative direction have continued to expand InClub’s reach. While the cultural hub has amassed a reputation for insightful, quality content along with an ever-growing roster of A-list cover stars such as Tamika Mallory, Taylor Rooks, and more, it started much differently.\n\n“InClub was a mustard seed, an idea that the best way to change something is from the inside out. We are on a mission to show there is more to our experiences and interests and that we are not monolithic. At our inception, a book I read by Blake Mycoskie, titled Start Something That Matters, was what watered this seed, to be more than just another magazine, but a place for partnership with those doing good in the world. Now, it has evolved into a generational media outlet that gives a voice and place for those who contribute to the culture and expand its rich fullness beyond what mainstream often limits it to. We initially envisioned it as a quarterly publication targeted at college students, but it has since evolved into a monthly digital publication available in 13 global markets. And we’re just getting started. We plan to be carried in more Barnes & Noble locations and Urban Outfitters across the country and launch in the U.K. and South Africa.”\n\nDion Ringgold interviewing sports journalist Taylor Rooks.\nCourtesy of IKhene Images\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe extension of InClub’s reach isn’t solely a testament to Ringgold’s leadership, but also to his faith. It’s something that, according to the mogul, is embedded in every facet of the platform, internally and externally.\n\n“My faith colors and informs how and why I do everything, including why we’re so audacious to believe we can be as big and as culturally valuable as publications like Vogue. It also shows up in the culture we’ve built, from honoring everyone, regardless of their role, being accountable to one another, and being environmental architects. We set the tone and temperature wherever we are, whether it’s a red carpet, on a set for a press junket, or at Starbucks. It is also partly the reason we refrain from spreading salaciousness, or negative gossip or rumors. It feels lazy and does not sit right with me.”\n\nDion Ringgold pictured with his wife Teona Ringgold and children along with former Vice President ... More Kamala Harris and former Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\nCourtesy of The White House Official Photography\n\nWhile InClub is just a year shy of its 10th anniversary, Ringgold’s tenure as an entrepreneur surpasses that. Throughout his journey, one of the most significant lessons he has learned is the importance of creating sustainable systems that support the ecosystem of a thriving business.\n\n“What I’ve learned is that systems build business, and culture makes them relevant. Many intelligent individuals possess ideas and charisma; they are great hustlers. However, to be a successful business owner, you must excel at building systems and fostering a strong company culture. If your only goal is to make money, hustle away. But if your goal is to build something that will matter, something that will be part of the cultural zeitgeist, shape narratives, and spark conversations. You need the right people, the right systems, and the right culture. Hustling makes you money for that trip to the Maldives, while systems and culture build a harvest that your entire staff and their children can live off of.”\n\nDion Ringgold and actress Blake Lively at the press junket for the 2024 film \"It Ends With Us.'\nCourtesy of Dion Ringgold\n\nAs Ringgold continues to carve out his own lane within the media industry, he will continue to embrace growing and learning, something he feels is essential for every leader.\n\n“I define leadership as the ultimate servant of the vision, direction, and safety of those he is leading. At InClub, we don’t call ourselves a team; we refer to ourselves as a crew. A team can achieve success based on the efforts of one individual. In a Crew, everyone must row at the same pace and in unison to reach their destination. I have realized that people and how they feel while rowing are equally as important as the mission of getting to the other side and winning. I am a mission-driven leader, and I am still learning and growing, which is the responsibility of every leader.”\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"As the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of InClub Magazine, Ringgold continues to position himself and InClub Magazine as changemakers.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kennethjwilliamsjr/2025/07/20/from-west-philly-to-the-world-dion-ringgolds-blueprint-for-impact/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/687d613939199062238b8488/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1078,607,x0,y642,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 21:43:23","author":"Blake Mycoskie,Contributor,Kenneth J.

Dershowitz told “Sunday Agenda” host Lidia Curanaj he also was contacted by the WSJ over a letter he reportedly sent, which the outlet couldn’t produce. (RELATED: It Takes Just One Word For Scott Jennings To Describe America’s Reaction To WSJ Trump-Epstein Story)\n\n“I’ll probably be called as a witness in the case, because they also called me, and they said that you wrote him a letter with a mock cover of Vanity Fair,” Dershowitz told Curanaj. “And I said, ‘I may have, I don’t remember, this was 23 years ago. Just send me a copy of the letter with my signature and I’ll tell you whether it’s authentic or not,’ and they said they couldn’t do it.”\n\n“And so they published the story without authenticating it with me, and that will be an important point in trying to prove malice, so I suspect I will be a witness if this case ever goes to trial,” Dershowitz continued.\n\nTrump secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet March 19, 2024, for defamation over comments made by “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos during a contentious March 10 appearance by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. CBS settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, drawing criticism from inside the company.\n\nSome of President Donald Trump’s supporters have criticized him and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Epstein files, with the president being “ratioed” on Truth Social over the matter, Newsweek reported. Trump fired back at the critics in a Wednesday post on Truth Social and also defended Bondi in a lengthy statement posted July 12 on the site.\n\nTrump announced in a Thursday night Truth Social post he was asking Bondi to seek permission from the courts to release the grand jury transcripts from the Epstein case. Bondi said in a response posted on X that DOJ would move to unseal the documents Friday.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Demokratët, siç pritej, po bëjnë shumë bujë, por republikanët në Uashington po bëhen gjithnjë e më nervozë.\n\nNjë përditësim i rrallë mbi shëndetin e Presidentit Trump. Paralajmërime për një rënie të tregut të aksioneve për shkak të kërcënimeve të tij për të shkarkuar kryetarin e Rezervës Federale të SHBA-së.\n\nDërgimi i raketave Patriot në Ukrainë. Akuza të reja për një “komplot të administratës Obama” për të organizuar një grusht shteti pas zgjedhjeve të vitit 2016.\n\nKëto janë vetëm disa nga titujt kryesorë që Trump dhe ekipi i tij kanë gjeneruar gjatë dy javëve të fundit. Por asnjëri prej tyre nuk ka dominuar për më shumë se një cikël të vetëm lajmesh. Pse? Dosjet Epstein.\n\nUashingtoni nuk pushon së foluri për financierin e ndjerë: a u vra i dënuari për abuzues seksual për të mbrojtur sekretet e shumë të njohurve të tij të famshëm? Ku është lista e klientëve të tij? Kush fshihet pas mbulimit të të dhënave? Çfarë di vërtet Trump dhe sa e ngushtë ishte miqësia e tij me Jeffrey Epstein ? A është e gjitha kjo e mirë për demokratët?\n\nSado që përpiqet, presidenti nuk po gjen dot një mënyrë për ta ndryshuar bisedën. “Më pas do t’i duhet të pushtojë Groenlandën”, thotë një republikan i acaruar. Një simpatizant i Trumpit psherëtin: “Është një rrëmujë e madhe”.\n\nDy javë pasi Departamenti i Drejtësisë dhe FBI-ja publikuan një memo ku thuhej se Epstein vrau veten ndërsa ishte në burg në pritje të gjyqit dhe se nuk kishte “listë klientësh”, historia ka marrë hov. Tani, si republikanët ashtu edhe demokratët po shprehin shqetësim për një mbulim të dyshuar të ngjarjes.\n\nPër bazën e Trump, është testi i pastërtisë që tregon nëse je rob i establishmentit apo i përgatitur të ngrihesh kundër tij. Besimi në komplotin e Epstein është rasti i provës në mospëlqimin e tyre për shtetin e thellë. Për republikanët e shkollës së vjetër, përgjigjja e Trump ndaj tij është një gabim i padetyruar që paraqet rrezik elektoral. Për demokratët, është përleshja e parë politike në njëfarë kohe që e ka bërë presidentin të djersitet.\n\nAjo që në shikim të parë mund të dukej një histori mjaft e pavlerë, është shndërruar në një valle politike të ndërlikuar me potencialin për të ndikuar në zgjedhjet thelbësore të mesit të mandatit për në Kongres vitin e ardhshëm.\n\nPasi kaloi ditë të tëra duke e përshkruar temën si “TË MËRZITSHME”, Trump më në fund ndryshoi qëndrim të enjten përballë ankesave në rritje nga ana e tij. Në përgjigje të asaj që ai e quajti “sasinë qesharake të publicitetit” që iu dha Epstein, ai urdhëroi prokuroren e tij të përgjithshme, Pam Bondi, të “paraqiste çdo dëshmi përkatëse të jurisë së madhe” (fjala “relevante” potencialisht po bën shumë punë aty).\n\nKy njoftim erdhi pasi një raport i Wall Street Journal pretendonte se përpara se të bëhej president, Trump kishte kontribuar me një letër të turpshme në librin e 50-vjetorit të ditëlindjes së Epstein. Në përgjigje, një Trump i tërbuar, i cili e denoncoi letrën si të rreme, ka ngritur një padi për shpifje prej 10 miliardë dollarësh kundër gazetës, botuesit të saj, Dow Jones, dhe kompanisë së saj mëmë, News Corp (botues i The Times dhe The Sunday Times). Një zëdhënëse e Dow Jones tha: “Ne kemi besim të plotë në rigorozitetin dhe saktësinë e raportimit tonë dhe do të mbrohemi me forcë kundër çdo padie.”\n\nPor problemi i presidentit me Epsteinin nuk ka mbaruar ende: pyetjet po shtohen. Ndërsa vlerësimet e miratimit të Trump mbeten të qëndrueshme midis republikanëve, sondazhet mbi trajtimin e tij të dosjeve Epstein nuk janë pikërisht optimiste.\n\nNjë sondazh i YouGov/Economist zbuloi se 81 përqind e atyre që votuan për Kamala Harris dhe 59 përqind e votuesve të Trump besojnë se qeveria po fsheh provat e Epstein. Kur votuesve iu kërkua të dinin se sa Trump dinte për krimet që Epstein mund të ketë kryer përpara se akuzat të bëheshin publike, 40 përqind e të anketuarve thanë “shumë”, ndërsa 17 përqind thanë “disa”.\n\nRepublikanët e zgjedhur privatisht kanë frikë nga pasojat në kutitë e votimit. “Ata e ndiejnë se është diçka ekzistenciale”, thotë një republikan i lartë. “Ata po përpiqen të gjejnë një mënyrë për t’u mbuluar, pasi nuk i besojnë Trumpit. Ata nuk besojnë se ai nuk është në dosje dhe nuk besojnë se ai nuk do të ndryshojë mendje.” Kryetari i Dhomës së Përfaqësuesve, Mike Johnson, ka bërë thirrje që dosjet të publikohen, ndërsa Thomas Massie, një kritik republikan i Trumpit, po u bën thirrje votuesve të “vazhdojnë presionin, po funksionon… Ne duam të gjitha dosjet”.\n\nTrump nuk ka nevojë të kërkojë rizgjedhje vetë, ndryshe nga senatorët, kongresmenët dhe kongresmenet që i shohin me nervozizëm zgjedhjet e mesmandatit. Nuk ka kaluar pa u vënë re në Partinë Republikane që JD Vance, nënkryetari dhe favoriti për të pasuar Trumpin, mbajti një profil të ulët javën e kaluar ndërsa presidenti sulmoi mbështetësit e tij “të dobët” të Maga-s për ngritjen e shqetësimeve të tyre. “Ai filloi të fliste vetëm kur u shndërrua në një grindje me median”, vëren një burim i brendshëm republikan.\n\nNdërkohë, opozita po mëson të përqafojë skandalin Epstein. Demokratët e lartë më parë kishin nxituar të hidhnin poshtë zërat për një komplot, por gjatë ditëve të fundit kanë filluar të bëjnë thirrje për publikimin e dosjeve.\n\nVazhdimësia e skandalit deri më tani rrjedh pjesërisht nga perceptimi se Trump dhe ekipi i tij kanë ndryshuar anë.\n\nPresidenti ishte ndër ata që ngritën shpresat e konspiracistëve të Epstein gjatë zgjedhjeve, duke sugjeruar se publikimi i më shumë dosjeve mund të ndodhte nën mbikëqyrjen e tij. Kreu i FBI-së, Kash Patel, foli më parë për një konspiracion të Epstein, ndërsa Bondi u shfaq në Fox News duke pretenduar se lista e klientëve – të cilën ajo tani thotë se nuk ekziston – ishte në tavolinën e saj/ The Sunday Times","summary":"Çfarëdo që të përpiqet presidenti, ai nuk mund ta ndalojë Magën të flasë për dosjet.

Gavin Newsom; Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear have all visited the Palmetto State, which favored President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by almost 20 percentage points. \n\nIn May, Tim Walz and Wes Moore, the governors of Minnesota and Maryland, respectively, both spoke at the state’s Democratic convention.\n\nSo, what’s drawing these nationally prominent Democrats to a state with a Republican governor, GOP supermajorities in both houses of the state Legislature, two Republican U.S. senators, and just one Democrat in its seven-member congressional delegation?\n\nIf you ask Newsom, it’s part of a soul-searching quest to connect with small town, conservative America.\n\n“I think it’s really important for Democrats that we spend time in parts of our states, parts of our country, that frankly, we haven’t spent enough time in, and so that’s why I’m here,” he said July 8 at a coffee shop in Florence, South Carolina.\n\nBut one reporter asked Newsom ahead of his visit if the real reason he was going to South Carolina is because it is likely an early state in the 2028 Democrat presidential primaries—the first steppingstone toward the presidency.\n\n“You don’t know that, and I don’t know that, and so that’s why I would suggest it’s what it is,” he said in an apparent deflection.\n\nDemocrats made South Carolina the first state in their primary cycle in February 2023 ahead of then-President Joe Biden’s bid for reelection—taking the place of the traditional leadoff states of Iowa and New Hampshire, which are predominantly white. About 25% of the population of South Carolina is black. \n\n“This calendar does what is long overdue,” then-Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison explained at the time. “It puts black voters at the front of the process in South Carolina. It keeps Nevada, where Latinos have been building power … and it adds Michigan, the heartland, where unions built the middle class of this nation. And Georgia, the forefront of the New South.”\n\nBiden himself wrote a letter to the DNC in December 2022 calling for a new caucus schedule to reflect racial diversity. \n\nWeeks after the letter, in January 2023, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a veteran of South Carolina politics with great sway in the state’s Democratic Party, said that he was “all in for President Biden,” who had “demonstrated in these two years … that he is deserving of reelection.”\n\nFor context, the 2020 endorsement of Biden by Clyburn, who is black, preceded Biden’s first victory in that year’s primary election cycle, as he had already lost in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.\n\nThe redrawn 2024 schedule created a favorable situation for the incumbent Biden against any potential Democrat challengers. \n\nIn fact, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questioned its fairness at the time. \n\n“President Biden didn’t do well [in New Hampshire]; he came in fifth. So, they took New Hampshire, and they kicked it out of first place. And now they’re going to say—they’re saying that they’re going to completely remove the delegates from New Hampshire,” Kennedy explained in an April 2023 interview.\n\nHe would leave the Democrat race in October of that year, accusing the party of rigging the system against him.\n\nNow, if South Carolina remains the first primary in the 2028 cycle, a Democrat presidential hopeful would be wise to seek Clyburn’s endorsement—since it did so much to help carry Biden to the White House in 2020.\n\nClyburn already appears to have taken a shine to Newsom.\n\nIn fact, Clyburn introduced Newsom as one of “these candidates that are running for president,” which is a narrative Newsom has shied away from.\n\n“I feel good about his chances,” he told the South Carolina crowd after praising him.\n\nAsked later on CNN whether he thought the term-limited California governor would make a good candidate for president, Clyburn replied, “Well, I was with him in Camden this evening, and I went there expecting a modest crowd on a Tuesday afternoon, and this was in fact his, I think, sixth or seventh stop of the day.”\n\nHe added, “It was an overflowing crowd of people, some of whom I have never seen at an event like this before, and so I do think people are listening to him, and they are listening to the Democratic Party in a big way.” \n\nIt still remains to be seen whether South Carolina stays as the first state in the Democrat presidential cycle.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin spoke on the topic in Charleston, South Carolina, shortly before his nomination as chairman in February.\n\n“It’s not up to the next DNC chair to put their thumb on the scale in any way, shape, or form. It’s not one person’s decision. It is the party’s decision,” Martin said. “Any state that wants to have their voice heard and make a bid for this will be heard.”\n\n“The calendar we put forward has to be rigorous, it has to be efficient, and it has to be fair … . It has to battle-test our nominees so we win, and it has to honor the great diversity of this party, and it has to honor the great traditions of this party.”\n\nNewsom’s office did not provide comment for this article.","summary":"For some reason, Democrats are flocking to deep-red South Carolina.

He always told truth to power and pulled no punches. We need more of that, not less,\" Walz wrote. CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" adding, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\" Failed Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams also applauded Colbert on social media, posting photos from her several appearances on the show.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called Colbert an \"extraordinary talent,\" and argued the cancellation of his show was not a coincidence, because the liberal late-night host had slammed Paramount's decision to settle with Trump. \"CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO,\" the progressive senator wrote. Sens.

The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Baran did so last year.\n\nOPM approved on Sept. 8, 2024, Baran’s transition from a commissioner on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to become deputy assistant secretary for waste and minerals management at the Department of Energy. He went from making $165,300 annually to $193,819 annually.\n\nBaran took President Donald Trump’s offer of “deferred resignation,” which allows bureaucrats to receive their paychecks through Sept. 30 without doing any work, as an incentive to leave the government early. Exchange Monitor reported on Feb. 20 that Baran accepted the offer.\n\nBaran is likely to receive his paycheck for about 7 months without doing work, costing the taxpayer approximately $113,061.08. \n\nWhy Did Baran Move to the Department of Energy?\n\nThe Biden White House renominated Baran to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a quasi-independent federal agency that oversees the use of radioactive materials, in 2023. Baran had held a seat on the five-person panel overseeing the agency since 2014, when President Barack Obama nominated him. Trump renominated him in 2018.\n\nBaran’s nomination died secretly in the Senate, according to the Huffington Post. About four senators who caucused with Democrats, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., either planned to vote against Baran or refused to pledge their votes for him, a source told the Huffington Post.\n\nThe Breakthrough Institute, a California-based think tank that took credit for Baran’s failure to get reconfirmed, faulted Baran for having “paid lip service” to supporting nuclear energy technologies but argued that his “voting record on the commission tells a different story.”\n\n“Baran has consistently voted against proposals to revise [commission] rules to accommodate advanced reactor technology,” the institute claimed. “He was the sole vote on the commission against changes to [commission’s] siting rules that would allow small advanced reactors to be deployed at retiring coal plants and against changing emergency planning requirements to reflect reduced accident risk associated with advanced reactors.”\n\nThe institute further noted that Baran joined the commission after serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under then-Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., whom the institute described as a long-time opponent of nuclear power.\n\n“It is my job to focus on nuclear safety and security,” Baran told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2017 at his reconfirmation hearing. “It is not my job to weigh in on the pros and cons of the merits of nuclear power.”\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nBaran’s decision to take another government job after losing his reconfirmation battle is emblematic of the process by which political appointees “burrow in” to the federal bureaucracy. \n\nWhile Baran decided to take Trump’s buyout offer, many “burrowers” have not.\n\nA recent poll found that 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case, Trump.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nAlthough Baran is no longer working in the government, his decision to “burrow in” nonetheless cost taxpayers more than $100,000. \n\nNeither Baran nor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission nor the Department of Energy responded to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\n\nThis is the latest in a series on bureaucrats burrowing in. Part one covers eight appointees. Part two focuses on a former Russiagate adviser who works at the Federal Aviation Administration. Parts three and five expose a former lawyer for then-Sen. Kamala Harris who advised Harris during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and who now works at the Defense Department. Part four focuses on a former Biden campaign lawyer who now works at the Justice Department.","summary":"Jeff Baran, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, failed to secure enough support in the Senate to keep his job when his term expired...

The incident she recalls, allegedly involving Mr Trump, happened in 1993. She spoke about it before last year’s presidential election, and is now bringing attention to it again amid the renewed controversy around the Epstein files.\n\n“They were best friends,” Ms Williams claimed of Mr Trump and Epstein during an interview with CNN today.\n\n“I dated Jeffrey for a period of, more or less, I think about four or five months. And the only friend that he would mention every time we saw each other, or had a phone conversation, was Donald. They were very close, and they were up to no good.\n\n“It was such a long time ago. But that was his bro, that was his wingman.”\n\nCNN host Brianna Keilar noted that her network had spoken to three friends of Ms Williams, who said she had spoken to them about the alleged incident contemporaneously, many years before Mr Trump entered politics.\n\n“I want to point out that I was polygraphed, before I did all this, by one of the most renowned examiners in the world,” Ms Williams said.\n\nShe also pointed to Epstein’s testimony in interviews with the author Michael Wolff.\n\n“Jeffrey confirmed to Michael what the two of them did to me,” she claimed.\n\n“I was dating Jeffrey, and he was always talking about Donald. It was his bestie and everything. And he was joking about how Donald thought I was hot, or whatever,” she told Ms Keilar, recalling the alleged incident.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s stop in and see him.’ So we went up to his office at Trump Tower. And within a couple of minutes, Donald was outside his office, and his hands were all over me. They were on my breasts, they were on my butt, they were on my hips, up and down.\n\n“The two of them kept having a normal conversation.”\n\nMs Williams spoke of how “shocking” the experience was.\n\n“When that happens in broad daylight, in an office, with assistants walking back and forth, you’re in shock,” she said.\n\n“If it happens in a dark alleyway, you fight back. But when it’s brazen like that, which is Donald Trump’s forte, you go into shock.\n\n“So I froze. And it was over very quickly, it was a few minutes. And then we got back in the elevator, and Jeffrey’s energy had changed.”\n\nShe said Epstein was “enraged” by the incident and, shouting, asked, ‘Why would you let him do that?’ once they were outside the building. Her interpretation was that Epstein expected her to resist more and was angry when she “froze”.\n\nThis all echoes an interview Ms Williams gave during last year’s election campaign, which Mr Trump’s spokespeople dismissed as “fake” at the time.\n\n“The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him,” said Ms Williams.\n\n“And his hands were just on me, and didn’t come off. Then the hands started moving, and they were on the side of my breasts, down to my hips, back down to my butt, back up. They were just on me the whole time. And I ... sorry. I froze.”\n\nMs Williams said she believed the incident was “some kind of weird, twisted game” between Mr Trump and Epstein, whom she said allegedly “smiled at each other” while it was happening.\n\n“It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by Kamala Harris’s campaign,” Karoline Leavitt, who is now Mr Trump’s White House Press Secretary, said at the time.\n\nAccording to Ms Williams, Mr Trump sent her agent a postcard later in 1993, after the alleged incident. On its front was an aerial view of his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“Stacey: Your home away from home. Love, Donald,” he wrote on the back.\n\nMs Williams alleged she was “berated” by Epstein after the encounter.\n\n“Jeffrey and I left and he didn’t look at me or speak to me, and I felt this seething rage around me, and when we got down to the sidewalk, he looked at me and just berated me, and said why did you do that?” she recounted.\n\n“He made me feel so disgusting, and I remember being so utterly confused.\n\n“I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways. I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me.\n\n“And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat.”\n\nMr Trump has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct since he entered politics a decade ago. In 2023, however, he was found liable in civil court for sexually assaulting the author E. Jean Carroll, and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages.\n\nThe judge in that case found that Mr Trump “digitally raped Ms Carroll”. Mr Trump appealed the ruling, but that appeal was denied earlier this month.\n\nThe President’s personal conduct came into sharper focus, this past fortnight, after his hand-picked officials in the Justice Department and FBI reneged on their previous promises to release the so-called “Epstein files”.\n\nMr Trump was a friend of Epstein for about 15 years, but no evidence has ever emerged to implicate him in the sex trafficker’s crimes.\n\nThis week The Wall Street Journal published a story alleging Mr Trump wrote Epstein a gaudy birthday message in 2003. The note, printed inside an outline of a naked woman, said Mr Trump hoped “every day (may) be another wonderful secret”.\n\nThe President has called the note “fake” and launched defamation proceedings against the newspaper.\n\nHe has also instructed the Justice Department to release a small number of Epstein-related documents.\n\n“I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval,” said Mr Trump today.\n\n“With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!”\n\nGrand jury testimony only involves evidence offered in an attempt to move a prosecution forward, which in this case means it will almost exclusively relate to Epstein and his chief co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThat testimony will not implicate Epstein’s unindicted co-conspirators, and indeed the Justice Department has requested, in its filing, that third parties remain unidentified.","summary":"An ex-girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein has spoken out again about her claim that Donald Trump “groped” her during a meeting with the sex trafficker.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/in-shock-exgirlfriend-of-jeffrey-epstein-again-accuses-donald-trump-of-misconduct/news-story/dc66636496a3719ef82d7e8cb33e1d04?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9bc9245b6fc937169b3036b1dfb4bc32","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 14:34:20","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":343530622,"title":"Janet Jackson, 59, make surprise onstage  appearance with her beloved brothers as she and rarely seen son Eissa, seven, support them at The Jacksons gig in Reading","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: How Brits are being kicked out of their holiday homes in Spain by underground network of squatter gangs... and are POWERLESS to stop it\n\nNigel Farage pledges to tackle 'lawless Britain' with radical plan that could see offenders sent to jails in El Salvador\n\nMissing mother-of-three who vanished after running to a garage at 3.50am bought a bottle of wine and milk before disappearing - as police divers search nearby lake for clues\n\nShowing his true colours?

The couple separated soon after the birth of her son.\nSpeaking about Eissa last year she told The Guardian: 'The most important thing I've done, the biggest thing I've done, is become a mother, and it's had a beautiful impact on my life,'\nShe continued: 'I wanted to have three children, but thought, \"I should stop there, that's probably all I can handle.\" Because you have to give all of yourself,' she explained.\n'Obviously, you have to work, but you don’t come first anymore. Your life completely changes. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything,' she said.\nIn another interview, the Rhythm Nation hitmaker echoed the same statement, calling motherhood 'the most amazing thing she's ever done.'\nShe also revealed the strict rules she has given her son, saying she is determined to make sure he has a normal childhood after she and her famous brothers were thrust into the spotlight at a young age.\nJanet amassed huge success since starting out as a child star in the 1970s and while she is 'so thankful,' she has insisted she will not be putting Eissa on the same path. \n\nView gallery\n\nJackie, 74, and Marlon, 68, then introduced their sister who made her way on stage looking effortlessly stylish in an oversized plaid jacket and flared jeans\n\nView gallery\n\nLater taking to her Instagram Stories Janet posted clips of the show as she gushed over her sibling's performance\n\nView gallery\n\nJanet shared a slew of clips as her brother's entertained the festival crowd\n\nView gallery\n\nJanet became a mother at age 51 with her ex-husband Wissam Al Mana.

She’s not black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,' Janet said.\n'Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days.

And you know who’s just loving it? President Donald Trump! It wasn’t long before he jumped on his favorite online platform, Truth Social, to give a round of applause for the end of Stephen Colbert‘s show, acting like he’d scored a huge win.\n\n“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,” Donald Trump posted, turning his attention to other late-night hosts. “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”\n\nColbert, known for coming up with “truthiness” back in 2005, is now caught in a situation that feels a bit like that.\n\nCBS is saying they pulled the plug because of a badly flourishing (if at all) business, like the tough competition at that time of night, and not enough money coming in from ads. They’re insisting it was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” But not everyone’s buying it.\n\nFans and even some political insiders who are usually careful with what they say aren’t convinced.\n\nWas It Really Just Business? Fans Aren’t Convinced\n\nColbert announced on Thursday that The Late Show will end in May 2026, calling it not just the finale of his own run but the end of the Late Show franchise. “I’m not being replaced. This is all just going away.”\n\nAnd while CBS chalked it up to dollars and cents, the backdrop is undeniably political. \n\nParamount, CBS’s parent company, recently settled a $20 billion lawsuit from Donald Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, paying out $16 million.\n\nBREAKING: After CBS’s 60 Minutes posted the unedited version of its October interview with Kamala Harris online, President Trump has doubled the value of his lawsuit against them from $10 billion to $20 billion.\nCBS is cooked! pic.twitter.com/rRI8qruI1N\n— I Meme Therefore I Am (@ImMeme0) February 9, 2025\n\nSome say it’s just a strange coincidence, but critics are raising their eyebrows. Even Stephen Colbert couldn’t resist poking fun at it, saying the whole deal stinks like “a big, fat bribe” in one of his latest opening bits.\n\nAnd CBS is trying to seal the deal with Skydance, a company that David Ellison, who happens to be the son of a well-known Donald Trump supporter, Larry Ellison, is in charge of. Now, for this merger to go through, they’re going to need the thumbs up from the Trump administration. Can you fathom the web this is spinning?\n\nDoes Donald Trump’s Comedy Kill List Include Late-Night?\n\nDonald Trump’s victory post comes off as more of a tally than actual commentary.\n\nHe’s had beef with late-night TV guys for a while now, pushing for Stephen Colbert to get the boot way back in 2024 and always pointing out what he sees as network bias towards the left.\n\nNow, with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel also on his naughty list, and Jon Stewart’s Daily Show under the same Paramount umbrella, the vibe is clear: go ahead and make jokes, but just don’t go too hard on the fun that makes him look bad. And let’s face it, most of the fun that comes out of American politics, especially since January 2025, does make Trump look bad. \n\nTrump destroys Jimmy Fallon at his Pennsylvania rally for the time when Fallon apologized for “humanizing” him during the 2016 election by messing up his hair on the Tonight Show.\n“How WEAK and PATHETIC is a guy like that?” pic.twitter.com/m3Wvl8pCf2\n— johnny maga (@_johnnymaga) September 24, 2024\n\nSo, what about Colbert?

That was due to Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine, who sided with all Democrats and two nominal independents in opposing the bill. \n\nTrump has praised Vance’s astuteness in the past, calling his vice presidential debate performance during last year’s election season “fantastic” and saying it “reconfirmed” his choice of a running mate. \n\nVance also cast the decisive vote in the Senate to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act early this month. That legislation will likely be a signature accomplishment of Trump’s second term in office. It provided billions of dollars for additional border security and defense spending, extended the Trump 2017 tax cuts, created a tax cut for taxes on tips, and created a federal school choice benefit, among other initiatives.\n\nThe vice president also cast two tie votes related to amendments to the legislation prior to its Senate passage. \n\nVance also protected the president’s agenda by casting the vote to table a resolution to effectively block Trump’s global tariffs. \n\nThe vice president has also made the adage “personnel is policy” a reality by casting the tiebreaking vote on the confirmation of Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense. Hegseth has proven to be a key Cabinet official in the second Trump presidency, spearheading a successful military recruiting initiative. \n\nThe influence of the vice president appears to be a far cry from the way Vice President John Nance Garner characterized the post when he was occupying it. Garner, who served under President Franklin Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941, was reported to have said the position was “not worth a bucket of warm spit.”\n\nBut now, in an era of fiercely divided electoral politics, the vice presidency appears to be more important than ever. Indeed, Vance’s immediate predecessor, Kamala Harris, in four years cast more tiebreaking votes, 33, than any other vice president in history. That’s an even more astounding number when you consider that Harris served just one term in office. \n\nJohn C. Calhoun, who cast the second-highest number of tiebreaking votes at 31, served as vice president for nearly two full terms, beginning 200 years ago in 1825. Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence, cast 13 tiebreakers between 2017 and 2020.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance has emerged as an essential force in getting President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda across the finish line.

Steny Hoyer of Maryland told the Daily Mail in an interview. 'I think there are a number of leaders.'\n\nHoyer twice served as House Majority Leader under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He has served on Capitol Hill for over 43 years since 1981 and is the longest tenured Democrat in the House of Representatives. It's safe to say he's been around a while to witness the party in and out of power.\n\n'When you don't have the presidency...I can't remember a time when there was a leader,' he continued. 'So I think it's a collective leadership.'\n\nOther Democrats flat-out admitted there is no clear head of the party. \n\n'We don't have a counterpart in our party at the moment, because ... we're coming out of the last presidency,' Florida Democrat Rep. Jared Moskowitz told the Daily Mail. 'But no, we don't have a counterbalance at the moment.' \n\nThe Floridian, known for his cool Air Jordan sneaker collection, noted that when Trump's term expires in 2028, both parties will be left searching for new leadership, ostensibly ignoring the platform JD Vance will have after serving as vice president.\n\n'The Republicans, will be in the same boat, right?' Moskowitz said. Who will be the leader of the party? Because it won't be the president anymore.' \n\nIn addition to Jeffries and Schumer, there are a number of Democrats who have been floated as the next party boss.\n\nOn those lists are usually Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and occasionally, former VP Kamala Harris. \n\nPopular prediction sites Kalshi and Polymarket list Newsom as the most likely Democratic nominee for the 2028 presidential contest, AOC is listed as close second while former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg comes in third. \n\nDemocrats have indicated they want new faces steering the party.\n\nAccording to a June poll from Reuters/Ipsos, 62 percent of self-identified Democrats agreed that 'the leadership of the Democratic Party should be replaced with new people.' \n\nThat could be why Democratic candidate for New York mayor Zohran Mamdani, a self-declared democratic socialist, has been surging in the polls and landing countless TV interviews. \n\n'Zohran Mamdani, the new leader of the Democratic Party, supports 'the abolition of private property' and 'seizing the means of production,' Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana wrote this week. \n\n'But Washington Democrats are still cozying up to him. There's no doubt about it: the loon wing is running the show.'\n\nMamdani, 33, embodies a political archetype akin to former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, also a self-declared democratic socialist. \n\nThe young mayoral candidate has even caught the attention of the president. \n\n'It's finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,' Trump wrote recently on Truth Social.\n\nMamdani met personally with AOC, along with about 40 other Democratic lawmakers this week in D.C. \n\nThe meeting was an hour-long session on communicating and organizing hosted by AOC, the progressive leader of the 'Squad.'\n\nThe venue had to change because of high demand from lawmakers to sit in on the session, a Mamdani spokesperson said.\n\nOne longtime Democrat even likened Mamdani to Trump, saying they share a similar populist appeal. \n\n'Donald Trump and he both get out and they talk to people and they listen to people and they understand how people feel. And he's using social media the way that Donald Trump has,' Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan said.","summary":"As President Donald Trump has racked up a string of major policy wins in his six months, Democrats are stuck in a rut without a clear party leader, they admitted to the Daily Mail.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14912235/Watch-Democrats-squirm-theyre-grilled-whos-REALLY-leading-party-young-communists-rise-ranks.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/18/19/100439311-0-image-m-34_1752862571758.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/16/5218213374595581902/1024x576_MP4_5218213374595581902.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-20 12:47:20","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":343460262,"title":"New K-12 school focuses on promoting American principles, eliminating 'woke ideology'","text":"A new K-12 online school is focusing on promoting American principles and \"eliminating woke ideology.\" The president of the American Virtual Academy, Damian Creamer, told Fox News Digital that he wanted to provide an alternative to parents who were fed up with liberal ideology being taught in the classroom. \"We’re really focused on giving families an opportunity to put their kids in a school that is going to respect their values and make sure that we're teaching American principles and providing a different option to families out there than what they typically run across,\" Creamer said.

Creamer added that American Virtual Academy also emphasizes the importance of reading, writing, and math. \"They don't have to worry about what we're teaching in the school and how we're teaching things and that our values resonate with their values and, as the founder of the school, I had an opportunity to be really particular about how I was going to put this together, making sure that it took a lot of time to think about what is it exactly,\" he said. \"What we can do to support families throughout the country, make sure that their students coming to American Virtual Academy are going to excel academically, and they're going to get a great education, but also just eliminating all the woke ideology and the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion), the CRT (critical race theory), the transgenderism, all of that stuff right there.\" \"That's not anything that we teach,\" he concluded. There has been an uptick in parents choosing options outside their neighborhood school since 2020. Homeschool enrollment has increased since the coronavirus pandemic, indicating a growing trend of parents overlooking public schools. Several states have been responding to the trend of parents choosing alternatives to traditional public school settings by passing universal school choice legislation, allowing all children within the state an opportunity to access the school that fits their needs. Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition. PRESIDENT OF LARGEST TEACHERS UNION IN US DEFENDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DURING ANTI-ICE PROTEST IN LA New Hampshire is the latest state to pass universal school choice, joining a trend of states with Republican trifectas expanding education options for children. New Hampshire is the first state that passed the legislation that went for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. The Trump administration instituted a federal tax credit scholarship, giving individuals all across the country an opportunity to support school choice programs within their state, circumventing anti-school choice measures. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Corey DeAngelis of the American Culture Project told Fox News Digital that the growth of alternative education models is emblematic of a growing trend of parents being fed up with the traditional public school setting. \"The teachers union made their anti-American agenda obvious at their annual convention this month by passing resolutions that had everything to do with politics and nothing to do with education. The NEA passed resolutions that read like a declaration of war on the Trump Administration. Parents wants their children to get an education, not left-wing indoctrination,\" DeAngelis said. \"There are too many woke private schools that are just as bad – ideologically – as the government schools parents are fleeing. But the good news is that supply meets demand. New options like American Virtual Academy are sprouting up because most families want something else,\" he added.","summary":"New K-12 online school American Virtual Academy launched in 2020 provides education without DEI, CRT, or transgenderism teachings for $5,000-$6,000 per year across all 50 states.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/k-12-private-school-focuses-promoting-american-principles-eliminating-woke-ideology","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/931/523/homeschool-kids.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 12:00:03","author":"Joshua Nelson","authors":["Joshua Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":343446942,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Kamala, You're Fired!

Literally speaking, almost! \n\nSo, apparently, there’s a text thread that Fox News got their hands on, and it’s juicy, to say the least. It’s all in this tell-all book by Stephanie Wolkoff, called Melania and Me. According to the book, Melania Trump had some not-so-great things to say about Ivanka and Jared during Donald Trump‘s first time in the White House, which started in 2016.\n\nShe’s supposed to have sent Wolkoff a message saying, “You know how they are snakes.”\n\nThis gives us a bit of insight into what might’ve been going on with the family dynamics back then. \n\nWolkoff isn’t new to sharing juicy gossip.\n\nShe also let slip about “Operation Block Ivanka,” which was reportedly Melania’s sneaky plan to keep Ivanka, often referred to as the First Daughter, out of the spotlight during President Donald Trump’s first swearing-in ceremony.\n\nOn top of all this, Wolkoff claims that Melania Trump was getting fed up with Ivanka and Jared taking the limelight and saw them as people just looking out for themselves, with no respect for the collective Trump family name.\n\nALSO READ: Forget Botox—This is the Real Reason Melania Trump Stays Ageless at 55!\n\nMelania Trump’s cutting nickname for rival step-daughter Ivanka told in new bookhttps://t.co/sNZbT83L6R pic.twitter.com/316ijslleV\n— MirrorUSNews (@MirrorUSNews) February 24, 2024\n\nStephanie Grisham, who used to be Melania Trump’s right-hand person, didn’t hold back when she heard about Wolkoff’s book.

In a joint statement, co-CEO George Cheeks, CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach, and CBS Studios president David Stapf insisted the decision was based purely on declining revenues and shifting industry dynamics.\n\n‘This was a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,’ they said. ‘It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.’ \n\nBut critics aren’t buying it.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders fired off a blistering statement on X: ‘Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late-night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.’\n\nSenator Ed Markey went further, suggesting possible political interference: ‘If the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company’s editorial decisions, the public deserves to know.’\n\nTrump wasted no time celebrating the move on his Truth Social account gleefully writing, ‘I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once-great.’\n\nThe post prompted a visceral response from Colbert’s fellow hosts. Kimmel posted to Instagram: ‘Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.’\n\nThe timing of Colbert’s cancellation has only deepened suspicions.\n\nOn July 2, Paramount agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit. On July 15, Colbert railed against it on national television. On July 17, Paramount pulled the plug on the show despite it still being the top-rated program in its timeslot, beating both Fallon and Kimmel in linear and digital viewership.\n\nIndeed, while CBS cited financial strain, the numbers have painted a more complicated picture.\n\nAdvertising revenue for The Late Show has dropped 40% since 2018 from $121.1 million to $70.2 million last year, according to ad firm Guideline.\n\nBut the show still drew a nightly average of 1.9 million viewers this past season, more than any other late-night rival with Colbert has maintaining a massive digital following on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nBut CBS insists the business no longer adds up.\n\nOne former TV network executive said The Late Show had been hemorrhaging money and losing up to $40 million annually because of shrinking ad dollars and rising production costs. \n\n‘Fifteen years ago, a show like The Tonight Show could earn $100 million a year,’ they said. ‘Now, they’re money pits.’ \n\nCBS had already begun gutting its late-night schedule. The Late Late Show with James Corden was scrapped in 2023. After Midnight was canceled earlier this year. \n\nColbert will end in May of next year with CBS planned to fill the Late Show slot with reruns of the primetime hit Tracker.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He’s hosted his show since 2003. \n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I’m not doing this anymore?’ It’s a very complicated thing … I’m not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nColbert’s cancellation is the latest flashpoint in what critics call a mounting war against media critical of Trump.\n\nThe president has long sparred with journalists and entertainers, launching lawsuits against The New York Times, CNN, 60 Minutes, and ABC News. \n\nEarlier this week, his administration slashed funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS and has openly mused about pulling licenses from outlets he considers ‘fake news.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA prominent group in Hollywood is demanding a comprehensive investigation into Paramount&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hollywood Group Calls for Bribery Investigation Following Colbert&#8217;s Cancellation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hollywood-group-calls-for-bribery-investigation-following-colberts-cancellation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hollywood-entity-wants-bribery-investigation-after-Colberts-cancelled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 09:12:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":343401608,"title":"Editorial: Shelter cost an insane tax hit","text":"Bay State taxpayers are forking over an average of $3,823 a week for each family in emergency shelter.\n\nThat’s according to MassFiscal after the Herald reported earlier this week the FY25 bill for the shelter system was just shy of $900 million — with the total expected to increase to nearly $1 billion.\n\nThis comes as the state’s Right to Shelter Law has drawn illegal immigrants to our state in record numbers. Yes, the law has been around for decades, but nobody on Beacon Hill was smart enough — or should we say fiscally conservative enough — to dump that law during the crisis at the Southern Border.\n\nWhy is Massachusetts always the destination of choice for anyone and everyone seeking a handout?\n\n“The fact that we are paying an average of $3,823 a week for each family in emergency shelter without scrambling for deep reforms of our emergency shelter law and other generous benefits is insulting to the taxpayers of our state,” said Paul Diego Craney, executive director of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance.\n\nHe’s right, and he keeps making excellent points, such as:\n\n“If you don’t think the average working Massachusetts family could use that kind of money each week after working hard and paying their taxes their whole lives, as opposed to just arriving here, you’re an elitist,” Craney added. “The taxpayers deserve much more from their elected officials than continuing to use their money to fund a system filled with corruption and report after report of the bad actors plaguing the system.”\n\nTaxpayers are on track to shell out more than $1.8 billion over the last two fiscal years on shelters housing homeless families with children and pregnant women. An influx of migrants in 2022, 2023, and 2024 spiked demand, but caseloads have fallen significantly since January.\n\nIn a report from Healey’s budget and housing offices, officials said the tally for state spending on the shelter system in fiscal year 2025 was up to roughly $897.5 million as of July 10. Total spending for the fiscal year that ended June 30 is projected to hit $970 million, the report said.\n\nThe Healey administration spent $758 million on direct shelter costs, including for the actual locations to house people, to pay National Guard troops to service those sites, and sites to screen people before they enter the system, according to the report.\n\nAnother $98.5 million has been spent on HomeBase, a housing assistance program that has seen a five-fold increase in demand since Healey took office in 2023.\n\nEnough is enough. The governor inherited this insanely progressive Right to Shelter Law and she has been quoted saying she pleaded with then-President Joe Biden to cap the migrant overflow coming in from Mexico and elsewhere.\n\nYet, our delegation was too busy trying to secure their jobs in a Kamala Harris administration to care about what was going on at home. How did that work out?\n\nWhat is left is a budget-busting system fraught with waste and crime. Many say that’s anecdotal, but even a few illegal immigrant rapes and drug deals is too many.\n\nWe can’t be the dumping ground for all of America’s ills.

The Kentucky Republican said this is a 'historical scandal.","summary":"The Democratic party plans to dissect what exactly went wrong in the 2024 presidential election - with two glaring exceptions in the analysis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14922227/oversight-DNC-2024-election-autopsy-report.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/20/05/100464369-0-image-m-62_1752984153380.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/27/8406618015794874638/1024x576_MP4_8406618015794874638.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-20 04:56:33","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":343317730,"title":"Powerful Hollywood entity call for investigation into bribery after Stephen Colbert cancellation","text":"A powerful Hollywood group has called for a sweeping investigation into Paramount Global following the abrupt cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America wants New York Attorney General Letitia James to launch a probe into whether the cancellation is related to Colbert's criticism of the network's capitulation to President Trump.\n\nIn a fiery joint statement from the the East and West Coast arms of the Writers Guild, the union suggests the scrapping of the show may amount to political bribery. \n\nThe guild alleges Paramount's decision to axe the show after Colbert accused the company of bribing Donald Trump to advance its proposed $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media was not merely coincidence, but potentially 'a dangerous capitulation to political pressure.'\n\n'Cancelations are part of the business,' the WGA said, 'but a corporation terminating a show in bad faith due to explicit or implicit political pressure is dangerous and unacceptable in a democratic society.' \n\nThe union's statement referenced the $16 million settlement Paramount reached earlier this month with Trump over a contentious 60 Minutes segment involving Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. \n\nThe agreement was widely derided by media watchdogs as a dubious payoff and has already prompted an ongoing investigation by the California State Senate.\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has also demanded a federal probe into whether the settlement constituted an illegal attempt to curry favor with the White House.\n\nThe cancellation came just two days after Colbert slammed the settlement live on air, calling it 'a big fat bribe' and openly questioning whether the payment was made to grease the wheels for the merger's approval.\n\nWGA leaders argue that segment may have cost Colbert his job.\n\n'Given Paramount's recent capitulation to President Trump,' the union wrote, 'we have significant concerns that The Late Show's cancelation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump Administration.' \n\nThe guild called on 'elected leaders to hold those responsible to account' and vowed to pursue every possible legal and political remedy to support its members and protect media freedom. \n\nParamount executives deny any political motive. In a joint statement, co-CEO George Cheeks, CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach, and CBS Studios president David Stapf insisted the decision was based purely on declining revenues and shifting industry dynamics.\n\n'This was a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,' they said. 'It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.' \n\nBut critics aren't buying it.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders fired off a blistering statement on X: 'Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late-night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.'\n\nSenator Ed Markey went further, suggesting possible political interference: 'If the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company's editorial decisions, the public deserves to know.'\n\nTrump wasted no time celebrating the move on his Truth Social account gleefully writing, 'I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once-great.'\n\nThe post prompted a visceral response from Colbert's fellow hosts. Kimmel posted to Instagram: 'Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.'\n\nThe timing of Colbert's cancellation has only deepened suspicions.\n\nOn July 2, Paramount agreed to settle Trump's lawsuit. On July 15, Colbert railed against it on national television. On July 17, Paramount pulled the plug on the show despite it still being the top-rated program in its timeslot, beating both Fallon and Kimmel in linear and digital viewership.\n\nIndeed, while CBS cited financial strain, the numbers have painted a more complicated picture.\n\nAdvertising revenue for The Late Show has dropped 40% since 2018 from $121.1 million to $70.2 million last year, according to ad firm Guideline.\n\nBut the show still drew a nightly average of 1.9 million viewers this past season, more than any other late-night rival with Colbert has maintaining a massive digital following on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nBut CBS insists the business no longer adds up.\n\nOne former TV network executive said The Late Show had been hemorrhaging money and losing up to $40 million annually because of shrinking ad dollars and rising production costs. \n\n'Fifteen years ago, a show like The Tonight Show could earn $100 million a year,' they said. 'Now, they're money pits.' \n\nCBS had already begun gutting its late-night schedule. The Late Late Show with James Corden was scrapped in 2023. After Midnight was canceled earlier this year. \n\nColbert will end in May of next year with CBS planned to fill the Late Show slot with reruns of the primetime hit Tracker.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. \n\n\"I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,\" Kimmel told Variety in 2022. \"And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.\"\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nColbert's cancellation is the latest flashpoint in what critics call a mounting war against media critical of Trump.\n\nThe president has long sparred with journalists and entertainers, launching lawsuits against The New York Times, CNN, 60 Minutes, and ABC News. \n\nEarlier this week, his administration slashed funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS and has openly mused about pulling licenses from outlets he considers 'fake news.","summary":"A powerful Hollywood entity is demanding a state investigation after CBS abruptly canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, just days after the host accused Paramount of bribing Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14921939/Powerful-Hollywood-entity-call-investigation-bribery-Stephen-Colbert-cancellation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/20/01/100462461-0-image-a-10_1752971564108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 01:15:49","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":343312450,"title":"Rosie O'Donnell goes off on 'madman' Trump and Colbert's cancelation in scathing TikTok attack","text":"Rosie O'Donnell launched a passionate TikTok attack against \"madman\" President Donald Trump and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show on Friday and Saturday.

Paramount also recently settled a lawsuit with Trump over the editing of CBS' \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Trump also commented on the cancellation of Colbert's show, posting the following statement to his Truth Social account: \"I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired.

She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he wrote on Truth Social. O'Donnell made a litany of allegations about the president's health in her TikTok rants, claiming that he's \"physically ill\" and is suffering from dementia.

Because this madman, this mentally incapacitated, physically ill, mentally ill man is spiraling out of control,\" she stated. \"His dementia is out of control.

Earlier in the week, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll similarly found that the party as a whole has an approval rating of 40% – considerably lower than the Republican Party’s 48% approval rating found by the same poll. Nor can Democrats necessarily rely on any GOP infighting to redound, in seesaw-like fashion, to their own benefit; for all the Sturm und Drang generated by the “Epstein files” affair, President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have actually increased among Republicans this month.\n\nThe issue for Democrats is that their current unpopularity is not a byproduct of the political scandals of the day or the vicissitudes of Trump’s polarizing social media feeds. Rather, the problem for Democrats is structural – and it requires a rethink and a reboot from soup to nuts. As this column argued last November, it is clear that Barack Obama’s winning 2008 political coalition – comprising racial and ethnic minorities, young people and highly educated whites – has completely withered. “Obamaism” is dead – and Democrats have to reconcile themselves to that demise. At minimum, they should stop taking advice from Obama himself; the 44th president was Kamala Harris’ top 2024 campaign trail surrogate, and we saw how that worked out.\n\nIn order for the party to rise up anew, as has often happened throughout American history following a period of dominance from a partisan rival, Democrats are going to have to move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievances that have so greatly alienated large swaths of the American people on issues pertaining to race, gender, immigration, and crime and public safety. And the good news, for conservative Americans who candidly wish the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, is that Democrats seem completely incapable of doing this.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old recent winner of New York City’s much-discussed Democratic mayoral primary, is a case in point.\n\nThe Ugandan-born Shiite Muslim Mamdani is a democratic socialist, but he is better understood as a full-fledged communist. That isn’t hyperbole: One merely needs to consider his proposed policies for New York City and review his broader history of extreme far-left political rhetoric. Mamdani won the primary, and is now seeking the mayor’s office, on a genuinely radical platform: support for citywide “free” bus rides, city-owned grocery stores, a full rent freeze on certain low-income units, outright seizure of private property from arbitrarily “bad” landlords, race-based taxation (an assuredly unconstitutional proposal), a $30 minimum wage and more. A true Marxist, Mamdani has called for the “abolition of private property.” And he has something of a penchant for quoting Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” too.\n\nBut Mamdani’s communism is only part of his overall political persona. He also emphasizes, and trades in, exactly the sort of woke culture warring and intersectional identity politics that have defined the post-Obama Democratic Party. Mamdani is a longstanding harsh critic of Israel who has long trafficked in, and had long refused to distance himself from, antisemitic rhetoric such as calls to “globalize the intifada.” Most recently, he also opposed Trump’s decision to have the U.S. intervene in last month’s Israel-Iran war, condemning it as a “new, dark chapter” that could “plunge the world deeper into chaos.” (In the real world, there were zero American casualties, and the bombing run was followed promptly by a ceasefire.) In many ways, Mamdani singlehandedly encapsulates the unholy “red-green” alliance of Marxism and Islamism.\n\nThere is, to be sure, nothing good down this road for denizens of New York City. If Mamdani wins this fall, expect a massive exodus of people, businesses and capital from the Big Apple – probably to the Sun Belt. But even more relevant: There is nothing good down that road for the national Democratic Party as a whole. In order to demonstrate that the party has learned anything from its 2024 shellacking and its current abysmal standing, it will have to sound and act less crazy on the tangible issues that affect Americans’ day-to-day lives.\n\nThat isn’t happening. If Mamdani’s rise is representative – and it may well be, especially as other far-left firebrands like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, continue to make outsize noise – then Democrats seems to be moving in the exact opposite direction: full-on Marxism and woke craziness. If the party continues down this path, it will experience nothing but mid- to long-term political pain. But as one of the aforementioned conservatives who wishes the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, I’m not too upset about that.","summary":"To succeed they are going to have to 'move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievance'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/commie-mamdani-shows-democrats-cant-quit-obamaism/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hammer-and-sickle-ussa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:38:57","author":"Josh Hammer","authors":["Josh Hammer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":343327750,"title":"Still mad at Trump over Epstein files?

I am, too.\n\nNo, I’m not telling you not to complain, not to vent your anger.\n\nI disagree with the decision, too. I urged President Donald Trump to reconsider and either release the Epstein files or name a special counselor. \n\nAnd the good news is, he has responded. He just ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all grand jury testimony. That’s a smart decision. \n\nBecause this Epstein list controversy was obscuring the list that matters most: the long, superhuman list of achievements that Trump has accomplished to start his second term.\n\nThis Epstein controversy has been obscuring the fact that this has been the greatest start to any presidency in history. And a remarkable past two weeks. And even a remarkable past 24 hours. Trump is hitting home runs.\n\nExcept for Epstein.\n\nFor once The New York Times quoted me correctly and accurately. The New York Times just featured a story on how Trump’s base and biggest MAGA media backers feel about the Epstein story.\n\nThey quoted Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon, Laura Loomer, Gen. Mike Flynn, Alex Jones, Roseanne Barr and yours truly. \n\nThe Times basically reported that TV and radio host Wayne Allyn Root wants Trump to release the Epstein files … but Root remains Trump’s biggest backer and recognizes all his remarkable success. \n\nTrue and true.\n\nI’m not alone. According to the latest CNN and Quinnipiac polls, Trump’s approval has gone up with Republican voters since the Epstein controversy. Trump’s approval in one poll rose from 86% to a remarkable 88%, and in the other from 87% to a stunning 90% approval.\n\nSo, it turns out while many in the MAGA movement want and expect Trump to release the Epstein files, it turns out the vast majority also acknowledge and recognize his remarkable one-in-a-billion achievements.\n\nSo, I’d like everyone who is still angry at President Trump over the Epstein decision to just think about what America would look like right now, and what your lives would look like right now, if Kamala Harris had been elected.\n\nThink long and hard about this one. And then thank God for President Trump – with or without the response you want with the Epstein files.\n\nIf Trump had lost, and Kamala had won, here is what America would look like:\n\n– Our nation might very well be in “climate change lockdown” right now. \n\n– You might be stuck in a “15-minute city,” where you’d need permission from government to drive more than 15 minutes from your home.\n\n– There’d be no “drill, baby, drill,” so your electric bill, gas bill and fuel for your car would all be at record levels. Inflation would be surging right now, destroying the great American middle class.\n\n– There would be no “Big Beautiful Bill,” so we’d all be hit with the biggest tax increase in history. More money for Big Brother and less for you.\n\n– Forget “no tax on tips” and “no tax on OT” and the new $6,000 extra tax deduction for seniors. Without Trump, they’d all be gone.\n\n– Instead of 2 million new job gains for American-born citizens and a loss of 500,000 jobs for foreign-born citizens since Trump took over, we’d have the opposite. Corporations would have signs up saying “We Don’t Hire Americans.”\n\n– You know the $15 trillion of investment President Trump just got for America from foreign governments? It would be gone. Who’d be dumb enough to invest in Kamala’s America? No one.\n\n– Instead of most companies in America eliminating DEI, the entire economy would be based on DEI. White people – no jobs for you. But if you’re black or brown and lesbian with no qualifications, you’re the new CEO!\n\n– We’d be experiencing massive censorship and banning of conservatives and critics of government. Free speech would be a thing of the past. Social media posts would result in SWAT teams invading your home to arrest you in front of your children for a tweet.\n\n– Conservatives and MAGA patriots would be declared “domestic terrorists.”\n\n– The odds are conservative talk radio and TV would be declared “hate speech” and taken off the airwaves.\n\n– Boys winning championships and scholarships in girls’ sports would be celebrated and encouraged. \n\n– So would transgender brainwashing in school, and transgender hiring, and transgenders in the military. \n\n– Remember Rachel Levine and Sam Brinton – two butt-ugly guys wearing wigs, dresses and high heels? They’d be in control of your life.\n\n– The untested, deadly, experimental COVID vaccine would be mandatory. The unvaccinated would be branded as pariahs, unable to live normal lives in America.\n\n– Our border would be in ruins – we’d be witnessing a massive foreign invasion like no one has ever seen in world history, with tens of millions of illegal aliens waiting at the border to cross into America and bankrupt our country.\n\n– We’d already be in World War III. \n\n– And few young Americans would be willing to join a U.S. military infested with woke ideology, and transgenders in your foxhole. So, Democrats would already have a military draft reinstated, so Kamala could send your sons and daughters to the Russian front.\n\n– America would be a one-party state with rigged elections for the rest of all time. \n\n– And “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” would still be a hit.\n\nThank God for President Trump. \n\nSo, disagree with him on releasing the Epstein files all you want. I want them released, too.\n\nBut he’s still the G.O.A.T. The best we’ve ever had in my lifetime, and my educated guess says he’s also the best we’re ever going to get in the future.\n\nAnd the alternative would have been the end of America; the end of freedom and free speech; the end of capitalism; the end of free and fair elections; and the end of YOU and me.\n\nAre you still mad at Trump? Maybe a little, but you’ll get over it. Think about the alternative. \n\nNow thank God for Trump.","summary":"'This controversy has been obscuring the fact that this has been the greatest start to any presidency in history'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/still-mad-trump-epstein-files-get-it/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/epstein_trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:34:41","author":"Wayne Allyn Root","authors":["Wayne Allyn Root"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":343309248,"title":"Was axing of Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show' part of culture war or ratings decline?","text":"\"Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late-night host, slams the deal.

It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\nWhether or not politics were at play, the late-night format has been struggling for years, as viewers increasingly cut the cable TV cord and migrate to streaming. Younger viewers, in particular, are more apt to find amusement on YouTube or TikTok, leaving smaller, aging TV audiences and declining ad revenues.\n\nAmericans used to religiously turn on Johnny Carson or Jay Leno before bed, but nowadays many fans prefer to watch quick clips on social media at their convenience. Advertising revenue for Colbert's show has dropped 40% since 2018 - the financial reality that CBS said prompted the decision to end “The Late Show” in May 2026.\n\nOne former TV network executive said the programme was a casualty of the fading economics of broadcast television.\n\nFifteen years ago, a popular late-night show like The Tonight Show could earn $100m (€86m) a year, the executive said. Recently, though, The Late Show has been losing $40m (€34m) a year, said a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe show's ad revenue plummeted to $70.2m (€60.4m) last year from $121.1m (€104.1m) in 2018, according to ad tracking firm Guideline. Ratings for Colbert’s show peaked at 3.1m viewers on average during the 2017-18 season, according to Nielsen data. For the season that ended in May, the show’s audience averaged 1.9m.\n\nComedians like Colbert followed their younger audiences online, with the network releasing clips to YouTube or TikTok. But digital advertising did not make up for the lost TV ad revenue, the source with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe TV executive said reruns of a hit prime-time show like Tracker would leave CBS with “limited costs, and the ratings could even go up\".\n\n The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is just the latest casualty of the collapse of one of television's most durable formats. When America's The Late Late Show host James Corden left in 2023, CBS opted not to hire a replacement.

The timing has sparked speculation among fans who view the cancellation through the lens of Paramount's pending merger and the company's recent settlement of a lawsuit with Trump over a 60 Minutes report.Trump accused 60 Minutes of editing its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in last year's presidential election, in a \"deceitful\" way, which the program denied.In a statement on Thursday, the network dismissed speculation and said the late-night talk show was being canceled for financial reasons. Those reasons are associated with Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which requires Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval under the Trump administration. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.In response to the Late Show's cancelation, Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday: \"I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.\"Last Monday, Colbert called out Paramount over its $16 million settlement with Trump during the show.\"While I was on vacation, my parent corporation Paramount paid Donald Trump a $16 million settlement over his 60 Minutes lawsuit,\" Colbert said in a monologue on The Late Show. \"As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended, and I don't know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company. But just taking a stab at it, I'd say $16 million would help.\"O'Donnell's nearly 10-minute TikTok post also included unsubstantiated claims about Trump's mental and physical health, calling him \"mentally incapacitated\" and alleging he suffers from dementia. She framed Colbert's cancellation as part of systematic silencing of Trump critics, comparing immigration enforcement to \"his own personal Gestapo.\"Trump, who is 79 years old and is the oldest person to serve a second term, has faced intensifying scrutiny over his age and cognitive fitness. Although, his physician declared him \"fully fit\" after a comprehensive physical that included a perfect score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the White House announced on Thursday that he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).What People Are SayingRosie O'Donnell via TikTok on Friday: \"I think Americans should stand up and say, no way. You're not going to silence us. You don't have the right to silence us. You never did. And you never will. We, the people, have the right to speak up against atrocities, which are happening on a daily basis, ICE, his own personal Gestapo—what will it take, America? What will take? He's gonna arrest every artist that disagrees with him and pretty much every artist does. Whether or not they're brave enough to say it is another thing.\"She added: \"How long do all of the voices against this horrific administration have in terms of their careers and ability to make money? Because this madman, this mentally incapacitated, physically ill, mentally ill man is spiraling out of control.\"President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social last Saturday: \"Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"Stephen Colbert reacted to The Late Show's cancellation during Thursday's episode: \"Before we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night. Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May,\" he said as the audience booed. \"Yeah, I share your feelings. It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced, this is all just going away, and I do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners. I'm so grateful to the Tiffany Network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home. And of course I'm grateful to you, the audience, who have joined us every night.\"What Happens NextThe Late Show's conclusion will mark the end of an era for political late-night television, though CBS has not announced replacement programming.O'Donnell's citizenship status remains unchanged despite Trump's threats, as presidential powers to revoke citizenship are constitutionally limited and face significant legal challenges.","summary":"The comedian says Trump orchestrated the late-night host's show cancellation to silence critics after he threatened her revoke her U.S. citizenship.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/rosie-odonnell-blasts-trump-colbert-show-cancellation-2101255","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686494/rosie-odonnell.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6133822d9a5f7bb67383c921db1ac64c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 18:36:15","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":343265776,"title":"Communist Zohran Mamdani Shows Democrats Can’t Quit Obamaism","text":"It has been painfully obvious, ever since the presidential election last November, that the Democratic Party’s brand is in tatters.\n\nThis week, a Quinnipiac University poll revealed that congressional Democrats have a minuscule 19% approval rating—an all-time low in the history of that particular poll. Earlier in the week, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll similarly found that the party as a whole has an approval rating of 40%—considerably lower than the Republican Party’s 48% approval rating found by the same poll. \n\nNor can Democrats necessarily rely on any GOP infighting to redound, in seesaw-like fashion, to their own benefit; for all the Sturm und Drang generated by the “Epstein files” affair, President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have actually increased among Republicans this month.\n\nThe issue for Democrats is that their current unpopularity is not a byproduct of the political scandals of the day or the vicissitudes of Trump’s polarizing social media feeds. Rather, the problem for Democrats is structural—and it requires a rethink and a reboot from soup to nuts. \n\nAs this column argued last November, it is clear that Barack Obama’s winning 2008 political coalition—comprising racial and ethnic minorities, young people, and highly educated whites—has completely withered. “Obamaism” is dead—and Democrats have to reconcile themselves to that demise. At minimum, they should stop taking advice from Obama himself; the 44th president was Kamala Harris’ top 2024 campaign trail surrogate, and we saw how that worked out.\n\nIn order for the party to rise up anew, as has often happened throughout American history following a period of dominance from a partisan rival, Democrats are going to have to move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievances that have so greatly alienated large swaths of the American people on issues pertaining to race, gender, immigration, and crime and public safety. And the good news, for conservative Americans who candidly wish the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, is that Democrats seem completely incapable of doing this.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old recent winner of New York City’s much-discussed Democrat mayoral primary, is a case in point.\n\nThe Ugandan-born Shiite Muslim Mamdani is a democratic socialist, but he is better understood as a full-fledged communist. That isn’t hyperbole: One merely needs to consider his proposed policies for New York City and review his broader history of extreme far-left political rhetoric. \n\nMamdani won the primary, and is now seeking the mayor’s office, on a genuinely radical platform: support for citywide “free” bus rides, city-owned grocery stores, a full rent freeze on certain low-income units, outright seizure of private property from arbitrarily “bad” landlords, race-based taxation (an assuredly unconstitutional proposal), a $30 minimum wage, and more. A true Marxist, Mamdani has called for the “abolition of private property.” And he has something of a penchant for quoting Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” too.\n\nBut Mamdani’s communism is only part of his overall political persona. He also emphasizes, and trades in, exactly the sort of woke culture warring and intersectional identity politics that have defined the post-Obama Democratic Party. \n\nMamdani is a longstanding harsh critic of Israel who has long trafficked in, and had long refused to distance himself from, antisemitic rhetoric such as calls to “globalize the intifada.” \n\nMost recently, he also opposed Trump’s decision to have the U.S. intervene in last month’s Israel-Iran war, condemning it as a “new, dark chapter” that could “plunge the world deeper into chaos.” (In the real world, there were zero American casualties, and the bombing run was followed promptly by a ceasefire.) In many ways, Mamdani single-handedly encapsulates the unholy “red-green” alliance of Marxism and Islamism.\n\nThere is, to be sure, nothing good down this road for denizens of New York City. If Mamdani wins this fall, expect a massive exodus of people, businesses, and capital from the Big Apple—probably to the Sun Belt. But even more relevant: There is nothing good down that road for the national Democratic Party as a whole. In order to demonstrate that the party has learned anything from its 2024 shellacking and its current abysmal standing, it will have to sound and act less crazy on the tangible issues that affect Americans’ day-to-day lives.\n\nThat isn’t happening. If Mamdani’s rise is representative—and it may well be, especially as other far-left firebrands like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, continue to make outsize noise—then Democrats seem to be moving in the exact opposite direction: full-on Marxism and woke craziness. If the party continues down this path, it will experience nothing but mid- to long-term political pain. But as one of the aforementioned conservatives who wishes the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, I’m not too upset about that.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Trump is demanding $10 billion in damages; in a post on TruthSocial, he called the legal action a “POWERHOUSE Lawsuit,” calling the article “false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS” and the Journal a “useless ‘rag.'”\n\nThe story concerns a birthday album compiled by Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, who’s now serving 20 years on sex trafficking charges. In the album, the paper wrote, was a “bawdy” letter bearing Donald Trump’s name.\n\n“It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker,” reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo wrote. “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The typewritten text features an imaginary conversation between Epstein and Trump, written in the third person. The letter closes with the words, “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” \n\nThe Journal story also prominently featured Trump’s denial, in which he called the letter “a fake thing,” adding, “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\nTrump also immediately threatened to sue the paper, “just like I sued everyone else.” Paramount recently agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to settle a suit from Trump alleging that CBS had engaged in election interference by what he loudly insisted was unfair editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (For good measure, CBS is also canceling Stephen Colbert’s show, days after he called the Paramount settlement “a big fat bribe” on air, citing vague financial concerns.) In December 2024, ABC News agreed to make a $15 million donation to Trump’s presidential library to settle a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made about writer E. Jean Carroll’s civil lawsuits, which she brought against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. Trump was ordered to pay Caroll $5 million, a judgment that was just upheld by a federal appeals court in June. But Stephanopoulos incorrectly stated that Trump was “found liable for rape,” which he was not. \n\nIn his suit against Murdoch and the Journal, filed by Florida law firm Brito PLC, Trump also names Dow Jonesand NewsCorp CEO Robert Thomson as defendants as well as each journalist on the story individually. In the complaint, Trump’s lawyers write that Safdar and Palazzolo “failed to attach the letter, failed to attach the alleged drawing, failed to show proof that President Trump authored or signed any such letter, and failed to explain how this purported letter was obtained.” It also complains that the story went “viral” on the internet and Twitter, including screenshots of organizations like the Lincoln Project and figures like former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann sharing it. \n\nIn a post on TruthSocial after the lawsuit was filed, Trump cast it as part of a long history of legal actions against the media. \n\n“We have proudly held to account ABC and George Slopadopoulos, CBS and 60 Minutes, The Fake Pulitzer Prizes, and many others who deal in, and push, disgusting LIES, and even FRAUD, to the American People,” he wrote. “This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media. I hope Rupert and his ‘friends’ are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case.”","summary":"Donald Trump filed suit late Friday afternoon against the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s parent company, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and several other defendants, saying he was defamed by a story that claimed he contributed to a 50th birthday album for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.

As it struggles to unify around a clear successor at the top, there have been calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.What To KnowThe survey, conducted between July 13 and 18 among Democratic-identifying voters, shows former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg leading with 26.7 percent, while Ocasio-Cortez trails in second with 18.5 percent—a strong performance for a candidate who has never held statewide office.The New York congresswoman's numbers outpace traditional power players such as California Governor Gavin Newsom—who polled at 15.8 percent—and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who polled at 14.5 percent.A second-place finish in a crowded field dominated by governors and former presidential candidates signals that Ocasio-Cortez would be a top-tier contender should she officially launch a campaign.While she has not formally announced a presidential bid for 2028, a number of recent moves and statements have raised eyebrows about what she has in store for her political future.The progressive representative has been actively engaging in national politics, most notably through her \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour alongside independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which has drawn large crowds and widespread attention.She has also released a campaign-style video featuring the slogan \"We are one,\" further fueling speculation that a presidential run may be on the horizon.When questioned about a possible 2028 candidacy, Ocasio-Cortez did not offer a definitive answer. Instead, she highlighted her focus on defending Medicaid and civil liberties, telling Fox News: \"This moment isn't about campaigns or elections or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected.\"Still, her growing national profile has caught the attention of political analysts. In April, pollster Nate Silver, who publishes the Silver Bulletin, named Ocasio-Cortez the most likely Democrat to lead the party's 2028 presidential ticket, citing her strong grassroots support and cross-generational appeal.The same poll also showed fellow progressive Mamdani—who is running for mayor of New York City—emerging as a potential 2028 contender. Mamdani polls at 4 percent, placing him in the middle of the pack and tying with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who registered 4.1 percent. Mamdani's support likely overlaps with Ocasio-Cortez's base, raising the possibility of a split progressive vote if both enter the race.Mamdani has already built up significant momentum during his bid for the Democratic nomination for New York Mayor against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. However, the New York state assembly member is unlikely to launch a bid for the presidency.While he is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he was born in Uganda, meaning he does not meet the \"natural-born citizen\" requirement outlined in the Constitution.Nonetheless, support for Mamdani in the poll signals enthusiasm for a more radical alternative to the Democratic establishment.Elsewhere in the Democratic field, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who secured the party's vice presidential nomination in the 2024 election, had 8.7 percent support—outperforming several other prominent figures.Booker and Mamdani tied at 4 percent, both ahead of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who had 3.2 percent. Others—such as Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (1.4 percent), Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia (0.5 percent) and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (0.3 percent)—remained at the bottom of the field.The results paint a picture of a highly fragmented Democratic primary, with no single figure consolidating majority support and multiple ideological factions vying for influence.On the Republican side, the race appears far less competitive—at least for now. Vice President JD Vance holds a commanding lead in the GOP primary field, with 57.9 percent support among Republican-identifying voters.His lead dwarfs that of his closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who sits at 13.2 percent.

Nor can Democrats necessarily rely on any GOP infighting to redound, in seesaw-like fashion, to their own benefit; for all the Sturm und Drang generated by the “Epstein files” affair, President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have actually increased among Republicans this month. (RELATED: Dave Portnoy Warns Against Socialist Zohran Mamdani)\n\nThe issue for Democrats is that their current unpopularity is not a byproduct of the political scandals of the day or the vicissitudes of Trump’s polarizing social media feeds. Rather, the problem for Democrats is structural — and it requires a rethink and a reboot from soup to nuts.\n\nAs this column argued last November, it is clear that Barack Obama’s winning 2008 political coalition — comprising racial and ethnic minorities, young people and highly educated whites — has completely withered. “Obamaism” is dead — and Democrats have to reconcile themselves to that demise. At minimum, they should stop taking advice from Obama himself; the 44th president was Kamala Harris’ top 2024 campaign trail surrogate, and we saw how that worked out.\n\nIn order for the party to rise up anew, as has often happened throughout American history following a period of dominance from a partisan rival, Democrats are going to have to move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievances that have so greatly alienated large swaths of the American people on issues pertaining to race, gender, immigration, and crime and public safety.\n\nAnd the good news, for conservative Americans who candidly wish the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, is that Democrats seem completely incapable of doing this.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old recent winner of New York City’s much-discussed Democratic mayoral primary, is a case in point.\n\nThe Ugandan-born Shiite Muslim Mamdani is a democratic socialist, but he is better understood as a full-fledged communist. That isn’t hyperbole: One merely needs to consider his proposed policies for New York City and review his broader history of extreme far-left political rhetoric. Mamdani won the primary, and is now seeking the mayor’s office, on a genuinely radical platform: support for citywide “free” bus rides, city-owned grocery stores, a full rent freeze on certain low-income units, outright seizure of private property from arbitrarily “bad” landlords, race-based taxation (an assuredly unconstitutional proposal), a $30 minimum wage and more. A true Marxist, Mamdani has called for the “abolition of private property.” And he has something of a penchant for quoting Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” too.\n\nBut Mamdani’s communism is only part of his overall political persona. He also emphasizes, and trades in, exactly the sort of woke culture warring and intersectional identity politics that have defined the post-Obama Democratic Party. Mamdani is a longstanding harsh critic of Israel who has long trafficked in, and had long refused to distance himself from, antisemitic rhetoric such as calls to “globalize the intifada.”\n\nMost recently, he also opposed Trump’s decision to have the U.S. intervene in last month’s Israel-Iran war, condemning it as a “new, dark chapter” that could “plunge the world deeper into chaos.” (In the real world, there were zero American casualties, and the bombing run was followed promptly by a ceasefire.) In many ways, Mamdani singlehandedly encapsulates the unholy “red-green” alliance of Marxism and Islamism.\n\nThere is, to be sure, nothing good down this road for denizens of New York City. If Mamdani wins this fall, expect a massive exodus of people, businesses and capital from the Big Apple — probably to the Sun Belt. But even more relevant: There is nothing good down that road for the national Democratic Party as a whole. In order to demonstrate that the party has learned anything from its 2024 shellacking and its current abysmal standing, it will have to sound and act less crazy on the tangible issues that affect Americans’ day-to-day lives.\n\nThat isn’t happening. If Mamdani’s rise is representative — and it may well be, especially as other far-left firebrands like Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) continue to make outsize noise — then Democrats seems to be moving in the exact opposite direction: full-on Marxism and woke craziness. If the party continues down this path, it will experience nothing but mid- to long-term political pain. But as one of the aforementioned conservatives who wishes the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, I’m not too upset about that.\n\nTo find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they’ve turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it’s clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert’s show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global’s president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks’ problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount’s decision to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount’s $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration’s approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York’s attorney general into whether Colbert’s cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS’ decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert’s show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy’s most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn’t just the end of a show. It’s the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert’s demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert’s contract, celebrated the show’s upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers’ late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live,” told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount’s Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He’s hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I’m not doing this anymore?’ It’s a very complicated thing … I’m not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.","summary":"As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in $439 million in ad revenue for its late-night programs.

A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.”\n\nDonald Trump appears to have written a “bawdy” letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 depitcting a naked woman, per the Wall Street Journal.

This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said.\n\n“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\nHe told the Journal he was preparing to file a lawsuit if it published an article. “I’m gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else,” he said.\n\nOn Friday, the president — a well-documented liar — sued the Journal in a federal court in Miami, Florida for assault, libel, and slander, according to CNN. In addition to the newspaper and its parent company News Corp, Politico reported, “the suit names WSJ reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo. It also names Rupert Murdoch.”\n\nTrump sued Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal in Judge Aileen Cannon's district. www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/t…— Alejandra Caraballo (@esqueer.net) 2025-07-18T21:43:40.540Z\n\nTrump had said on his Truth Social platform Friday morning: I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage’ newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!”\n\nLater Friday, he addressed the filing in a post that noted his other recent lawsuits against media companies:\n\nBREAKING NEWS: We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal. This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list. We have proudly held to account ABC and George Slopadopoulos, CBS and 60 Minutes, The Fake Pulitzer Prizes, and many others who deal in, and push, disgusting LIES, and even FRAUD, to the American People. This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media. I hope Rupert and his “friends” are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case. Thank you for your attention to this matter. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nThe president’s history with Epstein has received heightened scrutiny in recent days, amid demand for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to release its full files on the late sex offender. The two men were publicly associated with each other in the 1990s, up until a reported falling out over a business deal in 2004. Epstein was first arrested for sex crimes two years later.\n\nShortly after leaving the Trump administration earlier this year, Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth, claimed on his social media platform X that the president “is in the Epstein files” and “that is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nAfter congressional Republicans repeatedly blocked a measure that would force the DOJ to release all Epstein files while protecting victims early this week, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced the Epstein Files Transparency Act and warned that if it is not considered by the House of Representatives within seven legislative days, a discharge petition will be circulated.\n\nLate Thursday, after the Journal report was published, Trump said in a Truth post: “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”\n\nIn a post on X, Bondi said, “President Trump — we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.”\n\nTrump’s suit against the Journal comes as CBS parent company Paramount is under fire for its $16 million settlement with the Republican, who filed suit over the media organization’s handling of a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, last year’s Democratic presidential candidate, before the November election.\n\nAmong the critics framing that deal as a “big fat bribe” intended to secure federal approval of Paramount’s pending merger with Skydance is late-night host Stephen Colbert, who announced Thursday that CBS has canceled his show following his recent commentary. The network’s claim that it was a financial, not political, decision has been met with widespread skepticism.\n\n“It’s pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender to Trump,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a Friday statement. “The Redstone family, the major owners of the company, is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal.”\n\nTying the end of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” to congressional Republicans’ attack on funding for NPR and PBS, the DOJ targeting Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Trump’s threats to oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Sanders declared that “this is what the march toward authoritarianism looks like.”\n\nIn just the last day, Colbert was cancelled, PBS and NPR were defunded, and Trump threatened to sue even conservative outlets like the Wall Street Journal and NewsCorp over revelations related to Epstein.It sure looks like an open attempt at authoritarian control of the media.— Dylan Williams (@dylanotes) July 18, 2025\n\nThe Paramount settlement followed one in Trump’s case against ABC — which last December agreed to pay $15 million and release a note of regret after anchor and political commentator George Stephanopoulos said Trump had been found “liable for rape” of writer E. Jean Carroll. A federal jury found him civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but not rape.\n\nSanders and several other critics have warned that the media “succumbing to pressure” from Trump sets “an incredibly dangerous precedent.”","summary":"Sen.

Trump reacted Friday morning in a Truth Social post, writing, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.

The announcement comes two weeks after CBS parent company Paramount Global agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview featuring Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump had alleged the interview was deceptively edited. Colbert addressed the settlement on his July 14 monologue, calling it “a big, fat bribe,” and joked, “Just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.” He added, “Paramount knows they could have easily fought it because in their own words, the lawsuit was ‘completely without merit.’ And keep in mind, Paramount produced Transformers: Rise of the Beast. They know ‘completely without merit.’” At Thursday’s taping, Colbert informed his studio audience of the cancellation. “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it,” Colbert said. “It’s not just the end of our show, but it’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced.

On Thursday Colbert told his audience at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York that his popular late night TV show is being cancelled. “Yeah, I share your feelings,” he said in response to a chorus of boos.\n\nThe CBS network insisted that it had made “a purely financial decision” to wind up The Late Show next year. But others are not so sure. Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator who was a guest on Thursday’s show, tweeted: “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”\n\nThere are reasonable grounds for suspicion. Earlier this month CBS’s owner, Paramount Global, reached a $16m settlement with Trump over an interview on its current affairs strand 60 Minutes, removing a potential obstacle to the company’s $8bn sale to the Hollywood studio Skydance Media.\n\nIf the mega-merger goes ahead, a friend and ally of the US president, the billionaire Larry Ellison, could wield huge influence over the CBS news division as well as programmes ranging from South Park to Star Trek. The Late Show is sure to be seen by some as an example of obeying in advance.\n\nAmong those sounding the alarm is Marvin Kalb, the last correspondent personally hired at CBS by Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism whose defiance of McCarthyism was recounted in the film and play Good Night, and Good Luck. Now 95, Kalb perceives the Skydance takeover as a threat to CBS’s journalistic independence and moral integrity – and fears that this time it will buckle.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his home near Washington, Kalb said: “In my judgment it means that CBS, starting with 60 Minutes, will be under a tighter editorial control than it has ever been. The idea that 60 Minutes will be able to continue to do virile, unafraid reporting on Trump may be coming to an end.”\n\nThe Murrow protege, who spent 24 years at CBS News, warns that the network could drift in the direction of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News, which often parrots Trump’s talking points. “I’m afraid that CBS News will become a little Fox, that it will begin to be timid in the way in which it approaches any possibly critical story about the president.\n\n“Just as you rarely see or hear anything on Fox that is critical of Trump, likewise it may very well end up that CBS will be essentially in the same position, and that is huge loss for those who still favour freedom of the press and who still favour a vigorous, unafraid press.”\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, before the news about The Late Show broke, Kalb expressed concern about the future of the late-night comedians whose caustic, bullshit-detector political satire has earned Trump’s wrath in the past. Jon Stewart, whose current contract expires in December, and Colberthave both mercilessly skewered Paramount for caving in to Trump.\n\n“My gut feeling would be that Colbert’s contract, when it comes up, will simply not be renewed, and they will find a humourist who is pro-Trump,” Kalb said presciently. “Those are the kinds of programmes that, in a humorous way, tend to either criticise or make fun of Trump – and he doesn’t like that.”\n\nThe former host of NBC’s Meet the Press who is Edward R Murrow professor of practice, emeritus at the Harvard Kennedy School continued: “He has already taken action against the press, starting from his first term with ‘fake news’ and ‘fake media’. He has already gone a long way toward diminishing the once virile press – I keep using that word because I’m thinking about people who are not afraid, people who are open minded, fair-minded journalists who are simply covering the news.\n\n“If the news happens to be unfavourable with respect to the president, so be it. But if the president doesn’t like it, he’s going to make his views known. I think if there were a serious study done even up to this point on the last five or six months, I believe you would see an initial, perhaps reluctant timidity come into the coverage of news concerning Trump.”\n\nTrump filed a $10bn lawsuit against CBS last October, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on 60 Minutes with the then vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed in February, Trump bumped his claim for damages to $20bn. CBS initially called the lawsuit “completely without merit”, a view shared by many legal experts, and sought to have it dismissed.\n\nBut then the company entered into mediation in an attempt to placate Trump as Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, sought to close the $8bn merger with Skydance, which needs federal government approval. The CBS News head, Wendy McMahon, and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens quit over Paramount’s handling of the showdown.\n\nWhen Paramount reached the out-of-court settlement, it insisted that the $16m would go towards Trump’s future presidential library, rather than to him personally, and it would not be issuing an apology. But critics saw it as the starkest example yet of Trump’s ability to intimidate major institutions including the media.\n\nRome Hartman, one of the producers of the Harris segment, who retired from CBS News and 60 Minutes last month for unrelated reasons, said in a phone interview: “The motive of this lawsuit was clearly harassment and intimidation and the decision by Paramount’s leaders to succumb to that harassment and intimidation was an absolute betrayal. It’s a shameful betrayal of the hardworking people at 60 Minutes and at CBS News.”\n\nDespite Trump’s pressure campaign, 60 Minutes has continued to produce unflinching reports on his administration’s immigration crackdown, assault on federal government departments and other issues. Now its staff are bracing for a change of ownership and potentially different approach.\n\nHartman continues: “Now everyone is hoping that the new corporate parents will allow 60 Minutes to operate with the independence that it has always enjoyed. That’s not a just-because-we-want-it sort of thing; that’s because the independence and editorial voice of 60 Minutes is one of the reasons it has lasted as long as it has and it has the amazing reputation that it has for over half a century. We were betrayed by one corporate parent and they hope that will not be repeated by the new folks.\n “We are living in a moment of real peril for free voices and independent journalism, even independent commentary, as would be the case with Stewart and Colbert. These guys are businessmen in the end, and I hope they see that to maintain longstanding principles of independence and free speech is not just in their interest morally but in their interest economically.”\n\nSkydance was founded in 2010 by Larry Ellison’s son David. According to its website, David, who is a pilot, came up with the name as a reference to flying aerobatics known as “skydancing” and its promise of limitless possibilities. It has produced films including the Tom Cruise vehicles Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nBut although David is the public face of Skydance, his father Larry will be the power behind the throne at Paramount, according to an organisational chart obtained by the New York Times last year. The co-founder of software company Oracle is one of the world’s wealthiest men and a friend of Trump, who has touted Ellison as a potential buyer of TikTok.\n\nBill Carter, the author of four books about television, says: “Both of the Ellisons seem to be close to Trump, and Trump will basically use any leverage he can. That’s what he does, and he has been given the power to do it pretty much across the board here.\n\n“The speculation is that they’ll install somebody who is at least somewhat willing to take his side in a future controversy, which means there’s very likely to be some kind of chilling effect on the news division, and especially at 60 Minutes, because they have basically defied him even after this.”\n\nLast week the New York Times reported that David Ellison had held talks about acquiring the Free Press, an online publication co-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics. Discussions include Weiss “taking on an influential role in shaping the editorial sensibilities of CBS News”, the paper added, though probably not in a managerial capacity.\n\nJournalist Mehdi Hasan responded to the report about Weiss by tweeting: “RIP CBS News.” Paul Farhi, a former media reporter at the Washington Post, said: “She’s an opinion journalist and always has been, and that’s not the person you want running a news division or having a prominent role in the news division. You want someone who actually knows or upholds the tradition of straight-up reporting that CBS has stood for its entire existence.”\n\nFarhi added: “I suspect at the end of it he’ll discover that CBS News wouldn’t be too crazy about having her, but it’ll be a real test of his intentions, if he has any intentions at all, for CBS News. If he brings in someone like her, it will signal a direction and will be a sign of we’re not going to do things the way we’ve done in the past.\n\n“But I think it’s more likely that he won’t do anything that’s going to be radical in terms of CBS News. For one thing, CBS News is a very small part of the overall Paramount enterprise that she’s buying. It’s not a big profit centre. At the end of the day I suspect we won’t be talking about this topic once the merger is done, simply because CBS News is not out of control.”\n\nBut other parts of the Paramount forest are already in revolt. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of the long-running animated sitcom South Park, have accused the incoming Paramount president, Jeff Shell, of meddling in contract negotiations for streaming rights to the show, allegedly to benefit Paramount+ at their expense.\n\nThis has caused disruption to production schedules including a delay for South Park’s 27th season. Parker and Stone wrote on social media earlier this month: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”\n\nStewart and Colbert have also been pushing back. Stewart used a Daily Show monologue to tear into Paramount’s settlement, interrupted by a spoof ad for the fast-food chain Arby’s that said: “For when you want a sandwich commensurate with your company’s shame.” Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” and even alluded to speculation about his own job security, pointing to a moustache he grew on holiday and quipping: “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert if they can’t find him?”\n\nThe timing of the decision to axe him raised eyebrows in Washington. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday: “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just three days after Colbert called out CBS owner Paramount for its $16m settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”\n\nSpeaking before the announcement, Carter, author of The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, said: “It would be pretty obvious to anybody looking at this situation if they decided to eliminate those guys that it would be for political reasons because they’re obviously outspoken and have a big audience listening to them and it gets under Trump’s skin.\n\n“But it’s scary to think that’s something that could happen in America, that a president could basically eliminate a voice of protest against him. It would be like [President Richard] Nixon getting rid of the editorial cartoonists who were criticising him over Watergate. I would not put it past Trump to try to do it.\n\n“I do think that if you’re David Ellison, it’s a terrible look. If you’re in Ellison’s shoes, you have to know this will brand you as another person who’s basically giving the knee to Donald Trump. A lot of these guys don’t care because they have other agendas. But it is a thing to live with if you’re going to be branding yourself that way.”","summary":"The fallout from the Trump payoff comes as a merger threatens the company’s integrity and A-list talent, such as Stephen Colbert, have already been sacrificed\n\nFor a decade the comedian Stephen Colbert has mocked, ridiculed and eviscerated Donald Trump from every conceivable angle.

The CHS said Spafford had recently lost three fingers while producing homemade explosives.\n\nThe informant relayed a series of troubling behaviors from Spafford, who repeatedly espoused disdain for most forms of government regulations, particularly those in connection with firearms and other weapons.\n\nOne of the components Spafford used in constructing explosive devices was Tannerite, a brand of binary explosive shooting target designed to blow up when struck by a high-velocity bullet and used mostly for long-range target practice.\n\n“In June 2023, after shooting at the range with the CHS, Spafford stated that ‘we need to bring back political assassinations,”‘ to which [a family member] responded, ‘for real,'” prosecutors wrote in a statement of facts. “During that conversation, Spafford discussed making Tannerite with a substance that makes it as strong as dynamite, and stated he likes to set it off with homemade blasting caps.”\n\nAfter Spafford explained how he created a special solution that would “remove DNA and fingerprints” from weapons, the defendant invited the informant to “go shooting” with him, saying, “he was using homemade targets with photographs of the President for target practice.” At the time of the comment, Biden was the sitting president.\n\nIn a similar vein, authorities say that about two weeks after the near-miss assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a July 2024 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Spafford sent the informant a text message that read, “Bro I hope the shooter doesn’t miss Kamala.” The comment came shortly after then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced her intention to run for president.\n\nWhile giving the informant a tour of a property recently purchased by Spafford’s family members, the informant heard Spafford tell a family member that he kept hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) stored in a deep freezer on the premise. Prosecutors described HMTD as “peroxide-based primary explosive” that is “highly sensitive and easily detonated as a result of impact friction, or temperature changes.”\n\nSpafford also reportedly told the informant that he had an AR-15 that he had modified into a short-barrel rife. He stated that the weapon was not registered because he “doesn’t believe in any of that,” and expressed his desire to install a 50-caliber firearm on the roof of the house, saying, “They can’t get close enough if I’m mowin’ down on my fifty cal,” per the statement of facts.\n\nWhen authorities arrested Spafford and executed a search warrant on the home in December 2024, he initially claimed that any explosive materials were from fireworks.\n\nIn addition to the HMTD, authorities said they recovered about “155 improvised explosive devices” that “appeared to be homemade bombs” in an unlocked garage that also stored “household items and children’s toys.” The HMTD was located in a freezer in the garage “stored near Hot Pockets, popsicles, and Go Gurt.”\n\nSpafford, who has been in detention since his arrest, is currently scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Arenda L.

However, she is also the subject of gossip on social media. From her outfit choices that make her look older to her 33-year age gap with her husband, Nicholas Riccio, people always have material to discuss about Leavitt.\n\nDespite that, experts think that if Trump had gone with his original choice for his press secretary, it would have been a disaster. It was recently revealed that the Republican leader almost gave the position to a woman, who is definitely one of his biggest supporters, but also the most controversial one. \n\nAccording to the book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, Donald Trump was considering Laura Loomer as his press secretary.\n\nLoomer was one of the biggest cheerleaders during the U.S. President’s re-election, and he couldn’t help but appreciate her efforts. The infamous internet personality put grave efforts into furthering Trump’s election campaign, going as far as exposing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was apparently willing to run against Donald for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn their book, authors Josh Dawsey, Issac Arnsdorf, and Tyler Pager claimed, “Trump called Loomer to thank her, saying she’d exposed ‘DeSanctimonious,’ as Trump had started calling him, as a disloyal Trump hater.”\n\nDespite her efforts, it was Loomer’s many controversial statements that failed to give her a solid seat even amongst the MAGA loyalists. From her anti-Muslim views, casting doubt on the gravity of tragic school shootings, to openly mocking former Vice President Kamala Harris’s Indian heritage, Loomer has always come strong with her problematic opinions.\n\nTrump has indicated if he won Laura Loomer would be his Press Secretary. Can you imagine that? pic.twitter.com/XxG6xsZN9L\n— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) August 20, 2024 \n\n“Many of Trump’s advisers viewed Loomer as too-conspiracy-minded and pugilistic, but he liked her,” the book claims. However, despite Trump’s liking, Laura ultimately wasn’t fit enough to head his press team. The authors say that Donald Trump once asked his aides, “Is she too fringe to be press secretary?” When Karoline Leavitt was appointed instead of Laura Loomer, the Republican leader answered his own question.\n\nWhile Leavitt also makes many controversial comments, she is far more diplomatic than Loomer. The outspoken political activist has go embroiled in many problematic situations over the years, but never showed remorse for her actions.\n\nShe also criticizes Donald Trump‘s Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom she refers to as “Blondi.” While the President is quite fond of his AG, Loomer slammed her, claiming that she was “covering up” information about Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged “client list.”\n\nLoomer and Trump have a complicated relationship, with some rumors even claiming that their friendship is more than just mutual appreciation. Hence, it’s only natural that, she wasn’t ultimately appinted to head the White House press team.","summary":"Karoline Leavitt might be the head of the press team now, but she wasn't Donald Trump's first choice.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/not-karoline-leavitt-this-controversial-maga-loyalist-was-donald-trumps-first-choice-for-white-house-press-secretary","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Before-Karoline-Leavitt-Donald-Trump-Considered-Appointing-Laura-Loomer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 11:31:12","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":343177144,"title":"Diagnosing Democrats' self-inflictions","text":"The 2028 presidential election will mark 200 years of the world’s oldest active political party: the Democratic Party. But high tide for the party was long ago. Two centuries on, the party is floundering and foundering, its factions splintered beyond repair.\n\nA recent dinner with a longtime Democratic activist and fundraiser in D.C. confirmed my worst fears: they are doing nothing and giving nothing to a party that has “no message and no messenger.” In their sanguine estimation, the Democratic National Committee’s cash reserves of $15 million won’t carry it past this year. The Republican Party heads into the midterms with five times the funds. If the House doesn’t flip in 2026, the 2028 election won’t be pretty.\n\n“Happy Days Are Here Again” has been the Democratic Party’s unofficial theme song since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1929, but it ought to substitute taps. We come to bury the party, not to praise it. A color map of the country tells the tale: blue coastal outposts and red all over. Once upon a time, a coalition forged in the fires of FDR’s New Deal included voters in the North and South; labor unions; Black, Catholic and Jewish Americans; liberals and, most of all, a dedication to agrarian interests versus the big-business bent of the GOP. But America’s heartland went red some time ago. In its shrunken state, blue has just gone black-and-blue.\n\n“It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” as Bob Dylan once sang. The dissolution has been a long time coming. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 began to cleave the South away from the party. The Vietnam War was a fault line that caused a liberal-versus-conservative schism that obtains to this day. Under Ronald Reagan, the white working class migrated to the Republican Party. One-term President Jimmy Carter’s long lines at the pump didn’t help any. The Clinton era was a respite but birthed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, who had none of her husband’s charm and all his baggage and then some.\n\nBarack Obama’s Affordable Care Act should have represented a return to the triumphs of FDR and the domestic achievements of Lyndon Baines Johnson, but Obama failed to sell it in, and the GOP had a field day deriding “Obamacare.” Sadly, the nation’s first Black president triggered a backlash from those for whom the whole era of diversity, equity and inclusion represented cultural assault by coastal elites. A toxic surge of resentment and fatigue with progressive initiatives made Obama’s pick of Hillary to succeed him a disastrous choice. Coming out of Donald Trump’s first term, the only thing worse than Joe Biden staying in the race too long was rubber-stamping Kamala Harris, who represented more of the same.\n\nThe party brought it on itself. An obsession with political correctness and marginalized groups, plus a border crisis with millions of illegal immigrants who by definition can’t vote, and it’s no surprise that the party is seen as having lost its way. Values that might be laudable in other contexts — from LGBTQ issues to climate change, abortion rights and health care reform — instead got buried under wildly unpopular advocacy for transgender juveniles.\n\nTo bottom it out, New York City’s ranked-choice Democratic primaries put up an avowed socialist for mayor, one who previously refused to condemn the phrase “global intifada.” Good luck with that. Traditional Democratic support from the city’s Jewish population is replaced by a coalition driven by social media. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams just might pull this one out of the trash while running as an independent.\n\nWith nationally recognizable names like Gavin Newsom, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders (an independent who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination) and, now, Zohran Mamdani, the Dems have their work cut out for them. The electorate has moved center-right, while blue boldface names are left. Newsom is doing his best to pivot, but his past will be hard to shake. Any election irregularities or structural disadvantages that suppress Democratic votes will have to contend with a Supreme Court with six Republican-appointed justices that has demonstrated no tolerance for lower-court rulings in opposition to the executive branch. Further, a majority of governors, who control their states’ electoral apparatuses, are Republicans. And this is not your father’s GOP but a MAGA flock of bleating yes-men happy to be sheep.\n\nWe are living in post-democratic times. One party is in tatters while the other controls all the spokes of government. The country does not share the values to prevent tacit autocracy. Elon Musk’s third party won’t save us — he’s part of the problem, not the solution. In a kleptocracy, it’s all about the Benjamins. The Republican Party has vacuumed up money, votes and illiberal control. Welcome to the nation’s sestercentennial next year.

This is all just going away.’ His tone was somber, but many viewers felt there was clear tension under the surface. \n\nSorry, the video was not found\n\nJust days before the announcement, Colbert criticized CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for reaching a $16million legal settlement with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe suit concerned the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, an interview Trump claimed was manipulated. Not long after Colbert publicly blasted the settlement, CBS dropped the axe. \n\nOfficially, the network claims the show’s cancellation has nothing to do with Trump, politics, or the content of The Late Show but that denial came across less as a confident clarification and more as damage control.\n\nImportantly, the show has had consistently high ratings in its slot and is often the highest-rated show in late-night.\n\nTheir statement read: ‘We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire ‘THE LATE SHOW’ franchise at that time. This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.’\n\n Colbert has hosted The Late Show since 2015 (Picture: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images)\n\n Donald Trump – who Colbert interviewed on the show in 2015 – gloated about the cancelation online (Picture: Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS via Getty Images)\n\nAs Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall noted: ‘Pointedly, there is no comment from Colbert in the release, and there’s no way he wasn’t asked to provide a polite quote.’\n\nThen came Trump’s gleeful gloating on Truth Social: ‘I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!\n\n‘[Fox News host] Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.’\n\nIt was a smug victory lap that, intentionally or not, framed the network’s decision as a political scalp. It’s a bizarre spectacle when a sitting president takes public joy in the silencing of one of his loudest critics, but some also found it telling. \n\nThe Writers Guild of America issued a statement calling on New York state officials to launch an investigation into Paramount over ‘potential wrongdoing.’\n\nThe statement reads in part: ‘Given Paramount’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that The Late Show’s cancelation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.’\n\n Colbert took over for David Letterman in 2015 (Picture: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images)\n\nUS Senator Bernie Sanders shared a similar sentiment: ‘CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.’\n\nSenator Adam Schiff agreed: ‘Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled. If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.’\n\nHollywood isn’t buying the official line either. Colbert’s peers have rallied around him, none more bluntly than Jimmy Kimmel, who posted: ‘Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.’\n\nCBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance.Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal.

He was, arguably, the last late-night host still consistently willing to hold power to account with biting honesty. And now he’s gone.\n\nCBS may insist this is a simple case of budget cuts and shifting media trends, and it’s true the network, like many in legacy media, is navigating rocky financial waters. \n\nBut even if financial considerations were real, the optics of the timing and the conspicuous omission of any comment from Colbert in the announcement make it hard to believe the move was apolitical. \n\nThe merger between Paramount and Skydance Media – which still awaits approval from the FCC, an agency that reports to the President – adds another layer of intrigue. It’s not a stretch to see the show’s cancellation as a quiet concession, a quid pro quo to grease the wheels of a larger corporate deal.\n\nA host with a clear political point of view, one unafraid to criticize both his own network and the sitting administration, is being taken off the air, while the President cheers from the sidelines and a multi-billion-dollar media merger waits for government approval. \n\nThe warning bells of creeping authoritarianism have been ringing in America for some time now, but this doesn’t just echo them; it sounds a blaring alarm.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"'Make no mistake about it: Fascism is here.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/07/19/fans-convinced-late-show-stephen-colbert-cancelled-terrifying-reason-23700363/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SEI_259343511-10b0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 09:46:55","author":"Brooke Ivey Johnson","authors":["Brooke Ivey Johnson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":343157970,"title":"“His talent was even less than his ratings” — Donald Trump reacts to Colbert’s Late Show cancellation, while fans call it a political win for him","text":"CBS has recently announced on July 17, 2025, that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will come to an end in May 2026, prompting Donald Trump to celebrate.

On July 18, 2025, former President Donald Trump reacted gleefully to the news on his social media platform, Truth Social, and wrote:“I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”For Trump and his supporters, Colbert’s cancellation is being hailed as a cultural and political victory. Online MAGA communities cheered the move, celebrating the downfall of one of Trump’s most visible media critics. Many see it as a symbolic triumph over what they perceive as liberal media bias.CBS Cancels The Late Show After 33 YearsCBS formally declared that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert did not plan to be extended past May 2026, when Colbert would be free of his current contract, on July 17, 2025. Colbert has hosted the show since 2015, a nine-year anchor of the network's late-night lineup and a ratings powerhouse. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostA Wall Street Journal report says the show was canceled mainly for financial reasons. Although Colbert had the highest viewership, CBS was losing over $40 million a year because of high costs—Colbert's $20 million salary and a staff of over 200 people.CBS claims the decision was purely about the budget, but some believe there may be other reasons involved.CBS settles with Donald Trump amid merger negotiationsJust days before Colbert’s cancellation, CBS had paid Donald Trump 16 million over a defamation suit related to a 60 Minutes report that aired, featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris.It is claimed that the segment gave a misleading impression of Trump, and CBS decided to reach a settlement agreement instead of continuing with litigation. This settlement occurred alongside delicate merger negotiations between the parent company of CBS, Paramount Global, and Skydance Media.The merger required federal approval, placing the company in a vulnerable political position. Colbert criticized the network on-air, accusing CBS of paying off Trump and labeling the settlement “a big fat bribe.”What started off as a company cost-cutting move has rapidly turned into a political hot spot. The cancellation of the show is a straight win for Donald Trump. As CBS switches off the lights on The Late Show, Colbert’s final bow will mark the closing act of an era.","summary":"CBS has recently announced on July 17, 2025, that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will come to an end in May 2026, prompting Donald Trump to celebrate.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/shows/news-his-talent-even-less-ratings-donald-trump-reacts-colbert-s-late-show-cancellation-fans-call-political-win","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/6d292-17529152840906-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 09:18:57","author":"Tanishqa Patil","authors":["Tanishqa Patil"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.03},{"id":343162800,"title":"Donald Trump Is Most Successful President After Six Months Since FDR","text":"The first six months of Donald Trump's second presidency have been the most \"successful\" of any American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, according to an analysis conducted by Newsweek using AI.The model defines success in terms of legislative accomplishments, taking into account what degree of control over Congress each president's party enjoyed over the relevant period. Speaking with Newsweek, one political scientist said Trump's legislative accomplishments—such as his flagship One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a tax and spending package—are \"reflective of the partisan support in Congress.\"Why It MattersTrump was inaugurated as president for the second time on January 20 after winning the 2024 presidential election on pledges to crack down on illegal immigration, fight \"woke\" culture and slash certain taxes.The model indicates that Trump has been successful at getting many of his priorities passed into law, greatly aided by the slim majority Republicans enjoy in both chambers of Congress and by relatively little impediment from the conservative-dominated Supreme Court.What To KnowNewsweek asked ChatGPT to rank the accomplishments of 20th and 21st century U.S. presidents in their first six months, taking account of the level of support they enjoyed in Congress.The model gave Trump an overall score of \"very high,\" thanks to legislation such as the One Big Beautiful Bill and Laken Riley Acts.On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law after it narrowly passed both the House and Senate. The legislation slashed certain taxes, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts; raised the U.S. debt ceiling; increased spending on the military and border control; and cut some funding from Medicare and other welfare programs. According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the package will add $3.3 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade.Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on January 29, with the bill taking its name from a Georgia college student who was murdered by a Venezuelan illegal immigrant in February 2024. The legislation requires noncitizens charged or convicted of a range of offenses, including theft and assaulting a police officer, to be held without bond. It also gives states more freedom to sue the Department of Homeland Security over immigration enforcement.The AI analysis concluded that the first six months of Trump's second term were the most productive since Roosevelt's first term in 1933. In his first 100 days, Roosevelt passed 15 New Deal statutes, including the Emergency Banking Act.Third in the AI's calculation was Biden's first 100 days, which saw the package of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan designed to combat the economic effects of coronavirus, along with the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday. This package was passed despite the Democrats and Republicans being tied in terms of 50 affiliated Senators each, giving then-Vice President Kamala Harris a tiebreaking vote.At the other end of the spectrum, the AI gave the worst score for the first six months to Theodore Roosevelt, who became president in 1901, arguing that he passed \"no major statue before March 1902.\"Bill Clinton was also ranked poorly, with the AI saying his only major legislative reform during his first six months was the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.What People Are SayingDafydd Townley, an American politics expert at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K., told Newsweek: \"While Donald Trump has achieved some legislative successes, they are more reflective of the partisan support in Congress. Not every president in the modern era has had such a one-dimensional party to support his legislative agenda. The Democratic Party has long been a coalition of diverse voices, making it difficult to appease every member of Congress. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama found this out during their first term in office.\"Until the George W. Bush era, Republicans failed to hold both House and Senate majorities in the modern era, apart from two years in the first Eisenhower administration. Even during the Bush years, control of the Senate shifted back and forth on several occasions, making legislative efforts difficult, if not impossible. Reagan's ability to bridge the partisan divide and work with congressional Democrats on specific bills, such as Social Security reform and immigration policies, suggests a White House capable of achieving ideological success despite congressional barriers. The same applies to Richard Nixon, who gained considerable legislative success despite having a Democrat-controlled House and Senate when he entered office.\"Democrat presidents of the early Cold War had to contend with conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, despite Democrat majorities in the House and Senate. These long-serving members dominated congressional committees, thereby limiting the legislative success of John F. Kennedy, for example. The successful passage of a huge number of bills as part of his Great Society program is a testimony to Lyndon Johnson's management of Congress.\"Trump has been much more reliant on the use of executive orders to implement Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for Trump's second term in office. The Trump-inspired legislation in this Congress is more likely to consolidate power within the executive branch and lead to less congressional interference in the president's management of the White House and its agencies.\"What Happens NextIt remains to be seen how successful the second Trump administration will be in passing legislation through Congress beyond its first six months.If Republicans lose control of either the Senate or House in the 2026 midterm elections, it will make it significantly harder to get the party's bills approved by Congress.","summary":"In terms of legislative achievements, Trump's second term is the most successful since Franklin D.

Should my family now leave the US?’","text":"Oh, to have been born in a small, stylish country with good food and favourable sea breezes. No empire, no holy faith, no condescension, no fatal ideologies. The fish is grilled, the extended family roll in on their scooters, the wine looks amber in its glass as the socially democratic sun begins its plunge into the sparkling waters below.\n\nThis was not my fortune. I was born to one dying superpower and am now living in another. I was born to an ideology pasted all over enormous granite buildings in enormous Slavic letters and now live in one where the same happens in bold caps on what was once Twitter and what purports to be Truth (Pravda?) Social. America, Russia. Russia, America. Together they were kind enough to give me the material from which I made a decent living as a writer, but they took away any sense of normality, any faith that societies can provide lives without bold-faced slogans, bald-faced lies, leaders with steely set jaws, and crusades against phantom menaces, whether Venezuelan or Ukrainian.\n\nI have written dystopian fiction before, and my latest novel, Vera, or Faith, is a continuation of the natural outcome of my birth in Leningrad and my removal, at age seven, to Reagan’s America. I think I have predicted the future with fairly good aim in novels such as Super Sad True Love Story, where social media helps to give rise to a fascist America, although my timeline when that book was published in 2010 was 30 years into the future, not a decade and change.\n\nBut before I wrote that book, there was a period of some optimism where, I confess, I got things terribly wrong. I imagined, in my least cynical moments, that Russia would become more like America over the years, or at the least more habituated to pluralism and the rule of law. Of course, the very opposite happened. America is becoming Russia with every day. The tractors I would watch on Soviet television leading to ever more heroic harvests are now tariffs that will bring manufacturing back to our land. The dissidents who were the Soviet enemy within are now the vastly fictionalised Tren de Aragua gang members who supposedly terrorise our land, and indeed all migrants deemed insufficiently Afrikaner. Politicians in all countries lie, but the Russian and American floods of lies are not just harbingers of a malevolent ideology, they are the ideology.\n\nVera, the titular character of my new novel, is a 10-year-old girl growing up in an America that is just slightly different from our own. Her best friend is an artificially intelligent chessboard named Kaspie (after the chess player), the car that drives her to school is an ingratiating AI named Stella, and the lessons of her school are preparing her for a constitutional convention that will allow certain “exceptional” Americans, ie those who can trace their heritage to the colonial era but were not brought to the country in chains, five-thirds of a vote. This is being done, Vera is continually told, not to diminish her rights (she, being half-Korean, would not qualify for the enhanced vote), but to honour the Americans who are exceptional by nature of their birth.\n\nOne reason I wanted to write from the point of view of a 10-year-old character – who, as it happens, is also half-Russian by heritage – is because of the way living in an authoritarian regime changed my own life. There was daily cruelty in the courtyards, classrooms and workplaces of the Soviet Union (not to mention the daily fisticuffs over nonexistent products in the food stores), but there was something else you could never forget even as a child: ubiquity. I grew up a stone’s throw from the biggest statue of Lenin in Leningrad; Lenin looked down at me from the walls of the kindergarten classroom in which my mother taught music; and the very city in which I lived had been renamed after him.\n\nWhen I wrote Vera, my own son was 10, and Trump was every bit as much a part of his life as Lenin was of mine, from talk in the playground to conversations at the dinner table to the discussions of his social studies class. It is unsurprising that Trump’s sometime ideological consigliere Steve Bannon has chosen Leninism as a model for his hero’s rule. All mode of social inquiry, even at a fifth-grade level, must lead back to the scowling man on the television and telephone screen. My parents and I may have different styles of childrearing and certainly different politics, but despite our disagreements I will always honour them for getting me out of the Soviet Union at the right time. The question for my son as well as the fictional Vera remains: is it time to do the same with our children? Or is there still room to stay and fight?\n\nOf course, there are large, some would say crucial differences between the Soviet Union of the 1970s and the Trumpistan that America has become today. Much as the comparisons of the contemporary United States with Hitler’s Germany are incomplete (though getting more complete by the day), Russia and America are hardly twins either. And yet, their increasing similarities raise the question of how the similarities that seemed nonexistent at the end of the cold war are becoming unavoidable now.\n\nTo start with, these are vast lands that stretch from sea to sea. Their size alone is enough to fuel messianic complexes, manifest destinies, divine rights. And religion, which can easily morph into ideology and then violence, drives the stupidity of both nations. In both societies, religion helped normalise the bondage of other human beings: slavery in America and the institution of serfdom in Russia. Inequality is baked into the national psyche of both, despite Russia’s experiments with state socialism: the idea that human beings must be parsed into a multitude of categories. Obviously, other countries have caste systems, but none has the capacity to impose its worldview on the rest of the globe with such stubborn resilience. The Soviet Union loudly professed the brotherhood of nations, but Russian racism remained thick and outlandish on the ground (ask almost any African exchange student), and was converted with great ease into a hatred of Ukrainians, with Russian television using animated images of Ukrainians rolling in the mud with pigs and references to a racial slur that can be compared with the worst used in the States.\n\nTrumpistan dives right into this morass with the falsehood that some commonplace tattoos found on Venezuelan bodies supposedly signify gang orientation, but really emphasising that some people – brown or black or non-Christian or non-straight – can never fully claim the mantle of Americanness. There are, indeed, “exceptional” Americans, those that look like Trump and much of his coterie, and then there are those who semi-belong, or who may stay as long as they are useful, and then there are those who don’t belong at all and can be deported at will.\n\nTrump loves Putin with good reason. Putin takes the messianic ideals that are found at the nub of both American and Russian societies and he makes something out of them that Trump can only find beautiful and instrumental to his own power and corrupt dealings.\n\nAs both countries enter headlong into postindustrial, likely artificially intelligent ages, Putin subverts the meaninglessness of Russian working-class lives with loud (though sometimes nonsensical and contradictory) narratives, rooted in a perceived insult to the messianic ideals of the fatherland. When, during his debate with the doomed Kamala Harris, Trump said that Haitian immigrants – those who would never be true Americans even if granted citizenship – are “eating the cats … eating the dogs”, he almost surpassed his master in terms of the clarity and shamelessness of his message, as well as an understanding of the audience for whom these comments were intended. It is most interesting to see older Russian-speaking immigrants in America, who fled the authoritarian USSR of their younger days, embrace Trump precisely because of the clarity of his message, their inability to deny a great leader shouting slogans that, if you take away their ideological direction, look much like the ones that lined the walls of our metro stations or the front pages of the newspapers we sometimes used as toilet paper.\n\nWhen I wrote Vera, there was one thing I couldn’t quite do to my 10-year-old heroine, which is to subject her to the threat of violence. She was simply too young for that, and also, because her family was financially privileged, less likely to face such a threat. But as I write this, in June 2025, Trump is taking the final steps of authoritarian progression in his attempt to label any protest against the unconstitutional nature of his rule as an insurrection that must be put down with military force. These attempts, as we can see, can be easily accepted by his followers, many of whom drink from the well of (often Russian-born) misinformation. There are parts of our population who are aching to shoot a brown “un-American” person at the border, in the same way many Russians without a purpose in life dream of profitably shooting a Ukrainian.\n\nAnd whereas Putin has relied on his own praetorian guard, the Rosgvardia (or Russian National Guard), so Trump is stumbling toward his own force in the fiercely racist and loyal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, which, in cities like Los Angeles and elsewhere, happily spreads the fuel with which our democracy may soon burn.\n\nI want to take a step back and return to the mythical country with which I began. My favourite country in the world, Italy, is ruled by a political party with ties to Mussolini. Other countries I love are not paragons of social democracy and have little love of the “outsider”, although they may rely on exactly such people to care for their parents or raise their children. But the danger of America and Russia lies in the ferocity with which we believe, a ferocity that in Russia is fuelled by a justifiable anger (and built-in fatalism), given how the population has been ruled throughout the entirety of Russian history, and in America is enhanced by a population that, despite its relative wealth, reads below a sixth-grade level and is easily susceptible to manipulation. Ignorance, to add a pinch of Orwell to the proceedings, is the strength of both regimes. Convincing these populations that slavery was but a feeble blip on the radar of American history or that Ukrainians are porcine savages who precipitated Russia’s invasion requires a groundwork set by centuries of hatred and exploitation.\n\nSo where should my Vera live? It is hard to say, because living under these regimes is already preparing our children for the two choices they will inevitably face – to fight or to conform. And is it right to ask a child to give up her birthright, the right to live in a country that invented the grace of the blues, the easy slide of denim jeans, the sweet, almost religious voices of Walt Whitman and James Baldwin? That is a lot to ask of a 10-year-old.\n\nThe beauty of writing about a child is that you can see the monstrosity of the world adults have built filter through their innocence. But no child stays innocent for ever.","summary":"When he left the Soviet Union for a new life in America, the novelist never imagined he would live under another authoritarian regime.

The presumption is that today’s crowded field of Democrats would thin out quickly to give her a virtually free “top two” primary election finish next June. This would assure her a slot on the fall ballot, most likely against either a Republican-turned-Democrat like developer Rick Caruso – who lost a run for mayor of Los Angeles three years ago – or far-right Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nBut that scenario might not come about. As Harris contemplates, none of her prospective Democratic primary rivals has dropped out quickly.\n\nYes, Harris can take comfort she is the early-book leader in this race. Against a host of other declared and rumored candidates, she enjoyed 24 percent support in a poll by the UC Irvine School of Social Ecology. But placed in a hypothetical race against an unnamed Republican (right now, Caruso and Bianco are the most likely to be there), she led by only 41-29 percent, with heaps of undecided voters.\n\nUndecided voters have long been poison to Harris. Their late decisions made her 2010 run for state attorney general against then-Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley a horserace lasting until the very last days of vote-counting, almost a month after Election Day. They made what looked like an easy 2016 Senate run against then-Orange County Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez tighter than most observers thought it would turn out.\n\nAnd last-minute choices of the previously undecided in a few states cost her the presidency against Republican Donald Trump last fall.\n\nSo a contemplative Harris should be able to recognize a very tight race in the making and realize she just might lose – and forfeit any hope of ever becoming president.\n\nShe might even have trouble securing what figures to become the lone Democratic slot in the 2026 November runoff.\n\nYes, she leads the second-place Democrat, former Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter, by a 4-1 margin in the early polling and has even larger edges over other Democrats like former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, ex-federal Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, current Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state Schools Supt. Tony Thurmond and ex-state Senate President Toni Adkins.\n\nSome of them are bound to drop out of the top-of-ticket race before it gets extremely serious in late fall. But others will stick with it and – like Kounalakis, Porter and Villaraigosa – likely raise enough money to compete heavily against Harris.\n\nHistory, of course, shows that when she faces stiff competition, Harris can have problems, as when she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race in 2020 even before the first primary.\n\nSo even though Dean Jon Gould of UC Irvine’s Social Ecology program told a reporter that “The path to governor seems well-paved for Vice President Harris if she decides to run,” it ain’t necessarily so.\n\nCaruso, for one, will see these findings as extremely encouraging. Should he win a top two slot, he would likely see Harris as at least as soft a target as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, still weakened by the fact she left town when wildfire warnings were being issued before last winter’s Los Angeles area firestorms.\n\nIn debates, where Harris has never done very well, he would try to turn Harris into a pseudo-Bass, suggesting she might be a Bass clone.\n\nThis still makes a Harris entry to this race likely because of her standing as the early leader in every poll. But she’s never demonstrated an abiding interest in top California issues like homelessness or insurance company rates and performance.\n\nAll of which makes a Harris entry into this key race very much a question mark for the moment.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.","summary":"Harris might be leading gubernatorial polls, but does she really want the job&quest;","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/18/harris-might-be-leading-gubernatorial-polls-but-does-she-really-want-the-job/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LDN-L-2FIRES-0121-14-SR.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 07:33:23","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":343168852,"title":"Whatever the polls say, Kamala Harris shouldnt run for president in 2028","text":"The clock is rapidly running out on former Vice President Kamala Harris’ self-imposed deadline to issue a decision on her political future. \n\nIn the spring, Harris promised an “end of summer” decision on whether she would run for Governor of California next year, or whether she would stay out of that race in order to make another run at the White House in 2028.\n\nNow, over halfway through the summer, Harris finds herself at a crossroads: take the – likely – easy win and become the state’s 41st Governor, or instead, commit to a grueling primary process with a spot in the general election hardly guaranteed.\n\nTo that end, new polling may push Harris to give the presidency another shot, but that does not necessarily mean she should.\n\nIndeed, Echelon Insight’s July Omnibus poll shows that, among Democratic primary voters, Harris (26%) leads a 20-candidate field in an early 2028 presidential primary ballot test.\n\nAccording to the poll, Harris leads her two biggest competitors – former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and California Governor Gavin Newsom – by 15 and 16 points, respectively.\n\nViewed strictly through this poll, it may seem that Harris has a considerable advantage and possibly an inside track to represent the Democratic Party again in three years. \n\nAnd yet, it would behoove Harris and her camp to ignore this poll and instead declare her candidacy for the governorship. \n\nPut another way, despite a seemingly encouraging lead, Harris’ position atop the field almost certainly reflects name recognition more than a genuine desire for her to run for president again.\n\nDespite presenting respondents with more than 20 possible candidates, only the three mentioned above and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (6%) could be considered “household names” at the national level. \n\nMoreover, the 2028 Democratic National Convention is roughly three years away. It is extremely difficult for voters to know now who they will prefer then, thus, they often default to the familiar face.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 – analogous to right now in the 2028 presidential cycle – Gallup released a poll among Democratic primary voters. \n\nHillary Clinton (40%) was dominating the field, trailed by John Kerry (16%) and John Edwards (15%). The eventual winner – former President Barack Obama – was not even considered a serious enough contender to be included in the poll. \n\nAll of this is to say that it is entirely possible that the Democrats’ eventual nominee is not even among the list of more than 20 candidates polled by Echelon Insights. \n\nUnderscoring the necessity for Harris to discount this poll is something I discussed in these pages earlier this month. \n\nA separate 2028 poll from Emerson, reported Buttigieg (16%) leading Harris (13%). \n\nAt the time, I wrote that Emerson’s data points to a wide-open race for the party’s nomination, and Echelon’s poll showing Harris with a lead reinforces the conclusion that there is no established Democratic front runner, including Harris.\n\nFinally, were Harris to read this poll as a desire for her candidacy in 2028, its highly likely that she will confront many – or all – of the same challenges that hobbled her 2024 candidacy. \n\nBack on the national stage, voters would be reminded of Harris’ position in the previous Biden administration, which was deeply unpopular at its end. \n\nOne can easily imagine how awkward the primary would be when Harris was forced to defend the Biden administration – and her role in it – against competitors from her own party.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris struggled to separate herself from former President Biden throughout her campaign, nor was she able to truly define a wholly new platform or agenda for a Harris presidency.\n\nAnd, when Harris did take decisive stands on various policies, she was seen as either too far-left or inauthentic. \n\nTaken together, it appears that Harris’ best bet for a continued political future would be to enter the race for California Governor. \n\nShe is almost certain to emerge from the state’s jungle primary either against a much lesser-known Democrat or a Republican, against both of whom Harris would be the clear favorite. \n\nAs Governor, Harris would be able to gain experience in an executive position, remain politically relevant, and build a platform if she chose to run in 2032, when she’d only be 67 years old.\n\nIn that same vein, with the Democratic Party as a whole facing its own crossroads in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s primary win in New York City, Harris would be able to survey shifting political landscapes and decide what type of candidate she wants to be in 2032.\n\nFurther, despite California’s shift to the center on certain issues such as crime and homelessness, Harris’ more left-leaning platform would not be the same obstacle in California that it would be in a national election.\n\nUltimately, nobody – possibly even including Harris – knows what the former vice president will decide, and few could fault her for wanting a redo after the unprecedented circumstances that led to her presidential candidacy. \n\nHowever, if Harris hopes to have another shot as a truly viable candidate, her best course of action is undoubtedly to try her hand at the job in Sacramento. \n\nViewed in that light, Harris’ advisors would best serve her by convincing her that Echelon’s poll is a flash in the pan, not a sign of genuine desire for her return to the presidential conversation. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Whatever the polls say, Kamala Harris shouldnt run for president in 2028","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/18/whatever-the-polls-say-kamala-harris-shouldnt-run-for-president-in-2028/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24311777031117-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 07:32:26","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":343125272,"title":"Bucktin: 'Doddery Donald Trump forgets key fact in his rush to roast'","text":"Doddery Donald Trump publicly roasted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week, blaming Joe Biden for putting him in the job. “He’s a terrible Fed chair,” Trump fumed. “I was surprised he was appointed, surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him.” From behind the Resolute Desk, Trump slapped Powell with the nickname “Too Late”, accusing him of dragging his feet on interest rate cuts and claiming any pre-election moves were an attempt to boost Kamala Harris or Biden. Sadly for Trump, it was he who nominated and appointed Powell during his first term in office.

Another driver, clearly not clued into chicken etiquette, honked, overtook her, and ran over the bird. Furious and fowl-tempered, Sosa allegedly chased the car down, blocked it, and tried to yank open the door. When that failed, she reportedly reached for her can of bear mace and sprayed the other driver straight in the face, declaring she was going to “teach her a lesson.” Safe to say the chicken did not make it across the road. *** The White House praised the In-N-Out burger chain for switching to “100% beef tallow” as part of Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” plan, only to learn this week it was an April Fools’ joke from a fan account.

Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot last month in what Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded an act of \"targeted political violence.\"Brodkorb has been a vocal participant in Minnesota political life—including breaking with his party to endorse Democratic candidates after a long Republican tenure.Such events can have a chilling effect on political discourse and may influence perceptions of safety among political activists and former officials.What To KnowBoth surveillance footage and Brodkorb's statements indicate the suspect wore a mask and arrived on a bicycle, remaining in front of the house for four to five minutes while appearing to use a phone.The individual ignored several other trash cans on the street before seemingly targeting the one outside Brodkorb's driveway.Eagan Police Sergeant Rich Evans told The Minnesota Star Tribune that the incendiary device was \"a mortar-style firework.\" An arson investigation has been launched.Brodkorb, his wife and three children were home at the time but were not harmed. However, he said they had been \"terrified\" by the attack.The 51-year-old held Republican Party leadership posts from 2009 to 2011 and attended the 2008 Republican National Convention as a delegate.In 2024, he publicly endorsed Democratic nominees former Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who lost to President Donald Trump in the general election.Who People Are SayingBrodkorb posted the footage on X, saying: \"At 12:49 AM, a masked individual intentionally detonated an incendiary device—or large firework—in the trash can outside my home. It exploded, sparked a fire, and destroyed the can.\"In a second post, he continued, \"Seconds after the video starts, a masked person on a bicycle stops in front of my house. Later in the video, you can hear them talking on the phone. At 12:49 AM, they light the device, it explodes, and then the person leaves. @EaganPD is investigating. Please share the video.\"Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch whose friend, British politician Jo Cox, was killed on the steps of her office, condemned political violence last month, telling Newsweek: \"Public servants should not have to weigh the risk to their families before casting a vote or answering constituents' questions. Political violence doesn't just harm individuals—it poisons the system, scares away good people, and chips away at public trust.\"What Happens NextEagan police have initiated an arson investigation and seek public input based on the released security footage. Law enforcement encourages anyone with information about the incident or the individual involved to report tips.
