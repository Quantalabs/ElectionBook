The retired Colonel released a statement saying, “I am grateful to the president for his trust and confidence,” and understandably jumped at the opportunity to lead the service branch he served for 30 years.\n\nDemocratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker is also stepping down after a decade of leadership that saw the party take control of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly. She said in her announcement to the party: “I believe the time is right to pass the torch to a new leader who can continue to build on our successes and further strengthen our party.”\n\nBoth parties have a short window of time before they have to choose their next leader. The Democrats will vote on March 22, and the Republicans are looking to vote on April 12.\n\nSo far, four people have declared their candidacies: state Sen. Lamont Bagby, a Democrat from Henrico County, will face Democratic Party 10th Congressional District Chair Zach Pruckowski and community organizer Josh Stanfield to lead the Democrats, while Republican state Sen. Mark Peake is the only candidate thus far for the GOP. Both Peake and Bagby have indicated that they will remain in the Virginia Senate if they become party chair.\n\nPeake, whose candidacy has already been endorsed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin as well as the front-runner for this year’s Republican gubernatorial nomination, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, told The Daily Signal that a unified party is his main goal. He said he has a plan to achieve that by the time voting begins in September for the November elections: “It’s availability, accessibility, transparency, and fairness.” \n\nThat is the task for both parties this year. The main job of the party chair is making sure the local units have all the tools they will need to turn out their voters. “You’ve got to have the mailing list, walk list [for door-to-door campaigning],” Peake said.\n\nBeyond that, the tools would mean little without the knowledge of how to best use them. “We have to have training sessions so that [the unit chairs] can train their volunteers,” he added.\n\nStanfield, the Democrat community organizer, seemed to indicate that there is some friction within the Democrat’s state committee in an interview with the Virginia Mercury when he said that his goal as chair would be “this sort of idea of actually empowering members of the central committee to have a say, which means more regular voting on a larger range of issues.”\n\nThe party chairs will inherit organizations in better positions than their predecessors had. The Virginia Democrats had two major victories in November—reelecting Sen. Tim Kaine and delivering the state’s 13 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris. And the GOP can point to Youngkin’s victory in 2021 and several seat-flips from Democrat to Republican in 2023’s General Assembly election.\n\nHowever, the biggest wild card may be how they manage the tumult among Virginia’s federal government workforce as Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts and layoffs are hitting Virginia particularly hard.\n\nPeake added that, as always, fundraising will be key: “We’ve got to fundraise at the national level. We’ve got to get the [Republican National Committee] involved. We have got to get President Trump involved.”","summary":"With Virginia’s governor’s mansion and control of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs in less than eight months, both the Republican...

Another poll from NBC News found that only 27 percent of voters approve of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat should not surprise many people. Not only did the party lose the White House and the Senate due to dissatisfaction with Joe Biden, voters didn’t believe Kamala Harris would bring down prices or control immigration.\n\nThe NBC poll also showed that Trump’s approval rating is at the highest it has ever been, at 47 percent — but it also revealed that he’s underwater, with 51 percent of voters disapproving of the job he’s doing. The main cause of his weakness is fairly clear: The economy.\n\nDespite Trump hitting some high marks, the NBC poll showed that 54 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy and another 55 percent disapprove of his handling of inflation and the cost of living.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why stocks took a massive hit last week as the market reacted overwhelmingly negatively to Trump’s threats of tariffs against Canada, China and Mexico, and the erratic nature of his threats.

The process stems from complaints by leftwing legal group, The 65 Project, which targeted 111 Trump-associated lawyers–including Eastman–for discipline in contesting Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.\n\nEastman is targeted for his legal argument that then-Vice President Mike Pence could delay counting Electoral College votes from states deemed contested during the certification of Joe Biden win on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRegarding the other matter, Trump signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose work with the Democrat-aligned law firm Perkins Coie. The firm is known for promoting the discredited Steele dossier that alleged Trump was a Russian agent. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, a Barack Obama appointee, temporarily blocked the Trump order in response to a Perkins Coie lawsuit.\n\nEastman, former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, said he planned to bring up the arguments by Perkins Coie and Democrat attorneys general in his hearing next week, calling the proximity of the two cases almost like a script.\n\nEastman stressed the lawfare against lawyers for Trump violates the First Amendment and will have an obvious chilling effect on lawyers in future politically-charged cases.\n\n“I am hopeful that judges can apply the law in an impartial way separate and apart from their personal or political prejudices,” said Eastman, the founding director of the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence.\n\nThe 65 Project’s targeting of 111 Trump-aligned lawyers across the country who challenged the 2020 election outcome had mixed success.\n\n“It was a concerted effort from lawfare groups, a nationwide conspiracy to deprive lawyers for Donald Trump of their constitutional rights,” Eastman said. “That makes it federally actionable.”\n\nHe added, “I hope the new FBI director is investigating.” Trump appointed Kash Patel as the new FBI director.\n\nThe first bar hearing for Eastman began on June 20, 2023, almost a year before the initial ruling on March 27, 2024 by State Bar Court Judge Yvette Roland, who recommended Eastman’s disbarment. Roland had been a Democrat donor.\n\n“I’m not aware of any that are longer or expensive. Most bar hearings are a few days,” Eastman said.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics, Roland as a California lawyer contributed $500 to the Obama 2008 presidential campaign, $1,250 to Obama’s 2012 campaign, and $450 to the 2010 Kamala Harris attorney general campaign. In 2022, as a judge, Roland contributed $250 to the gubernatorial campaign of Gavin Newsom, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nEastman said he spent about $1 million defending his law license.\n\nAfter the appeal division decides, the matter can go to the California Supreme Court.\n\n“If we win the appeal, that should be the end of it. But I expect the hyper partisan bar prosecutors to appeal it,” Eastman said.\n\nEastman maintains that a vice president’s role in the certification process of a president was not settled law.\n\n“Case law in California is clear that even if you think an argument is likely to lose, you are ethically obligated to make a plausible, tenable argument for your client,” Eastman said.\n\nCongress passed a bipartisan Electoral Reform Act of 2022 that included a provision specifically stating the vice president only has a ceremonial role when votes are counted. Trump said passing of the law meant the vice president previously had a role in the count.\n\n“The Constitution is not clear here. I was making a plausible argument. I think it was right,” Eastman said. “But even if it was wrong, it was tenable. To disbar someone for advancing a tenable argument is outrageous.”\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.]","summary":"Scheme by 'lawfare groups' was 'conspiracy to deprive lawyers of their constitutional rights'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/this-is-just-absolute-projection-state-poised-to-disbar-trump-2020-lawyer/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/donald-trump-flag-cpac-20250222.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 21:29:41","author":"The Daily Signal","authors":["The Daily Signal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":301233080,"title":"Amid 2028 speculation, California governor’s podcasts with Trump loyalists anger Democrats","text":"By MICHAEL R.

But, he added, Democrats “have to take a lot of big swings.”\n\nThe governor — who called Trump a threat to American democracy throughout last year’s campaign — has been trying to navigate a tenuous relationship with the White House as the state recovers from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January. He’s requested $40 billion in federal aid.\n\nNewsom, while progressive, has never been locked into one ideological position: He’s broken at times with more liberal factions in the Legislature. His shift this time may be to head off the kind of criticism Republicans have aimed at former Vice President Kamala Harris, also of California, or edge toward positions more closely in line with public opinion. According to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters nationwide in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.\n\nDuring the podcast episodes released so far, Newsom has been mostly affable and agreeable, though he’s challenged his guests at times. This is not the tart-tongued Newsom who appeared in a 2023 televised debate with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom he described as weak and pathetic, or who called the state legislature into special session last year to attempt to safeguard the state’s progressive policies under a Trump administration.\n\nIn an age of rigid partisanship, talking with the other side is “so rarely a part of public discourse it seems like either bravery or lunacy,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “While there are clear risks, he is trying to align his national reputation … in a slightly unpredictable middle.”","summary":"Podcasts have become an increasingly important venue in politics.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/17/california-governor-podcast/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/US_California_Governor_Podcast_11059.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 21:27:27","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.097},{"id":301223706,"title":"What to expect from the Trump-Putin call on Ukraine war","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he will likely be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, and the White House have since confirmed the call. Trump is eager to fulfill his campaign promise by making a deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine, which he has called a \"bloodbath.\" Here's what to expect and what not to expect from their conversation. Both Trump and Putin will likely remain cordial and respectful to each other, continuing to showcase their skills and talents in diplomacy. Unlike former President Biden and his VP Kamala Harris, who frequently got exasperated by Putin’s recalcitrance, calling him a \"killer,\" Trump does not insult Putin. The master of the Art of the Deal knows how to dance the waltz of diplomacy. PUTIN IN NO RUSH TO FOLLOW 'TRUMP TIME' CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL Underneath the facade, neither Trump nor Putin trust each other. Smiles and positive gestures notwithstanding, in his first term, Trump pursued the most forceful anti-Russia policy since Ronald Reagan. He authorized lethal aid to Ukraine, sanctioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, booted out Russian spies who operated out of its embassy posing as diplomats, and shut down three Russian facilities in the U.S. that effectively served as espionage operating bases targeting the homeland. Trump also took several measures to mitigate Russia’s ability to exploit vulnerabilities in America’s way of war, which is highly reliant on technology. In turn, Putin views Trump as an extremely difficult and worthy opponent, someone who is unpredictable and hard to manipulate the way the Russian dictator played previous presidents: Bush, Obama and Biden. In 2017, when asked by a journalist if he was disappointed in Trump after the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities in New York, Washington and San Francisco, Putin called the question \"naïve.\" The former KGB operative said Trump is \"not my bride, and I’m not his groom.\" In 2018, after the summit in Helsinki, Putin mocked the idea that Trump trusted him: \"You can’t trust anyone. Where did you get the idea that Trump trusts me and I fully trust him?\" Putin told journalists. \"He [Trump] defends the interests of the USA, and I of Russia.\" Indeed, feelings and emotions are simply not part of the statecraft that serious and strong heads of state use when dealing with each other, especially when it comes to Russia and the United States, both of which consider themselves exceptional great powers. When it comes to the substantive side of the Trump-Putin deal on Ukraine, there will be no breakthrough on Tuesday. But both sides will likely report positive progress with no specific details. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The 30-day ceasefire deal is unachievable. Putin is highly unlikely to be compelled to accept a ceasefire because he is prepared to fight until the bitter end. As President Trump recently admitted, Putin \"holds all the cards.\" Washington could and likely will apply even more severe economic pressure on Moscow, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett recently suggested. Hassett claimed that there’s \"a heck of a lot of things\" that Trump is ready to use as part of his \"carrots or sticks\" strategy to pressure Putin. But the Russians believe Team Trump are bluffing, suggesting that it’s too risky to play the cards involving global economic ramifications. The Russians think more aggressive sanctions against Russia’s energy sector would backfire, resulting in even higher prices here. Regardless, Moscow believes it can weather sanctions, as it has done thus far. Indeed, no economic sanctions have changed Putin’s behavior in the past decade. President Trump likely senses that a deal with Putin is harder to make than he thought. By making it his campaign promise, Trump might have boxed himself into an unachievable timeframe, giving Putin leverage. Trump’s Russia advisers should have laid out clearly for the commander in chief the complexity of the Russia-Ukraine issue that Washington had stepped into by pushing Ukraine into NATO in the first place. The Russian media is praising Putin’s \"six words\" message to an \"impatient\" Trump (My za mir, no est’ nyuansy, in the Russian language), referring to Putin’s recent televised statement in which he claimed that Russia is for peace, but \"there are nuances.\" On Sunday, Trump claimed that he was \"being a little bit sarcastic\" when he promised on the campaign trail to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Sunday night, speaking with journalists on Air Force One, Trump sounded more realistic and clear-eyed. \"We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,\" he said. \"Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\" If the commander in chief realizes that Putin is stringing him along, he will cancel the call and walk away. Letting Putin stew might soften him up, prompting a comeback if the Russians really want peace. The mess that President Trump inherited from Biden and the Europeans will almost certainly not be resolved in a phone call, if at all.

According to a survey conducted last week by Canadian market researcher Leger, 59% of Canadians stated they are less likely to travel to the United States this year than they will be in 2024, and two-thirds of them stated they have drastically cut back on their purchases of American goods both in-store (68%) and online (65%), as per a report by NBC News.Approximately 36% of Canadians who had planned trips to the United States reported having already cancelled them.Three-quarters of respondents aged 55 and older said they are avoiding trips to the United States more than they used to, according to a separate survey conducted this month by Approach Tours, a Montreal-based company. The U.S. Travel Association estimates that 20.4 million Canadians visited the United States last year, and that number is projected to increase by over a million in 2025. However, the industry group issued a warning last month that a mere 10% decrease in those visits would result in 14,000 jobs and $2.1 billion in lost spending.According to Canada's statistical agency, round-trip air travel by citizens decreased by 2.4% last month, and car trips to the United States by Canadians fell by 23% last month compared to February 2024, as per a report by NBC News.How are airlines and tourism boards reacting?Canadian consumers are increasingly choosing to travel domestically or take short-haul flights to places like Mexico and Costa Rica rather than the United States.Due to tariff concerns, Air Canada has lowered its March capacity to Las Vegas and other well-liked vacation spots in Florida and Arizona, but the situation is still very fluid. Since Trump's tariff announcements, Canadians' desire to travel to the United States has decreased by 25%, according to Calgary-based airline WestJet. Caribbean and Mexican travel destinations stand to gain from this trend; Bermuda predicts a 20% rise in revenue from the Canadian market, as per a report by NBC News.In Palm Beach County, South Florida, 40% of foreign visitors were Canadians last year, contributing to an annual economic impact of half a billion dollars. In order to keep up good relations with Canadian clients and media, a local tourism organization is revamping its pitch in Toronto. To highlight the value of the destination to attendees, the company will share exclusive offers and discounts. In the meantime, the Thousand Islands border saw a 12% decrease in passenger traffic in February and a 3% decrease in January. Although the region's marketing campaigns are bilingual and feature both American and Canadian attractions, advertising resistance is a problem.

How about you, libertarians? Constitutional conservatives? Any conservatives, in fact, who believe the rule of law and integrity of democratic institutions should, ahem, trump day-to-day politics?\n\nNo, really, we want to hear from you. All you folks who convinced yourselves that a second Trump presidency wouldn’t be half as bad, for civil liberties or for your professed principles, as that of an incompetent Democrat armed with the rhetorical equivalent of wet lettuce.\n\n(Lettuce is a key ingredient in salad, you see, and Kamala Harris constantly spewed out the most cringeworthy examples of word sala... oh never mind.)\n\nThe Trump administration, in its early months, has been at least as hostile towards free speech as any US government in my memory, which admittedly only stretches back to the end of the Bill Clinton years. This after Mr Trump’s cause in last year’s election campaign was quite widely seen, in some quarters, as an existential fight to preserve freedom of speech.\n\nIt has also openly, brazenly defied the US Constitution, first by usurping the power of Congress to dictate federal spending, and then by insisting that Mr Trump should get to decide what is legal, not the courts. In other words, it has sought to place him above any restraint or reproach from the other two theoretically co-equal branches of America’s political system.\n\nSo this new Trump government is quite close to becoming everything you accused the Democrats of being. Domineering, politically retributive, contemptuous of the law, censorious, and focused on centralising power around one man.\n\nThose are either problems for any government, full stop (the consistent position), or for any government that disagrees with your own political priors (the hypocritical position).\n\nThe pre-election warnings, among Mr Trump’s haters, that he was leaning into something dangerously close to authoritarianism now look a touch naive, if anything. And if you’re still missing that, your glasses are not rose-tinted. They’re opaque.\n\nGive the Trump administration credit for one clever, if unoriginal, element of its early strategy. It has done a truly wonderful job so far of picking easy, juicy, unsympathetic targets.\n\nForeign aid? That’s the first part of government spending anyone you poll will want to cut. Sure, it might kill a bunch of people in Africa who rely on American resources to avoid dying in childbirth, or from treatable diseases, but hey, those people are foreigners. Got to take care of your own first. Got to keep those sweet subsidies to Elon Musk’s companies flowing. We must have our priorities.\n\nArresting and trying to deport an anti-Israel permanent resident for protesting peacefully? Well, his views are way out of the mainstream. People don’t want to be associated with them. Who’s going to stand up for a guy like that? More on him later.\n\nSending alleged foreign gang members overseas, and shooting a glitzy video bragging about just how brutally you treated them? Well, who would be stupid enough to object?\n\n“wHY aRe YOu dEFeNdINg cRImInALs?” is a really freaking easy political argument. Maybe the very easiest, in fact. Bordering on lazy, like shooting from the free throw line, or the penalty spot.\n\nAre they criminals, though? Have we actually established that, through the normal legal process, in accordance with the laws of the United States, or are we being told to just take the government’s word for it? A government that has already lied a whole heap of times in a mere two months?\n\nIf these really are violent gang members, go through the proper process, prove it, and then deport them. Doing it without that due process is the act of a government that doesn’t actually give the slightest of damns about civil freedoms.\n\nWatch this video, published by the Trump team. Look at the photos, sourced from a combination of US and El Salvadorian material. Ask yourself: is this the PR work of a freedom-loving government? Or something darker?\n\nDo you have any idea whether the men in the images above really are criminal gang members? No. Do I? No. Some of them might be. But none of us have any clue, because that claim was never tested. There was no due process at all. The Trump administration merely said they were criminals, invoked a law from the late 1700s intended for use during wartime, and we’re supposed to accept that without question.\n\nThe process, when it comes to any government’s policies, does matter, even when it sounds boring and nerdy, and even when it slows things down. The rule of law matters.\n\nBecause on day one, it’s the very easiest target being taken into custody by officers working for an agency they won’t identify, in plain clothes, who refuse to give their names. It is that guy who is being muscled into an unmarked car, and being shipped across the country to a detention centre far away from his eight-months-pregnant wife, and being denied legally required access to counsel, and being labelled a threat to American foreign policy by the government without any supporting evidence.\n\nThat is whose rights are being abrogated today. What happens six months from now?\n\nWatch this clip next. It’s the moment Mahmoud Khalil, the US green card holder I was alluding to above, was taken into custody without explanation.\n\nPerhaps you have faith that the Trump administration’s performative cruelty is aimed squarely, and solely, at those who definitely deserve it. Well, let me give you a couple of examples.\n\nLast month the government made a big show of the fact that, as part of its drive to detain migrant criminals, it was sending the “worst of the worst” to Guantanamo Bay. The White House’s official spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, characterised these people as those who’d been “raping” and “murdering” Americans. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem accused some of those in question of being “pedophiles”. Mr Trump himself called them the world’s “worst criminal aliens”.\n\nWho did we actually have, among the 180 migrants sent to Guantanamo at the time? Only two had been convicted of federal felony offences: one who had illegally re-entered America after being deported, and one who’d conspired to transport other migrants across the border.\n\nAmong the rest? Well. For example, there was a person who had one very, very black mark on his record. Murder, you may wonder? Assault? Trafficking in hardcore drugs?\n\nNah, a different kind of traffic offence actually. He got a ticket for riding his bike on the wrong side of the road. That is what got him labelled “the worst of the worst” and shipped off to the squalor of Guantanamo. That is what led to him being treated like the most loathsome criminal imaginable.\n\nLet’s do another. Last week Fabian Schmidt, a legal permanent resident of the United States since 2008, was detained at the airport after returning from a trip to Europe.\n\nMr Schmidt’s mother, Astrid Senior, has claimed law enforcement stripped him naked, forced him into a cold shower and interrogated him “violently” for hours, then deprived him of both sleep and his medication. The government has not denied those claims, declining to comment based on privacy regulations (which, it must be noted, have not stopped it from publicly shaming other targets of its policies).\n\n“It was just said that his green card was flagged,” Ms Senior said.\n\nMr Schmidt has a DUI on his record, plus a misdemeanour charge for possessing marijuana, which was already dismissed by the authorities.\n\nGuantanamo for the guy who rode his bike in the wrong lane. Borderline torture, allegedly, for the guy who may have had some weed on him once. Disproportionate, no?\n\nAll that under the orders of the same president, by the way, who just gave full pardons to supporters of his who had been convicted of attacking police officers.\n\nBut that’s the point. It’s all theatre. It’s performative. Naked hostility to immigrants is the right-wing equivalent of the far-left’s own preposterous virtue signalling.\n\nThose migrants who got sent to Guantanamo? Some were eventually deported. Others returned to the US. It didn’t really matter either way, because Mr Trump already had his video footage of them being treated like scum, and he’d milked it for likes on social media, and he’d absorbed the adulation of those people who tend to “yasss king” at anything he does.\n\nWatch that video the White House was so proud of again. Ask yourself why a small army of heavily armed law enforcement officers were there to watch a handful of unarmed, completely unthreatening prisoners get manhandled off a plane. Ask yourself why it was filmed with such eye-catching production value.\n\nAsk yourself why the White House previously posted, I kid you friggin not, an “ASMR” video featuring the oh so sensual sounds of migrants’ handcuffs and chains jingling as they were loaded onto a plane to be kicked out of the country.\n\nIt’s cruelty porn. And it approaches the visual language of a wannabe police state.\n\nHold back your howls of outrage and your accusations of “TDS”. You saw the same footage as me. The tone is unmistakeable; we gain nothing by pretending otherwise.\n\nNow, you can be in favour of a police state, by all means, one that treats your perceived enemies brutally in your name. But don’t insult your own intelligence by pretending that is freedom. It’s the antithesis. It’s the stuff of El Salvador, or Hungary, or worse.\n\nLet’s discuss Mr Khalil, who was taken into custody after leading anti-Israel protests on the campus of Columbia University. The government is now trying to deport him.\n\nHe’s a permanent resident of the US, and is married to a heavily pregnant US citizen. Upon his arrest, he was taken across the country to Louisiana, separating him from his family. He’s been held there ever since, and was denied access to a lawyer until a judge intervened.\n\nThe Trump administration has accused him of “leading activities aligned to Hamas”, without providing any supporting information. He has not been charged with any crime. He has not been accused of committing or inciting violence. No proof has been offered of a connection to Hamas, or to any other terrorist group. There is no evidence, as far as we can tell, of Mr Khalil being a national security threat.\n\nBy all appearances, then – until the government offers any evidence at all to the contrary – this guy is facing deportation, despite being a legal resident, for voicing opinions the Trump machine doesn’t like.\n\nWhere are you, self-described free speech absolutists?\n\nElon Musk spent day after day, not so long ago, tweeting in defence of those who had organised violent riots in Britain, and who had explicitly called for Muslims to be killed. Mr Musk said their imprisonment for inciting violence was an attack on freedom of speech, and said the judges responsible for those sentences should be in jail instead.\n\nNothing to say about this, though. Nothing. Crickets. Could not care less. Because Mr Khalil doesn’t share his ideology.\n\nYou want to support this stuff? Fine. But you do not get to rabbit on and on and on about Donald Trump restoring freedom of speech.\n\nLook at his record, just in recent months.\n\nSuing media companies for coverage he didn’t like. Saying unfavourable stories about him should be “illegal”. Punishing law firms for representing the wrong clients. Trying to dictate the curriculum of private schools, and threatening to withdraw funding unless they comply. Detaining the likes of Mr Khalil, and foreshadowing more such arrests in the near future.\n\nWe could keep going, believe me. The point is, it has become extremely obvious that this president has no qualms at all about wielding the power of America’s government to suppress legal forms of speech.\n\nThe fact that he has chosen easy, unsympathetic targets has no substantive value when you judge his actions.

Gavin Newsom’s Podcasts With Trump Loyalists Enrage Democrats","text":"As a wounded Democratic Party struggles to regroup, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is holding mostly chummy conversations with prominent conservatives on a new podcast he’s touting as a way for the party to grapple with the MAGA movement’s popularity.\n\nIn doing so, he appears intent on showing he is more than a progressive warrior. But he has stunned some members of his own party by agreeing with his guests on issues such as restricting transgender women and girls in sports. \n\nNewsom also called dismantling police departments “lunacy” and remained silent when Steve Bannon, an architect of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, falsely said Trump won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe programs provide a fresh lens on a liberal governor and potential 2028 presidential candidate who not long ago was enlisted as a chief surrogate for President Joe Biden’s campaign. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, he chastised national Democrats for being too passive in defending abortion rights and same-sex marriage, an issue he championed two decades ago as mayor of San Francisco.\n\nNewsom said his choice of podcast guests reflects his interest in knowing more about how Republicans organized in the last election, when Trump swept every battleground state and Republicans locked up majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n“I think we all agreed after the last election that it’s important for Democrats to explore new and unique ways of talking to people,” he added in an email to supporters.\n\nNewsom’s party criticizes his guests\n\nAfter spotlighting Bannon, conservative radio personality Michael Savage and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Newsom will quickly diversify his lineup: His next guest is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last year’s Democratic vice presidential nominee. But some Democrats say the governor, who is widely viewed as having presidential ambitions, is selling out Democratic values in favor of his own political aspirations.\n\nAimee Allison, the founder and president of She the People, a national organizing hub for electing women of color, said Newsom is betraying California and “showing his weakness and naked ambition.” Allison was among Democrats who helped Newsom defeat a 2021 recall attempt.\n\n“We need a governor that will defend California’s values, support vulnerable children, LGBTQ+ people, Black people, women, and everyone else who’s in the line (of) fire of the Trump administration. Instead he is making the worst moves possible in a time of rising fascism. He’s trying to remake himself to be acceptable to MAGA,” Allison wrote in an email, referring to supporters of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\nCalifornia Assembly member Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ+ legislative caucus, said they were “profoundly sickened” by Newsom’s statement on transgender athletes. And Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, another potential 2028 candidate, said of Bannon, “I don’t think we should give him oxygen on any platform — ever, anywhere.”\n\nFinding a new audience\n\nPodcasts have become an increasingly important venue in politics, and as Newsom considers a national campaign he has been praised by some for venturing into unfamiliar territory.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, credited Newsom with trying to reach voters who might not engage with traditional media.\n\n“I think there are going to be a lot of people this alienates in the short term,” Burton said. But, he added, Democrats “have to take a lot of big swings.”\n\nThe governor — who called Trump a threat to American democracy throughout last year’s campaign — has been trying to navigate a tenuous relationship with the White House as the state recovers from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January. He’s requested $40 billion in federal aid.\n\nNewsom, while progressive, has never been locked into one ideological position: He’s broken at times with more liberal factions in the Legislature. His shift this time may be to head off the kind of criticism Republicans have aimed at former Vice President Kamala Harris, also of California, or edge toward positions more closely in line with public opinion. According to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters nationwide in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.\n\nDuring the podcast episodes released so far, Newsom has been mostly affable and agreeable, though he’s challenged his guests at times. This is not the tart-tongued Newsom who appeared in a 2023 televised debate with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom he described as weak and pathetic, or who called the state legislature into special session last year to attempt to safeguard the state’s progressive policies under a Trump administration.\n\nIn an age of rigid partisanship, talking with the other side is “so rarely a part of public discourse it seems like either bravery or lunacy,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “While there are clear risks, he is trying to align his national reputation … in a slightly unpredictable middle.”","summary":"As a wounded Democratic Party struggles to regroup, California Gov.

While some believe this could lead to deportation, the controversy continues to elicit debate. The decision comes after a legal battle over whether the Duke of Sussex received special treatment during his immigration process.Why are Prince Harry’s visa records being unsealed?Judge Nichols, who was appointed by Donald Trump, mandated in his ruling that the government submit the redacted copies of Prince Harry's visa documents by March 18, 2025, at the latest. The deadline for releasing the documents that will provide the most definitive proof to date regarding the Duke of Sussex's immigration fraud was set by Judge Carl Nichols, as per a report by the Daily Mail.The Washington-based judge declared the redactions recommended by the Department of Homeland Security to be appropriate. Last year, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is in charge of immigration in the United States, was sued by the right-wing Heritage Foundation after it denied a Freedom of Information request for Prince Harry's documents, as per a report by the Daily Mail.ALSO READ: Democrats say Kamala Harris is Missing in Action as she's having a good time without taking any clear leadership According to Heritage, Harry might have lied on the forms when asked if he had ever used drugs.What could the released documents reveal?Although it's unclear what information will be made public, it might contain forms that show whether Harry answered no when asked if he used drugs. DHS attorneys have previously stated that a fourth item must be kept confidential while the other three will be made public with redactions, as per a report by the Daily Mail.How does Prince Harry feel about the legal battle?Prince Harry discussed his use of cannabis, cocaine, and magic mushrooms in both his Netflix TV series and his memoir, Spare. He has been embarrassed and upset by the case, and it has also made him wonder if he could be deported if it turns out that he lied.He has previously been open about his drug use and claimed that cannabis allowed him to move past the trauma of losing his mother, Princess Diana.Using the psychedelic drug ayahuasca, the Duke claimed to have discovered that his mother wanted him to be happy. How has the legal battle over his visa unfolded?Judge Nichols denied Heritage's request to make all the documents available in September, citing the Duke's right to privacy.However, following a hearing, he changed his mind and stated that he wished to disclose as much information as possible.Judge Nichols stated in a prior hearing that in my view that has to happen and that he wished to make the maximum amount of relevant information available to the public, as per a report by the Daily Mail.However, Judge Nichols stated that he did not wish to disclose Harry's immigration status, so some files may have significant redactions. The director of Heritage's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, Nile Gardiner, spoke following the hearing and urged Trump to release the documents.According to Heritage, Harry's March 2020 US visa application may indicate that he checked the no box when asked about his drug use. DHS stated in earlier court documents that the records in question are especially sensitive since they would disclose Harry's immigration status in the US. Despite being a high-profile person, Prince Harry still has a privacy interest in these kinds of documents and in his immigration or visa status in general, according to DHS.Did Prince Harry receive special immigration treatment?The initial inquiry aimed to ascertain whether Harry, who relocated to the United States after leaving the British royal family as a working member, was receiving preferential treatment. DHS rejected the Heritage Foundation's allegations as a bare suspicion of government misconduct and said that making Harry's documents public would not provide any meaningful light on the organization's workings. Will Donald Trump deport Prince Harry?However, President Trump recently criticized Meghan, calling her terrible, and stated that he would not order him to leave the country.Donald Trump claimed he was only granting Harry a reprieve because his wife is causing him enough trouble.

They couldn’t raise the federal minimum wage because the Senate parliamentarian (i.e., their unelected adviser) said so. They couldn’t codify federal abortion rights, enact a public health insurance option, protect Americans’ voting rights, or limit dark money’s influence on politics due to the existence of the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation. They couldn’t eliminate or reform the filibuster, they argued, because it would be necessary down the line, when the party lost power. \n\n Of course, a filibuster might have been useful last week, but Democrats broke it to ensure the passage of Trump’s spending bill. Republicans needed votes from Democrats in order to pass the legislation. Democrats gave them those votes for nothing in return — with some, like Schumer, arguing that allowing a government shutdown would be worse than passing Republicans’ spending bill.\n\n “What happened this week — a total cave on a totally partisan long-term funding bill — hasn’t happened in the 20 years I’ve covered Congress,” Steven Dennis, a longtime Capitol Hill reporter for Bloomberg News, noted Saturday. \n\n The surrender, which drew enthusiastic praise from Trump, generated unprecedented blowback from Democratic lawmakers as well as reliable party supporters. For a moment, it seemed that the party had finally grown tired of its leader’s performative helplessness and refusal to stand up to Trump. Some ultra-reliable Democratic Party supporters online demanded Schumer step down, while others called for him and the rest of Democrats who supported the spending bill to face primary challenges. \n\n Will this anger last? Will it be channeled into something meaningful? The answers to those questions all remain to be seen — though there’s indication already that Schumer, for one, is worried about blowback. On Monday, he postponed his book tour. \n\n While the senator was busy bailing on a promotional tour, the Trump administration was eager to show the opposition and the country how it planned to wield its immense power for the foreseeable future — powers that for now have the begrudging cash-blessing from Schumer and some other Democratic senators. Trump immediately got to work using an archaic wartime law to deport hundreds of people whom his administration is accusing of gang membership to El Salvador. When a federal judge issued an emergency order demanding the administration stop, Team Trump responded by openly mocking the authority of the court.\n\n Furthermore, on Friday, the president ordered the gutting of several more federal agencies, including the council dedicated to reducing homelessness in America.\n\n All of this is now being carried out with the comfort of knowing that Democratic lawmakers have little opportunity to stop them — and that Schumer ditched whatever semblance of leverage they may have had on Friday.\n\n Recent polling suggests that Democratic voters want their lawmakers to fight Trump’s agenda, rather than work with Trump and his allies. And last week, there were signs that the liberal elite on Capitol Hill were inching ever so slightly in the direction of, as one Democratic lawmaker characterizes it to Rolling Stone, “open, righteous revolt” against their own leadership — most specifically, Schumer, who has become the primary target of the ire.\n\n Beginning on Thursday night, Rolling Stone was bombarded with numerous messages or calls from furious Democratic senior Hill staffers, longtime liberal and progressive operatives, and liberal and center-left lawmakers who couldn’t stomach that their party’s Senate leader was so willing to surrender to Trump and Musk.\n\n Indeed, the word “surrender” was used, angrily, by a majority of these Democratic sources. They had endured decades of living with the stereotype that Republican politicians fear their own base, and Democratic elected officials hate their own base, and that it shows in each party’s public output and propensity — or lack thereof — for sheer ruthlessness.\n\n One senior Democratic Senate aide notes that the party spends “all our time fundraising off of taking the fight to Trump and Elon; so what are we supposed to say to our own people when we demonstrate to them that we aren’t able to put up even a minimum level of resistance?”\n\n On Thursday, a line was crossed. “Grow a pair,” says one Senate Democrat, directing their (albeit, private and not on-the-record) ire at Schumer. “We have a very short window to tank the defeatist ambitions of our own leader!”\n\n The window was indeed short. And by the close of the week, the Democratic lawmakers who wanted a battle royale would have to settle for more excuses. And the policymakers sitting on the other side of the aisle couldn’t believe their luck.\n\n Or, perhaps the problem was — to various Dems, anyway — that these Republicans absolutely could believe their luck. They’d become accustomed to Democrats’ surrender by now.\n\n Multiple senior GOP sources in both chambers on the Hill and within the Trump administration were quick to blab to Rolling Stone about how thrilled they were at Schumer’s willingness to cave — because they now believe they can get away with the same tactics in the next funding showdown and exclude Democrats from the process. \n\n Trump aides and other administration officials were similarly giddy at the idea that, in the words of one official, “for all that big talk” from Schumer and other leading Dems about how Trump, Musk, and the rest are a rampaging, authoritarian threat to the material and constitutional health of the republic, the minority leader was unwilling to put up any actual fight. This Trump official also claims that any widespread intra-party rage at Schumer is “good for us,” as it would inflame squabbling and power struggles in an already weakened opposition.\n\n Whether there’s truth in that or not, an increasing number of progressive activists and policymakers are coalescing around the notion that the stakes are now immeasurably high — and that waging an effective campaign against Trump’s wrath is impossible with the current order of liberal establishment leadership.\n\n In the wake of last week’s surrender, the progressive organizing group Indivisible called for Schumer to step down as Senate minority leader, following an emergency vote among the organization’s leaders. \n\n Ezra Levin, the group’s co-founder, tells Rolling Stone the vast majority of the group’s leaders believe this is necessary — and that they are in much firmer agreement about this than they were about the need for Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race last year after his calamitous debate with Trump. \n\n “Back last year after Biden’s disastrous debate performance, we called [an] emergency meeting of Indivisible leaders across the country to ask if Indivisible should call on Biden to drop. It was roughly evenly split — one third ‘drop,’ one third ‘stay,’ one third ‘I don’t know.’ Where they were unified was on calling for it to be [Vice President Kamala] Harris if Biden dropped out, so that’s the position we took,” Levin says. “For this [latest] emergency call, the vote was not close. 91 percent voted to have us call for [Schumer] to drop from leadership. This is astounding.”\n\n Levin adds: “Indivisible is not made up of radicals who hate that party. These are rank-and-file Democratic organizers who are looking at how they can organize against Trump and Musk and figure out some way to retake the Senate next year. Essentially nobody believes we have a stronger hand with Schumer as an anchor on the party … This is simply a choice between the Democratic Party or Chuck Schumer. And I don’t think we can afford to abandon the party while Musk and Trump are threatening destruction of the republic. Our leadership is dragging us down — change horses or drown.”","summary":"After Chuck Schumer helped pass Trump’s spending bill, some Dems have finally had enough of their leadership’s powerlessness act","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/democrats-surrender-trump-schumer-revolt-1235298082/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chuck-schumer-dem-leaders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 19:40:42","author":"Andrew Perez,Asawin Suebsaeng","authors":["Andrew Perez","Asawin Suebsaeng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":301211726,"title":"‘I really had my hopes up’: DoorDash driver sees $100 tip waiting.

The other side of it says Trump won.”\n\nThe message is apparently meant to either rub the right-wing win into choice faces or to counter a fringe liberal conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump and his allies rigged the 2024 election. Not long after Election Day, some Kamala Harris supporters started making noise about “missing votes,” though fewer people voted in 2024 than in 2020.\n\nIn the following weeks, this morphed into a theory that Elon Musk used Starlink to hack voting machines. Some conspiracy theorists claimed the satellites were uploaded with fake Trump votes, then exploded to cover the evidence. Voting machines are not connected to the internet, so it is unclear how they would do that. Election security experts resoundingly dismissed the theories, and no evidence ever surfaced to support them.\n\nRegardless, the 2024 election truthers remained pervasive enough to make someone money on these fake $100 bills. You can get a 100-pack of them on Amazon for $12.99.\n\nFake tips plague tipped workers across the U.S.\n\nTipping has become a contentious issue in the U.S., where every business seems to have a tip jar these days. But worse than the dreaded rotating tablet tip screen is the horror of getting a prank instead of money after delivering the goods.\n\nFor many years now, people have left fake cash for tipped workers at restaurants. Before President Trump, this typically came in the form of church pamphlets telling wait staff that eternal salvation is worth way more than the $20 they thought they were getting. This little trick made the news after it happened to X user @lightbodyblues in late 2015.\n\nStill, at least the Christians who did this arguably had good intentions. The Trump 2024 ad seems to come from a hope that one’s delivery driver is liberal just to rub salt in a wound.\n\n‘This would instantly radicalize me’\n\nSome commenters on the Reddit post wondered if the prank would have an impact that the customer wouldn’t expect. Met with the cruelty of this Trump supporter, wouldn’t a struggling DoorDash driver feel repelled from their side?\n\n“This would instantly radicalize me,” says u/loganlofi.\n\n“I wonder how a fellow Trumper would react,” mused u/Low_Pickle_112. “I’m guessing that OP isn’t a Trump supporter, but if you’re giving these things out, there’s a chance you annoy someone who disagrees with you but there’s also a chance you annoy someone who does agree with you, basically telling them “See, we’re dicks to each other too!” Guess these people just don’t consider that.”\n\nOthers recommended that the OP consider taking action. Some said they should report the customer to the app so that they couldn’t use DoorDash anymore. Other Reddit users suggested calling the cops and reporting them for dealing in counterfeit cash.\n\n“They have proof that the fake bill was presented as an actual cash tip,” u/MarkHirsbrunner writes. “Report them to the police for paying with a counterfeit bill.”\n\nOf course, since the customer used it as an optional tip, this probably wouldn’t work.\n\nA final group of Redditors simply wondered why anyone would do this, and one user had an equally simple answer.\n\n“So that they can hurt people,” said u/Perfessor_Deviant.\n\nThe Daily Dot has reached out to u/Mysterious_Check_983 for comment via Reddit.\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

But these days, as the price of eggs continues to be one of the hottest topics in the country, more and more people think Finley is on to something, and she has found a way to turn her homemade backyard chicken coop into a successful side hustle. \n\nFinley started her bare-bones operation in 2020, keeping just four chickens to produce fresh, healthy eggs for her recipes. But in the five years since, her flock has grown to 17 chickens that produce over 5,000 eggs each year, according to NBC News. \n\n“I didn’t expect it would grow like this when I first started,” she said in an interview. \n\nAs PBS News reported, the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs increased 65 percent in 2024, mostly due to a bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 and led to the slaughter of more than 145 million chickens, hens and other birds. The rising prices have forced people and businesses to find creative solutions to cope. As The Root reported, restaurant chain Waffle House added a surcharge to customers ordering egg dishes. And in New York City, bodegas began selling single “loosie” eggs to customers who couldn’t afford the cost of an entire dozen, according to the New York Post.\n\nFinley told NBC News she sells her eggs for between 3 and 9 dollars per dozen, and people have no problem paying the price. After all, who wouldn’t want to buy an egg laid by a chicken named Kamala Harris, Jasmine Crockett or Beyoncé?\n\nNow, through her business, The Royal Chicken Coop, Finley is sharing her knowledge, consulting others who want to raise chickens of their own on things like personalized coop design, setup, and weekly maintenance.\n\n“It is an involved process to do it the right way,” Finley told NBC News. “But it’s worth it.”","summary":"Five years ago, you know you would have given Naeema Finley a serious side-eye if you found out she raised chickens in her Georgia backyard.

The report added that the two financiers will launch a new $500 million distressed credit fund with Matt Englehardt, another one of their former associates.\n\nThe Wall Street return bid comes after Perry was forced to shutter his eponymously titled Perry Capital in 2016. The firm lost more than 60% of its assets under management over its final two years in business as mounting losses eroded investor trust.\n\n“I have this hope that someone says, ‘I love what you guys did, your team did things that were completely different, and how can I participate with them in the future?’” Perry said in an interview at the time.\n\nAside from amassing an ill-fated, 75% stake in Barney’s, Perry invested heavily in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in 2010 but sued the government for “illegally seizing the profits” for the US Treasury.\n\nHe launched the fund back in 1988 after cutting his teeth at Goldman Sachs on the bank’s merger arbitrage desk.

In the aftermath of the Democrats' election defeat, former Vice President, Kamala Harris has largely been absent from the public eye.This has provoked the Democrats to ponder about the various possibilities of her absence. Some claim she's just taking her time planning her next move, while others claim she's missing in action and hasn't assumed a strong leadership role, as per a report.Why are Democrats calling Kamala Harris ‘MIA’?The controversy surrounding Kamala Harris' political future rages on as speculations mount. She’s MIA! complained a Democratic insider to Page Six, referring to Kamala Harris. Doug Emhoff is telling people she's the leader of the party, but there is a clear lack of leadership, the political source continued, referring to Harris' spouse. According to Democratic insiders, who are still hurt over losing the election to Donald Trump, Kamala Harris is a political Where's Waldo who has disappeared. The individual you just attempted to elect with $2 billion? The insider said, I'm happy she's enjoying herself at a musical and being represented by CAA, but this whole 'Do not do anything, or say anything,' strategy isn't the kind of leadership the world needs right now. With Harris, it demonstrates how somewhat outdated the thinking is. As in, Well, I'll go away because I'm not going to run for governor for a year and a half.

Although they don't like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who recently started a podcast, at least he's out there doing stuff, according to the first source. What reasons are the Democrats citing for her election defeat?One of her major drawbacks, according to the source, is that she is the world's most risk-averse person. She lost for a number of reasons, including the fact that she did not do enough interviews. People had nothing to peel back the onion. Kamala Harris' avoidance of new media forms was another failure, according to a recent opinion piece in the Telegraph, and a donor complained to the San Francisco Standard that for so many Democratic donors, this was such a gut punch of an election, not to mention an expensive gut punch. What’s next for Kamala Harris?However, a source close to the veep notes that she is talking to state and federal leaders, attending the NAACP Image Awards, and raising money for the Democratic National Committee. Followers are eager to support her, and they're giving her space to decide what to do next. She's talking to folks, not running around trying to get press, as quoted in a report by Page Six.FAQsWhy are some Democrats unhappy with Kamala Harris?Critics claim she has been absent from key leadership moments following the election, failing to take an active public role.What has Kamala Harris done since the election?She has attended events such as the NAACP Image Awards and raised funds for the DNC, but has kept a low profile overall.","summary":"Some Democrats are questioning Kamala Harris' absence and leadership role after the election defeat.

Though Donald the Younger never officially announced the end of his engagement with Ambassador Kimberly Guilfoyle, herself the ex-wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom, it’s pretty clear, for a number of reasons, that those wedding bells shan’t be ringing for the two. For one, Guilfoyle is being exiled—sorry, sorry, I mean has been selected as the U.S. ambassador to Greece, which tidily gets her out of the way while Don Dons his way around Palm Beach. (Read: Making out with Anderson openly and freely at restaurants on the regs since December.) For another, he’s doing that Donning with Anderson on his arm in a very short, very sequined mini-dress, as he did Saturday when the two attended the amfAR Palm Beach Gala.\nThe two arrived together and sat together, and if Anderson’s Instagram Story Sunday morning is anything to go by, even got some clutch public canoodling in. That’s how you know it’s the real thing. Anderson posted a photo of the two grinning together, then helpfully drew a great big heart around it.

It was a surprise Florida homecoming for this leading figure in the far-right \"manosphere\" of internet personalities whose Romanian arrest and detention once seemed the final act of his unapologetically misogynist enterprise.\n\nWhile his return to the United States might imply a second act for the controversial podcaster — particularly given initial allegations that his being allowed to leave Romania was the result of political pressure from the Trump administration — it took mere days for Tate's legal troubles to overshadow his startling repatriation. Claiming to have made a \"thorough review of the evidence,\" Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said on X that he had begun a \"now-active criminal investigation\" into Tate's human trafficking and assault allegations. \"Florida is not a place where you are welcome with that type of conduct,\" said Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose administration is steeped in much of the same far-right milieu as Tate, at the news of the latter's arrival in his state. Florida has \"no involvement\" in Tate's return, DeSantis stressed.\n\nSerious criminal allegations aside, Tate has long been a controversial figure for his embrace of — and proselytizing for — an overtly sexist worldview in which women exist largely for the pleasure of men.

But we have the ability to push back, because our conservatism really is just not for the microphones. This is something that we’ve had to develop over the course of our lives.”\n\nDonalds continued by explaining that he became involved in politics when he was 30 years old, during which he realized he was “a conservative,” and this realization was something he had to convince himself along with his community. He argued this self-realization is why “the media has to vilify us” and other black Republican lawmakers, but such tactics are “not going to work.”\n\nThe lawmaker is still fresh from his announcement of entering the 2026 Florida gubernatorial election, with the aim to succeed Gov.

The Trump administration's upending of the federal government, along with economic fears raised by the president's trade war, has sparked a show of anger at the usually polite home district town halls hosted by GOP members of Congress.\n\nRepublicans like Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Rep. Chuck Edwards of North Carolina have been \"booed out of their own events and drowned out after giving unsatisfactory responses,\" said The Verge. In a different era, news of such encounters with angry constituents might have been contained to local news reports, but \"now, they go viral, agitating even those at the highest levels of government.\" The apparent backlash has \"rattled Republicans,\" said The Verge.\n\nThose rattled House Republicans have \"hit the brakes\" on such gatherings, said NBC News. GOP leaders have told members of Congress to \"do tele-town halls or at least vet attendees\" to avoid scenes of confrontation. But President Donald Trump has \"shrugged off\" the backlash, said The Hill. He blamed the belligerent gatherings on \"paid 'troublemakers'\" without offering any evidence.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

There is \"no proof\" that so-called troublemakers have been paid to show up at GOP town halls. Instead, voters are \"rightfully angry\" about cuts to agencies that help them, and \"upset about the overreaching influence\" of billionaire Elon Musk. Republicans ought to be able to deal with their constituents' anger, Pequeño said. The voters \"are allowed to be furious.\"\n\n\"Buyer's remorse is boiling over\" at the GOP town halls, said Theodore R. Johnson at The Washington Post. Voters from \"California and Kansas and Wisconsin\" are making it clear \"they're getting a government they didn't vote for.\" And they're mad that their representatives \"don't appear interested in doing much\" about it. It's actually an old debate: Do elected officials \"act as vessels for the people's voice,\" or are they \"trustees who do what they think is best\" for the country? What's clear is that \"people want accountability\" for the governance they're getting.\n\nThere are other signs that GOP voters have \"objections, frustrations and fears\" about the Trump administration's moves, said Axios. A focus group of Trump voters from the swing state of Michigan called the president's actions \"erratic,\" \"frightening\" and \"disruptive.\" \"It's getting to the point where I'm almost scared to watch the news,\" said one attendee. Notably, though, just one out of 10 of those voters said they would \"choose Kamala Harris for president if they could do it over.\"\nDemocrats, meanwhile, see an opportunity. The party plans an \"extensive series of town halls in Republican-held districts\" across the country, said The New York Times. The first of the \"People's Town Halls\" will focus on battleground districts currently held by Republicans, in places like Arizona and Pennsylvania. \"If they won't talk to their own voters, then Democrats will,\" said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nExplore More\n\nRepublicans\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJoel Mathis, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nJoel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

He also responds to Trump’s “illegal” invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and his attempt to deport foreign-born university students and faculty. Trump’s sweeping efforts to make the United States hostile to immigrants “creates danger for everybody,” warns Raskin. Finally, Raskin responds to recent divisions within the Democratic Party over a GOP spending bill. He urges congressional Democrats to present a “unified plan” and “common strategy” for resisting a Republican supermajority loyal to Trump.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The United States is moving closer to a constitutional crisis as the Trump administration refuses multiple court orders while the president vows to take revenge on political enemies and escalates his attack on the press.\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. deported 137 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was last used to justify the arrest and internment of 30,000 Japanese, German and Italian nationals during World War II.\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana for taking part in student protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. A second Columbia student protester has also been arrested.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump spoke at the Department of Justice and threatened to take revenge on his political enemies.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They’re never coming back. … So, now as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In a moment, we’ll be joined by Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, but first let’s turn to a part of his response to Trump’s speech. Raskin spoke outside the Department of Justice Friday.\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: In the 18th century, the American Revolution overthrew the kings, the lords and the feudal barons to establish a nation where we would have a nation where all would be equal under the law. As Tom Paine put it, in monarchies, the king is law, but in the democracies, the law is king. But, amazingly, we now have a president in the 21st century who believes he’s a king, and he believes that the king is the law once again.\n\n The first seven weeks of this radical experiment in neomonarchism has been a disaster for the rule of law and for the Constitution and for the First Amendment. There have been 120 federal cases filed against Donald Trump all over the country, and he has lost already in more than 40 courtrooms across the land, where temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions have been issued against his lawless attack on the Constitution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland speaking outside the DOJ on Friday, responding to Trump’s speech. He’s joining us now from Takoma Park, Maryland. Congressmember Raskin is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and a former constitutional law professor.\n\nDuring Trump’s first presidency, Raskin served as a floor manager and the Democrats’ lead prosecutor for Trump’s second impeachment after the January 6th Capitol insurrection. He was also a member of the House January 6 committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. In January, Biden gave preemptive pardons to Raskin and other members of the January 6th House committee. Earlier today, President Trump claimed the pardons are invalid because, he said, they were done by autopen.\n\nCongressmember Jamie Raskin, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don’t we start there, with President Trump saying all the pardons that he issued that were done by autopen are invalid? That would include you. Your response?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: First of all, thank you for having me, Amy, and that was the first time I got to hear a clip from our press conference. What you couldn’t hear there was the constant berating and heckling of MAGA counterprotesters who showed up. We were being drowned out by a guy with a bullhorn. I wanted to borrow his bullhorn, because we didn’t have a sound system with us. But I appreciate your running that clip where we went and appeared opposite Donald Trump.\n\nSo, but I had not seen that Donald Trump is claiming that the pardon rendered by President Biden was somehow illegitimate because of the kind of pen that was used. This sounds like classic Donald Trump stuff. You know, the pardons, of course, were necessary because of Trump’s promises to prosecute Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, less so the rest of us, but they had already made their moves against Liz Cheney. And I have no reason to think that those were not valid any more than the humiliating and atrocious pardons that Donald Trump gave to nearly 1,600 insurrectionists, including violent felons who viciously attacked our police officers on January 6th.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about this almost unprecedented speech? It is very rare for a president to go to the Department of Justice and give a speech like this. I think Clinton did around some anti-crime bill, which many would dispute was actually an anti-crime bill. Obama went to say goodbye to the attorney general. But to give an hour address naming names of targets, talking about the press as enemies of the people, if you can respond, overall, to what he said?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, it was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe by Donald Trump. No speech like that has ever taken place at the U.S. Department of Justice, which has existed since 1870, when it was set up to try to enforce the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution against the Ku Klux Klan and against white supremacists and insurrectionists and secessionists.\n\nBut nobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other. But here Trump made it clear that he views these people as his lawyers. They are reporting to him, according to his corrupt unitary executive theory. And far from staying out of the business of deciding who will be prosecuted and who will be let go, he’s going to superintend the whole machinery of the Department of Justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go to a clip from President Trump speaking at the Department of Justice.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they’re really corrupt, and they’re illegal. What they do is illegal. … These networks and these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. It’s influencing judges, and it’s entered — it’s really changing law, and it just cannot be legal. I don’t believe it’s legal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that is President Trump speaking at the Justice Department. Of course, he has sued ABC. He has sued CBS. He has sued The Des Moines Register. Because he has the backing of the wealthiest person on Earth, Elon Musk, he could do endless lawsuits. And whether or not they win, that’s not the point. But he could just wipe out one news institution after another, Congressmember Raskin.\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, he’s obviously frustrated because he’s losing everywhere in court on everything from the birthright citizenship executive order, which is blatantly unconstitutional, to the spending freeze to the sacking of thousands of probationary employees. And so, he’s frustrated, so he says it’s got to be illegal for the media to be covering his defeats and to be trying to expose the various constitutional violations of his administration. Of course, it’s completely lawful and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAnd he’s just operating out of the authoritarian playbook, which says that the first thing you do when you get in is you crack down on the free press. And he’s been doing that in numerous ways. He’s been ordering the FCC to go after ABC, CBS, NBC, anybody who displeases him in any way. But he’s also been personally suing media entities. There was a shakedown of $15 million against ABC because he was unhappy with coverage there. And now he’s got a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, not even because of anything they said about him, but because he thought that the coverage of Kamala Harris was too positive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: It was about, right, a 60 Minutes interview, which in all news media you do an hour an interview, and you play 10 minutes, so things like her sneezing were taken out. And he said that was used to affect the — try to use to affect the election.\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Of course, Fox News operates completely as an ideological arm of the Republican Party and of the Trump cult, and there’s nothing unconstitutional about that. You know, it’s totally fine for a newspaper entity to be endorsing Harris or Trump or what have you. So, he’s just absolutely confused on the point.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about the naming of names, everyone from, oh, Norm Eisen to the organization CREW, that sues over corruption in government, to the Democratic lawyer Marc Elias to the prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, Pomerantz who worked for Alvin Bragg. He named him, as well, the Manhattan DA. What it means for the president of the United States to name check these people and talk about going after them?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, Trump has embarked upon exceedingly unpopular policy moves, including, you know, an $888 billion cut to Medicaid, increasing the tax on Social Security, coming from Elon Musk, gutting federal departments and agencies promoting environmental protection, promoting health research, promoting anti-disease campaigns. And so, the only way to try to protect these maneuvers is to shut down a free press and disable the lawyers who are in court every day holding them to account.\n\nAnd understand, Amy, we are winning in court every single day against the lawlessness, most recently against this completely illegal move to deport people outside of the provisions of immigration law by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which requires that America be at war or be in the midst of an invasion. And we are not being invaded, and the Congress of the United States, which I have the privilege of serving in, has not declared war on Venezuela.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, let’s go into that, Trump invoking that 18th-century law in order to deport Venezuelan nationals from the United States. On Saturday, they flew, the Trump administration, more than 260 immigrants, including 130 people accused, but not convicted, of being a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump has labeled a terrorist organization. The flights came despite a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered any of these deportation flights that were currently in the air to be turned around. One of them was still on the ground. The Washington Postreports the three flights bound for El Salvador arrived after the judge’s order. It looks like Salvador, this maximum-security prison, which is ultimately run by the Trump ally Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, guilty of mass human rights abuses — it looks like this judge is holding a hearing today about why they disregarded his ruling. Can you talk about the significance of this? The same thing happened with the Brown University professor, the kidney doctor, who was sent back despite the judge ruling she should be allowed to at least be — her case be heard, and she should not be deported.\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: James Boasberg is an excellent judge in the District of Columbia, federal judge. He’s also very conservative. And this is a pattern we note now, that it goes across Democratic and Republican appointees. The same with a bunch of prosecutors who have resigned rather than participate in a corrupt scheme like the effort to absolve and exculpate Mayor Adams.\n\nBut Boasberg’s order was completely flouted and violated by the Trump administration and by the president of El Salvador, who gloated and basically mocked the judicial order online, saying, “Oopsie… Too late.” And I think that was retweeted by — I think it was Elon Musk who retweeted it with some glee. But, look, you’re messing with federal court judges who intervene in a situation like this only when they believe there is imminent harm to people being threatened and when they think that there is a probable likelihood of success on the merits of the case. And I think it was shown, to his satisfaction, that there was all kinds of imminent harm being threatened by these deportations outside of the immigration law system that we’ve got by invoking the Alien Enemies Act from 1798, which was last used during World War II to round up Japanese and Japanese American citizens in the internment.\n\nAnd so, I don’t know. It will be very interesting to see what Judge Boasberg does at this point, because as the president of El Salvador, the corrupt and human rights-violating president of El Salvador, said, “Oopsie… Too late,” when it was very clear they had the order to bring those people back and let them go through the normal process. We have no idea who was part of the contingent being deported.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And Rubio, the secretary of state, retweeted the “Oopsie.” Now I want to ask you about Mahmoud Khalil. There have been mass protests across the country for this Palestinian graduate student who was here on a green card — his wife, eight months pregnant, she is a U.S. citizen — to be released. Can you talk about what’s happened to him? He’s now still in Louisiana ICE detention. What you’re calling for?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we’re calling for respect for the rule of law and for the First Amendment and for due process, and nothing more than that. I would hope, I would assume that people who support the freedom of speech and due process would be saying this is a completely unacceptable situation.\n\nFirst of all, when he was picked up, they were saying that he had a student visa, which he did not. He’s a permanent resident, a green card holder, who has all of the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen has. And so, you can disagree with his speech; you can agree with his speech. But in any event, he was picked up for his speech, not given due process under our immigration law system, and then deported and taken out of state. And that’s just an intolerable situation.\n\nAnd if it can be done to him, it can be done to every other permanent resident. And indeed, because he’s never been charged with anything, there have never been criminal charges, and he’s not being charged with anything now, it creates danger for everybody, both noncitizens and citizens alike. And, of course, that’s the history of this, Amy. If you go back to the Alien and Sedition Acts from the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson was able to observe, along with other people who were the targets of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that the attack on immigrants very quickly becomes an attack on citizens, as the incumbent party thinks that they’re absolutely invulnerable and they can jail people and prosecute people just for being in the political opposition.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, can you talk about some of the things you’re calling for, calling on people to submit an open records request to DOGE for your own data, for people’s own data, to see what they have on you, like Social Security, student loans, etc., the meaning of this? And your overall, as a constitutional lawyer — the role of the richest man on Earth, of Elon Musk, firing thousands of people, using his own social media platform X to do this? What role does he have in the U.S. government?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we don’t know exactly what role he has. That’s an excellent question, because they’re very slippery and elusive about this. Sometimes the president describes him as the head of DOGE, as the leader of DOGE. In court, they’ve said he’s not involved in an administrative capacity with DOGE; he’s just an adviser to the president. So we’d like to know.\n\nWe did get this victory in court last week, where a federal judge determined that DOGE is a federal agency, and they cannot slime away from that reality. It is a federal agency. That means that they are subject to FOIA and to the Privacy Act.\n\nAnd I immediately sent in a request for all of the private records of mine, private data of mine, that DOGE has. And under FOIA and under the Privacy Act, we all have that right to find out what information they’ve got from Social Security, from the Department of Education, if there’s college loans, if there’s military service. Whatever it might be, all of that belongs to the people since the Privacy Act of 1974. So, I sent it in. I put it up online. I think more than 8,000 or 10,000 people have followed. And we’re going to launch a campaign this week, because more than 300 million people have that right, and people need to understand that you’ve got a right to the data, not Elon Musk and DOGE. And we want to know what’s happened to it. Has it gone to his artificial intelligence private business, to Grok? Has it been shared with other third parties? The people have a right to know that.\n\nAnd so, you know, my grandfather was in politics, and he told me when I was a little boy, he said that duck hunting is a lot of fun, until the ducks start shooting back. And I think people are going to insist that our rights be vindicated within American constitutional democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, Congressmember Raskin, your comments on what Chuck Schumer, the ranking Democratic member in the U.S. Senate, did, both supporting what was going to be called — the Trump administration threatened to call it the “Schumer shutdown,” but, actually, not so much that as having said to the end he would not go along with it, then switching, and the rifts in the Democratic Party now?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, I took a very strong position against that continuing resolution, which was packed with more efforts to dismantle the American social safety net, attacks on Medicaid, attacks on healthcare. And it also provided — and this was very troubling to me — retroactive validation, at least implicitly, of all of the assaults on the federal agencies and on the federal workers. So there was no way I could go along with it. Schumer took an opposite position after different twists and turns in his journey.\n\nBut I’ve got to say, Amy, what troubled me the most resembled what troubled me the most about what happened to us when Donald Trump showed up for the joint session of Congress. It’s that we did not have a unified plan across the House and the Senate within the Democratic Party to decide what to do. And I had said I would stick with any unified plan we had. We could boycott it. We could hold up signs. We could stage a walkout, whatever. But we needed to have a plan. We needed to call a play. And I think that’s the real political sin here, that House and Senate Democrats are acting like we occupy different galaxies. We’ve got to get together and decide what our common front and what our common strategy is. I’m an old, washed-up football quarterback. It’s like going out onto the field without any play at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, do you think Schumer should step down as the ranking Democrat of the Senate?\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN: You know, they’re going to go through that. I think we’re going through a period of tremendous upsurge and ferment and change in terms of political leadership across the board. And because we’ve been so separated, the Senate and the House Democrats, I really know very little about the internal dynamics that led to what took place there. So, I’ll reserve judgment on that. But I will say this is a moment where new political leadership is popping up everywhere, and that’s all to the good.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, former constitutional law professor, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nNOW READ: Trump now has massively more power than he did last week as Chuck Schumer caves — again","summary":"President Donald Trump spoke at the Department of Justice Friday in an unprecedented speech in which he threatened to take revenge on his political enemies, from the press to the FBI itself. “It was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe,” says Maryland Congressmember Jamie Raskin. “Nobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other.” Raskin, who spoke at a press conference in response to Trump’s address outside of the Department of Justice, is a former constitutional law professor and served as the Democrats’ lead prosecutor for Trump’s second impeachment over the January 6 Capitol insurrection. He also responds to Trump’s “illegal” invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and his attempt to deport foreign-born university students and faculty.

It is obvious that defendants made a strategic decision to ignore their legal obligations to return the premises in a suitable condition,” the suit said.\n\nThe plant was spun off as part of the bankruptcy of former owner the Tribune Co. in 2012, and the Times became a tenant a year later. Soon-Shiong bought the newspaper in 2018, and since then, the newspaper “fell into decline,” the lawsuit said.\n\nLast year, Soon-Shiong said the publication was losing $30 million to $40 million a year, and slashed over 115 jobs — or more than 20% of its 500-person newsroom — marking one of the largest workforce reductions in the newspaper’s 142-year-old history.\n\nAt the time, Soon-Shiong said he was seeking a better “balance” to the paper’s liberal editorial coverage after he blocked his editorial board from publishing an endorsement of then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nThe move sparked internal turmoil and outrage among readership, with thousands canceling their subscriptions and several LA Times editorial staffers resigning in protest over its shift in politics.\n\nEarlier this year, Soon-Shiong offered a round of buyouts to staffers who have worked at the paper over two years in an attempt to slash costs and reorient the newspaper more to the middle.","summary":"Real estate developer Alameda claimed bio-tech entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong and lease guarantor NantMedia breached the rental contract for the Olympic plant in Downtown LA, which the Times left last March.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/17/media/la-times-hit-with-24m-lawsuit-for-allegedly-failing-to-pay-rent-leaving-printing-plant-covered-in-toxic-ink-stains/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100626841.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 17:15:32","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.621},{"id":301168230,"title":"Decoding Kamala Harris’ ‘I am a Capitalist’ Message and the Interesting Reason Behind It!","text":"On September 25, 2024 as a part of their New Way Forward plan, Governor Tim Walz and Kamala Harris unveiled their vision for the economy of the country. One of the key takeaways from Harris’ speech in Pittsburgh is her self proclamation as a capitalist. She said, “Look, I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment.”\n\nThis comment has not come from the void as Harris has, for a while, been building her case. Since early September there has been a “release of a small-business plan that included a new $50,000 tax credit for new small businesses as part of an overall goal of triggering 25 million new small businesses in four years.”\n\nIn a Telemundo interview, Harris herself mentioned, “I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist.” While this essentially makes Harris’ stance on the market and economy clear, it also seems to be a message to Donald Trump who always refers to Harris as a communist or a socialist.\n\nMoreover, Harris has also chosen someone like Mark Cubon to represent her and he repeated Harris’ message with an even better spin and said, “Kamala Harris is a hardcore capitalist” as he clearly hinted at the fact that Harris is a better person to do business with.\n\nSince these messages and discussions were happening before the election, Cubon made it clear that the goal of projecting Harris in this light was to present her as some kind of CEO and also help undecided voters to bring “up to speed on our policies and how [she is] not an ideologue or dogmatic.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nHarris herself seemed very eager to put forward the idea of her being a capitalist and business person as she further said, “As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity and opportunity. And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach.”\n\nHarris’ words show that she has been trying to make her place into the bond that Republicans have with the business world. Harris also said, “I’ve always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions.” She also borrowed a phrase used by former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, saying when it comes to economic matters, she would pursue “bold, persistent, experimentation” and would ensure that she will not be “constrained by ideology” and will also seek “practical solutions” to various problems.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nHowever, despite what she promoted, the Biden-Harris duo could not defeat Donald Trump as he became the American President for the second time. In one of his speeches on the economy in Georgia, Trump had said, “With the vision I’m outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we’re going to take other country’s jobs.”\n\nHis words clearly impacted the American people as he emerged as the winner in the election. It now remains to be seen how Harris further uses her capitalistic image for her future political endeavors.","summary":"Kamala Harris called herself a ‘capitalist’ to make her plans for the American economy clearer.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/decoding-kamala-harris-i-am-a-capitalist-message-and-the-interesting-reason-behind-it","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kamala-Harris-had-claimed-herself-as-a-capitalist.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 17:15:06","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.127},{"id":301148828,"title":"House Republican campaign arm eyes 26 Dems seats it hopes to flip","text":"House Republicans’ official campaign arm rolled out its target list of Dem seats Monday it hopes to flip in the 2026 midterm elections, as the party seeks to fortify and expand its threadbare majority.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) listed 26 Democratic seats, including three in New York and one in New Jersey, that it believes are vulnerable.\n\n“House Republicans are in the majority and on offense,” NRCC chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) said in a statement. \n\n“Meanwhile, vulnerable House Democrats have been hard at work demonstrating they are painfully out of touch with hardworking Americans,” Hudson added. “Republicans are taking the fight straight to these House Democrats in their districts, and we will unseat them next fall.”\n\nAt the moment, Republicans have a 218-213 majority. When the dust settles and vacancies get filled up during special elections, that’s expected to become a four-seat majority, which gives them very little breathing room on tough legislation.\n\nThe NRCC is trying to convey confidence as it stares down historical headwinds under which the party in control of the White House takes a political beating in the first midterm election cycle. In 2018, for instance, Republicans hemorrhaged 21 seats during the blue wave year.\n\nDuring the 2022 elections, Democrats dramatically outperformed expectations but lost five seats to Republicans. Some analysts believe that after the latest round of redistricting, which mostly concluded in 2022, the lower chamber is less conducive to dramatic swings than it once was.\n\nBut Hudson and the NRCC are hopeful they can buck history by taking aim at the 13 House Democrats who won a district that President Trump carried last November, among other potentially vulnerable reps.\n\nFor context, only three House Republicans won districts that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried.\n\nTargeted Dem reps on the NRCC’s list in the tristate area include Nellie Pou of New Jersey, and Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen and Josh Riley of New York, all three of whom flipped a GOP-held seat within the past year.\n\nOthers on the list are Josh Harder, Adam Gray, George Whitesides, Derek Tran and Dave Min of California; Darren Soto and Jared Moskowitz of Florida; Frank Mrvan of Indiana; Jared Golden of Maine; Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan; Don Davis of North Carolina; Chris Pappas of New Hampshire; Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico; Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford of Nevada; Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes of Ohio; Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas; Eugene Vindman of Virginia and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.\n\nAlmost all of those reps, except Pappas, are on the Cook Political Report’s list of Democratic toss-up or lean-Dem seats.\n\nPappas is rumored to be eyeing the seat held by retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), potentially creating an opening. Over two years ago, he had fended off a spirited challenge from now-White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMany of those Democrats on the NRCC list are also moderates who have been targeted by the NRCC in the past. Nevada, for example, has long been a deeply competitive state, where Republicans only have one House seat. The other three House seats have proven to be elusive for some time.\n\nGolden’s race in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District had been one of the tightest contests last cycle. He’s been coy about whether he will seek re-election in 2026.\n\nSuozzi’s seat had briefly been in Republican hands under Long Island’s lying former Rep. George Santos, who was eventually expelled from Congress.\n\nDuring the 2024 cycle, the three tightest races Republicans won had a combined victory margin of about 7,000 votes. \n\nBetween the 2020 and the 2024 elections, some 419 congressional districts hewed more red, including over five dozen that swung toward Republicans by double digits.\n\nOn the Senate side, Republicans will have to defend 22 of the 35 seats up for grabs in 2026, while Democrats only have to protect 13. Democrats also have at least three incumbent retirements, while Republicans only have one so far.","summary":"House Republicans' official campaign arm rolled out its target list of Dem seats it hopes to flip in the 2026 midterm elections, as the party seeks to fortify and expand its threadbare majority.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/17/us-news/house-republican-campaign-arm-eyes-26-dems-seats-it-hopes-to-flip/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100627798.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AmsInhLI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-17 17:07:16","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.113},{"id":301140648,"title":"Trump applauds Jeff Bezos' changes at Washington Post in rare media praise","text":"President Donald Trump revealed during an interview on Sunday that he has gotten to know Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and praised his recent changes at the newspaper. \"A guy like Bezos, I've gotten to know him, and I think he's trying to do a real job.

I stayed until the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, killed a column I filed last week expressing my disagreement with this new direction. Lewis refused my request to meet,\" Marcus wrote in a piece for the New Yorker. Bezos also set off an uproar last year when he nixed the Post's endorsement of Harris less than two weeks before the election.

The pair will be accompanied by NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov when they undock.\n\nAfter spending nine months on the ISS, astronauts Sunita Williams (left) and Barry Wilmore (right) are set to splash down off the coast of Florida at approximately 5:57pm ET on Tuesday\n\nThe four Crew-10 astronauts who arrived at the space station just after midnight on Sunday will continue to maintain the space station in their stead. \n\nNASA will provide live coverage of Williams, Wilmore, Hague, and Gorbunov's flight back to Earth, starting with Dragon spacecraft hatch closure preparations at 10:45pm ET Monday.\n\nThe families of Williams and Wilmore have largely been tight-lipped about the fiasco, but Wilmore's daughter Daryn has posted several candid TikToks about her father in recent months.\n\nShe replied to several comments from viewers, confirming that she'll be able to finally see her father in person 'a few hours after' they splash down in the Atlantic.\n\nDaryn also had a short exchange with her sister in the comments, with the two remarking on how anxious they felt while watching that launch.\n\nIn a separate TikTok video posted in February, Daryn opened up about the challenges of spending months without her dad, saying he had 'missed out on a lot' during his uncertain nine-month stay in space — including Christmas and her parents' 30-year wedding anniversary.\n\nWilmore and his crewmate, Williams, were only supposed to be on board the ISS for eight days after they launched on June 5.\n\nThis updated return target will provide extra flexibility in case weather conditions are unfavorable on Tuesday, but will still give their replacements — the Crew-10 astronauts — enough time to get up to speed on ISS operations\n\nWilmore's daughter Daryn, 19, issued a cryptic message about her dad in a TikTok video posted Sunday \n\nBut their spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner, suffered helium leaks and thruster issues that ultimately drove NASA to send the ship home without them in September. \n\nThe two astronauts have been stuck up there ever since, awaiting the Crew-9 return flight that was repeatedly pushed back due to other interferences. \n\n'It's been hard if we're completely honest', adding that her frustration about her father's stay was 'less the fact that he's up there' and 'more the fact of why,' Daryn said in the February video.\n\n'There's a lot of politics, there's a lot of things that I'm not at liberty to say, and that I don't know fully about,' she added.\n\n'But there's been issues.

In a joint interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on August 29, 2024, Harris was accompanied by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nLiberals Have a New Enemy: Kamala Harris’s Chairs\nThe same book that unearths the Democrats’ “no daylight” strategy reports that the Harris campaign spent weeks obsessing over the height of their candidate’s chairs.⁰⁰According to a pre-released excerpt, the then-vice president… pic.twitter.com/MHR4k6uvEw\n— Tony Seruga (@TonySeruga) March 14, 2025\n\nThe two sat at a table, but when her colleagues saw that Harris seemed to be under Tim Walz, they issued a fresh directive to ensure that it never happened again.\n\n“Sitting next to Walz in a chair that seemed to place her below him and heaping praise on Biden’s record, Harris did not look like a candidate seeking the highest office in the land,” the excerpt read. “The whole scene reinforced the criticism that the vice president was either incapable, or afraid, of answering tough questions on her own.”\n\nHowever, Allen and Parnes stated that “the question facing Harris was whether she could build a sturdy platform,” independent of the required chair specifications. The extract also revealed that former President Joe Biden had instructed Harris to stick with his policies.\n\n“What, if anything, would you have done differently over the last four years than President Biden?” Early in October, Sunny Hostin, co-host of “The View,” asked Harris to begin her series of cordial interviews.\n\n“There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I’ve been apart of most of the decisions that have had impact,” Harris began. “The work we have done, for example, capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for our seniors. It’s something I care deeply about, about allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and bring the cost of prescription medication down for seniors but my intention is to expand that for all Americans.”\n\nAccording to reports, the president himself put pressure on her to keep her distance from Biden. According to Allen and Parnes’ book, Biden called Harris to offer her some advice prior to her first and only presidential debate against current President Donald Trump.\n\n“For the rest of the campaign, her team required that she be provided a chair that met certain specifications: “Leg height no less than 15 inches; floor to top of seat height no less than 18.9 inches …”\nAmazing @jonallendc @amieparnes detailhttps://t.co/AIUSycgRad pic.twitter.com/QlW0583uVE\n— Allan Smith (@akarl_smith) March 13, 2025\n\n“Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him — especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans.

Instead, the paper would move to the right.\n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” Bezos declared.\n\nThe decision caused the departure of the Post opinion editor David Shipley. A few days later, longtime columnist Ruth Marcus announced she was leaving the paper and published a column in the New Yorker that the Post had refused to publish. In her piece, Marcus criticized Bezos for his stance and revealed that media writer Erik Wemple had a column critical of Bezos that the Post would not publish.\n\nMarcus’ exit follows the departure of other notable figures like Pulitzer-prize winning editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes, who had a cartoon critical of Bezos spiked, as well as columnist Jennifer Rubin who left the paper.\n\nIn a statement explaining her departure, Rubin wrote, “Corporate and billionaire owners of major media outlets have betrayed their audiences’ loyalty and sabotaged journalism’s sacred mission—defending, protecting, and advancing democracy. The Washington Post’s billionaire owner and enlisted management are among the offenders. They have undercut the values central to The Post’s mission and that of all journalism: integrity, courage, and independence.”\n\nSeveral writers quit the Post editorial board in 2024 after Bezos made the decision to pull an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nThe news side of the Post has also reflected a pro-Trump narrative. In reporting on Trump’s recent address to a joint session of Congress, the paper was in league with other mainstream outlets in downplaying the abnormal nature of the affair, including the decision to remove Rep. Al Green for disagreeing with Trump.\n\nBezos’ pro-Trump actions aren’t limited to the Post. Amazon, where Bezos made his fortune, recently announced that it would begin streaming old episodes of Trump’s TV show “The Apprentice” and the company is also paying first lady Melania Trump for a documentary.\n\nBezos gushed over Trump’s election win in a congratulatory post, donated to his inaugural committee, and had front row seats at the event.

A federal judge attempted to block the removal of hundreds of alleged gang members, but the administration carried on with the deportations, arguing the order came too late.\nMore than 200 Venezuelan immigrants, which the White House accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, were flown — along with some suspected members of a Salvadoran gang — from the US to a supermax prison in El Salvador on Saturday. The White House claims the court order didn’t apply to this flight because it was already over international waters on its way to El Salvador by the time it was put into effect. The Trump administration says it welcomes a coming legal fight over its expanded immigration authority.\nPresident Donald Trump has previously noted his hope of using these powers to target “known or suspected” members of a particular criminal organization: the “Tren de Aragua,” a Venezuela-based gang he frequently mentioned when talking about immigration and crime on the campaign trail. And earlier this year Trump took the steps to designate the group as a foreign “terrorist” organization invading the US. He’s now applying that law against this Venezuelan group.\n“Tren de Aragua” sprang out of Venezuela in the 2010s and has been accused of setting up and running human trafficking and extortion rings in neighboring Colombia, Chile, and Peru. As border crossings, asylum claims, and migration from Latin America in general picked up since the pandemic, the group has been of particular interest for Trump and immigration hawks.\nAs Trump and his allies have tried to portray undocumented immigration as a threat to public safety, they’ve repeatedly highlighted the Tren de Aragua (or TdA)’s criminal activity in the US and abroad. That emphasis has coincided with TdA’s post-pandemic expansion in the US, though it’s deeply unclear how many TdA members are here — and how powerful the gang actually is.\nStill, a few high-profile incidents — in which the perpetrators were accused of being TdA members — have caught Trump’s attention, and they’ve been a consistent focus of conservative media, immigration critics, and local law enforcement agencies. Those include a high-profile forced entry in an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, that Trump seized upon last summer and highlighted during his debate against former Vice President Kamala Harris.\nBut not much is actually known about the group, how it operates, or the extent of its reach within the United States. Still, that hasn’t stopped officials, politicians, and commentators from using real instances of crime and violence to paint a picture of a dangerous migrant “invasion.”\nTrump himself did that on Tuesday night, referencing the murder of a 12-year-old Texan girl in the Houston area. Two undocumented Venezuelan men were eventually charged with her murder, and both are accused of being members of the gang — which Trump called the “toughest gang, they say, in the world, known as Tren de Aragua.”\nWhether the Tren de Aragua is the toughest in the world is debatable. But back in Venezuela and along the routes that migrants follow to get to the US, it has contributed to insecurity, instability, and violence. \nWhat is the Tren de Aragua?\nWhile we don’t know a lot about the state of the organization in the United States right now, a lot is known about the group’s origins. The Tren de Aragua has its roots in a trade union that was formed to build a railroad in 2005, during Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez’s tenure. According to researchers who have studied the group’s rise and local journalists, it morphed from being a railway workers’ group into an organization that embezzled funds and extorted contractors during that construction process. The project ended up falling apart in 2011, but by then the group had morphed itself into a larger criminal organization, being led out of the infamous Tocoron prison, a detention center in the state of Aragua, Venezuela, that had been overtaken by inmates.\nIt was there that the groups’ current leader joined the group, and eventually led the Tren de Aragua to expand its extortion, local drug dealing, and human trafficking into other Venezuelan states, and eventually into Colombia, Chile, and Peru. It’s no coincidence that the TdA’s rise happened around the start of Venezuela’s economic crisis in 2014 and in 2017. Rising poverty, collapsing social safety nets, and political repression created opportunities for both recruitment and targets of extortion, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation among the very migrants and refugees fleeing instability back home.\nAfter establishing itself in those neighboring countries since 2018 — and with the rise in Venezuelan refugees and other South American migrants in the United States since the pandemic, reports of people with alleged ties to the group have steadily increased in the US. Scores of news and government reports have tied supposed gang members to murders, sex trafficking and exploitation cases, and petty crime. Immigration officials, meanwhile, frequently label undocumented immigrants who have been arrested and are in the process of being deported as alleged TdA members.\nBut it’s hard to prove these associations, Charles Larratt-Smith, an assistant professor of security studies and researcher on transnational migration at the University of Texas at El Paso, told me. Unlike in the cases of other transnational criminal groups — like Mexico’s drug cartels or MS-13, the Salvadoran gang born in Los Angeles that ended up wreaking havoc in El Salvador after its members were deported or removed from the US — there’s no evidence or intelligence sharing between the US and Venezuela that can help identify members, and no straightforward hierarchy or line of command within this network. Essentially anyone can claim or be accused of being a member of the group, since there’s no reliable way to cross-reference membership, or for the group itself to hold its members accountable. Even the tattoos and other symbols used to try to identify group members can be inconsistent. And the group’s original base of operations, the Tocoron prison, has since been retaken by the Venezuelan government, and its leader has disappeared.\nIn other words, the group’s influence, reach, and actual power may have been exaggerated over the years. “If you’re comparing those organizations to the Tren de Aragua, the comparison is farcical,” Larratt-Smith said. The shadowy group just doesn’t have the same means, resources, organization, or power to compete with the groups various American government and Homeland Security officials have compared it to.\nAnd yet both Trump’s and Biden’s administrations have argued they pose enough of a threat to warrant federal responses, Just last year, the Biden administration levied sanctions against the group and designated it as a transnational criminal organization. And in January, the Trump White House went one step further, reclassifying it as a foreign terrorist organization.\nSo while there are places where the group’s presence is better established, like in New York City, the shadowy description of the group also serves other political purposes.\nFor Larratt-Smith, the fear the Tren de Aragua, and its presence in the US, inspires in people serves to both justify the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in general, and helps to muddy the differences between those actual TdA gang members in the US and any Venezuelan immigrants who commit crimes in the US or may have criminal records back home. “It’s a useful signifier for Venezuelan criminality — and that does exist, you would have to be naïve or delusional to say otherwise — but it’s disproportionately publicized compared to acts of criminality committed by American citizens, because it fits this broader [anti-immigrant] narrative,” he told me.\nUpdate, March 17 at 10:35 am ET: This story was originally published on March 7, 2025, and has been updated to include the Trump administration’s latest Tren de Aragua-related immigration actions.","summary":"Over the weekend, the stakes of the Trump administration’s deportation efforts reached a new level after the White House invoked an 18th-century legal authority to expand its powers.

Rally-goers behind Trump – some of whom just moments before were holding placards reading 'Joe Biden: You’re Fired!' – cowered. The agents were talking to one another, trying to figure out what was next.\"The journalist went on to describe the following moments, including how the agents lifted Trump up and formed a circle around him.\n\nBut despite having just been shot, Trump's priority was his footwear. He told them: \"Let me get my shoes.\"\n\nThe author explained: \"Trump’s shoes had slipped off during the maelstrom. The former president had as of late been wearing shoes made by the Swiss manufacturer Bally.\"While the shoes were designed to be tied on, Trump had turned them into slip-ons. Trump appeared to search for them, and then stood up, looking as if he were in shock.\"\n\nMoments later, Trump notoriously pumped his fist three times and exclaimed: \"Fight, fight, fight!\"But it was in the moments when the 47th president was escorted away – after the cameras stopped rolling – that Isenstadt provided a shocking glimpse into the historic scene.\n\nHe explained: \"The detail guided Trump offstage, his typically immaculately sprayed gold hair out of place and his bloodied MAGA hat in hand. \n\n\"Descending the stairs, he wrapped his arms around an agent to his right. The loyal Curran was on his left. \n\n\"Once they got to the bottom, it took the agents another twenty seconds to get Trump into his SUV. Before getting in, he raised his arm once more.\"The scenario at Butler Memorial Hospital was just as intense, with Isenstadt revealing Trump's team headed straight for the emergency room and the building went into lockdown the moment he arrived.\n\nHe wrote: \"After pulling up to the hospital, Wiles, Cheung, Scavino, and Nauta headed for the emergency room. The building was going into lockdown. \n\n\"Secret Service agents had their long guns out; nurses were wheeling patients out of units so they could create a secure wing for Trump.\"Isenstadt continued to describe the scene, highlighting how the president was placed on a stretcher and had his bloody clothes removed.\n\nHe said: \"Hospital workers then stretchered the former president through the emergency room doors. Trump's bloody hat, suit jacket, and white collared shirt were off; he was only in an undershirt and suit pants. \n\n\"His shoes, in the end, had been left onstage; they would be retrieved by a production worker and brought to the hospital later in the evening.\"It was then Trump predicted the future when he told team: \"This is going to make some news,\" the author wrote.\n\nHe then explained how Trump was taken into a separate room, during which the Secret Service checked on the lieutenants to ensure they weren't injured.As phones flooded with texts and calls, media outlets scrambled for interviews and information. \n\nOne outlet falsely claimed Trump had died, prompting his team to quickly draft and send a statement declaring Trump was \"fine.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the now-president was wheeled out for a CT scan to check for a concussion, which came back clear, and he requested the records.Trump asked a nurse: \"Can you give me a copy of these? Because I want to make sure I can show reporters that my cognitive function is 100 percent. You can’t say the same about Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe nurse responded: \"We can put it on a CD for you,\" to which Trump said he'd \"release at a later date.\"\n\nTrump also requested to see photos from the attack, including one showing a bullet near his head and another of him bloodied but raising his fist defiantly with the American flag behind him.According to Isenstaft, he then exclaimed: \"Wow, that’s iconic. That’s the most American picture I’ve ever seen.\"\n\nBefore being discharged, the author explained how Trump was handed back his bloodied clothes, joking: \"This is going into the museum.\"Despite the injury, Trump did not require extensive medical treatment and was discharged from the hospital shortly after the incident.\n\nThe Republican, who won the U.S. Presidential Election against Dem. candidate Kamala Harris in November, later commented how his ear \"still throbs\" following the assassination attempt.","summary":"In Alex Isenstadt's new book, the author gives a backstage look into the moments after Donald Trump was shot at his Pennsylvania rally in July.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-shot-pennsylvania-rally-inside-information-election/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/YRnRCQGCZ/0x0/donald-trump-shot-pennsylvania-rally-inside-information-election-1742222177239.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 16:10:35","author":"Juliane Pettorossi","authors":["Juliane Pettorossi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":301118538,"title":"Republicans launch bid to make 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' an official mental illness","text":"Republicans launch bid to make 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' an official mental illness\n\nPODCAST: Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Karoline Leavitt and the biggest myth about Trump. Listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy KATELYN CARALLE, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nPublished: 15:22 GMT, 17 March 2025 | Updated: 15:48 GMT, 17 March 2025\n\nTrump Derangement Syndrome could be considered a real mental illness, if Republicans have their way.\n\nA group of GOP senators in Minnesota filed a bill to classify the made-up condition an official disorder.\n\nThe proposal details how Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) manifests as 'verbal expressions of intense hostility' toward Donald Trump and 'overt acts of aggression and violence' against any person or thing that expresses support for the president.\n\nIt claims symptoms produce 'Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald Trump's behavior.'\n\nFor years, pro-Trump pundits and allies have paraded the term around as an insult towards critics who oppose the MAGA agenda and its leader Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X last month that 'Trump Derangement Syndrome is causing Democrats & the media to oppose President Trump's commonsense efforts to cut billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse from our federal government.'\n\n'They can't stand that we finally have a President who actually delivers on his promises,' she added when defending Trump's initiatives to cut billions in government spending and thousands of federal jobs. \n\nRepublicans in the Minnesota Senate are launching a bid to officially classify the so-called Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) as a mental illness \n\nThe bill claims TDS symptoms produce 'Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald Trump's behavior'\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) referenced it during an interview with 'first buddy' Elon Musk.\n\n'I don't think it's an exaggeration to say today, after Donald Trump, the left hates you more than any person on earth,' Cruz said on his podcast The Verdict.\n\n'Yes, I appear to be No. 2. I mean, judged by the various signs,' Musk replied.\n\n'It's derangement, it's Trump derangement syndrome and Elon derangement syndrome,' the senator insisted. 'Why do they hate you so much?'\n\n'Well, because we're clearly over the target,' the billionaire replied. 'If DOGE was ineffective, if we were not actually getting rid of a bunch of waste and fraud and a bunch of that fraud, I mean, the forward we're seeing is overwhelmingly on the left.'\n\n'I mean, it's not zero on the right, but these NGOs are almost all left-wing NGOs that are being funded.'\n\nMinnesota's SF2589 bill states: 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' means the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump.'\n\nWhile 'derangement syndrome' is a political phrase made popular in recent years to mock Trump's enemies and critics, the term was coined in 2003 by the late political commentator Charles Krauthammer to describe critics of then-President George W. Bush.\n\nLast month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt credited TDS as the reason Democrats claim they are against the president's target on federal government's waste, fraud and abuse\n\nThe Minnesota proposal includes the same phrasing Krauthammer used to describe 'Bush derangement syndrome,' which was defined as 'the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency—nay—the very existence of George W. Bush.' \n\nRepublicans in the Minnesota Senate want to redefine the term TDS so it is recognized as a 'mental illness' by the American Psychiatric Association and Zero to Three, a nonprofit for baby and toddler development.\n\nThey are reading the proposed bull before the Minnesota Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Monday.\n\nMinnesota is a blue state that voted 50.9 percent for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election compared to the 46.7 percent that voted for Trump.\n\nKaroline LeavittPoliticsWhite House\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRepublicans launch bid to make 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' an official mental illness\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Trump Derangement Syndrome could be considered a real mental illness, if Republicans have their way.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14507513/republican-bid-trump-derangement-syndrome-mental-illness.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/17/15/96276451-0-image-m-21_1742224690052.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/18/1923489672029094878/1024x576_MP4_1923489672029094878.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-17 15:48:16","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":301112106,"title":"Donald Trump's Approval Rating Enters Uncharted Territory","text":"The American public is becoming more dissatisfied with how President Donald Trump is handling the economy, with one poll showing a majority disapproval for the first time ever.An NBC News survey of 1,000 registered voters found that 54 percent said they disapprove of Trump's job performance on the economy. The poll was conducted between March 7 and 11, and the results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The news network said this was the first time Trump has received a majority negative view of his handling of the economy in national NBC News polling.Newsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.Why It MattersVoters trusting Trump to handle and improve the economy over former Vice President Kamala Harris was seen as pivotal to the Republican's 2024 election victory. The polling suggests there is public frustration that the president is not following through with his campaign promises amid fears of a potential recession and ongoing major tariff plans on international imports.What to KnowThe NBC News poll, released Sunday, shows that while Trump's overall approval rating of 47 percent is among the highest ever scores for him as president, voters are concerned about the state of the economy.More than half (54 percent) said they disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, compared to 44 percent who approve. More voters also expressed disapproval of how the Republican president is handling inflation and the cost of living (55 percent) against 42 percent saying they approve.The poll also shows that 18 percent of voters believe the economy is currently in a \"good\" or \"excellent\" state. In comparison, 43 percent believe the economy is in a poor state and nearly four in 10 (39 percent) of poll respondents said they think the state is in a \"fair\" condition.Other polls have suggested that voters are becoming more concerned with Trump's handling of the economy since he reentered the White House on January 20.A CNN poll, released March 12, found that 56 percent of the public disapproves of his handling of the economy. This figure is higher than at any point during Trump's first term in office, according to CNN polling.The CNN survey was conducted by SSRS from March 6 to 9 among 1,206 U.S. adults. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.A recent YouGov/Economist poll showed that 43 percent of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of jobs and the economy, compared to 47 percent who disapprove. In a previous late January poll, nearly half (49 percent) said they backed Trump's handling of the economy, while 37 percent disapproved.Between the two polls, there has been a 10-point increase in those expressing disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy in just over a month.The latest YouGov/Economist poll was conducted March 9-11 among 1,699 U.S. adults. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.What People Are SayingKristen Hopewell, an economist and director of the University of British Columbia's Liu Institute for Global Issues, previously told Newsweek: \"There's no state that won't be harmed by Trump's tariffs—but some will be hit even harder than others. Tariffs on steel and aluminum will raise costs for manufacturers across the U.S., undermining their competitiveness. This will hurt the biggest hubs of American manufacturing—California, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, and North Carolina—hardest.\"Mark A. DiPlacido, policy adviser at conservative think tank American Compass, wrote in a March 17 opinion piece for Newsweek: \"The tariffs President Trump levied under his first administration raised more than $230 billion in revenue while reducing U.S. dependence on tariffed goods and avoiding inflation. Given the persistence of the U.S. trade deficit, President Trump is right to take tariffs to the next level. Whether through a simple global tariff of 10-20 percent—which could raise as much as $2.2 trillion in revenue over 10 years—or a wider set of reciprocal tariffs based on our trade balance with each foreign nation, the United States must assert its economic interests against the unfair practices of our trading partners.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, responding to a question about a potential recession on NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday, said: \"There are no guarantees. Like, who would've predicted COVID? I can predict that we're putting in robust policies that will be durable. And could there be an adjustment? Because I tell you that this massive government spending that we've had, if that had kept going, we would have to wean our country off of that.\"President Donald Trump, in a February 2 post on Truth Social, wrote: \"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"What Happens NextThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that Trump's tariff plans against Canada and Mexico will harm U.S. GDP growth.The OECD said Monday that U.S. economic growth is projected to be 2.2 percent in 2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026. These figures are down from previous forecasts of 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent respectively.","summary":"The president has a majority against his handling of the economy for the first time in a national NBC News poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-approval-rating-economy-tariffs-2045871","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2608605/donald-trump-aboard-air-force-one.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 15:48:07","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":301092652,"title":"Courtney Love, 60, joins huge list of stars fleeing America because of 'frightening' Donald Trump as she reveals plans to relocate to the UK","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate Middleton's sweet gesture to Irish Guards on St Patrick's Day revealed as she dresses in green to watch annual parade\n\nThe REAL reason behind Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne's shock split after eight years of marriage as EastEnders star steps out for first time without her wedding ring\n\nMeghan Markle responds to claims she's 'out of touch with the real world' following Netflix show\n\nMark Wright's poisonous family rivalry is causing havoc in Essex, insiders tell Kate Hind, as the reality star's ruthless behaviour is exposed\n\nLIZ JONES: When I met the teenage Justin Bieber, he did something that truly shocked me.

For others, that meant resigning from their posts in protest.\"\n\nIn 2024, according to Fahlberg, Trump and his team wanted to avoid hiring someone who, like Miles Taylor, wasn't committed to the MAGA cause.\n\nTaylor was serving as chief of staff of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) when, in 2018, he wrote an anonymous op-ed for the New York Times that described his efforts to push back against Trump policies he considered harmful. The op-ed was famously headlined \" I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The only ways to fight the Trump regime's use of fear and intimidation\n\nAfter coming out as the person who wrote that op-ed, Taylor endorsed Joe Biden for president in 2020 and Harris in 2024. Taylor hasn't been shy about attacking Trump as anti-democracy. \n\nJames Blair, Trump's deputy White House chief of staff, described Trump's second administration as a \"pretty battle-hardened\" group of loyalists.\n\nAccording to GOP lobbyist and former Trump campaign official David Urban, the president's second administration is much more compliant than the first. \n\nUrban told the National Review, \"(In 2016), a lot of people had, I would say, potentially different views on how things should be executed, right? And they were trying to get things done the way they thought the president wanted…. Donald Trump doesn't need an interpreter….This time, they're just doing what he says.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump pollster John McLaughlin told the Review, \"There was turnover within his first administration. This time around, he clearly is picking people that he's had longer relationships with. There's more recognition of who's really out to achieve the goals of what the president said his movement is about, rather than people who are about themselves.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Revealed: Trump halted a clean-up that puts hundreds of thousands at risk for poisoning","summary":"During his first term as president, Donald Trump received a great deal of pushback from non-MAGA conservatives who served in his administration — including those hired as White House chief of staff (John F.

The process stems from complaints by leftwing legal group, The 65 Project, which targeted 111 Trump-associated lawyers–including Eastman–for discipline in contesting Joe Biden’s 2020 election win. \n\nEastman is targeted for his legal argument that then-Vice President Mike Pence could delay counting Electoral College votes from states deemed contested during the certification of Joe Biden win on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRegarding the other matter, Trump signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose work with the Democrat-aligned law firm Perkins Coie. The firm is known for promoting the discredited Steele dossier that alleged Trump was a Russian agent. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, a Barack Obama appointee, temporarily blocked the Trump order in response to a Perkins Coie lawsuit.\n\nEastman, former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, said he planned to bring up the arguments by Perkins Coie and Democrat attorneys general in his hearing next week, calling the proximity of the two cases almost like a script. \n\nEastman stressed the lawfare against lawyers for Trump violates the First Amendment and will have an obvious chilling effect on lawyers in future politically-charged cases.\n\n“I am hopeful that judges can apply the law in an impartial way separate and apart from their personal or political prejudices,” said Eastman, the founding director of the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence. \n\nThe 65 Project’s targeting of 111 Trump-aligned lawyers across the country who challenged the 2020 election outcome had mixed success. \n\n“It was a concerted effort from lawfare groups, a nationwide conspiracy to deprive lawyers for Donald Trump of their constitutional rights,” Eastman said. “That makes it federally actionable.”\n\nHe added, “I hope the new FBI director is investigating.” Trump appointed Kash Patel as the new FBI director. \n\nThe first bar hearing for Eastman began on June 20, 2023, almost a year before the initial ruling on March 27, 2024 by State Bar Court Judge Yvette Roland, who recommended Eastman’s disbarment. Roland had been a Democrat donor. \n\n“I’m not aware of any that are longer or expensive. Most bar hearings are a few days,” Eastman said. \n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics, Roland as a California lawyer contributed $500 to the Obama 2008 presidential campaign, $1,250 to Obama’s 2012 campaign, and $450 to the 2010 Kamala Harris attorney general campaign. In 2022, as a judge, Roland contributed $250 to the gubernatorial campaign of Gavin Newsom, according to OpenSecrets. \n\nEastman said he spent about $1 million defending his law license. \n\nAfter the appeal division decides, the matter can go to the California Supreme Court. \n\n“If we win the appeal, that should be the end of it. But I expect the hyper partisan bar prosecutors to appeal it,” Eastman said. \n\nEastman maintains that a vice president’s role in the certification process of a president was not settled law. \n\n“Case law in California is clear that even if you think an argument is likely to lose, you are ethically obligated to make a plausible, tenable argument for your client,” Eastman said.\n\nCongress passed a bipartisan Electoral Reform Act of 2022 that included a provision specifically stating the vice president only has a ceremonial role when votes are counted. Trump said passing of the law meant the vice president previously had a role in the count. \n\n“The Constitution is not clear here. I was making a plausible argument. I think it was right,” Eastman said. “But even if it was wrong, it was tenable. To disbar someone for advancing a tenable argument is outrageous.”","summary":"The irony is striking for John Eastman, a constitutional attorney and one of President Donald Trump’s lawyers in the litigated post-2020 election.&#160; One week before...

But at least Newsom is doing something unlike former vice president Kamala Harris, who is one of the frontrunners to be the next California Governor if she considers to contest, Democratic supporters feel. According to Democratic insiders, Kamala Harris is absolutely missing in action after her defeat in the presidential election apart from her blink-and-miss appearances for which she gets mostly trolled. Citing a source, PageSix reported that Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff is telling people that Harris is the leader of the party but no one knows what she is doing. Dem donors who spent billions for Harris' campaign are left high and dry. \"The person you just spent $2 billion on trying to elect? I’m glad she’s having a good time going to a musical, and being repped by CAA,” said the insider, but “this whole strategy of ‘Do not do anything, or say anything,’ that’s not the kind of leadership the world needs right now.”“One of her problems is that she’s the most risk-averse person on the planet. That’s one of the reasons she lost,” one source told PageSix.Kamla Harris skipped the Oscars this year and instead watched it at home. She also spoke about it at the HumanX conference recently for which she got only trolled as her \"word-salads\" are still beyond comprehension. Harris has, however, set a deadline about deciding on what to do -- before the end of the summer. Id Harris decided to enter the race to succeed Gavin Newsom and wins, the she would not be able to enter the 2028 presidential run. Harris has also kept on some of her most senior and trusted aides under her newly formed organization Pioneer49, including chief of staff Sheila Nix and senior advisers Kirsten Allen and Ike Irby. Longtime advisers Brian Nelson and Minyon Moore as well as her White House chief of staff Lorraine Voles all remain key parts of her informal kitchen cabinet. Other top aides in California are waiting for the signal from Harris to engage, Politico reported.","summary":"Citing a source, PageSix reported that Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff is telling people that Harris is the leader of the party but no one knows what she is doing.

It’s becoming clear | Margaret Sullivan","text":"Gavin Newsom’s choice of guests – a parade of rightwingers – on his new podcast might seem baffling.\n\nAfter all, the California governor is seen as a mostly progressive Democrat from a very blue state whose reputation is that of a coastal elite.

This is the guy who trashes the reality-based press as the “opposition party”, and who believes in bamboozling the American people into submission by “flooding the zone with shit”.\n\nIf you had to name the five people most responsible for Trump’s still-shocking rise to power, Bannon’s name would belong on that list. Don’t forget that he was sent to prison for criminal contempt of Congress after refusing to cooperate with the House of Representatives investigation of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nBut Newsom found Bannon worthy of a cordial chat blasted out to his growing podcast audience.\n\nFor some, it boggles the mind.\n\n“I know what Steve Bannon got out of that interview – his fringe views were elevated and validated,” one prominent Democratic member of Congress told the journalist Oliver Darcy. “I don’t know what Gavin or Democrats got out of it.” Those “views”, naturally, included the repeated lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nAs Martin Pengelly reported in the Guardian, one red-state Democrat – someone who knows a lot about bridging the gap in American politics – heartily disapproves.\n\n“We shouldn’t be afraid to talk and to debate just about anyone,” said Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, “but Steve Bannon espouses hatred and anger, and even at some points violence, and I don’t think we should give him oxygen on any platform, ever, anywhere.” (Beshear, it should be noted, may also be looking at a presidential run, and was considered as Harris’s running mate last year.)\n\nSo what the heck is Newsom’s strategy, exactly?\n\nIf you ask one of his podcast guests – Kirk, the pro-Trump extremist and podcaster – it’s simple enough.\n\nIn an opinion piece on the Fox News website that followed his podcast appearance, Kirk called the California governor savvy and charming, but most of all ambitious. Newsom, Kirk quipped, wanted to be president more than any other person alive – and maybe dead, too.\n\n“He has a shark’s instincts and is hoping the voters will have a goldfish’s memory,” he posited.\n\nAdam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman and vocal anti-Trumper, finds that infuriating.\n\n“Many of us on the right sacrificed careers to fight Bannon, and Newsom is trying to make a career and a presidential run by building him up,” Kinzinger told Pengelly.\n\nMake no mistake. There is a legitimate issue underlying this disagreement.\n\nDemocrats are justifiably searching for a way to reach that wide swath of voters who seem permanently turned off to their party.\n\nAnd whatever one’s politics or affiliation, we all know that the US is terribly and destructively polarized. We must find a way to talk to each other across the great divide. We really do need to seek common ground.\n\nBut the way to do it is not to normalize conspiracy theorists who have already done so much damage. It’s not to offer chummy chats – with little or no pushback – to those who want to trash vulnerable people, including transgender individuals and immigrants, or to repeat lies about a stolen election.\n\nThis “rebrand” may help Newsom’s efforts to present himself as a healer or a centrist as he prepares to run for president in 2028.\n\nBut anybody who’s paying close attention should know that what he’s doing is deeply cynical and ultimately counterproductive.\n\n Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture","summary":"The California governor is seeking to reposition himself for a possible 2028 presidential run.

But in the early days of his second term, public views about his economic performance have quickly become his most conspicuous potential vulnerability.\nEven before Trump rattled the stock market this week by acknowledging his trade agenda could trigger a recession, several public polls had shown his job approval for managing the economy lagging below his overall job performance rating as president.\nThat’s a dramatic reversal from Trump’s first term, when approval for his handling of the economy exceeded his overall approval rating every time the CNN/SRSS, Gallup or CNBC polls asked the public about both over his four years.\nIn an early February poll this year, by contrast, Gallup found, for the first time, that fewer people gave Trump positive marks on the economy than on his overall performance — and that his economic grades were lower than at any point during his first four years. Likewise, the CNN/SRSS poll released Wednesday found Trump’s approval rating on the economy (44%) fell slightly below his overall approval rating (45%) for the first time in either of his presidential terms — and matched the lowest economic approval rating the survey ever recorded during his first four years. Since January, the public’s assessment of Trump’s economic performance has often come in below his rating for any other major issue, such as immigration or foreign affairs.\nThis early into his term, opinions about Trump’s economic management are hardly set in stone. Pollsters agree most Americans are willing to give him more time to make progress on inflation, the issue that mattered to more of his voters than any other in Election Day polls. (Inflation rose slightly less than expected in the latest government report released Wednesday.) In many surveys, Trump’s overall job approval is slightly higher than at this point in his first term (though still below that of any other new president in the history of modern polling this soon after taking office).\nBut the inversion of the first-term pattern on his economic approval still represents an early warning signal for Trump. It suggests that if he can’t make progress against high prices, the same frustration with inflation that sapped support for Joe Biden could ultimately weaken Trump, too — particularly because polls also show that most voters do not see Trump prioritizing inflation as much as they do themselves.\nThe fact that public support for Trump’s handling of the economy has dipped so early in his second term “is a red flag for him,” said long-time Democratic pollster Nick Gourevitch. “In the election, there were a ton of different topics, but the number one topic in every single poll, and with every key group that switched (toward Trump), was economics and inflation. If voters were telling us they wanted something to change, it was that. So, if that doesn’t change, and that’s where the voters who put you in office wanted you to go, that’s a problem for him.”\nIn Trump’s first term, confidence in the economy was a stabilizing force for him, reinforcing a floor under his standing with the public even when he was battered by storms on other fronts. At the outset of his second term, these early results suggest apprehension about the economy has become a source of political instability for Trump — and a potential ceiling on his support.\nRisks for upcoming elections\nTrump will never again appear on a ballot — assuming he is not serious in his frequent comments about breaking the Constitutional limit of two presidential terms. But as American politics has grown more polarized, a president’s approval rating has become a huge factor in elections during his tenure. In 2018, for instance, exit polls found that fully 9 in 10 voters who disapproved of Trump’s performance supported Democratic House candidates, while nearly as many who approved of him backed Republicans. Even though Biden was not on the ballot in 2024, over 4 in 5 voters who disapproved of his performance likewise voted against his successor in the race, Vice President Kamala Harris. The stronger Trump is, the better Republican chances will be in every election through 2028, and vice versa for Democrats.\nAnd, as for every president, voters’ views about the economy will be a critical determinant of that strength.\nThough Trump has portrayed his second term as the dawn of a new “golden age” for the country, surveys consistently show his return to the White House has done little to dispel Americans’ gloom about the economy.\nThe University of Michigan’s venerable Index of Consumer Sentiment showed a bump in economic optimism after Trump’s victory last fall, driven mostly by improved assessments among Republicans. But in February, the first full month of Trump’s second term, the index notably dipped, falling even below its level during the final months of Biden’s term. Though the public’s assessment of current economic conditions in the survey slightly improved in February compared to last fall, that was outweighed by a sharp deterioration in Americans’ future expectations. In fact, the University of Michigan found respondents more pessimistic about their personal financial prospects over the next year than at any point in 2024. In the new CNN poll, the share of voters expecting the economy to be in poor shape one year from now also spiked between January and February.\nThe wellspring of this continuing unease isn’t difficult to identify. The latest University of Michigan poll found expectations about future inflation surged in both January and February. In a late February CBS/YouGov national poll, over three-fourths of those surveyed said their incomes were not keeping pace with prices. (The results on that question were equally glum among White, Black and Latino respondents.) In an NPR/PBS-News/Marist poll taken around the same time, nearly three-fifths of adults said they expected grocery prices to increase over the next six months.\nCustomers shop for produce at an H-E-B grocery store on February 12 in Austin.\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\nEarly polls consistently show good marks for Trump on some issues, particularly immigration, and this week’s CNN/SRSS survey found about half of Americans believe he can bring needed change and manage the government effectively.\nBut polls show the intractable concern about prices that helped propel Trump back to the White House is now functioning more as a headwind against him. Trump’s 42% economic approval rating in Gallup’s February poll was three percentage points lower than his nadir during his first term (45% in April 2017). The 56% share of Americans who disapproved of Trump’s economic performance in the new CNN/SRSS poll far exceeded his worst first term result; at no point in Trump’s first four years did a majority of Americans disapprove of his economic management in a CNN poll.\nAcross all these measures, the numbers are especially precarious for Trump among independent voters. Independents’ assessment of current conditions in the latest University of Michigan survey, and their expectations for future conditions, were both worse than at any point during Trump’s first term — even the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Fewer than one-third of independents approved of his economic performance in the February Gallup poll; that was also lower than at any point during his first term, according to results provided by Gallup. In this week’s CNN/SRSS poll, only 20% of independents thought Trump’s policies had improved the economy; nearly three times as many thought his agenda has hurt economic conditions.\nJay Campbell, a Democratic pollster who conducts the CNBC survey on the economy with a Republican partner, said Trump’s extraordinary bond with his base ensures he will maintain a solid floor of support regardless of what happens in the economy.\nBut the economic results, Campbell predicted, will heavily influence Trump’s standing with the less partisan voters who can tip elections, such as this fall’s gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and next year’s midterms. “We know from the last couple of decades of polling that independents are highly sensitive to pocketbook issues and to the economy, much more than any other political issue,” Campbell said.\nMicah Roberts, the Republican pollster who partners on the CNBC economic survey, said these sagging assessments of Trump’s economic performance should not concern him — yet. “I think it’s a little early to be waving any type of warning flags about what this means for his presidency,” Roberts said.\nRoberts pointed out that even during Trump’s first term, his approval ratings on the economy started relatively modest and then substantially improved over the next three years, until the pandemic erupted in early 2020.\nTrump’s strength with the public on the economy “hasn’t gone away,” Roberts said. “People still believe he has strong ideas on the economy. I think it will take a while for his policies to start making a difference and then he’ll do what he does very well” — i.e., market the results.\nAlso benefiting the president is that voters’ dismal assessment of Biden’s economic performance has clearly weakened the Democrats’ credibility as an alternative. Even polling conducted late last month by Gourevitch’s firm and a partner found that more voters trust Republicans than Democrats to handle inflation and the economy.\nStill, Roberts agrees voters will remain patient only for so long. Americans are closely watching Trump’s “ability to improve economic conditions for everybody, including the people who are struggling the most, so he is going to be held to that standard,” Roberts said. “My question would be: Is this the right time to start measuring that — some 40 days in? In June, I think if things drop off further specifically with Republicans and independents then you can start (to see) flashing yellow lights.”\nHas Trump taken his eye off the ball?\nLike many Republican strategists, Roberts believes the waves of disruption Trump has brought to domestic and international policy are delivering to his voters exactly what they wanted. “It just seems like it’s a firehose of new direction that I think by and large for his core supporters is being received very, very well,” Roberts said. “This is the stuff they voted for.”\nBut Democrats see this same geyser of controversy as a vulnerability for Trump. They believe it signals to voters that he has lost focus on inflation, the public’s top concern.\n“Nothing about his first few weeks has really been around the core problem that voters believe is most important,” said Gourevitch. “I don’t think people are hearing a focus on inflation and costs from Trump.”\nPolls support that analysis. In Wednesday’s CNN/SRSS poll, nearly three-fifths of all adults — and two-thirds of independents — said Trump hasn’t paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems. The late February CBS poll documented the gap most dramatically: While about 4 in 5 Americans said the economy and inflation should be the highest priority for Trump, only about one-third said they believed Trump was prioritizing either of them.\nIn that CBS poll, most people said Trump was primarily focused on immigration — which was a central concern for his voters — and shrinking the federal workforce. Campbell argues that whatever voters feel about the Elon Musk-led effort to squeeze federal agencies, they simply do not consider it as relevant as the continuing pressure on their cost of living.\nUS Army soldiers patrol the US-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, on January 24.\nCharly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n“Nobody likes ‘waste and fraud’ in the federal government, and people think it can be fixed, but at the end of the day that doesn’t affect their daily lives and nobody believes it does,” Campbell said. “It all ladders up to, ‘What is this administration doing that is helping me now?’ And people don’t have anything they can point to in that regard.”\nThe belief among most voters that Trump is not focused on their principal concern —inflation — is a risky position for any elected official. But the greater risk for Trump will come if voters conclude his agenda is not so much ignoring the problem of inflation as compounding it.\nPublic opinion on tariffs is somewhat unsettled, because they are not an issue that many Americans have deeply held views about. But surveys leave no doubt many are concerned that Trump’s on-again, off-again flurry of new levies could cause prices to rise, despite his promises to the contrary. In an Economist/YouGov survey released earlier this week, 7 in 10 adults said tariffs would raise prices, and 3 in 5 said that such levies would hurt, not help, average Americans.\nThe debate coming later this year over the Republican plan to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts will offer Democrats another chance to portray the GOP agenda as raising costs for families. That’s because the House and Senate Republican tax and spending plans are likely to retrench Washington’s spending on Medicaid and subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to help fund the extension of the tax cuts.\nStill, regardless of how voters interpret these policy debates, or even whether they are fully aware of them, pollsters agree what makes inflation unique is that Americans reach an unfiltered judgment about its direction in their daily experience. “The one difference between costs and every other political issue is that there is not a news or social media lens that can impact your perception,” said Gourevitch. “You know how much eggs cost when you go to the grocery store.”\nTrump’s unbreakable hold on his base voters, his formidable skills as a political communicator, and the entrenched doubts about Democrats may provide him some defense if discontent over inflation persists. Democrats privately expect that Trump eventually will seek to send Americans a direct payment with his name on it (as he did during Covid), marketed this time as a “dividend” from tariff revenues or DOGE savings.\nBut the clear signal of Trump’s first weeks back in the White House is that he isn’t immune from inflation’s corrosive effect. Over time, Trump may find it no easier than Biden to keep his approval ratings high if prices remain high as well.","summary":"CNN  —  In President Donald Trump’s first White House term, public confidence in his handling of the economy was always among his greatest strengths.

While Obama, Roosevelt and Truman described themselves as \"public servants,\" Bianco writes, Trump sees himself as a \"monarch ordained by a god.\"\n\nREAD MORE:'Sounds like Putin': Trump blasted for declaring top news organizations 'illegal'\n\n\"From using the White House's South Lawn to shill cars for his biggest campaign donor to demanding taxpayer-funded ads that claim he victoriously closed the southern border,\" Bianco observes, \"President Donald Trump is demonstrating that, as he stated in his first term, he has 'the right to do whatever I want.' That's his twisted interpretation of Article 2 of the Constitution, which describes the power of the president.\"\n\nBianco continues, \"Yet the president of the United States is not a king. He’s not a monarch ordained by a god….. As mass protests against the Trump Administration take place across the nation, let us remember the historical role and responsibility of the president and what others who've held the office have had to say about the responsibility that comes with the position.\"\n\nThe journalist/author notes that in a May 1918 op-ed for the Kansas City Star, Roosevelt wrote, \"The president is merely the most important among a large number of public servants.\" And in July 1954, Truman said, \"I would much rather be an honorable public servant and known as such than to be the richest man in the world.\"\n\nThen, in a November 2020 appearance on CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Obama described the president of the United States' as a \"public servant\" who needed to represent the public's interest, not their own.\n\nREAD MORE: The only ways to fight the Trump regime's use of fear and intimidation\n\n\"We, the American people, are responsible to each other to secure the health of our democracy,\" Bianco argues. \"This means we must elect to office presidents who are committed to public service, and if we fail at that, then we must use our First Amendment rights to protest against them.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Revealed: Trump halted a clean-up that puts hundreds of thousands at risk for poisoning","summary":"After Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by roughly 1.5 percent in the popular vote in the United States' 2024 presidential race, many far-right white evangelical Christian fundamentalists didn't view the outcome as Trump narrowly winning a close election.
