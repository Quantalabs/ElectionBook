If elected in November, the 33-year-old would become the first Muslim mayor in New York City’s history. \n\nAccording to city officials, Mr Mamdani had taken 43 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of ballots counted. Mr Cuomo, who was at around 36 per cent, confirmed to supporters he had called his rival and conceded — and appeared to have no chance to catch his rival. \n\nMr Mamdani’s triumph was widely celebrated by Democrats and New Yorkers – but not by the US President, who weighed in on the political upset in his former hometown in a series of furious Truth Social posts. \n\n“It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line,” Mr Trump wrote. \n\n“Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. \n\n“He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling (sic) over him. Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!”\n\nMr Schumer, who is US Senate minority leader, is Jewish and not of Palestinian heritage. Mr Trump’s “AOC+3” is in reference to the so-called progressive squad in Congress that includes New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \n\nIn a follow-up post, Mr Trump declared Ms Ocasio-Cortez an “Low IQ Candidate”.\n\n“Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, and our Country is really SCREWED!,” he declared. \n\nProminent conservative activists, meanwhile, targeted Mr Mamdani’s Muslim faith, tying him to 9/11 in a barrage of vile xenophobic attacks. \n\nMAGA-aligned social media personality Laura Loomer claimed that “New York City will be destroyed” and that the city “is about to see 9/11 2.0”. \n\n“If the Muslim Brotherhood would have been designated as a terrorist org, @ZohranKMamdani could have been prevented from running for office,” Loomer wrote.\n\n“Get ready for Muslims to start committing jihad all over New York.” \n\nConservative activist Charlie Kirk also invoked the September 11 Al-Qaeda attacks. \n\n“24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11,” he wrote. \n\n“Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City.” \n\nWhile Donald Trump Jr declared that “New York City has fallen”. \n\nIn the closing days of the race, Mr Mamdani remarked on the countless attacks he’d faced because of his religion. \n\n“I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim’,” he said at a press conference. “I get threats on my life, on the people that I love. And I try not to talk about it.”\n\nIn his victory speech on Wednesday, Mr Mamdani said: “Tonight we made history”, adding that New Yorkers “have stood up for a city they can afford”. \n\nThat Mr Mamdani, the son of Indian immigrants, has also spoken out for Palestinians and accused Israel of “genocide” in its ongoing assault on Gaza makes him a prime target for the President and the Republican faithful. \n\nHis success has been seen as a rebuke to Democratic centrists who backed the powerful Mr Cuomo, as the party flails nationally in search of a way to counter the President’s hard-right movement. Democrats have struggled to make their case as a credible alternative to Republicans since Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat to Mr Trump — seen in part as repudiation of identity politics and so-called “woke” ideology.\n\n“It’s a political earthquake,” director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, Lee Miringoff, told The New York Post. \n\n“An unknown defeating Andrew Cuomo is a changing of the guard. More Democratic voters are younger, and their views have to be taken into account.” \n\nDemocratic consultant Trip Yang described it to The New York Times as “the biggest upset in modern New York City history”. \n\n“The race shows Democratic voters are growing tired of the same old faces and they’re willing to bet on newcomers,” said political strategist Andrew Koneschusky, a top former Democratic Senate aide.\n\n“Looking ahead, we may see more competitive Democratic primaries and more upsets like this. That’s bad news for establishment Democrats, but can be good for the party overall.”","summary":"The US President unleashed on the unlikely victor of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary race, blasting his politics and “terrible” looks.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/communist-lunatic-donald-trump-slams-zohran-mamdanis-nyc-mayoral-primary-win/news-story/dde9a202f51541fdc0067679ddcd248d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4670331ecf8306337bacfdaf30330c61","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 00:48:01","author":"Natalie Brown","authors":["Natalie Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":335246464,"title":"Mediator in Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, CBS News proposes $20 million settlement","text":"The mediator involved in President Donald Trump's lawsuit against Paramount and CBS News reportedly proposed a $20 million settlement to end the high-stakes legal battle. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump and Paramount's legal teams were presented with a proposal to end the president's $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to sources familiar with the matter. The proposal, per the WSJ, would have Paramount making a $17 million donation to a Trump presidential foundation or museum and paying millions more in legal fees and public service announcements on Paramount-owned networks to combat antisemitism. CBS BLASTS TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER Last month, Trump rejected Paramount's $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology. According to the Wall Street Journal, Paramount \"isn’t prepared\" to give one. \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account,\" Trump attorney Ed Paltzik told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"CBS and Paramount targeted the President in an attempt to harm his reputation while committing the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion.\" Paramount did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCERS RAIL AGAINST TRUMP'S ‘BULLS---’ LAWSUIT, DREAD PROPSECTS OF PARAMOUNT MAKING SETTLEMENT Last October, Trump sued CBS News and Paramount for $10 billion over allegations of election interference involving the \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the presidential election (the amount has since jumped to $20 billion). The lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of deceitfully editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION The raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. CBS News has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder who recused herself from settlement discussions in February, made clear that she wanted to settle Trump's lawsuit in hopes of clearing the pathway for Paramount's multibillion-dollar planned merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration's FCC. However, there has been newsroom drama in recent months involving Redstone's efforts to \"keep tabs\" on the network's reporting of Trump, at least until the merger closes. That led to the abrupt resignations of \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who claimed he could no longer maintain editorial independence, in April, and CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon in May.","summary":"A mediator involved in President Donald Trump&apos;s $20 billion lawsuit against Paramount proposed a $20 million settlement, according to The Wall Street Journal.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/mediator-trumps-lawsuit-against-paramount-cbs-news-proposes-20-million-settlement","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/trump-60mins-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 23:00:15","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":335235712,"title":"Skydance boss David Ellison tells Hollywood pals that Paramount merger will close before end of summer: sources","text":"Skydance Media boss David Ellison has been striking an upbeat tone in his quest to purchase Shari Redstone’s Paramount, On The Money has learned.\n\nThe budding movie mogul’s quiet confidence to media insiders in recent days may seem a bit odd for regular readers of On The Money. We’ve been chronicling how the $8 billion deal faces significant headwinds from the Trump administration’s regulatory apparatus, and the president’s own legal team.\n\nNot according to Ellison, however. In fact, the son of billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison has been telling people in TV and movie circles out in Los Angeles that he believes the deal will go through before the end of summer – well before its drop-dead date in October when both sides need to walk away if the deal isn’t completed, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly why Ellison – whose independent studio has produced hits like “Top Gun: Maverick” and the latest “Mission: Impossible” sequels – is so optimistic because much of the news surrounding the transaction has been anything but encouraging.\n\nTrump’s regulators are stalling their mandatory approval as they investigate if Paramount’s CBS News subsidiary violated Federal Communications Commission guidelines that its content must be free of political bias; conservatives have complained about CBS’s left-wing bias for years – a charge the network has vehemently denied.\n\nTrump has also filed a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS in Texas federal court, charging the network’s “60 Minutes” with violating an obscure state business law in a case involving its controversial interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. Trump claims the sit-down with his Democratic opponent was deceptively edited. Paramount believes the deal’s regulatory approval is contingent on a settlement.\n\nYet, as On The Money previously reported, Redstone’s management team and board are worried about being on the hook for bribery charges if the payment is seen as a quid-pro-quo to get the deal done. That’s because their boss, Redstone, would receive a $2 billion payout once the merger is complete.\n\nBut maybe Ellison knows something we don’t know. Both sides in the lawsuit have recently held settlement discussions, On The Money has learned. They’ve discussed a payment of $35 million to end the lawsuit, a far cry from the $20 billion headline number and lower than the $50 million Team Trump originally sought.\n\nAs On The Money has reported, a potential settlement has been discussed where CBS runs millions of dollars in public service ads for causes of the president’s liking, such as combating antisemitism, as well as making a lower cash payment.\n\nSources say the mediator has warmed up to the idea of PSAs and a smaller monetary payment than what Trump has sought. But it’s unclear if Trump will agree to those terms.\n\n“President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account,” Trump lawyer Ed Paltzik told On The Money on Wednesday.\n\n“CBS and Paramount targeted the president in an attempt to harm his reputation while committing the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion.”\n\nA Paramount spokesman had no comment. A spokeswoman for David Ellison declined comment.\n\nTrump recently praised the Oracle scion as someone who will be great running Paramount, and would change the culture at CBS, or as Trump put it (in his usual understated way): “They are all getting fired” when ownership changes.\n\nDavid Ellison’s dad, Larry Ellison is supplying the money (some of his $250 billion in net worth) for the Paramount merger, and as reported, he has an open line to the White House given his relationship with the president.\n\nMedia industry insiders say there could also be a scenario where the deal is approved before the lawsuit is settled. Ellison then could write Trump the check after he takes over at Paramount.\n\nOr maybe Paramount is ready to just bite the bullet and pay Trump close to what he wants. Legal experts say any bribery case would be a stretch in court. Trump has been wringing settlements out of other companies over similar squabbles, and Paramount could make the case that even paying Trump $50 million is less than the cost of litigation.\n\nSo, there might be good reasons for David Ellison’s optimism that he will bag both a major movie studio and the Tiffany Network.","summary":"Maybe Ellison knows something we don't know.

The Democratic leader of the House, Hakeem Jeffries, was born in Brooklyn and today represents a Brooklyn district. The Democratic leader of the Senate, Charles Schumer, was elected statewide but is a lifelong resident of Brooklyn. The party’s ranking superstar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was born in the Bronx and today represents a district that covers part of the Bronx and Queens. The party’s other ranking superstar, Bernie Sanders, while a senator from Vermont, was born and raised in Brooklyn.\n\nThe New York contingent essentially is the leadership of the Democratic Party today. Yes, there are the Californians — the aged Nancy Pelosi, the failed former Vice President Kamala Harris, and the ambitious Gov. Gavin Newsom — but in a coastal party, it is the East Coast that is in command.\n\nOf course, you will say, “Wait a minute, the Republican president is from New York, too.” And indeed, Donald Trump was born and raised in Queens. But he couldn’t get elected in his home city. And the rest of the Republican Party represents more geographical diversity — a House speaker from Louisiana, a Senate majority leader from South Dakota, a vice president from Appalachia.\n\nAfter the 2024 election, Democratic pollster Mark Penn wrote that Trump was elected by “Americans who feel abandoned by the coastal elites and a Democratic Party that moved too far from mainstream America.” Voters, Penn said, “sent a clear message to the coastal elites that it is the working class and middle America that runs this country.”\n\nThat’s bad news for a party that is heavily concentrated in a few coastal enclaves. It’s even worse when the biggest coastal enclave shows its values by electing Mamdani. There are probably a lot of things Democrats might do to broaden their appeal beyond the coastal areas, but that is definitely not one of them.","summary":"THE NYC PARTY. The political world is buzzing over the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, unexpectedly won by Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old Ugandan-born Muslim socialist who, in the course of his brief career in politics, has advocated defunding the police, freeing criminals, having the city take over grocery stores, and more.

The crowd surged, chanting “Free Mayor Baraka.” Then a familiar voice on a bullhorn cut through the clamor: Zohran Mamdani had taken the train in from New York to join the crowd.\n\nProtesters tightened around him. “At a time when too many think the only option is surrender, we have to show the mayor that we have his back,” Mamdani said, the line aimed squarely at Democratic national leaders. Brad Lander and a handful of other Democrats spoke, too, but every camera, including mine, stayed locked on Mamdani. That burst of authority, in a state where he holds no office and can’t even vote, convinced me of his potential, weeks before his upset of Andrew Cuomo in the New York City primary race for mayor.\n\nAfter clinching the Democratic nomination, Mamdani is now on track to become the first Muslim mayor of any U.S. city with a seven-figure population (New York dwarfs the populations of Michigan cities Dearborn or Hamtramck by 30 times). The office he’s vying for commands a $100-billion-plus budget and the largest police force in the country. For Muslims like me, that hits hard. We’ve spent decades under New York Police Department surveillance and “Demographics Unit” informants. I still remember the anti-terror squad that questioned me for hours about my connections to global jihad after I was arrested on a simple trespassing charge while taking photos. The symbolism of having a Muslim mayor is nice, sure. But it’s the control over the NYPD that for me—and likely many more Muslims, especially those who had it much worse—makes Mamdani’s victory feel like the impossible has suddenly become possible.\n\nMany believed the Democratic primary for mayor would merely be a formality for Cuomo, given his name recognition and despite his disgrace. In his run for the position, the former governor unleashed an establishment-tested megadonor-sponsored blitz, an attempt to win via moneyed brute force. Fix the City, one of several super PACs that funded his campaign, burned through $25 million carpet-bombing voters with TV ads and mailers that characterized his biggest opponent, Zohran, as dangerous. In response, Zohran countered with 50,000 volunteers as his campaign boasted of a remarkable “1.5 million doors knocked.” It’s a strategy that appears to have paid off. It should have strategists on both sides of the aisle taking note.\n\nI saw that difference up close on the last night of Ramadan earlier this year. I’d tagged along as Mamdani ricocheted between Chaand Raat street fairs in the Bronx and Queens. My ears perked up when the same hushed questions about Gaza surfaced—where other Democrats I’ve covered slip into canned empathy or pivot to poll-tested “balance,” Mamdani leaned in. He answered at length, never once glancing at a handler for permission, instead just jumping into clearly genuine thoughts on the moral cost of “dodging hard truths.” Consultants told Kamala Harris to sidestep that very topic in 2024 and she lost to Donald Trump. I think last night’s primary shows that voters can hear the difference between these too-carefully-crafted messages and what Mamdani did.\n\nEarly analysis says Mamdani’s upset was powered by a surge of younger voters. Not only did he go on the record backing the student encampments that Mayor Eric Adams condemned and dispatched an armored NYPD to clear, Mamdani pledged to honor the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Notably, when pressed on fealty to the current state of Israel, he refused to accept anything short of a state “with equal rights for all.” Polling now shows young Americans likelier to oppose U.S. military aid to Israel than support it, a reality Cuomo and other establishment Democrats miss.\n\nBy refusing to triangulate, Mamdani left his opponents only one card to play, the ugliest one: Islamophobia. That became the cri de coeur particularly of Republicans who will try to make this victory representative of some kind of imaginary threat. Minutes after the upset, right-wing figures were screaming “terrorist.” Charlie Kirk invoked 9/11; Elise Stefanik warned of “dangerous insanity.” The slurs echoed every insult Muslims here have absorbed since the 2000s, only this time it sounds more like pathetic cope than a denouncement of their neighbors. This primary feels like a rebuke of Islamophobia. Finally.\n\nWhich brings me to the national collision course: Mamdani’s win comes right on the heels of Donald Trump’s attempts to edge closer to his dream to “liberate” blue cities with fresh ICE raids, as he’s being doing this summer in Los Angeles. Already, Trump has posted a rant on Truth Social about Mamdani’s victory, calling him a “Communist Lunatic.”\n\nWhat does it mean that New York Democrats just nominated the man who vows to “stand up for our sanctuary city policies which have kept New Yorkers safe, and use every tool at the city’s disposal to protect our immigrants”? The man who was literally on ICE’s doorstep when his mayoral candidate opponent, Brad Lander, was cuffed and detained for contesting an ICE arrest in a New York City federal building? It means November now looks like a straight referendum on immigrant rights—and whether or not the Democratic Party has any fight left in them. What we saw this week is that Democratic voters certainly do.\n\nFor Muslim New Yorkers, a massive electorate that also suffers from chronically low turnout, the idea that American politics is designed to exclude us has just been shattered. My own father once voted for George Bush, before the Iraq War. He now writes off voting as “picking the lighter boot.” But Mamdani’s surge might be the kind of thing to give my dad, and my many equally cynical Muslim friends, hope. Those same people are now basking in the delight of watching online trolls spiral as they belch “terrorist” while reckoning with his likelihood to win the mayorship in November.\n\nIn Democrat circles, Mamdani is catching more grief for being a socialist than for being Muslim, but once again, he is flipping derision into momentum. The Democratic base in New York isn’t allergic to unapologetic Muslim identity—it’s starving for moral coherence and material promises on affordability, housing, and public safety.\n\nWill Democrats on a national level take cues from his success? It has been a long time since those Democrats have proven themselves to be good listeners. At least Mamdani is speaking so clearly.","summary":"This should have strategists on both sides of the aisle taking note.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/06/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-election-trump-muslim.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/d29a9db4-9130-41ba-95b4-9714048fa7cc.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 22:07:49","author":"Aymann Ismail","authors":["Aymann Ismail"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":335225066,"title":"Joni Ernst Pulls Back the Curtain on Key Senate Effort to Fight the Deep State in the One Big Beautiful Bill","text":"Federal bureaucrats can act like a “deep state,” opposing the people’s elected president from within his own executive branch, in part because public-sector unions protect them, and taxpayers unwittingly pay bureaucrats for work they do for these unions. \n\nThe Republican Congress aims to claw back some of this money in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, gave The Daily Signal an inside look at the negotiations involved.\n\n“The federal government is actually footing the bill for these unions, which means that the taxpayers are footing the bill for the federal government to foot the bill for these unions that are working against the federal government and the taxpayers, so it just really doesn’t make sense,” Ernst said at an event with the Public Labor Unions Accountability Committee Wednesday morning. \n\n“We have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars every single year on these union bosses that are arguing with our agencies on very trivial things,” such as “employees’ ability to work from their couches,” she explained. The unions also fight to protect bureaucrats from getting fired, which arguably enables the deep state.\n\nErnst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus, noted that “rooting out this kind of waste is exactly why DOGE exists.” \n\nBureaucrats billed taxpayers $160 million in the 2019 fiscal year for time worked for unions (known as “official time”), the last full year of available data before the Office of Personnel Management under President Joe Biden stopped publishing the data in 2021. Ernst demanded official time figures from 24 federal agencies in December 2024, but only three gave her data.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission spent $420,074 in the 2024 fiscal year, up from its 2019 figure of $377,056. NASA, meanwhile, spent $893,620 on official time in 2024, up from $641,037 in 2019. The Defense Health Agency, which oversees health benefits for servicemembers, said its bureaucrats spent 87,000 hours working for unions, costing $3.3 million total for fiscal years 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill\n\nErnst has proposed a fee to recoup for the taxpayer some of the money bureaucrats bill for hours they spend doing work for the union, but Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled against it. \n\n“We’d try and establish a fee, but it wasn’t enough to make it Byrd bath-proof, so we’ll go back,” Ernst told The Daily Signal in a press gaggle Wednesday morning. \n\nMajor legislation requires 60 votes to pass the U.S. Senate, unless it deals with budget matters, which can pass with a bare majority under budget reconciliation. The “Byrd bath” involves the Senate parliamentarian going through the provisions of a reconciliation bill like the One Big Beautiful Bill, to determine if they meet the threshold for budget considerations, known as the Byrd Rule after Sen. Robert Byrd.\n\nErnst told The Daily Signal that the fee wasn’t high enough and that MacDonough had other concerns “based in policy.”\n\n“We need to work through this,” Ernst said. “We’re going to tweak the language a little bit.”\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Ernst’s office had not yet secured MacDonough’s approval for keeping the proposal in the reconciliation bill.\n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA recent poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful order from President Donald Trump if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile many bureaucrats may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may operate as a deep state, working against the goals of the current president.\n\nOnly 5.9% of private sector workers were union members last year, while 32% of public sector workers had joined unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The aggregate number of employees belonging to unions in the public sector (7 million) was roughly the same as those in the private sector (7.2 million). \n\nEven President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal created the administrative state, opposed unions within the federal government, but President John F. Kennedy allowed them. Then the Civil Service Reform Act of 1979 established collective bargaining rights and “official time” for unions in exchange for government unions foregoing the right to strike.\n\nPublic sector unions have secured special benefits for government workers, making them more difficult to fire. Trump has attempted to change the rules, but public sector unions like the American Federation of Government Employees, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, are filing lawsuits to block his reforms.\n\nMy book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” exposes the left-wing groups that staffed and advised administrative state under Biden.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. After the June 21st, Saturday night bombing of the nuclear facilities in Iran, the Left has kind of gone crazy. \n\nI’ve mentioned in earlier videos their inconsistency, where they now want to invoke the War Powers Act and resolution that Congress must approve these interventions. Of course, they never did that during either the Clinton or Obama administrations who bombed regularly and frequently, and much more frequently than President Donald Trump, without any worry about getting a resolution. \n\nBut it opens a larger issue up and that is, the Left knows that they are not polling well. They know that the party’s base is controlling their narrative, and they know that that narrative supports issues from transgenderism to an open border, to lax enforcement of criminal statutes, to something like Kabul abroad that has no public support.\n\nAnd they’re angry. And this anger is coming from the base of the party. And the base of the party are the green radicals, the Green New Deal people. They’re the diversity, equity, inclusion, black caucus people. They’re the trans people. They’re the Antifa people. And it’s manifesting itself in a way we’ve never really seen before. \n\nJust to give you a few examples:\n\nIlhan Omar, the controversial representative from Minnesota, sounded off the other day. And she said that the United States is basically worse than Somalia—where she came from, I guess as a preteen or 12 or 13 years old—and it’s worse than the dictatorship in Somalia. \n\nIf she really believes that, of course, the question is begged to be asked, why did you come here? Why don’t you go back? Why are a million people a year, under the Biden administration, committing illegality—breaking the law—to get in here? Why don’t a million people go back to Mexico? Or why don’t we all go back to our countries of origin? It made no sense.\n\nThen we had “The View” with Whoopi Goldberg. And she weighed in and said that black people today—remember, this is a multimillionaire person who’s making millions of dollars for sitting there and sounding off like this—black people have it worse than people who have it in Iran today. \n\nAnd if you look at the average black income of women, it is approaching normality and it’s parity with their white counterparts. In some cases, of the white working class, it’s higher. \n\nI don’t know what she’s talking about. It’s completely absurd. Why would anybody say that? Why would you say that when black people are doing better than ever and have more of a combined gross national product than, probably, black people in the entire world put together? Why would she say something like that?\n\nThen we had Jasmine Crockett, the controversial Texas representative. She went off on the last election and said that half of the people that voted for Trump were mentally ill—half the country that voted for Trump. She was basically going down a racist rant. \n\nThen she said that people only voted against former Vice President Kamala Harris not because of her word salads, not because of her incompetence, not because she couldn’t give interviews, not because she had to completely flip from her former left-wing positions, at least for 90 days, but because they voted for an old white man. \n\nCan you imagine somebody on the Right saying the only reason people voted for Kamala Harris is they just wanted to vote for a middle-aged black woman? That would end their career.\n\nAnd then, of course, we had Mr. Padilla, Alex Padilla, he’s our senator. And as I mentioned earlier, he crashed a press conference by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. He barged in and he was screaming and yelling and he had no identification. He wanted to do something like, I guess, he wanted to top Sen. Cory Booker’s Spartacus, 25-hour filibuster to nowhere. \n\nBut he was arrested because people didn’t know who he was. I think he was angrier that he’s a senator and nobody, even in a state, knows that he’s a senator from California. \n\nBut then, he started sounding off and said, “Well, I’m not against deporting criminals.” And I just said, “Full stop, you are. Because you were one of the sponsors of sanctuary cities in your prior manifestation as a California official. And the whole purpose of a sanctuary city is not to turn over criminals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So, you have no credibility.”\n\nAnd finally, we end with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He had a little flirtation with moderation. He had a podcast—I guess it’s defunct now, but he tried to bring on people like Charlie Kirk, sound reasonable, say that he agreed with Donald Trump that biological men shouldn’t compete in women’s sports. \n\nAnd then somebody tapped him on the shoulder and said, “Gavin, your party is crazy. They’re left-wing lunatics. You would never be nominated. You’re polling 4%. How are you going to get the nomination? So, the correct position, Gavin, is to sound crazy like they are. And crazier, even, than Sens. Bernie [Sanders] or Elizabeth Warren, ‘the squad,’ or Crockett. And then you can move back and do the podcast, once you’re nominated.”\n\nSo, as a result, Gavin Newsom is doing his little body movement. He’s challenging Trump to come out here, mano a mano. He said that Vice President JD Vance is a liar, he wants to debate him. \n\nAnd during the riots, he did a French Laundry 2.0. He was up in Napa, where he seems to feel most comfortable, doing a wine tasting while people were, I don’t know, destroying federal property, attacking the police, setting cars on fire, looting. And after, he said that this didn’t exist and that Donald Trump had overreacted and prompted this by nationalizing the California Guard. \n\nSo, he’s completely melded down. This is beside the point that he doesn’t address, at all, our high taxes, the lack of available water, our electricity rates, the most expensive gas in the United States, the disaster in Pacific Palisades and the inability to re-burn, what caused it, etc., etc., etc.\n\nSo, you add it all up and every once in a while you see James Carville and he’s trying to remark on how crazy they are but in the mode of his criticism, he’s crazy because he says things that are even crazier. \n\nSo, whatever Donald Trump has done to them—and maybe that will be his lasting legacy—he had the ability to expose what used to be Democrats as absolutely unhinged and nihilistic. And I don’t think anybody wants any part of them.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The Journal said it’s unclear if Trump is still seeking an apology and emphasized that settlement talks remain fluid and an agreement may not be reached.\n\nLegal representatives for CBS and Trump did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe high stakes legal battle comes as Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media awaits regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of the media giant’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations. The deal, which executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nIf the merger is not closed by the time that extension expires next month, it would automatically be pushed another 90 days into October. After that, if the deal is still not closed, the FCC blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal.\n\nWhen asked by reporters last week whether he sees the agency’s review being resolved soon, Trump replied: “I hope so. Ellison’s great, he’ll do a great job with it.” But he also took the opportunity to blast CBS for the Harris interview.\n\n“What they did was they interviewed Kamala, her answer was horrendous, I would say election-threatening,” he said. “They took the entire answer out, and they took another answer from another question and put it in. And they did that, I understand, a number of times … We caught ’em, and they are very embarrassed by it, and they are working on a settlement now.”\n\nDemocratic Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden issued a warning to Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone last month that reaching a settlement in exchange for regulatory approval could violate federal anti-bribery laws. The California State Senate has also launched an investigation into the matter and invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion” related to the Harris interview, including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard.\n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMore to come…","summary":"The potential settlement would include a $17 million donation to Trump’s presidential foundation or museum\n\n\nThe post Trump-CBS Mediator Proposes $20 Million Settlement in Legal Battle | Report appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/mediator-trump-cbs-lawsuit-settlement-proposal/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Shari-Redstone.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 21:25:10","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":335228242,"title":"Is Donald Trump Getting Closer to Pardoning Joe Exotic? U.S. Rep Vows to Put Case to Free Murder-for-Hire Reality Star Before President","text":"Joe Exotic's continual quest to get President Trump to grant him a pardon could have some new support, RadarOnline.com can report. \n\nColorado Representative Lauren Boebert has offered to bring the Tiger King's name up for discussion.The 61-year-old reality star, whose real name is Joe Maldonado, is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence after he was convicted in a murder-for-hire plot of zookeeper rival Carole Baskin. He is scheduled to be released from prison on March 18, 2036.\n\nHe's already pinned his hopes on a presidential pardon, but he may be running out of time as he's been battling cancer – and he's refusing any more treatment. \n\nBoebert was asked about justice for Maldonado while speaking with Alex Stein on the Prime Time with Stein show. Stein called Maldonado's continued confinement \"cruel and unusual.\"\n\n\"You become the number one hit show, and you're locked up in jail so you don't even get to use it in your criminal defense. You don't get to use it for any good that you might do out in the community,\" Stein said, arguing keeping Maldonado detained is \"un-American.\"\n\n\"I just feel like that is cruel because if we really do have a criminal justice system .. what is the whole basis of America? It's about second chances. About 'hey you make a mistake you get back up.' That's the American dream.\"Congressional PledgeBoebert, who confessed to being a fan of the Tiger King show on Netflix, pledged to take any pardon request seriously but needs to learn more about his conviction. \n\nShe told Stein: \"I haven't read into the actual charges. I've watched the show, certainly, so what he was actually convicted of? Put that before the pardon team and I'm sure they'll see this and have conversations with me and many others.\n\n\"Joe Exotic has reached out to me – or at least his team has in the past and other members of Congress for sure.\"Begging for HelpMaldonado has pleaded his case to numerous politicians, claiming he's behind bars due to a government conspiracy theory. He's reached out to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Matt Gaetz, and even former president Joe Biden.\n\nHe's also pleaded with Donald Jr. as well as Trump himself to help him become a free man again.Days after the 79-year-old beat Kamala Harris in the election, the ex-TV personality penned in a letter: \"A lot of people went to bat for you in 2021 who have been living in hell ever since then.\n\n\"Everyone hopes you keep the promises you made during your campaign, which include pardoning everyone sooner rather than later in 2025.\"Pardon MeIn February, Maldonado sent Trump another typed letter pleading for his freedom after being in prison the \"last 7 years for a crime that I did not commit.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Just as the Department of Justice was weaponized against you, it was weaponized against me for nothing more than a political agenda to pass the Big Cat Safety Act and monopolize tigers in America.\"\n\nThe Netflix star made it clear he does not need a \"full pardon\" and is happy \"living out my life\" as a felon, as Trump is doing.","summary":"Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert has offered to bring the Tiger King's name up for discussion.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/president-donald-trump-pardon-joe-exotic-rep-lauren-boebert-tiger-king-star/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/C5sqM5-Ls/0x0/joe-exotic-begging-letter-donald-trump-attorney-matt-gaetz-pardon-wildlife-services-1732029383210.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 20:45:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":335243448,"title":"Kamala's Stepdaughter Felt 'Trauma' Voting in NYC Mayoral Primary","text":"Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, said she felt “trauma” voting in the New York City mayoral primary, because it was the same polling station where she voted for her stepmom, who handily lost to President Donald Trump in November.\n\nIn a video posted to social media, Emhoff said, “You know, I’m feeling a little trauma walking to the same polling station that I did to vote for Kamala.”\n\n“And you know, I’m just feeling a lot of hope right now,” she said. She then updated her video after voting, declaring, “We did it.”\n\n“I’m feeling a huge mix of emotions,” she added. “I’m really nervous. I’m also so hopeful. It’s been so spectacular seeing New York come together in this way and rally behind Zohran, and, yeah. Let’s fucking do this, guys.”\n\nThis comes as the self-declared democratic socialist — New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani (D) — declared that he and his supporters “made history” in essentially clinching the Democrat primary in the Democrat-run city.\n\n“I want to applaud the assemblyman for a really smart and good and impactful campaign,” opponent Andrew Cuomo said after his own apparent loss. “Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won.”\n\nMamdani has made waves with a series of radical comments and proposals — such as city-run grocery stores — as Breitbart News has documented:\n\nMayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani outlined his platform on his website saying people in his city are struggling with the cost of groceries.\nThe site then declared Mamdani “will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing. With New York City already spending millions of dollars to subsidize private grocery store operators (which are not even required to take SNAP/WIC!), we should redirect public money to a real ‘public option.’”\n\nHe also has publicly stated that “queer liberation means defund the police.”\n\nMamdani has earned praise from the likes of fellow socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who said, “Congratulations to Zohran Mamdani and his thousands of grassroots supporters for their extraordinary campaign.”\n\n“You took on the political, economic and media Establishment- and you beat them,” Sanders added. “Now it’s on to victory in the general election.”","summary":"Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, said she felt \"trauma\" voting in the New York City's mayoral primary.\n\n\nThe post Kamala&#8217;s Stepdaughter Felt &#8216;Trauma&#8217; Voting in NYC Mayoral Primary appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/25/kamalas-stepdaughter-felt-trauma-voting-nyc-mayoral-primary/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Ella-Emhoff-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 20:39:56","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":335237428,"title":"No, grazie: Bezos’ billions can’t buy his dream Italian wedding","text":"Let’s all collectively shed a single tear for billionaire Jeff Bezos and his betrothed Lauren Sanchez, whose dreams of a picture-perfect Italian wedding are crushed. \n\nThanks to the protesters who tirelessly took to the streets and canals of Venice, the filthy rich couple have been forced to relocate some of the festivities to a shipyard.\n\nA group named No Space for Bezos successfully strong-armed the Amazon founder out of using the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia, a centrally located venue, by planning to form a blockade in the canals around the event on June 28.\n\n“We won!

And while these visitors are being offered upgrades and comped nights, their displacement is just another out-of-touch move by uberwealthy snobs who throw money at inconveniences—and people—and expect them to go away. \n\nOnce a low-key tech nerd, Bezos has spent the past year flaunting his money and cozying up to Donald Trump, earning him a growing list of critics and enemies. Most people don’t love the concept of ultrarich billionaires who pay hardly any taxes, but it’s an even worse look when those billionaires are also lining the pockets of the president. \n\nRelated | Washington Post loses staff, readers, and money as Bezos bends to Trump\n\nThe Amazon founder worth more than $220 billion was among the tech billionaires who donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and had a primo VIP seat as Trump took the oath of office. The owner of The Washington Post also broke with tradition and did not let the paper’s editorial board endorse Kamala Harris for president.\n\nAnd while Bezos hasn’t had a front-and-center seat with the president since attending his inauguration, he has hobnobbed with Trump in plenty of other ways. \n\nIn addition to streaming his buddy’s old reality show “The Apprentice,” Amazon Prime signed a $40 million documentary deal with first lady Melania Trump as well. Of course, all of this is pocket change compared to Bezos’ military contracts with the government. \n\nHis space technology company, Blue Origin, scored a $2.4 billion deal with the U.S. Space Force. \n\nBack in Venice, guests like Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, and Mick Jagger have already been sighted as the wedding date nears. It’s unclear if the president will take time away from his clumsy diplomacy and warmongering to attend the nuptials of one of his top benefactors. \n\nAs for why the citizens of Venice pushed back so hard on Bezos and Sanchez’s presence, it could be a multitude of reasons.

It failed to beat Donald Trump, a twice impeached convicted felon, and lost both chambers of Congress. Since November, Democrats have been searching for a path out of the wilderness. On Tuesday, they found one.\n\nBut instead of celebrating Zohran Mamdani’s apparent victory in the New York mayoral primary election, the first major Democratic contest since Trump’s win, many in the party establishment went into panic mode.\n\nMamdani, 33, a self-described democratic socialist who would be the first Muslim mayor of America’s biggest city, represents a unique threat to the entitled elites, gerontocrats and consultants who have helped take Democrats’ approval rating to a record low of 29%.\n\nHis defeat of Andrew Cuomo, a 67-year-old from a political dynasty vying to come back from a sexual harassment scandal, could hardly have been better scripted as a pivot point for Democrats who ruined their brand by closing ranks to cover up concerns over former president Joe Biden’s decline.\n\nCuomo, bankrolled by corporate donors and endorsed by former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, personified the twitching tail of a dying animal. Mamdani, an aspiring rapper turned state politician backed by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow New Yorker, represented a dare to imagine what a post-Trump future might look like.\n\n“What’s happening in NYC is a blaringly loud message to those in the Dem establishment who still cling to old politics, recite focus-grouped talking points, and are too afraid to say what needs to be said,” tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to former president Barack Obama.\n\nIt was a campaign that triangulated ground game, digital style and policy substance. Mamdani was a shoe leather candidate who put himself all over the city, talked to countless voters, projected optimism without sounding preachy and had thousands of volunteers knocking on doors multiple times.\n\nHe also learned from Ocasio-Cortez’s mastery of the attention economy. Where other Democrats seem contrived and cringy on social media, Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez are of a generation that swims naturally in such waters, proving that you cannot fake authenticity.\n\nBorn in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, he is a cosmopolitan and charismatic New Yorker. In November, a week after Trump’s victory, he went to Queens and the Bronx with a microphone and interviewed working class New Yorkers about why they voted for Trump or did not vote at all. A video of the exchanges has 2.7m views on the X social media platform.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, dressed in full suit and tie save for bare feet, he ran into freezing waters off Coney Island then strolled along the beach talking policy and tweeted some pleasingly bad puns: “I’m freezing … your rent as the next mayor of New York City. Let’s plunge into the details.”\n\nFor all Democrats’ angst over messaging, none if it matters if the policies fail to resonate. The Democratic party has come to be seen as the party of the college-educated elites, something that Trump, with no sense of self-irony as a millionaire New Yorker, has exploited to maximum effect with blue collar voters.\n\nBut Mamdani evidently struck a chord in a city feeling the pinch of the affordability crisis. The average Manhattan rent now stands at $5,000 a month. His proposals include freezing rent for many New Yorkers, free bus service and universal childcare paid for by new taxes on the rich.\n\nWhen Trump identified some of the frustrations and offered fake populism, he was twice rewarded with the White House. When Mamdani offers solutions that would be regarded as mainstream in many European countries, he is demonised as an extremist. On Wednesday, the New York Times newspaper characterised him as “running on a far-left agenda” while the front page of Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post declared: “NYC SOS. Who will save city after radical socialist batters Cuomo in Dem mayoral primary?”\n\nMamdani showed the value of fearlessness. A staunch supporter of Palestinian rights, he has called Israel’s actions in Gaza a “genocide”, joined a hunger strike outside the White House calling for a ceasefire and championed the cause of Mahmoud Khalil, a student activist at Columbia University who spent more than three months in detention on the orders of a federal judge.\n\nCuomo and his allies’ efforts to portray Mamdani as antisemitic fell flat. There is a lesson for Democrats who denied a Palestinian American a speaking slot at their national convention last year and saw Kamala Harris lose to Trump in the Arab-majority suburb of Dearborn in Michigan, potentially costing her the crucial swing state of Michigan.\n\nExpect the Democratic establishment to fight back, just as Hillary Clinton did against senator Bernie Sanders’s insurgent candidacy in 2016 (Sanders endorsed Mamdani). They fear the loss of the control they have long enjoyed. They also fear that Republicans and rightwing media will cast Mamdani, Ocasio-Cortez and the rest as radical Marxists, as sure to lose elections as Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nMatt Bennett, a cofounder of the centrist thinktank Third Way, wrote on social media that it is “dangerous to believe a NYC Dem primary offers a roadmap for winning” in swing or conservative places and urged Democrats to follow moderates, “not the siren call” of socialism. He added: “Mamdani diagnosed the right problem: the affordability crisis facing the working class. But he has the wrong solutions: his ideas can’t work and would make matters worse.”\n\nThere will certainly be much debate over whether New York City, a Democratic stronghold with many distinct characteristics, is a useful template for candidates in cities, towns and rural areas the length and breadth of the country. “As New York goes, so goes the nation,” is not really a thing.\n\nEven so, after six months of anguished soul searching, Democrats now have one answer. Some don’t like it. Mamdani – likely be the favourite in November’s general election for mayor – signifies a generational change and rebuke to a party establishment grown complacent and hypocritical in its deference to figures such as the Clintons, Biden and Cuomo despite their obvious flaws.\n\nThe odds of Ocasio-Cortez, currently 35, running for and winning the Democratic nomination in 2028 just got shorter. It is a leap of political imagination for America that progressives would savour – but so, too, would the Republican election machine.","summary":"Mamdani signifies a generational change and rebuke to a party establishment grown complacent and hypocritical\n\nThe party was on its knees.

Unfortunately, the footnote links don't work with Balkinization's posting software, so I thought I'd include it below; note that I've posted earlier versions of this essay here before.\n\nThe Crisis of the Media Environment\nEugene Volokh\nSenior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford; Professor of Law Emeritus, UCLA[1]\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign saw a massive disinformation and misinformation campaign, which likely helped bring the current administration into power. Leading media organizations failed to stop it in time. Indeed, some of them were complicit, through inadequate investigation and perhaps even willful blindness, in the misinformation. We thus face an urgent question, raised by the workshop organizers: \"How can and should the media system be reformed?\"\n\nI'm speaking, of course, of the campaign to conceal President Biden's mental decline—a campaign that was only conclusively exposed by the June 27, 2024 debate. At that point, little time was left for deciding whether the President should be persuaded to step aside; for the actual persuasion; for the selection of a replacement; and for the replacement's attempt to persuade the people to elect her.\n\nHad the Administration leveled with the public earlier, or had the media exposed the concealment earlier, there would likely have been time for a full primary campaign, in which Democratic voters could have made their choice about whom to run against Donald Trump.[2] Perhaps that candidate would have been more effective than Kamala Harris. Or perhaps the candidate would have still been Harris, but a Harris who was seen as having more legitimacy with the public. \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" the Washington Post tells us. It appears that the Democratic Party's prospects died in this particular darkness.[3]\n\nThe single most consequential fact of the 2024 Presidential campaign had thus been largely hidden for a long time, including from (and, perhaps unwittingly, by) the media organizations whose job it is to inform us. Indeed, this was a fact not just of immense political significance, but also central to national security: If President Biden was indeed cognitively impaired, that bore on his ability to make decisions as President, not just his ability to be re-elected.[4]\n\nWhen, for instance, Trump and Vance spread unfounded rumors of Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs, the media rightly blew the whistle. But when some media outlets tried to point out the evidence of Biden's likely incapacity, others didn't pick up on the investigation—and, indeed, sometimes pooh-poohed the investigation.\n\nAs late as mid-June 2024, the White House and many of its supporters characterized videos of Biden apparently freezing up and seeming confused as \"cheap fake\" disinformation created by his enemies.[5] Indeed, as Nate Silver has noted, \"some coverage endorsed the White House party line, particularly in its tendency to characterize claims about Biden's acuity as 'misinformation.'\"[6] Only Biden's televised debate performance on June 27, 2024 made it impossible to deny there was something badly wrong. It seems likely that many of the supposed \"cheap fakes\" actually accurately captured Biden's cognitive slippage, especially since the slippage apparently went back a good deal before the debate.[7]\n\nAnd even if some particular videos had indeed been disinformation from his enemies, the fact remains that the media failed to adequately identify the disinformation from his friends.[8] Isn't it shocking that so many White House reporters appear to have learned of Biden's decline thanks only to the nationally televised debate and not to their investigative journalism?[9]\n\nOf course, reaching the truth on this question wasn't easy. Biden insiders apparently tried hard to conceal the facts (that's the disinformation part).[10] And indeed it's not surprising that people who are both personally loyal to a President and rely on the President's success for their ongoing careers would want to conceal such facts. In our fallen world, we can't expect much candor from political insiders. And I expect most journalists sincerely believed the reassurances they were getting from the insiders.\n\nBut getting sincerely duped isn't a great professional mark for a journalist.[11] Their job was to dig and find out—before things became evident, not after (and indeed some indications of Biden's decline were indeed evident for some time before the debate[12]). Alex Thompson, the coauthor of Original Sin, elaborated on this problem:\n\n\"I had one conversation with someone, this was after the election, while we were reporting this book, and this person said, 'Listen, yes, we deserve blame for X, Y, Z. We were hiding him. We were.' But this person also sort of got in my face, and they said, 'Listen, the media deserves some blame, too.' Like we were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin and get on,\" he said.\nThompson admitted there was truth to what the person was saying about the media and its lack of skepticism about Biden's administration.\n\"They're just like, 'You guys should not have believed us so easily.' And I thought that was like a really interesting, but I also think that's true,\" he said. \"I think the media, . . . in a lot of ways, was not skeptical enough and did not remember the less[on] that, they do it to different degrees, but every White House lies.\"[13]\n\nIndeed, to the extent that the media's credibility has declined over recent years, such failures of investigation seem likely to only exacerbate this decline:\n\nUndoubtedly, the White House wanted to keep this fact [of Biden's decline] under wraps until Biden was safely over the finish line in November. But media organizations that participated, even unwittingly, in this farce have not only made a subsequent Democratic administration far less likely—they have profoundly undermined their own integrity.[14]\n\nHow could this happen? I hope we will learn more about this in the years to come. But at this point, at least a first cut—informed by our shared knowledge of human nature—is that many in the media likely didn't dig hard because they didn't really wanted to uncover things.[15] It isn't controversial, I think, that most in the mainstream media much preferred President Biden over his challenger, Donald Trump.[16] Indeed, I agree they had good reason to dislike Trump. Certainly Trump himself had done much to stoke that hostility.\n\n\"Biden is cognitively impaired\" was a standard talking point on the Right. So long as Biden was the nominee, that impairment, if demonstrated, would help Trump.[17] (As I've argued, if knowing of the impairment helped Democrats replace Biden with a better candidate, the knowledge might have hurt Trump, but that would have been a less direct chain of causation.) It's human nature to accept stories that fit one's political preferences than to challenge them. A thought experiment: If the sitting President in 2024 had been a Republican—whether Trump or, say, an older Ron DeSantis—would the media have acted the same way they did? Or would they have worked harder, dug deeper, and uncovered the truth earlier?\n\nYet of course institutions should be designed to counteract the flaws generated by human nature while working within the constraints created by human nature. (That knowledge was old when Madison was young.) This is true of media institutions as well as governmental ones. There need to be mechanisms to keep reporters' and editors' inevitable ideological predilections from turning into ideological blinders and ideological blunders.\n\nOf course, it's much easier to identify the problem than a suitable solution. One can imagine, for instance, newspapers deliberately seeking out reporters and editors with many different ideological beliefs, hoping that colleagues will fill each others' blind spots (or, in collegial conversations, help each other identify their blind spots). But this may be hard to implement; and, as with preferences based on race and sex, preferences based on politics may be challenged as leading to hiring based on ideology rather than merit. (They may also be defended, as with preferences based on race and sex, as a tool for fighting subconscious bias that keeps meritorious candidates from being fairly considered.) Indeed, hiring that considers applicants' ideological beliefs may violate some states' laws that limit employment discrimination based on political ideology or party affiliation,[18] just as hiring that considers applicants' religious beliefs may violate bans on employment discrimination based on religion.\n\nNewspapers might also return to prohibiting reporters and editors from publicly opining on controversial issues. Of course, realistic readers will recognize that reporters may still be biased. But taking a public stand on an issue may increase such bias: If one has publicly endorsed a position, it might become harder to write fairly about evidence that instead tends to support the rival position. Few of us like writing something that suggests that we were mistaken in the past, or that our critics can interpret as making such a suggestion.\n\nAgain, though, in some jurisdictions such public neutrality rules for newspaper employees may violate state employment statutes. One state court held (by a 5–4 vote) that those statutes themselves violate the First Amendment when applied to newspaper reporters or editors.[19] But in AP v. NLRB (1937), the U.S. Supreme Court held (also 5–4) that federal labor law, which bans discrimination based on union membership, didn't violate the Associated Press's rights to select reporters or editors.[20]\n\nLikewise, one can imagine newspapers and magazines deliberately courting a broad ideological mix of readers—not just for the extra revenue, but also to commit themselves to having a base that they will need to be seen as treating fairly. A publication that has many readers on the left, right, and center might feel more pressure to be fair and careful to all sides. Of course, it may be hard these days to acquire such a broad reader base. And there's always the danger that concern about reader reactions may press a newspaper to avoid controversial topics altogether, rather than to try handling them fairly.\n\nFinally, newspapers can just try to recommit themselves to objectivity, fuzzy as the term may sometimes be. (Many commentators have expressly taken the opposite view.[21]) In their news coverage, they may recommit to discussing the best arguments on both sides of contested issues. In choosing what to cover, they may try hard to see what both sides of the aisle view as especially important. On their editorial pages, they may avoid a party line, either instituted top down[22] or by staff revolts.[23] Instead, they may adopt the policy that whatever ideas are shared by at least substantial minorities of the public should be seriously covered, even when editors think that one side is obviously wrong.\n\nAgain, though, that's easier said than done (and it's not even that easily said). It will inevitably require hard choices that will leave many observers skeptical about the media organization's fairness —e.g., which sides of a multi-sided issue should be covered, which topics are important enough to cover, which positions are such outliers that they can be set aside, how to allocate scarce space and attention. And it may not do much to solve the problem we began with, which is the ability of media organizations to be massively duped by the side they sympathize with.\n\nThus, these solutions are likely to be far from perfect. The cures may even be worse than disease.\n\nBut there is indeed a disease, \"a profoundly broken media system\" (to quote the workshop organizers). This system is one that the public has good reason to distrust. Its flaws undermine the media's ability to check government malfeasance. It may have been so captured by the desire to #Resist one movement that it failed to resist the disinformation spread by another. And it may thus have ended up helping the very candidate and movement that it had (understandably) viewed as dangerous.\n\n[1] For an early draft of this article, written before the books cited below came out, see Eugene Volokh, \"The 2024 Presidential Campaign Saw a Massive Disinformation and Misinformation Campaign, …[\"], Volokh Conspiracy, Mar. 31, 2025, https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/31/the-2024-presidential-campaign-saw-a-massive-disinformation-and-misinformation-campaign/.\n\n[2] See, e.g., Chris Whipple, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History 201 (2025) (quoting Leon Panetta, White House Chief of Staff under Clinton and Secretary of Defense under Obama, as making this point); Jonathan Allen & Amie Parnes, Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House 86 (2025) (quoting \"a Biden ally\" as making the same point); id. at 90 (inferring that long-time Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held a similar view); Jake Tapper & Alex Thompson, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again 6 (2025) (\"If history is any guide, a competitive primary and caucus process would have produced a stronger Democratic nominee . . . .\"); Josh Barro, This Is All Biden's Fault, N.Y.

It’s the kind of rhetoric that thrives only in far-left activist bubbles.\n\nIf these protesters took a moment to look at the facts about the state of Latino America, they might feel differently about the country they’re so eager to condemn. According to a 2025 report from California Lutheran University and the University of California, Los Angeles, the U.S. Hispanic GDP reached $4.1 trillion in 2023. That makes it the fifth-largest economy in the world, larger than any economy in Latin America and the economies of India, the United Kingdom, and France. That didn’t happen because we’re oppressed in this country. It happened because Latino families believe in hard work, stability, and upward mobility, and America helped us thrive.\n\nWe’re not just growing in GDP. Since 2010, Latinos have accounted for 58.7% of U.S. labor force growth, adding an average of 726,000 workers every year. In 2023 alone, Latino consumption totaled $2.7 trillion, greater than the economies of Texas and New York. Educational attainment is also surging, with Latino bachelor’s degrees up more than 125% since 2010.\n\nNone of this success was preordained. Many of us come from humble beginnings. My parents were born in Mexico. I was raised to be grateful for the opportunities we found here. Whether you voted for Kamala Harris, Trump, or didn’t vote at all, there’s no denying that America has been good to Hispanics. There’s no need to pretend otherwise just because someone you dislike occupies the White House.\n\nGratitude is not submission. It’s wisdom, and a way of respecting the sacrifices of our ancestors. It’s the ability to look around and see that, for all of our political debates, America remains a place where immigrants and their children can rise. Compare that to most of the hemisphere, where government dysfunction, corruption, and economic instability have crushed the dreams of millions. That’s the alternative.\n\nSo when radicals in LA shut down highways, loot small businesses, and wrap themselves in Mexican flags, the question becomes: Who exactly are they speaking for? Certainly not the 60 million Latinos who have made the U.S. home. Certainly not the small business owners, tradesmen, and working mothers who get up every morning and move this country forward. Certainly not the students, entrepreneurs, and veterans who wear both their heritage and their citizenship with pride.\n\nThe truth is, these rioters are out of step with the diverse communities they claim to represent. They speak a language of resentment that has no resonance with the average Latino household.\n\nThe rest of us are busy building something better.\n\nAbraham Enriquez is the founder and president of Bienvenido US, an organization dedicated to mobilizing, enhancing, and empowering Hispanics to promote the principles of individual liberty and sound policy.","summary":"Throughout this month, people have watched scenes unfold in Los Angeles that are as destructive as they are delusional: masked rioters vandalizing property, blocking traffic, clashing with police, and waving foreign flags as if the United States were their enemy.

That's bad news for establishment Democrats, but can be good for the party overall.\"Democrats have struggled to make their case as a credible alternative to Republicans since Kamala Harris's 2024 defeat to Trump -- seen in part as repudiation of identity politics and so-called \"woke\" ideology. But the man who would be his city's first Muslim mayor embraced his identity, courting the one million New York members of his faith where they live -- in the city's many mosques and community centers.He also presented himself as the candidate of generational change, reaching out to fellow millennials with a smart communications strategy dominated by short-form viral videos.He bested Cuomo, a towering figure in Democratic politics, by combining his social media savvy with a \"go everywhere\" street campaign that made his much less visible opponent look complacent. Born in Uganda, Mamdani is the son of renowned historian Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, who directed the classic \"Salaam Bombay!\" Curious voters wanting to learn more about his colorful back story shared old hip hop videos from his previous life as a musician, rapping under the moniker \"Young Cardamom.\"Youth activist David Hogg, who was kicked out of the Democratic National Committee leadership after annoying the party's old guard in a row about aging candidates, maintains that likability was a key factor. He is \"infectiously, and relentlessly positive in a way I have seen few politicians ever be,\" Hogg said, arguing that Mamdani's appeal went well beyond his policy proposals.But his platform was vital too, according to Koneschusky, who says Mamdani has demonstrated to Democrats slow to see the penny drop that, in the Trump era, economic populism works.Mamdani focused relentlessly on the cost of living crisis -- floating rent freezes, free buses and even government-run grocery stores.\"We've seen the effectiveness of an economic message time and again. It's what propelled Trump in last year's presidential election and it's what propelled Mamdani,\" Koneschusky said.\"It's so blatantly obvious that this is where the Democratic message should be centered and yet the party can't seem to universally embrace this simple truth.\"Some analysts have cautioned against reading too much into the result -- a single primary victory against an establishment favorite with a lot of baggage.Cuomo is accused of having lied about his role in the Covid pandemic and mismanaging the crisis, and he resigned in disgrace over sex scandals. Others point out that Democratic nominees have lost around half of the last 15 New York City mayoral races, and that the city's denizens could easily change tack when it comes to the mayoral election itself.But political commentator Bill Kristol, chief of staff from 1989-93 to then vice president Dan Quayle, expects Democrats to still be feeling the aftershocks of the New York earthquake come the 2026 midterms, when seats in both chambers of Congress will be at stake.\"It should be a death knell for an ossified Democratic establishment that needs to be put out of its misery,\" Kristol wrote in his daily newsletter for conservative outlet The Bulwark.\"And it should be a wake-up call for non-socialist Democrats to show some of the audacity and the ability of Mamdani.\"","summary":"Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is a seismic wake-up call for a party establishment out of step with younger Americans and failing to counter Donald Trump, analysts say.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/new-york-mayoral-vote-floors-democratic-establishment-3776806","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4607239/new-york-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-was-not-afraid-leaning-his-identity-did-not-shy-away.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 17:36:20","author":"Guillaume Lavallee With Frankie Taggart In Washington","authors":["Guillaume Lavallee With Frankie Taggart In Washington"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.341},{"id":335168616,"title":"Lauren Boebert Praises 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic As He Seeks Pardon","text":"Colorado U.S. Representative Lauren Boebert said Tiger King star Joseph Allen Maldonado, known widely as \"Joe Exotic,\" has reached out to her office for help with a pardon.Why It MattersExotic gained widespread notoriety during the COVID pandemic when Netflix aired a documentary centered on him and his tiger sanctuary in Oklahoma.

says he wants to tax the wealthy, dole out free childcare and spend $65million on transgender care. \n\nHis campaign has pushed populist ideas like free public buses, rent freezes for rent-stabilized apartments, and grocery stores that would be owned by the city.\n\nHe has also advocated for defunding the city's police department, defended pro- Palestine slogans like 'globalize the intifada' and said he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHe has vowed to 'fight back' against president Donald Trump, saying that he is the Republican's 'worst nightmare' because he is a 'progressive, Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things I believe in'.\n\nMamdani - a state legislator - took down scandal scarred ex-Governor Andrew Cuomo and several others in the primary, the results of which won't be officially confirmed until July 1 due to the city's ranked choice voting system. \n\nIn his victory speech given late Tuesday night and attended by lefty celebrities like actress Cynthia Nixon, actor Kal Penn and Kamala Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, he referred to Trump as a fascist to cheers from the crowd.\n\n'We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city that they can afford. A city where they can do more than just struggle. And it is where the mayor will use their power to reject Donald Trump's fascism,' he said.\n\nStance on Israel \n\nIn a city torn apart over Israel's campaign against Hamas following the October 7 attacks, he has been called to show support Israel's right to exist. \n\nHis pro-Palestinian stance has sparked outrage amongst the Jewish communities, which make up a large portion of the city, and makes up the largest population of Jewish people outside of Israel.\n\nMamdani has defended his use of the term 'genocide' to describe Israeli military actions in Gaza, while also saying that he would 'protect Jewish New Yorkers'.\n\nIn his 17-page public safety plan, released in April, he says he has a vision of a New York City 'free from hate violence' and speaks of cracking down on antisemitism. \n\nHe had also previously vowed to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he ever travel to New York City. \n\nMamdani said the basis for the arrest would follow the International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last November. \n\n'This is a city that our values are in line with international law. It's time that our actions are also', he said.\n\nOn Monday night he appeared alongside fellow Democratic candidate Brad Lander, a reform Jew who once considered becoming a rabbi, on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert', and was questioned over his stance. \n\nHe and Lander - New York City's comptroller - endorsed each other in hopes of 'sending Cuomo back to the suburbs,' Mamdani told Colbert. \n\nColbert pushed him on his refusal to condemn calls to 'globalize the intifada', adding: 'They are afraid that your mayorship would actually lead to increased antisemitism.'\n\nThe question teed up Mamdani to denounce antisemitism while not addressing his past statements, which have included calls to 'globalize the intifada' that some say is a call to violence against Jews.\n\nWhen asked during a podcast interview last week if the phrase made him uncomfortable, Mamdani merely said it captured 'a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.'\n\nDuring the interview, Colbert asked Mamdani and Lander about Israel and whether they believe it 'has the right to exist.'\n\n'Yes, like all nations. I believe it has a right to exist, and a responsibility also to uphold international law,' Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani has previously said he hopes Palestinians gain political agency peacefully and that his criticism of the Israeli government is not equivalent to antisemitism. \n\nAfter the podcast appearance, Jewish leaders including Rep. Daniel Goldman and the Anti-Defamation League criticized Mamdani for his remarks. \n\nThe Holocaust Museum in Washington DC even weighed in, calling his comments both 'outrageous and especially offensive'.\n\nLGBTQ issues\n\nMamdani wants to spend $65 million in taxpayer funds for a transgender treatment facility, including for minors, if elected. \n\nHis campaign site says his administration would also form its own Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs.\n\nHe has vowed to protect gender-affirming care with the $65 million investment to 'care to New Yorkers who seek it'.\n\n$57 million would be handed out to public hospitals, community clinics, federal health centers and nonprofits, $8 million would expand services, the site says. \n\nMamdani first announced the protection plan last month at a Trans Community Town Hill meeting flanked by activists. \n\nThe New York Sun who first reported on the spending plan noted that it was unclear if the proposed plan would pay for only medication, or gender surgery as well. \n\nMamdani defended the spending while attacking hospitals in the city who had stopped providing gender-affirming care for minors under threat from President Trump.\n\nThe president had signed in an executive order aimed at restricting transition surgery for those under the age of 19 earlier this year. \n\nThe order axed federal funding to clinics providing treatment to minors in a bid to 'rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures' and compared transgender surgeries to 'chemical and surgical mutilation.' A judge has since blocked the order. \n\nHis campaign has also vowed to go after private hospitals who deny youths transgender care. \n\nAccording to his website, Mamdani would have New York state Attorney General Letitia James and local DA's 'hold them accountable to the law' via investigations and public hearings. \n\nMamdani's Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs would be bankrolled with $87 million in funding, his website added. \n\nStance on police \n\nMamdani has in the past called for the New York City Police Department to be defunded, even branding body a 'rogue agency' in one post to his X. \n\nIn other posts that have resurfaced, he also branded the NYPD as 'wicked and corrupt', while calling for it to be dismantled. \n\nIf elected, Mamdani said he would not hire more police officers, but instead create a city agency called the Department of Community Safety. \n\nProposals to defund or abolish the police are very unpopular, and he seems to have dialed back this rhetoric most recently. \n\nSpeaking during a debate last month with the other candidates, he said: 'I will not defund the police. I will work with the police because I believe the police have a critical role to play in creating public safety.'\n\nMamdani added: 'Sixty-five percent of crimes from the first quarter of this year are still not solved. \n\n'We need to ensure that police can focus on those crimes, and [that] we have mental health professionals and social workers to address and tackle and resolve the mental health crisis and homelessness.'\n\nHis Department of Community safety, he says, would focus on expanding on violence interrupter programs and mental health response teams for 911 calls. \n\nDespite rolling back his previous calls to defund the NYPD, he has said he would cut their overtime budget and the department's $80 million communications budget.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, he said: 'The police have a critical role to play.\n\n'Right now, we’re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net. This department will pioneer evidence-proven approaches that have been successful elsewhere in the country.'\n\nHis plan for the department outlines the cost of building it as $1.1 billion, his team estimated $605 million of that would be transferred from other departments and offices that already exist inside City Hall. \n\nThe remainder, $455 million, would come from new funding sources, which have not all yet been identified.\n\nThe ultimate goal, Mamdani says, is to stop crimes before they occur and address the root causes of crime. \n\nTaxpayer-funded freebies \n\nRunning his campaign based on the high cost of living in New York City, Mamdani catapulted himself into the race by promising a myriad of freebies. \n\nFree buses and no-cost childcare are high up on his populist agenda, as well as promises of city-run grocery stores to tackle high prices and freeze rents on rent stabilized apartments. \n\nTo fund his vision, he hopes to procure $10 billion in new revenue through high taxes on businesses and the wealthiest New Yorkers. \n\nHe also has plans to invest $70 billion in publicly subsidized housing, and to open up public land for housing development. \n\nMamdani's site says: 'We need significantly more affordable housing. But for decades, the City has relied almost entirely on changes to the zoning code to invite and shape private development.\n\n'We can’t afford to wait for the private sector to solve this crisis. Zohran will triple the City’s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes, constructing 200,000 new units over the next 10 years.' \n\nIn a city where a three-bedroom apartment can easily cost $6,000 a month, his message clearly struck a chord. \n\nA Politico review of his proposals found he had widely underestimated the actual cost of housing construction and school rehab plans by tens of billions of dollars. \n\nFormer New York state Governor David Paterson told the outlet: 'He articulates his points very well, and they make sense. \n\n'You understand exactly what he’s saying. The problem is: Nobody told him there’s no such thing as Santa Claus.'\n\nIn a interview earlier this month, Mamdani did say he had 'changed his mind' about private sector construction. \n\nWhile the results were not yet final, Mamdani had such a commanding defeat over Cuomo that the former governor conceded defeat overnight. \n\nCuomo, a 67-year-old political veteran vying to come back from a sexual harassment scandal, told supporters: 'Tonight was not our night. I called him, I congratulated him.' \n\nMamdani had taken 43 percent of the vote with 95 percent of ballots counted, according to city officials. Cuomo was at around 36 percent and appeared to have no chance to catch his rival.\n\nHowever, the contest is ranked-choice, with voters asked to select five candidates in order of preference.\n\nWhen no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote outright, election officials start the time consuming process of eliminating the lowest-ranking candidates and retabulating.\n\nThe confirmed winner will face several contenders in November, including current Mayor Eric Adams, who is a Democrat but has vowed to run again as an independent.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani, who calls himself 'Trump's worst nightmare' is looking to implement a series of woke policies that would drastically reshape the city.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14845893/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayoral-candidate-socialist-views-police-trans.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/25/17/99717725-0-image-m-10_1750867361924.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/25/3871427435293946249/1024x576_MP4_3871427435293946249.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-25 16:17:46","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.001},{"id":335144026,"title":"Usha Vance says she has no plans to abandon Hinduism, explains how Vance children will choose their faith","text":"Second lady Usha Vance spoke candidly in a new interview about how she and Vice President J.D.

J.B. Pritzker is expected to announce on Thursday that he'll seek a third four-year term steering the blue Midwestern state, a source with knowledge confirmed to Fox News. The billionaire governor, a member of the Pritzker family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain and who has started several of his own venture capital and investment startups, is expected to make his announcement in Chicago before traveling to Springfield, Illinois' capital city. Illinois, which is the nation's sixth most populous state, does not have term limits for statewide officials.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION ON JB PRITZKER Pritzker has become one of his Democratic Party's most vocal critics of the sweeping and controversial moves by President Donald Trump during the opening months of his second tour in the White House. \"We’ve got to be ready for the fight,\" Pritzker said in an interview with Fox News Digital in April. PRITZKER ON HOT SEAT AS ILLINOIS GOVERNOR FACES OFF WITH CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL The 60-year-old governor argued that the nation is \"in a constitutional crisis\" and that \"we have too many people who are ill-affected by the policies of the Trump administration.\" Pritzker, who has taken steps to \"Trump-proof\" his solidly blue state, told reporters earlier this year, \"You come for my people, you come through me.\" 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY TRY TO SUCCEED TRUMP IN THE 2028 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Pritzker is seen as a potential contender for the Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination – and the launch of his 2026 gubernatorial re-election campaign is not expected to derail him from potentially running for the White House.

Americans are optimistic.”\n\nNihilism, cynicism and fascism are buzzwords in America today. Optimism, less so.\n\nBut people did look happy. Families knocked their heads together for selfies, squinting through the sunlight at their phones. Young bros munched hotdogs with one hand and slurped Miller Lites with the other.\n\nPredictions of the death of the republic felt far away. For a moment, Saul Bellow seemed to have got it wrong when he wrote, “The human species as a whole has gone into politics.” The Phillie Phanatic, the team’s green, fluffy mascot, the most eminent in America, got off his quad bike, climbed a wall ten feet in front of us and began vigorously humping the air.\n\nI suggested the country might be a bit stuck, spiritually. “I have perfect confidence in the American spiritual purpose,” the representative for Silicon Valley dutifully replied. “It’s the political class that hasn’t been worthy of the American people.” He looked around the stadium again. “Do people seem like they’re in a dark place? They seem like they’re in a good place here.”\n\nKhanna’s optimism runs deeper than baseball crowds. Where other Democrats think we live in an irredeemably populist age and dismiss voters as indulging demagoguery, he sees an enduring belief in democracy. “People underestimate the spirit, the democratic spirit, and the resilience of our people,” he continued. “Martin Luther King did not decry the spirituality of the American people. He summoned it. Obama didn’t decry it. Kennedy didn’t decry it. Leadership is about finding the register to tap in to it.”\n\nKhanna, 48, has been in Congress since 2016 and co-chaired Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. He has become the leading Democrat opposed to Trump’s campaign in Iran and has co-led a War Powers Resolution, which instructs the president to withdraw unauthorised forces acting against Iran. Like the Maga isolationists, he wants to avoid another Iraq. In 2004, aged 27, he ran against a Democratic congressman who supported Bush’s war.\n\n“I’m not a pacifist,” Khanna told me on the phone last week. “I don’t believe in foreign interventions that are going to make matters worse.” He wants the Democrats to be the party that “stands for peace abroad and good jobs at home – we need to retake the mantle of being the anti-war party that Donald Trump took from us. We need to stand united again.”\n\nKhanna perches on the party’s progressive wing, but skirts around its trademark social justice rhetoric. He avoids questions about whether he’ll run for the 2028 presidency. But ignore that: the signs suggest he will. He’s a constant presence on television and takes pride in often appearing on Fox. As early as March 2022, Sanders’ top aides were telling Khanna to run in 2024 if Joe Biden stood down. A year later, the New York Times reported that he was already being talked about as a candidate for 2028. Last year, the Atlantic said that Khanna refused to rule out a run. “The old guard needs to go” he told me, in his professional, studious manner. The implication was obvious: it’s time for his generation to lead.\n\nA few weeks earlier in north DC, Khanna strolled into a coffee shop with a chai tea. He was wearing a blue tie  with a fat Trumpian knot, a congressional pin, and shiny hair gel. He had an impassive air, a rarity in agitated Washington.\n\nHe thought his party was “very self-flagellating and introspective for two months” after the election. But now the listing economy meant the president had “committed the cardinal sin in American politics: you can’t destroy wealth. You can’t go after people’s money.” He’s “optimistic” the Democrats will win come 2028.\n\nKhanna thinks the party hasn’t had a truly open primary since Barack Obama ran against Hillary Clinton in 2008. Who are his would-be competitors for the Democratic nomination this cycle? Apart from Kamala Harris, who is slowly rising from her political grave to attend fundraisers, and Chris Murphy, Trump’s bête noire in the Senate, the field is packed with governors.\n\nThere’s California’s Gavin Newsom, who has launched a podcast in which he banters with leading Maga figures. The Illinois billionaire and long-time Democrat donor JB Pritzker is being touted by old party hands in Washington. Harris’s 2024 running mate, Tim Walz, is keeping up his public appearances. Bringing up the rear is Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro.\n\nBut the only energy in the party since the election has been on Bernie Sanders’ anti-oligarchy tour, featuring his support act, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another frontrunner. At a stop in Pennsylvania in May, a union leader introduced Sanders with the line: “No other politician is able to do it like him.” Which, given that he is 83, is part of the problem.\n\n“The two most consequential Democrats in the modern era [are] Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders,” Khanna said. Khanna’s politics are a mix of Sanders and Obama. His Obama-esque brand of optimism makes Sanders’ progressive policies sound less radical to the establishment. Is he Bernie’s heir?\n\n“No, that would be highly presumptuous. Bernie Sanders is not cloneable. Great leaders like Bernie or Obama have no heirs. Who’s Winston Churchill’s heir? Who’s Gandhi’s heir?”\n\nAt the game, we were sitting four rows behind first base. Khanna and his younger brother, an urbane federal attorney, were to my left, with their parents to my right. The brothers were trading notes on whether the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates was the best in the league. Their mother leaned over and mischievously said baseball had got better once the rules were changed to shorten the time between pitches. She and their father – an aloof, dignified man who prefers cricket – raised the boys in nearby Bucks County, and would bring them to a game once a year. “They’d get all the food!” she reminisced. Nowadays, the family obliges when Khanna shepherds them pitch-side in freshly bought Phillies hats to take a photo for social media.\n\nKhanna’s parents came over from the Punjab in 1968. His maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, spent time in prison for supporting civil disobedience during Ghandi’s campaign for India’s independence from British rule. He went on to become an MP and lead the Punjabi branch of the Indian National Trade Union Congress. “He was my inspiration,” Khanna said. “He really stood for the ideals of non-violence, pluralism, self-determination.” What does he take from his grandfather’s story? “The importance of courage in politics, the importance of a willingness to stand up for what you believe.”\n\nThat Martin Luther King drew deeply from Gandhi’s satyagraha philosophy means the American civil rights leader looms large in Khanna’s politics. “In his book on non-violence King said that we must be angry and reform a system – not obsess over the players in the system.” For Khanna, King is the bridge between the seemingly disparate worlds of the Punjab and the United States, between the activism his grandfather championed and the country Khanna now wants to lead.\n\nThe morning of the baseball game, Khanna was on ABC News telling his fellow Democrats to admit they were wrong to let a senile 81-year-old run for president. In our seats, he flicked through emails on his phone, triaging the fall-out. The party is still writhing over its part in Trump’s comeback. Khanna thinks voters can only trust the Democrats again once they own up to that mistake.\n\nHis politics, too, cuts against the party’s progressive grain. He pushes what he’s light-heartedly called “Blue Maga”, a coinage ill-suited for a Democrat popularity contest. Ditto the fact that the Maga guru Steve Bannon told me Khanna is one of his favourite Democrats.\n\nWhatever the optics, Khanna wants to beat Trump by spreading the bounty of economic growth. His main idea – what he calls economic patriotism – is to reindustrialise the US with a Marshall Plan for America. He wants Medicare for all. He fights for more taxes on the wealthy, getting big money out of politics and a higher minimum wage. But he is no Luddite: he sees technology as America’s saviour.\n\nAt Yale Law School in the late 1990s Professor Lawrence Lessig told him all the interesting law would be in Silicon Valley. He heeded the advice, joined a firm and represented “tech start-ups, tech companies, venture capital”. He got the call from the Obama administration in 2009 to become a deputy assistant secretary in the Commerce Department. Elon Musk called him a “leading thinker” for a blurb quote for his 2012 book Entrepreneurial Nation. And then, after a few false starts, he was elected to the House of Representatives for California’s 17th Congressional District, located in Silicon Valley, in 2016.\n\nVenture capitalists backed Khanna’s run, and so his call for wealth taxes presents a puzzle: why did capital’s traffic wardens support this union-backing progressive? “They still support me,” he said, “because I’m pro-innovation.”\n\n“They believe I’m a technology optimist, and I believe that technology has to be part of the solution of the American renewal.” Technology itself, in Khanna’s world, sits on a different moral plane to those technologists who use “their wealth to distort politics”. “I’m very opposed to this vision that innovation is incompatible with democracy.”\n\nKhanna is intensely relaxed about artificial intelligence. He thinks robots will replace workers at a slower rate than the doomsters suggest. “We need to have strong labour protection, so there’s collective bargaining, so workers get to decide and control machines, not be displaced by machines.” Again, something for both the technologists and the progressives.\n\nCompare that language to a recent tweet from Sanders: “AI is coming for YOUR job.” Khanna’s ecumenical approach to politics means he shuns this populist division of us and them – and yet retains the policy.\n\nLabour protections are fine. But what if workers aren’t around to feel the benefits of a trade union? Might AI be a meteor that wipes us out? “No, no, it’s like any technology: we need to have a humanistic frame for it.”\n\nThere’s a proprietary pride in the way Khanna touts the supremacy of Silicon Valley. It’s an area in which his “progressive capitalism” fuses with his conviction that America is exceptional and unique. His usually decorous tone takes on a nationalistic pitch.\n\n“The EU has no credibility [on tech],” he said. “They haven’t produced a single consequential tech company other than [the Dutch supplier for semiconductors] ASML,” he said.\n\n“America will lead. America will make a decision. We have failed in having the proper sense of regulation. But people laugh at the EU’s regulations because it’d be like if I tried to regulate [American] football, never having played football.”\n\nAnd what of that famed “special relationship” with the UK? Does the UK have any standing on technology?\n\n“It’s a yawn. I care more about what some random congressperson thought about AI than when Rishi Sunak said he was going to do an AI summit. I kind of laughed.”\n\nAnd why is that?\n\n“Because it’d be like if I said I wanted to do a summit of what it’s like to live in the developing world. It’s like, what the hell do you know about what’s going on about innovation and technology?”\n\nThe UK does have a trillion-dollar tech industry, I pointed out. “I have a $14trn tech district,” Khanna replied.\n\nHis thoughts on Sunak were delivered with brevity: “Fine. Technocrat. Proud of his story.”\n\nKhanna sees little resemblance between himself and Sunak because his newly minted Silicon Valley neighbour (Sunak’s now a fellow at Stanford) lacks a “humanistic side”. “I mean, I’m proud of him as someone who overcame being Indian and Hindu and was proud of his whole heritage, but I think it was not transformational an ideology. I respect him on a personal basis.”\n\nForget Sunak. There’s another young politician in Washington who courts Big Tech and preaches reindustrialisation, who can thrive in the Valley and the Rust Belt – and who hopes one day to lead their party.\n\nIn February, JD Vance defended an employee on Musk’s cost-cutting team who had once tweeted, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” and, “Normalise Indian hate.” Khanna took issue with that, and tweeted at Vance: “Are you going to tell him to apologise for saying ‘Normalise Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.”\n\nVance, whose wife’s parents are also Indian immigrants, replied: “For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up… You know what I do worry about, Ro? That they’ll grow up to be a US Congressmen [sic] who engages in emotional blackmail over a kid’s social media posts. You disgust me.”\n\nInternet spats are one way in which Khanna has made himself the Democrats’ loudest critic of the vice-president. On 5 May, Khanna gave a speech, pointedly at their shared alma mater Yale Law School, in which he criticised Vance for the administration’s attacks on free speech and universities, calling the vice-president’s time at Yale a “stain on the degree of every Yale graduate”.\n\nThough Khanna comes from an immigrant family, and Vance from a broken one, they have similar careers.\n\n“But very different values,” Khanna said. “I’m not for getting rid of due process. I believe that our multi-racial democracy is a strength, not a weakness.”\n\nIn his convention speech last year, Vance argued that America is not an idea, but a nation state, a group of people living between two oceans, whose interests come above those ideals debated in Independence Hall – where both the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution were signed – three miles from the stadium.\n\n“It is a nation state,” Khanna said, but “we also have the dedication to the idea, where we’re conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition of equality.” Vance is “making us less exceptional” he added. “He’s making us another ordinary nation.”\n\nHe worries America might become a place where humans are ordinary, not one where their brutishness is alloyed with a higher purpose. “[Trump and Vance] made America so much about transaction and survival of the jungle and doing what’s in your self-interest, or you’re a sucker and you’re weak. And that’s a very impoverished vision of America. That’s every other nation.\n\n“What makes America the spark of vitality, of inspiration is that we seek to ennoble that. We seek to inspire beyond that. That’s our exceptional nature.” American exceptionalism is not in vogue much nowadays. Large factions of the left and right see American imperialism as a sinful enterprise. In many ways, they think it’s time the US became more like every other nation.\n\nMight Trump be the archetypal American leader, the apogee of… “the American id,” Khanna jumped in. “Kennedy or Obama is the embodiment of the American ideal.”\n\nWe walked up the stadium steps after the game and Khanna asked me to sum up his perspective in two sentences. “Progressivism mixed with American exceptionalism,” I offered. “American progressivism,” he said, smiling, “I’d never thought about it like that before.”\n\nWe drove 40 minutes north to a village hall in Bucks County, the part of Pennsylvania where Khanna grew up. The changeable sign on the lawn outside read: “MEI CATERING BUCKS BEST WEDDING – 215 364 2130”. Inside, around 100 people sat beneath leftover wedding decorations. One organiser told me the local Republican representative, Brian Fitzpatrick, has not held in-person town halls for the district in years. On the stage, Khanna promised to stay until all their questions were answered. (When I left, he was fielding questions by the stage.)\n\nThe first questioner told Khanna he should call Trump voters “white supremacists”. Khanna demurred. He would never label half the country like that. These are fellow Americans, endowed with exceptionalism. He doesn’t believe it, anyway.\n\nThree other questioners (at least one a self-identifying millennial) were worried about the party’s language and messaging: “We need to stop using this weak language – this is Nazi crap. This is eugenics.” I spied two surgical masks in the room. Khanna said Trump voters do not like what the president is doing and can be won over. “That’s because they’re stupid,” one woman muttered behind me.\n\nNoticeably, he did not mention trans people in one of his answers: “gay, lesbian…” he paused, listing those under threat from the administration. “Trans!” an audience member shouted out. “… or whatever your sexuality,” Khanna continued. He strangely still thinks “woke” only means respecting minorities’ history but his condemnation of cancel culture to me (he called himself a “free-speech absolutist”) suggests he knows the political toll wokeness has taken on the Democratic Party.\n\nThe night before, Khanna got talking to Trump voters who were protesting outside his town hall in Allentown. They had recognised him from his appearances on Fox News. Khanna invited them in to listen to his speech. When he said he was trying to pass a bill supporting Trump’s plan to lower prescription drugs, “they clapped. I talked about not cutting Medicaid. They clapped. They love the economic patriotism of building new industry and how we’re going to build manufacturing. And this is what we need to do: engage these Trump supporters.”\n\nRo Khanna is an American optimist. In one sense, he pans Trumpland sewage for nuggets of hope. In another, he sees through crises to an irrepressible American spirit. Trump’s marauding power cannot crush his conviction that democracy will endure.\n\nHe has no time for the idea that politicians have become sad stars in a reality television show. He once said Trump will be a footnote in American history. That seems complacent, even innocent. But Khanna’s Sanders-esque policies lend his politics of optimism an edge of reality, a confidence to turn and face the reasons we live in a Trumpian age.\n\n[See also: Labour is losing its mind]","summary":"The left-wing congressman – and Democrat presidential contender – on “Blue Maga” and being Bernie’s heir.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/us/2025/06/ro-khanna-interview-american-optimist","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/06/25/202525RoKhannaNOCC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 15:42:57","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":335126504,"title":"Glamorous socialite sued over Porsche crash that left elderly woman with a 'traumatic brain injury'","text":"A glamorous socialite rammed into a senior citizen with her Porsche, leaving the woman with a traumatic brain injury, according to the alleged victim's lawsuit.\n\nVanessa Getty, who married into the oil-rich Getty family, struck 66-year-old Mary Riley's parked vehicle on March 28, 2024, according to Riley's lawsuit.\n\nThe socialite, 53, allegedly lost control of her $100,000 Porsche Taycan while looking for her glasses.\n\nRiley had just got back into her 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK 550 and had not even had time to shut the car door before Getty smashed into her, the suit claimed.\n\n'Suddenly and without warning a vehicle driven by Defendant Vanessa Louise Getty violently crashed into Plaintiff's parked vehicle,' the complaint filed on June 18 states.\n\nAs a result of the incident Riley suffered, 'orthopedic injuries and a traumatic brain injury,' the suit said.\n\nRiley's lawyer, Quinton Cutlip, told Daily Mail that Getty told responding officers that, 'she had been distracted because she was looking for her glasses' when the crash happened.\n\n'Ms. Getty was negligent and was apologetic at the scene.

In an interview with The View earlier this year, he pointed to stances on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights as reasons he would not fit in with the GOP. Some Democrats have called on him to face a primary challenge in 2028.The new poll from Susquehanna Polling suggests that Fetterman remains narrowly above water among Democrats, but that Republicans view him even more favorably. These polling numbers, if they hold over the next few years, could have key implications for his political future.What To KnowThe Susquehanna poll showed that Fetterman remains more popular than not with Pennsylvania voters, with 41 percent approving of him, compared to 37 percent disapproving.Among Democrats, only 40 percent gave him positive marks, compared to 39 percent who disapprove of his job performance. An additional 21 percent were unsure of their feelings toward Fetterman.Republicans, however, gave him stronger approval. Forty-five percent approved of Fetterman, while 37 percent disapprove of him, according to the poll. Eighteen percent said they were not sure. Meanwhile, 30 percent of independents approved of Fetterman, while 27 percent disapproved; 41 percent were not sure.The poll surveyed 713 likely voters from June 17 to June 21, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.Fetterman has faced growing criticism from Pennsylvania Democrats, with his name being booed during a \"No Kings\" protest held in Philadelphia earlier this month. His comments about Israel amid its conflicts with Iran and Hamas, as well as his more moderate positioning on the U.S.-Mexico border, have drawn criticism from the party's more left-leaning wing.Fetterman defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in the 2022 Pennsylvania race by about five points; however, Pennsylvania remains a critical battleground, with roughly equal support for Democrats and Republicans.President Donald Trump won the state by nearly two points against former Vice President Kamala Harris last November, and it's likely to be a battleground again in the 2028 race, when Fetterman will also be on the ballot if he chooses to run for reelection.What People Are SayingSusquehanna Polling and Research President James Lee told PennLive: \"It's hard to say how he fares in a reelection contest, which is still a few years away, but based on this latest poll his real vulnerability seems to be in a Democratic primary.\"Senator John Fetterman said on The View in January: \"I would make a pretty terrible Republican because, you know, pro-choice, pro really strong immigration, pro-LGBTQ...I don't think I'd be a good fit. So, I'm not going to change my party, and if I am...I'll give you the exclusive.\"What Happens NextFetterman's reelection is years away, and he has not confirmed whether he intends to run again. Some Pennsylvania Democrats are hoping for a primary challenge in the race.Former Representative Conor Lamb, who ran against Fetterman in 2022, has been floated as a potential rival but told Politico earlier this year he is \"not considering any campaign right now.\"","summary":"Fetterman is more popular with Republicans than Democrats in Pennsylvania, according to a new poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/john-fetterman-approval-republicans-pennsylvania-poll-2090583","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2671096/senator-john-fetterman.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 15:01:41","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":335173926,"title":"“You Must Be Truly F--king Stupid”: Meet the Man Behind the White House’s Shock Jock Press Strategy","text":"“FAKE NEWS CNN STRIKES AGAIN,” Leavitt posted on X to her 1.3 million followers. She then added a second post noting that one of the lead reporters on CNN’s story, Natasha Bertrand, had also written a Politico story in 2020 in which former intelligence officials raised concerns that Hunter Biden’s laptop was part of a Russian disinformation plot. “How did that work out for you, @NatashaBertrand?” sneered Leavitt.\nAs aggressive as Leavitt’s response was, it was positively subtle compared to the one HuffPost reporter S.V. Date got from the White House last month. After he asked communications director Steven Cheung why transcripts of many of President Donald Trump’s public remarks had not been posted on the White House website, Cheung lowered the boom: “You must be truly fucking stupid if you think we’re not transparent,” he told Date in a statement. “We’ve even granted low-level outlets like HuffPo additional access to events, because we’re so transparent. For anyone to think otherwise proves they are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.” His parting admonition: “Stop beclowning yourself.”\nPresident Trump’s public hostility toward the news media includes filing a dubious lawsuit against CBS News parent Paramount over how the network edited a Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview, banning the Associated Press from the Oval Office, and seeking the end of federal funding for PBS, NPR, and Voice of America. But Trump’s anti-media disdain plays out in smaller ways via his press shop, which often turns reporters’ requests for comment into opportunities to unleash withering streams of crude insults and insinuations.\nCheung is the most aggressive of Trump’s press staffers, and the architect of the weaponized comms. After serving as the chief spokesman during the 2024 campaign, Cheung was appointed by Trump to oversee White House communication. A former spokesman for the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a self-described “pro-wrestling historian,” Cheung is a regular practitioner of the verbal smackdown. Merely providing the White House’s take on an issue usually isn’t enough; Cheung often garnishes his public replies with a rancid cherry. After Daily Beast editor Joanna Coles went on CNN and raised questions about Trump’s weight loss in April, for example, Cheung took to X and called her a “blithering idiot” who was “suffering from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome rotting her pea-sized brain.”\nBack in March, when journalist Tara Palmeri wrote on Substack about Elon Musk’s fraying relationship with the Trump White House, Cheung had a blunt response: “These sources are full of shit and have no idea what they’re talking about.” Palmeri’s sources, in fact, provided an early preview of the eventual Trump-Musk blowup.\nOn his official White House X feed, Cheung has referred to various political adversaries and reporters as a “cuck,” “dumbass,” “dummy” and “a dick.” He also posted last month that former FBI director James Comey “might be one of the dumbest motherf—-ers in human history.”\nLeavitt, the press secretary, tends to refrain from such coarse responses during televised briefings, but she can be scathing too, once the cameras are off. In an X post in February, she trashed New York Times reporter Peter Baker after he compared the AP’s Oval Office ban and the White House’s seizure of the press pool to Vladimir Putin’s tactics in the Kremlin. “Gone are the days where left-wing stenographers posing as journalists, such as yourself, dictate who gets to ask what,” Leavitt snapped.\nBaker, who has covered every president since Bill Clinton, told me the exchange was typical. “The automatic response to any inquiry now [is] to insult the reporter and malign the news organization, often ad hominem and often without addressing the substance of the inquiry,” he said. “That wasn’t such a routine in [Trump’s] first term. It seems to be a policy in the second.”\nThe in-your-face approach trickles down to junior staffers, too. After a lawyer erroneously wrote that air-traffic controllers were subject to a hiring freeze following a deadly plane crash in January, White House press aide Alex Pfeiffer ripped him as a “lying hack” on X. (Pfeiffer, formerly Tucker Carlson’s producer at Fox News, used equally colorful language to describe his contempt for Trump’s advisers and supporters and their claims of election fraud in the wake of the 2020 election. According to emails made public in 2023 in Dominion Voting System’s defamation lawsuit against Fox, Pfeiffer called Trump lawyer Sidney Powell “a fucking nutcase,” and described Trump’s most loyal supporters as “cousin f—ker types.”)\nAnother deputy, Anna Kelly, gave an earful to New York Times reporter Minho Kim earlier this month after Kim asked the White House for comment about the ethics of corporations advertising their products as part of the Army’s 250th anniversary parade. Kelly skipped any factual or substantive response and went straight to the accusations. The Times, she told Kim in a statement, was “pining to insult” the Army. She further suggested that Kim’s story dishonored those who gave their lives in battle.\nThe resort to invective isn’t just a change from the mannered and measured official pronouncements of previous administrations; it’s a change even from the standards of Trump 1.0. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Jahan Wilcox, told a reporter she was “a piece of trash.” Such outbursts were unusual then. The bar is lower now, mainly because the administration has made such invective commonplace.\nThe White House’s sniping is often delivered via two official but otherwise anonymous social media accounts, Rapid Response 47 and DOD Rapid Response, the latter emanating from the Pentagon. The accounts routinely denounce and label news stories critical of the administration as “fake news,” which so far includes reporting by ABC News, The Atlantic, the BBC, CBS News, CNN, Financial Times, NBC News, The New York Times, NPR, Reuters, USA Today, and The Washington Post, among others. Notably, the reporting of Trump-friendly outlets seems to have escaped nearly all notice.\nCheung vents at journalists so often that he has to recycle some of his more piquant insults, such as describing critics as “beclowning” themselves, possessing “a pea- (or peanut-) sized brain” or suffering from “a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” He’s applied the latter term to Coles, CNN anchor Erin Burnett, the Associated Press, The Washington Post, Harvard professor emeritus Laurence Tribe, former Trump advisers John Bolton and John Kelly, MSNBC commentator Barbara McQuade, journalist Bob Woodward, and former Republican candidate Nikki Haley, among others. Author Michael Wolff, who has written several books critical of Trump, hit the daily double in February: Cheung called Wolff “a lying sack of shit” who has “a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\nIn a brief exchange of emails, Cheung suggested his communications style was a bold and refreshingly honest break from the official White House–speak of yore. “We speak directly and clearly, untethered by traditional and outdated mores of politics often cloaked in trite responses that do not serve the American public well,” he wrote. “The press knows exactly where we stand and if you ask any reporter across the ideological spectrum, most will tell you they have great relationships with all of us.”\nWell, “great” may not be the most apt term. Date, the HuffPost reporter, called Cheung’s retorts “puerile” and the stuff of “a fourth-grader on the playground” in an interview. “Their objective is to insult the reporter and trash the [news] outlet rather than provide accurate information,” he told me. The larger issue, he noted, is how the insults allow the flacks to evade the questions reporters have raised. “I’ve asked them to refute any of the facts I’ve reported, and they’ve been unable to do that,” he said.\nIn direct personal interactions and in background comments, Cheung can be pleasant and helpful, Palmeri and other journalists said. But for public consumption—or maybe just for Trump—he adopts the persona of an avenging, foul-mouthed avatar. It’s an act, Palmeri says, “a machismo thing. I don’t take it personally…. This is who they are and how they choose to speak. That’s their choice. Their goal is to slam, dunk on, and ‘own’ the media. It feels like we’re being dragged into a reality show we didn’t sign up for.”","summary":"Reporters can expect aggressive, hostile, and even foul-mouthed replies to questions, a bare-knuckle style that Steven Cheung, the architect of the weaponized comms team, considers “untethered by traditional and outdated mores of politics.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-shock-jock-press-strategy","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/685c074820a863198a590a32/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Steven-Cheung-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 14:57:58","author":"Paul Farhi","authors":["Paul Farhi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":335110912,"title":"Scott Brown Announces Candidacy for New Hampshire Senate Race","text":"Former Massachusetts GOP Sen.

Him suggesting we now adjust them to cater to the right is new. And it sucks.”\n\nBut let’s be clear: There’s a difference between catering to the right and doing what we need to win elections while staying true to our core values. Purity politics will keep us in the minority. If the left-left wants to win on the strength of its agenda, it has a long way to go in winning over hearts and minds.\n\nA new Echelon Insights poll makes this clear. Asked what kind of party they’d want if the two major parties disappeared, only 6% of likely voters would support a party with a Green New Deal-style agenda focused on ending systemic inequality, breaking up corporations, and promoting full economic and social justice.\n\nAnother 13% would support a party that “advance[s] social progress including women's rights and LGBTQ rights, work[s] with other countries through free trade and diplomacy, cut[s] the deficit, and reform[s] capitalism with sensible regulation.” That’s fairly center-left.\n\nBut the best-performing left-of-center message? A middle-class focus—universal health insurance, stronger labor unions, and higher taxes on the rich to help the less well-off. That scored 31% support. It’s not a majority, but it’s stronger than either of the two conservative-aligned options, which together totaled 44%.\n\nSure, we can quibble with question wording, but the trend is clear: People support equality in theory, but they want politicians focused on their lives. That means better wages (which unions deliver), affordable housing, cheaper groceries, accessible education, and a shot at the American dream. When 75% of men say they won’t do better than their parents, it’s no surprise they’re angry.\n\nYes, racism is baked into conservative appeal. But maybe that tops out around the 44% of voters drawn to conservative messaging. Republicans can’t win national elections or hold Congress with 44%. \n\nThe Senate map for the 2026 midterm elections looks rough on paper. Democrats will defend open seats in swingy Michigan, light-blue New Hampshire, and lean-red Georgia. Meanwhile, Republicans have to defend only Maine and North Carolina. In a typical year, Democrats might gain a seat (or lose one)—nowhere near the four they need to flip for a majority.\n\nBut next year won’t be typical. Trump’s Republicans are self-sabotaging with their unpopular “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will likely tank them in the House. Still, the Senate is all but surely out of reach.\n\nDemocrats’ next-best pickup targets after Maine and North Carolina? Florida and Texas. That’s how bleak it is. To retake the chamber, Democrats would need to miraculously win all four of those states and hold every vulnerable seat.\n\nEnter the much-maligned “moderates.”\n\nLast year, political newcomer Dan Osborn ran as an independent in deep-red Nebraska. The GOP hammered him with “Bernie Sanders of Nebraska”-style attack ads. They tried hard to brand him as a Democrat.\n\nYet, on Election Day, he lost by just under 7 percentage points, scoring 46.5% of the vote to Republican incumbent Deb Fischer’s 53.2%, in a state Trump won by over 20 points. That means Osborn overperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by a stunning 13 points.\n\nOsborn is a labor organizer and Navy vet. His platform? Lower taxes on small businesses, raise the minimum wage, legalize marijuana, expand union rights, preserve gun ownership. He backed tougher border enforcement but supported legal pathways for undocumented workers. He wanted to protect Social Security benefits and expand funding for public schools.\n\nAs a progressive, I hate some of that. But I love other parts. And more importantly, most of it is opposed by Nebraska’s Republican incumbents. Osborn’s secret? A relentless focus on economic livelihoods while neutralizing Democrats’ social-issue vulnerabilities.\n\nSo no, I’m not violating my values by being thrilled that Osborn is exploring a run in 2026. He won’t give me my progressive utopia—but he could help stop the Republican dystopia if he won and caucused with Democrats. That’s a trade I’ll take.\n\nOsborn’s model could work elsewhere, and the path to the majority isn’t through only moderates. If we get lucky, we may see former Sen. Sherrod Brown attempt a comeback in Ohio. And Beto O’Rourke—who very nearly won a Senate race in Texas in 2018—has been campaigning with progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and eyeing another run.\n\nProgressives will have plenty of candidates to be excited about. But if we want a durable Senate majority—one that can one day bring in D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood—we must recenter the party around the economic issues that unify the working majority.\n\nForget the MAGA base. They’re gone. No one is catering to those A-holes. But a huge swath of Americans simply want a government that improves their lives.\n\nIf our brand becomes “we prioritize transgender athletes playing on teams that match their gender identity”—a position opposed by 65% of likely voters, per Echelon Insights’ poll—we won’t win. It sucks to write that, believe me, but losing elections hurts more, as Trump proves every single day.\n\nWe can make common cause with voters on what unites us. Here are two other left-leaning causes that polled especially well, per Echelon Insights:\n\n Raise the minimum wage to $20/hour: 58% support, 37% oppose.\n\n Raises taxes on those making over $250,000: 68% support, 27% oppose.\n\nHeck, one item in the poll even asked whether voters thought it was “the responsibility of the federal government to ensure everyone has health care.” And guess what? Sixty-two percent of voters think it is the government’s responsibility, while only 34% think it isn’t.\n\nConservatives keep saying Americans don’t want socialism, but is there anything more socialist than universal health coverage? And Americans support that by a nearly 2-1 margin! \n\nGuys, we can win big on those issues—and more! We can deliver the American Dream. And in doing so, we can build broader support for our fuller progressive agenda over time.\n\nThat’s how we win. That’s how we govern. And that’s how we fight for everyone—including the most marginalized—without dooming ourselves to permanent minority status.","summary":"Many of you are going to hate this, but if Democrats have any shot at reclaiming the Senate next year, it’ll happen through the party’s moderate flank.\n\n\n\nI get it.

Scott Brown is making another run for Senate in New Hampshire. Brown ran unsuccessfully for Senate in New Hampshire in 2014, after representing Massachusetts in the Senate from 2010 to 2013. After his failed New Hampshire run, Brown served as President Donald Trump's ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa during Trump's first term. Brown touted his background in his launch video, also saying, \"Like a lot of you, I’m worried about where the country is headed.\" “New Hampshire is an amazing place to live, work and raise a family,\" Brown said. \"We’ve been blessed by two great governors: Chris Sununu and Kelly Ayotte. But in Washington, we haven’t been represented by the right people.” Brown then took direct aim at Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who is running for Senate to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. “For four years, Chris Pappas has stood by Joe Biden as he opened the border, drove up the cost of everything and made life just simply unaffordable,” Brown said. Brown also praised Trump, saying, \"He sealed the border, he stood up to China, and he restored our standing in the world,\" showing an image of Trump in the Situation Room taken as Trump authorized strikes against Iran. Pappas responded to Brown's announcement, saying in a statement that Brown \"stands with corporate special interests, supports efforts to strip away health care coverage from tens of thousands of Granite Staters, and backs President Trump’s reckless tariffs that New Hampshire small businesses are speaking out against every single day.\" \"While Scott Brown looks for yet another opportunity to do Wall Street’s bidding and blindly support President Trump and his agenda, I’ll always put New Hampshire first,” Pappas added.

The group shared the documents with The Daily Signal.\n\nThe Daily Signal called and emailed the New York and D.C. attorneys general offices multiple times on Tuesday and Wednesday. The offices of Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, Maryland Attorney General Antony Brown, and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser responded to inquiries for this story and declined to comment. \n\nCommon interest agreements allow separately represented parties–in this case states–that share a legal interest to share confidential information and legal strategies with each other without waiving the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine. But Horner is skeptical of the rationale for the common agreement. \n\n“Even when they try to paper that over by saying these states might want to intervene or file an amicus brief, wanting a political outcome is not the same as sharing a legal interest in that outcome,” Horner told The Daily Signal. “But that is what a lot of these represent. One further ‘tell’ is that many were entered in anticipation of the prospect of what a hypothetical future Trump administration might do.”\n\nMonths before the election, it was Oregona’s top state lawyer Ellen Rosenblum who became part of an agreement July 19 to challenge the White House Council on Environmental Quality “in promulgating a rule or guidance.” The council was at the time under President Joe Biden. \n\nA few days later, four other attorneys general–from Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Wisconsin–signed on, just a day after incumbent President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be his successor. \n\nStates haven’t sued over actions by the Council on Environmental Quality during Trump’s second term but brought an August 2020 lawsuit that was paused after Biden was elected. \n\nOn Nov. 8, four days after Trump’s victory, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and then-Oregon Attorney General Rosenblum were the first to sign an agreement to challenge an anticipated Trump action opposing the premise of birthright citizenship. Most others signed on by Nov. 12, and the agreement was finalized on Nov. 14. \n\nA day after Trump’s inauguration, 19 state attorneys general announced their lawsuit on defending birthright citizenship. \n\nBy Dec. 19, Democrat attorneys general from 23 states signed an agreement for “potential litigation to challenge executive, agency, and state actions to vacate, rescind, enjoin, or\n\nStay” a rule allowing beneficiaries of the Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and other noncitizens to have access to health plans under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. \n\nFive days before Trump was sworn in, a group of 15 Democrat attorneys general asked a federal court to allow them to intervene in an existing lawsuit to defend health subsidies for illegal immigrants who came to the country with their parents. The Biden administration expanded Obamacare for about 147,000 people protected under the DACA policy. \n\nIn a 2024 agreement, the names of 12 separate attorneys general, along with some state environmental officials, were on an agreement to protect the Inflation Reduction Act, one of President Joe Biden’s key legislative achievements, expanding taxpayer subsidies for environmental programs and an expansion of the Internal Revenue Service. The document was not dated, but included the name of Oregon’s Rosenblum, who left office on Dec. 31.\n\nThe agreement said the states “anticipate participating in administrative and judicial proceedings that are ongoing or expected to be brought addressing actions or omissions relating to implementation of the federal Inflation Reduction Act.” \n\nThe agreement added this “could include, among other things, submitting filings to federal agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and/or the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and/or engaging in litigation relating to actions or omissions of such agencies regarding implementation of the IRA.”\n\nGreen subsidies were key through the documents, said Horner, the lawyer for Government Accountability and Oversight.\n\n“One common thread is that these AGs coalesced to protect the interests of key political constituencies: trial lawyers and green groups, for example,” Horner said. \n\nThe states did sue over a federal funding freeze–which included Inflation Reduction Act money. A Rhode Island federal judge sided with the states to prevent the funding freeze. \n\nAn agreement among Democrat attorneys general that was effective on Jan. 3 said, “The Parties have agreed that they have a common interest in developing legal strategies to challenge the actions and formation of the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”), and a common interest in any existing or future executive, legislative, regulatory, and investigative actions or inactions and any administrative or judicial proceedings related to or arising from DOGE recommendations (the “Common Interest Matter”).”\n\nIn February, 14 states sued to challenge the authority of DOGE and its chief, Elon Musk, to access government data. \n\nBy Jan. 9, attorneys general from 23 states joined to defend a ruled on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regarding regulations of those in the business “of selling firearms,” including litigation and “any existing or future legislative, regulatory, investigative, or litigation proceedings related to” the government’s definition. The state of Texas sued the ATF, challenging the agency’s definition and argued it infringes on private gun sales and oversteps the agency’s authority. \n\nMost of the 23 attorneys general that signed in November on to a common interest agreement to defend another ATF rule on the classification of “forced reset triggers,” and to defend or challenge decisions by ATF to change the policy. The agreement was reached on Jan. 9. \n\nThis month, 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to reverse a policy on triggers, arguing that rifles can be converted to machine guns. \n\nThe Daily Signal contacted the offices of 17 other attorneys general named in the various common interest agreements on both Tuesday and Wednesday. The offices did not respond by publication time. These offices were for Attorneys General Kris Mayes of Arizona; Bonta of California; Williamong of Connecticut; Kathy Jennings of Delaware; Anne Lopez of Hawaii; Raoul of Illinois; Andrea Campbell of Massachusetts; Dana Nessell of Michigan; Aaron Ford of Nevada; Matthew Platkin of New Jersey; Raul Torrez of New Mexico; Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; Dan Rayfield of Oregon; Peter Neronha of Rhode Island; Charity Clark of Vermont; and Josh Kaul of Wisconsin.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL – As early as July of last year, during the heat of a presidential race, a group of Democrat state...

The ultimate outcome may not be known for days due to the city's ranked choice voting system.He will now face off against incumbent mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent in November's election—and Cuomo could still reenter the race.Still, Mamdani, a progressive upstart with a history of pro-Palestinian activism, is on course to become the first Muslim mayor of the nation's largest city.His victory is sure to reverberate through the Democratic Party at a time when it remains ideologically divided about its future after losing the White House in November.\"Zohran Mamdani's triumph in New York City's Democratic primary represents more than just an electoral upset. It's a confirmation that progressive politics, when pursued with discipline, vision and vigor, can resonate broadly – even in a city known for its entrenched power structures,\" said Bhaskar Sunkara, president of progressive politics magazine The Nation, in an opinion piece for The Guardian.National Democrats will also likely look to Mamdani's winning strategy as they try to win back younger voters who abandoned them in November's election.Pollster Nate Silver wrote in a post on his Silver Bulletin website that it shows how the \"aging Democratic establishment should probably be put out to pasture.\"He wrote: \"If you want to inspire younger voters, nominate younger candidates. Mamdani, at age 33, is literally half Cuomo's age: the former governor is 67.\"Mamdani \"thoroughly earned the win, and Cuomo and the Democratic establishment thoroughly earned the loss,\" Silver added. \"And even if they finally take the hint, generational turnover in the Democratic Party is coming whether they like it or not.\"David Hogg, who has clashed with Democratic National Committee leadership over his plan to raise money for young progressive candidates challenging Democratic incumbents, said on X that Mamdani's campaign \"constantly grows in size in person and virtually bc people believe the message so much this share it for free and get others to join in. People want something to believe in & for many Zohran was the first Democrat who gave them that, post 2024.\"Pablo O'Hana, a political advisor and campaign strategist who worked on former vice president Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign last year, said Mamdani's win \"is proof\" that progressive ideas can win elections.Mamdani \"speaks the language of renters, immigrants and low-income workers – not in abstract policy terms, but with urgency and clarity,\" O'Hana wrote in an opinion piece for The Independent newspaper.His platform focused on freezing rent, building affordable housing, free buses, free child care, a higher minimum wage and more, mostly paid for by new taxes on the rich.New York City \"is not as friendly to progressive leftism as you might find on the West Coast,\" Silver noted. \"Instead, it has elected mayors like Adams, Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, and there's recently been a conservative backlash in the city, which swung strongly to Donald Trump last year. But that makes Zohran's win more impressive, not less.\"But Thomas Gift, the director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, said Mamdani's victory could prove to be short-lived.\"Mamdani's politics resonate with a relatively narrow segment of Democratic elites, which may be enough to win a New York City primary but is likely to face stiffer competition in a general election,\" he told Newsweek. \"Self-styled socialists always have a ceiling of support.\"Gift added that Mamdani was also \"fortunate to face a scandal-plagued primary challenger whom many New Yorkers were eager to cast aside—yet again.\"Mamdani's success also came despite his defiant stance against Israel, which led to accusations of antisemitism that he refuted.\"In a city with more Jewish residents than Tel Aviv, this would typically be politically suicidal,\" O'Hana wrote. \"But Mamdani has made a sharp distinction between opposing Israeli government policy and antisemitism – a feat that seems to have eluded practically every left-wing politician on the planet.\"Margaret DeReus, the executive director of the nonprofit IMEU Policy Project, said in a statement to Newsweek that not only did Mamdani \"run a progressive campaign to lift up working-class New Yorkers of every race and in every borough, he stood up for Palestinian rights despite relentless attacks.\"He understands that voters want to see their tax dollars go toward making housing, transportation, healthcare, and education affordable — not sending weapons for Israel to kill Palestinians.

JB Pritzker will seek a third term in office next year amid growing questions about the Democrat’s ambitions for higher office.\n\nThe Democrat will announce his intentions Thursday at an event in Chicago, according to two people familiar with his plans who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the events.\n\nThe 60-year-old wealthy businessman was a top contender as Kamala Harris’ running mate during her 2024 presidential run. Pritzker, who has spent years building his national political profile, remains a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.\n\nHe has often been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate for his party, fanned by travel to New Hampshire, fundraising and campaigning for Democrats across the country. It’s not clear if he may still consider a bid in 2028 or later.\n\n“To be in public office right now is to constantly ask yourself, ‘How do I make sure I’m standing on the right side of history?’” he said at a June commencement address at Knox College in Illinois. “There is a simple answer: The wrong side of history will always tell you to be afraid. The right side of history will always expect you to be brave.”\n\nIllinois does not have term limits. Pritzker is the first governor to seek a third term since Republican Jim Thompson in 1982.\n\nPritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, is a former private equity investor and a philanthropist. He became governor in 2019, his first time serving in public office after losing a 1998 Democratic primary for a suburban congressional seat.\n\nHe bested a crowded primary field for governor and went on to defeat one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, a venture capitalist.\n\nThe 2018 matchup was one of the nation’s most expensive statewide political races, with more than $250 million raised between the largely self-funded candidates. Questions about the wealth and relatability of both candidates — who each have buildings in Chicago named after their families — came up often.\n\nFor instance, Pritzker faced questions about his Chicago mansion’s property taxes. He received a tax break after having the toilets removed from a second mansion he owns next to his family residence and declaring it “uninhabitable.” Pritzker later repaid the county about $330,000.\n\nWorking with Democratic supermajorities in the House and Senate, Pritzker has boasted balanced budgets and paid down billions of dollars in debt, prompting several upgrades. He also has overseen increased education funding, the centralization of early childhood services, and new laws to make health insurance more comprehensive, accessible and affordable.\n\nAfter receiving generally high marks in his first term for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pritzker defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican with 55% of the vote to become the first Illinois governor to be elected to a second term in 16 years. He promptly delivered a victory speech that seemed bound for a national campaign, denouncing Trump and asking: “Are you ready to fight?”\n\nHe has continued to be among Trump’s most vocal, no-holds-barred critics.\n\n“Donald Trump is a convicted felon, liable for sexual assault, and a congenital liar,” Pritzker said after Trump’s speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. “He is a man who remains wholly unfit for the office of the presidency, both in temperament and character.”\n\nIn February, Pritzker, who is Jewish, compared the Trump administration to Nazi Germany\n\n“I do not invoke the specter of Nazis lightly. But I know the history intimately — and have spent more time than probably anyone in this room with people who survived the Holocaust,” he said in February. “Here’s what I’ve learned: The root that tears apart your house’s foundation begins as a seed, a seed of distrust and hate and blame.”\n\nPritzker, whose net worth is estimated as $3.7 billion by Forbes, has also bankrolled his political organization, “Think Big America.” It aims to protect abortion rights and has supported state constitutional amendments to strengthen those protections in Ohio, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nPritzker says the fight for abortion rights is personal and credits his mother Sue with sparking his early interest in the cause when they attended abortion-rights rallies together. His mother died in a car accident when he was a teen. His father, Donald Pritzker, died years earlier of a heart attack when JB Pritzker was a young boy.\n\nPritzker is married with two children. He has several prominent family members. His sister Penny Pritzker, is a former U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery and was a U.S. commerce secretary in the Obama administration.\n\nO'Connor reported from Springfield, Ill.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-seek-134018624.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zXdd8CsyVLwJnihGOhsHVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/22c88da4a5cd7900fd5588ae69a3de4a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 13:40:18","author":"Sophia Tareen And John O'connor","authors":["Sophia Tareen And John O'connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":335121476,"title":"BET Sets Layoffs as Part of Paramount’s 3.5% Reduction to US Staff","text":"BET will be laying off staffers as part of Paramount’s 3.5% reduction to its U.S. workforce, BET Media Group CEO Scott Mills shared in an internal memo on Wednesday.\n\nThe job cuts will impact staffers “in areas including linear research, finance, and business and legal affairs,” according to the memo, as seen by TheWrap. \n\nStarting Wednesday, the network will be implementing “a streamlined organization structure” utilizing its existing teams within the content strategy and production, programming, marketing and insights, social impact, advertising sales, streaming and digital departments.\n\nEarlier this month, Paramount co-CEOs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins told staff they would be “prioritizing investments in our growing streaming business” by reducing their U.S. workforce by 3.5%, which would impact hundreds of employees.

Along with her impressive tennis career, the American is also known for her bold political opinions on social media.The war scene began with Iran and Israel attacking each other with air strikes, and this intense clash was joined by the US government, which attacked Iran on Sunday, June 22, 2025. The US military air-struck three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, making it the first time that Americans had attacked Iran directly.Trump revealed that he proposed the Iranian government sign a deal that stated they could not have a nuclear weapon; however, since Iran did not agree with the deal, Trump's government initiated the attack. Amid these ongoing unfortunate incidents, the former tennis player Navratilova voiced her opinion on X, slamming Trump and his government by heaping praise on the former government officials.\"Somebody needs to make t-shirts that say \"Harris and Clinton were right about everything,\" wrote Martina Navratilova.This isn't the first time the American has reacted to this matter.

They wrote:\"US government buildings now appear to be putting up giant banners of Donald Trump’s face, echoing authoritarian dictatorships.\"This tweet garnered attention from the renowned podcaster Fred Wellman, who weighed in on this matter by calling the entire thing fascist, and his post caught the attention of Martina Navratilova, who expressed her feelings about this by calling it a dictatorship.\"Fascist, communist- take your pick.

But in securing this win, 33-year-old newcomer Mamdani hasn’t just shut out a titan of New York politics – he’s given the Democratic Party its first real jolt of energy since it lost the White House last year.\n\nMamdani’s victory wasn’t an “ABC” (Anyone But Cuomo) victory. For those outside the US – or even outside New York – Mamdani is a new name. He’s the son of Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, and grew up partly in East Africa before settling in the city. Elected to the state Assembly in 2020 – New York’s lower elected house, closest to the UK’s devolved governments, Mamdani is part of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and represents a gentrifying slice of western Queens.\n\nHe speaks the language of renters, immigrants and low-income workers – not in abstract policy terms, but with urgency and clarity. And that’s what made this campaign take off. His platform focused on freezing rent, expanding tenants’ rights, offering free buses, mostly paid for by a hefty new tax on the wealthy – solutions often dismissed by the establishment as too radical.\n\nMamdani ran a serious and organised campaign that beat its opposition with door-knocking, community trust and conviction. It’s a sign that the progressive movement is finally maturing: no longer just shouting from the sidelines, it’s now winning tough fights with party machinery.\n\nThe race also confirms my theory about something deeper in the current political mood. American voters, across ideological lines, are desperate for someone to “flip the f***in’ table”.\n\nI came up with that phrase while working on Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign last year, and I keep returning to it. People didn’t vote for Donald Trump because they admired his criminality, racism or misogyny – they voted for him, despite all that, because he was the only candidate who promised to break the system.\n\nWorking people don’t care who flips the table – Trump or Mamdani – as long as someone does.\n\nI’m incredibly proud to have worked on the Harris campaign, but we struggled to articulate a path to improving the lives of voters who feel locked out, left behind and lied to. The system isn’t working, and they didn’t see change in our campaign. Whether it’s the populist right or the democratic left, these people will rally behind whoever makes them feel heard. In 2024, that was Trump. Now, it’s Mamdani.\n\nOf course, Mamdani is not without controversy. He drew national attention for his past support for the Palestinian cause, including a 2021 protest chant to “globalise the intifada”. In a city with more Jewish residents than Tel Aviv, this would typically be politically suicidal. But Mamdani has made a sharp distinction between opposing Israeli government policy and antisemitism – a feat that seems to have eluded practically every left-wing politician on the planet (see Jeremy Corbyn). He’s spoken forcefully and repeatedly that Palestinian liberation must also mean protection for Jewish New Yorkers. \n\nAs Brad Lander – the Jewish comptroller of New York City, who ran a collaborative campaign with Mamdani to make the most of ranked-choice voting – told Stephen Colbert: “No mayor is going to be responsible for what happens in the Middle East, but there is something quite remarkable about a Jewish New Yorker and a Muslim New Yorker coming together to say: ‘Here’s how we protect all New Yorkers. Jewish New Yorkers and Muslim New Yorkers are not going to be divided from each other.’”\n\nSo what did Democrats just do? Whether they realise it or not, they might have finally chosen a direction. Mamdani’s victory won’t sit easily with the party’s corporate donors or centrist strategists – but then we tried their way in 2016 and 2024. Instead, it offers something they’ve lacked for months: a vision.\n\nMamdani’s win is proof that progressive ideas can win elections, that authenticity beats mediocrity, and that voters want more than messaging – they want someone who lives their struggles and means it when they say they’ll change it. Mamdani has finally done what I’ve advised, hoped and craved someone would: Flipped the f***ing table.\n\nNew Yorkers rightly crave a representative who understands what it is like to live in cramped, overpriced apartments and make long commutes on a struggling subway. A Ugandan-born socialist millennial Muslim may just have given the Democrats the shot in their arm that the national party needs.\n\nPablo O’Hana is a New York-based senior political advisor and campaign strategist, who worked on the Kamala Harris election campaign","summary":"In defeating a New York political titan to be the Democratic nominee for New York mayor,  Mamdani show that voters wants someone – anyone – who will ‘flip the table,’ says campaign strategist Pablo O’Hana","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/zohran-mamdani-democrats-new-york-mayoral-race-b2776601.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/25/7/29/SEI256761702.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mQEoBMpm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-25 11:15:39","author":"Pablo O'hana","authors":["Pablo O'hana"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":335069442,"title":"Joe Rogan, Bernie Sanders spar over big money in politics after Sanders complains about Musk's spending","text":"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tried to slam Elon Musk over the $270 million he spent to help get President Donald Trump elected during an appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Tuesday, but Rogan quickly shot back with the large sums donated to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ doomed campaign. Sanders sparred with Rogan over political donations during a discussion of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. The ruling found that political donations were a form of speech, and therefore could not be limited under the First Amendment. Sanders slammed Citizens United as \"maybe the worst decision that the Supreme Court has ever made.\" \"What is says is you’re a billionaire, you now have the constitutional right because your money is your freedom of expression,\" Sanders said. \"The result of that decision, let’s take us to where we are today, Elon Musk… he spent $270 million to elect Donald Trump. I think that’s absurd.\" BERNIE SANDERS ENDORSES FORMER PUNK ROCK MUSICIAN WITH HISTORY OF RACIST, SEXIST REMARKS Rogan then asked what the largest donation to the Harris campaign was. Sanders didn’t give a sum but said the campaign spent \"a lot of money.\" \"They spent $1.5 billion just in the course of a couple months,\" Rogan said. The Harris campaign raised $1.5 billion during her 15-week-long campaign, and exited the race $20 million in debt. The Tesla CEO formally endorsed Trump after he survived his assassination attempt at his Butler Pennsylvania rally. Musk then jumped into the race head first, pouring $240 million into a pro-Trump Super PAC called America Pac. He also handed out $1 million checks at rallies he hosted to audience members who signed a petition endorsed by his PAC, as well as spending millions on other pro-Trump efforts. Sanders claimed that as a reward, Musk became the \"most powerful person in government\" when Trump took office.

When she took to the stage at the Lido music festival in Victoria Park, east London, on June 14, it was straight from a gruelling tour that has seen her criss-cross the globe for the past eight months.\n\nSo it’s a fair guess that the 32-year-old singer, real name Charlotte Aitchison, would have been looking forward to sleeping in her own bed once the 90-minute show was over. And, as luck would have it, she didn’t have far to go.\n\nSuccess has bought Charli XCX – whose hit album Brat last year earned the approval of US presidential nominee Kamala Harris and spawned a hedonistic cultural trend dubbed ‘Brat summer’ – a £3.8millon home in Los Angeles.\n\nBut the Cambridge-born star also has a more modest residence in the shape of a simple, terraced flat bought for an undisclosed amount in – where else? – Hackney.\n\nThis once down-market industrial hub may seem an odd choice for A-listers more accustomed to the glitz and glamour of Beverly Hills. But, in recent years, British-based celebrities have turned away from the cobbled streets of west London and descended in their droves on Hackney – much to the discomfort of long-standing locals, as the Mail discovered this week.\n\nIndeed, it is not just Charli XCX singing the borough’s praises – as the famous faces in the Lido Festival crowd would attest.\n\nAlso there was Hollywood actor Paul Mescal, who has spoken about his time living in the borough after his breakout role in the TV drama Normal People in 2020, and whom starry-eyed fans regularly claimed to see jogging topless around Victoria Park or along the nearby canal.\n\nWith him was actor Harris Dickinson, who recently starred as Nicole Kidman’s toyboy in erotic thriller Babygirl and is one of Mescal’s co-stars in the forthcoming four-part biopic about The Beatles.\n\nPerhaps even more notably, there was the actor James Norton and singer Lily Allen apparently enjoying a rather affectionate first date after meeting through celebrity dating app Raya.\n\nThen there was former One Direction heart-throb Harry Styles, a long-standing Hackney devotee who celebrated his 19th birthday in the borough back in 2013.\n\nAway from the park, Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker has a home in Hackney while BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James and ‘it-girl’ Alexa Chung are also locals. Even the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appear to be fans, picking Hackney bakery Violet to make their wedding cake in 2018.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that this circle of well-connected movers and shakers has triggered comparisons with another celebrity enclave: the so-called ‘Primrose Hill set’ whose hedonistic goings-on in the late 1990s and early 2000s were rarely out of the headlines.\n\nAlthough the supporting cast changed from time to time, the core group – most of whom lived and socialised in the eponymous north London neighbourhood – included supermodel Kate Moss, Hollywood stars Jude Law, Sienna Miller and Rhys Ifans, and Oasis frontmen Noel and Liam Gallagher.\n\nWhile they eventually drifted apart after Law’s bitter divorce from fashion designer Sadie Frost in 2003, one subsequent report remarked upon the group’s reputation for ‘having a whale of a time with drink, drugs and bed-hopping’.\n\nSuch louche carry-ons seem unlikely in 2025 and the era of celebrity wellness brands. But, even so, the sight of Hackney’s star-studded streets begs the question: Is E9 the new postcode of power?\n\nSociety bible Tatler certainly thinks so – last year it praised Hackney as the ‘borough du jour’.\n\nIn gushing tones, the magazine declared the area ‘a new social heartland... brimming with it-girls and Gen Z glamazons’. Apparently, it is also ‘a leafy place where boujie [fancy and expensive] cafes reign supreme and “natty” [natural] wine is as ubiquitous as tins of Perello olives’.\n\nAmong the hostelries it highlighted was Hackney bar The Shacklewell Arms, a venue frequented by Mescal, his Normal People co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and Irish actress Saoirse Ronan.\n\nAnother drinking den to get an enthusiastic thumbs-up was cocktail bar Night Tales, where techno music is on the sound system and regulars include ‘royal raver Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium’.\n\nHackney is a food-lover’s paradise, too, it boasts no fewer than seven Michelin-starred restaurants – including Plates, the first vegan establishment in the UK ever to be awarded a star.\n\nThe famous Broadway Market – which operates more than 50 stalls offering street food every weekend – was named by industry chiefs as Britain’s best food market last year.\n\nThe regular shops lining the street, which are open all week, include a number of specialist bookstores with arcane titles such as Baldness & Modernism, and Cigarettes: 1930-2010.\n\nAnother thoroughfare likely to meet with celebrity approval is Wilton Way, dotted with bistros, galleries, boutiques and even a ‘floral atelier’ (a flower shop to you and me).\n\nAnd the Towpath Cafe, along the Regent’s Canal, has a clientele that includes actress Tracey Ullman, designer Simone Rocha and award-winning chef Fergus Henderson. Its most famous customer, Keira Knightley, says the cafe is ‘one of the reasons I live in London’, adding: ‘It’s a jewel-like, dream of a place.’\n\nThen there’s the green spaces: the borough’s 58 parks – which amount to 282 hectares – make up the largest amount of recreational green space in inner London. According to the council website, Hackney Marshes includes Europe’s ‘greatest concentration of football pitches’ while the nearby 86-hectare Victoria Park – which hosts the Lido Festival and All Points East festival every August – attracts nine million visitors a year.\n\nYet, while fans may be delighted at Hackney’s newfound Hollywood appeal, many locals are rather less excited by it.\n\nAdjoining Wilton Way is the austere Wilton Estate, developed as social housing in the 1950s. One resident I speak to tells me he often sees celebrities such as Paul Mescal socialising in the Spurstowe Arms pub round the corner. But, when I ask what he thinks of his glitzy neighbours, his response is less than enthusiastic.\n\n‘I wouldn’t have any particular problem with famous people moving into the area but those sort of people will be looking at the houses going for £2million or more,’ he tells me.\n\n‘That shouldn’t be an issue because those sorts of prices are out of reach of anyone from around here anyway. But – and it’s a big “but” – the problem is that these things trickle down. Even for locals like me, places you can’t swing a cat in end up costing crazy money.’\n\nAnd the threat of soaring house prices isn’t the only issue.\n\nHackney had the highest burglary rate in London last year and is among the capital’s top five most crime-ridden boroughs. The CrimeRate website also states: ‘As of 2025, the crime rate in Hackney is 28 per cent higher than London [overall figure] and 55 per cent higher than the England, Wales and Northern Ireland overall figure.’\n\nMore detailed statistics reveal an even more alarming picture. Based on 4,475 crime reports logged by the Met in the 12 months to the end of last September, the rate of ‘theft from the person’ offences in Hackney was 38 times the national average.\n\nThe rate of vehicle crime was three times higher than the national figure. Separate research shows that rates of gang and knife violence in the borough are among the worst in London.\n\nAs one resident, who only gave her name as Sarah, tells me: ‘There are enough youngsters hanging around here doing nothing already.\n\n‘The last thing we want around here are famous punters strutting around like they own the place and their hordes of silly fans making a nuisance of themselves.’\n\nAs I continue on to Hackney’s main thoroughfare, Mare Street, the chichi restaurants and boutiques beloved by the stars might as well be on a different planet.\n\nInstead, the grim streetscape consists of little more than burger joints, downmarket retailers and bookies. Only the beautifully ornate Hackney Empire, a redbrick Grade II-listed building that opened as a music hall in 1901, offers some brief respite from the parade of eyesores.\n\nNor does it improve much along the pedestrianised section at the street’s northern end. Even the presence of a Gail’s coffee shop – which has become something of a symbol for gentrification – and the impressive St Augustine’s Tower, which dates back to the 16th century and is represented in the borough’s coat of arms, fail to cheer things up.\n\nFor the remainder of the stretch, it is largely more of the same: fast food outlets, phone repair premises and soulless-looking shops. The main difference here is the greater number of vacant, shuttered-up storefronts covered in graffiti.\n\nRight at the very top, where Mare Street meets Lower Clapton Road, is The Crown pub. It is an unthreatening but faintly depressing sort of a place, where a friendly bartender serves a clientele of largely silent middle-aged men drinking on their own.\n\nRacing from Royal Ascot is on the telly and betting dockets are on the tables. A ‘polite notice’ instructs customers: ‘No sitting in the window seats during darts matches.’\n\nThere are a couple of light-hearted posters on the walls – one references Jägerbombs ‘helping women lower their standards for years’ – but there is precious little laughter to be heard.\n\nFrankly, it doesn’t feel like the sort of place that Hackney’s incoming celebrity population might start gravitating towards.\n\nBack outside, scores of people are soaking up the afternoon sunshine in the pretty surroundings of St John’s Church Gardens. Among them is Elaine Shields, a 40-something mother who says only that she has lived in Hackney for ‘years’.\n\nHer verdict, at least, is a little more optimistic. ‘This place has its faults, it isn’t perfect by any stretch of the imagination. But there is a nice community spirit around here,’ she tells.\n\nBut, with a raised eyebrow, even Elaine admits: ‘I don’t think having a bunch of celebrities here is going to improve that.’","summary":"This once down-market industrial hub may seem an odd choice for A-listers more accustomed to the glitz and glamour of Beverly Hills.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14843027/once-market-area-London-invaded-list-stars-girls-rivals-Primrose-Hill-locals-furious-RONAN-OREILLY.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/25/10/99702685-0-image-m-14_1750843149166.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 11:10:12","author":"Editor,Ronan O'reilly","authors":["Editor","Ronan O'reilly"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.715},{"id":335024366,"title":"New York Mayor's Race Shows Us a Better Way To Run Elections | Opinion","text":"We all know American politics needs a redesign. Too many politicians are unaccountable to the voters and act like they know it. We want more choices and consensus, but have been ground down by toxic campaigns.The good news is that change is not only possible but already happening, if you know where to look. Anyone looking for a good example of progress that matters should check out the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City. We'll get a nominee who represents a majority of us, and we're getting a campaign where candidates are working together instead of just tearing each other down.This year marks the second time New York City voters will select mayoral nominees with ranked-choice voting (RCV), and that has made a huge difference. You don't have to be a math person to see how RCV has created different incentives and made the campaign better. Take it from someone who has run in races with and without ranked-choice voting: It's working for New York and would do the same in cities and states across the nation.Our primary is the kind of race that would be a mess without RCV: 11 candidates, representing a range of ideologies, backgrounds, and neighborhoods. In most places, such crowded primaries could be won with as little as a quarter of the vote as candidates go on a negative blitzkrieg against anyone they see as a threat. That drives up the candidates' negatives and everyone else's frustration.Such negativity won't work here. In a ranked-choice election, voters have the power to name their second and third choices. If no one has 50 percent of voters' first choices, the lowest candidates are dropped. If your first choice is eliminated, your vote counts for your second choice. This process continues until someone wins a majority. Essentially, we turned the primary into an instant runoff that everyone can participate in, and that produces a winner with the widest and deepest support.This explains why the New York mayoral race is seeing campaigns that otherwise might look—well, a little weird.Queens assemblyman Zohran Mamdani—running second behind former governor Andrew Cuomo in most polls—urged his supporters to donate to one of his opponents, council speaker Adrienne Adams. Mamdani and Brad Lander, running third, cross-endorsed each other two weeks ago and encouraged their followers to rank them one-two, in whatever order. Mamdani, Adams, Lander, and Zellnor Myrie have locked arms and done multiple campaign events together.All because voters can express support for multiple candidates. In a ranked-choice system, you can't write off voters who support another candidate—instead, it pays to talk to them, explain where you have common ground with their first-choice candidate, and ask to be their second choice.Newspapers, unions, community groups, and even star politicians are getting in on the fun, too—endorsing several candidates, in order of preference.Without RCV, we'd be seeing a completely different final few weeks of this campaign. Instead of debating issues, candidates would be demanding that those behind them in the polls drop out or risk playing spoiler.I've seen the difference firsthand. When I sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, I stood on the debate stage and watched allies take sledgehammers to each other. First they ran to the Left, then they ran over each other. Kamala Harris pounded Joe Biden over his stances on busing from the 1970s—a long-ago dispute that even became fodder for J.D. Vance in 2024. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, chasing the same progressive voters, made tiny distinctions into huge tempests.Then, when I ran for mayor of New York in 2021—the first time the city used RCV—everything felt different. I lost, but the race was better. Don't get me wrong: All of us wanted to win. But when the election wasn't a zero-sum game, most of us took quite different paths that were much more voter-friendly. For example, I urged my supporters to rank Kathryn Garcia as their second choice. Kathryn and I spent the last weekend before the election campaigning together. No one had to drop out, and voters got to decide.Some people accused us of trying to game the system—and have said the same about candidates and organizations that are \"cross-endorsing\" this year. That's silly. We were trying to engage more voters, right out in the open. That's not a game; it's what campaigns are supposed to be about. Ranked choice encourages candidates to go out and talk to more voters.Of course, not everything in a ranked-choice campaign is sunshine and roses. There are still sharp elbows. As this campaign ends, the two leading candidates will draw sharp distinctions.The race is also seeing some trends that we see in almost every Democratic primary—activists from the Left and the center both trying to pull the party their way, and more charismatic politicians rising to the top. That's all natural. Ranked choice is here to give voters more choice, not to overturn the laws of physics and turn politics into a lovefest.It would also be better if this was happening not in a party primary, but in an election open to all voters—and if Democrats made it easier for everyone to take part. There is no reason—beyond making it harder to participate—to have a February registration deadline for a June primary.We shouldn't judge RCV against perfection, but against the old rules—where agreements between campaigns would be struck in back rooms. Candidates would be told to drop out, or maybe not to run in the first place. Then endorsements would be traded for a job, or a promise of support down the line. Voters would be kept in the dark. Those who wanted more choices would be out of luck.Americans want more choices and new voices. They want winners chosen by majorities, who are accountable to all of us. The road to better elections and more accountable politicians will be long. Ranked-choice voting is an important first step. What's happening right now in New York City is the proof.Andrew Yang is a businessman, lawyer, philanthropist, and former candidate for president of the United States. In July 2022, Yang, alongside Democrats, Republicans and Independents, launched the new Forward Party to give Americans more choice in our democracy.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"This year marks the second time New York City voters will select mayoral nominees with ranked-choice voting.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/new-york-mayors-race-shows-us-better-way-run-elections-opinion-2090116","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2670617/voting-booths-new-york-city.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 10:00:02","author":"Andrew Yang","authors":["Andrew Yang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.015},{"id":335165402,"title":"Letter: We're all paying the price for some putting party before country","text":"To the editor: Smart-aleck Republicans believed Donald Trump would make America great again.\n\nWell, let's run through it.

While decidedly more moderate than Mr. Mamdani, both congressmen campaigned last fall on bringing down costs for people in their swing districts and taking on huge corporations and billionaires, a strategy Mr. Ryan described as “patriotic populism.” Even though it won them both races, Washington Democrats have been hesitant to embrace that strategy.\n\nI saw similar complacency last year while advising Ruben Gallego’s successful Senate campaign in Arizona.

Jean Carroll Beat Trump in Court—Plus, What Really Happened In the 2024 Election","text":"Jon Wiener: From The Nation magazine, this is Start Making Sense. I’m Jon Wiener. Later in the show: The leading autopsies on the 2024 defeat of Democrats are missing two big things, Steve Phillips argues: the centrality of racial hostility, and of gender resentment, as central organizing forces in American politics. But first: Donald Trump owes E. Jean Carroll 88 million dollars. She’ll explain why – in a minute.[BREAK]One person has sued Trump twice and won both times. Of course, that is E. Jean Carroll. He sexually assaulted her in 1996 in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. The case went to trial in 2023, and she won. And now she’s published a book about it. The book’s title comes from what Trump said about her, Not My Type. It’s subtitled One Woman versus a President. E. Jean Carroll is a journalist who’s written for the Atlantic, Rolling Stone, New York, Esquire, Outside, and Vanity Fair. She was also the first female contributing editor to Playboy. And she’s the author of five previous books. We reached her today at her cabin in the mountains in upstate New York. E. Jean Carroll, welcome to the program.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Well, thank you very much, Jon. The Nation is important to American journalism for many reasons, but chiefly because The Nation supported Hunter Thompson during his early years as a journalist.\n\nJW: I should add that one of your five previous books is about Hunter Thompson.\n\nJW: When Donald Trump crossed paths with you, at the front door of Bergdorf Goodman in 1996, he knew who you were. What did he say to you?\n\nEJC: He said, ‘Hey, you’re the advice lady.’\n\nJW: And what was he talking about?\n\nEJC: For 27 years, I was the advice columnist at Elle Magazine.\n\nJW: And I understand this was the longest currently running advice column in American publishing at that point.\n\nJW: I want to talk about some of the key figures in your book, the lawyers. Tell us about Trump’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina.\n\nEJC: A man who was built like Popeye, had a voice like a shotgun going off in a gravel pit. Fabulous dresser, wore $6,000 suits, had a $3 million watch. Trump hired him because he got Michael Jackson acquitted. \n\nJW: What was Michael Jackson’s crime that Joe Tacopina took on?\n\nEJC: Child abuse.\n\nJW: To quote your book, “when Michael Jackson is accused of molesting little boys, who does he call? Tacopina. When that Sopranos actor is accused of killing a cop, who’s he going to call? Tacopina. When that police officer is accused of raping a drunk woman, who’s he going to call? Tacopina. And when Donald Trump is on trial for sexually assaulting and defaming a person who’s Trump going to call? Tacopina.”\n\nEJC: Tacopina is one of the most famous and certainly one of the most intelligent defense attorneys. Unfortunately, Jon, he followed Trump’s instructions. That’s what defense attorneys do. They defend their client, and that’s what Tacopina did. So it was fascinating to watch him with this huge ego flail away at me. He was trying to make the case that I lied, and that Trump is a saint, and that I’m only in it for the money. I’m a gold digger, a slut, whatever. So it was interesting.\n\nJW: Trump’s other main attorney was Alina Habba. You describe her as “the most distinguished and illustrious graduate of Widener University Commonwealth Law School, a superb institution which accepts only 65% of its applicants.” Why do you think Trump picked her?\n\nEJC: She handled the parking lots for her husband. But mainly Alina Habba is devastatingly beautiful, and don’t kid yourself, she’s very bright. She didn’t know diddly squat about the law, but she had the ability, Jon, while her client was in the courtroom and berating her and telling her what to do, she had the ability to go on and try to tear me to shreds. So you’ve got to salute Alina Habba.\n\nJW: And tell us about your attorney, Roberta Kaplan. Isn’t she famous?\n\nEJC: Well, she’s merely probably the greatest legal mind of her generation. She opened the gates for gay rights in the country. She trounced the Nazis and the white supremacists in Charlottesville. And when she takes the front of the courtroom, it’s like Alexander the Great Landing in Persia. Just watch out.\n\nJW: Robbie Kaplan deposed Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reminded him – he was sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office when he said about you to a reporter for the publication, The Hill, “She’s not my type.” Robbie showed him a picture where you are standing next to him at some social event. He’s with Ivana, you’re with your husband at the time. And Robbie Kaplan pointed at you and asked him who that was. And what did he say?\n\nEJC: Well, he didn’t recognize Ivana. He pointed to Ivana. He said, “I don’t know who that is.” And then he pointed to me and said, “that’s Marla. That’s Marla. That’s my wife.”\n\nJW: ” That’s my wife.” Now actually, you do look a lot like Marla Maples. Isn’t that true?\n\nEJC: Yes. Back in the day.\n\nJW: How did the jury learn about this mistake that Trump made in identifying a picture of you?\n\nEJC: Well, it was one of the high points of the trial. We had big screens in the courtroom at both trials, and let’s just take our hats off right now to Robbie Kaplan, because she got it introduced into court, right? There was, we ran nearly an hour of his deposition. So the jury, Jon, was thrilled with Donald Trump. It was, as we say, wonderful.\n\nJW: Before the trial began, your attorney staged a test trial with real New Yorkers as jurors. Presented all the evidence; one trial, three different sets of jurors. How did that go?\n\nEJC: Not so well.\n\nJW: Tell us.\n\nEJC: Well, the jury agreed on three facts. Number one, two people could end up in a Bergdorf dressing room in 1996, easily. Two, something sexual easily could have happened in a Bergdorf dressing room in 1996. And the two people in the dressing room in 1996 were Trump and me. They all agreed on that. And they thought that I wanted it. I asked for it. Because I was too old and too ugly for anybody to imagine anybody, let alone Donald Trump, attacking me.\n\nJW: So your attorneys said they had to change your appearance to something the jury would find Trump would want to attack. How did they want to change your appearance?\n\nEJC: Well, it’s impossible to. I’m 81. What are you going to do? I’m an old lady sitting there, desiccated, a carcass sitting there. What are you going to do? So what we did is I had a live talk show in 1996, the same year that the event happened, a television show. And so we cut my hair, exactly. That’s why he recognized me out in front of Bergdorf’s. He said, Hey, you’re that advice lady. I had a talk show at the time, cut my hair exactly like it was in ‘96. We did my makeup exactly as it was in ‘96. I wore the same clothes that I wore in ‘96, and it gave the jury a chance to imagine I could have been that woman.\n\nJW: The jury consultants then told you what would be the worst possible jury – the jury you had to avoid. What was that?\n\nJW: One word answer. And what jury did you end up with?\n\nEJC: Men. In the first trial, we had six men and three women. And the second trial we had seven men and two women. We had our work cut out for us, because male jurors like a strong man, and Trump is a strong man.\n\nJW: One of the big issues for Trump’s defense was that when he grabbed you in the dressing room at Bergdorf’s, you did not scream. And after that became a big issue, lots of women posted on Twitter using the hashtag “#IDidn’tScream.” Tell us about that.\n\nEJC: That was a very moving experience, particularly if you read any of those stories. One in particular I’ll never forget: she was on a big camp bus going home from a kid’s camp. The man who ran it was in the front. His wife and kids were in the back. And he raped her in the front seat in the bus while they were going home. And she didn’t scream.Not all women scream. Every woman has a different reaction. We went a long way in this trial of bringing out that little fact. Not every woman is a perfect victim. Not every woman goes to the police. Not every woman screams.Particularly Joe Tacopina, Alina Habba, both beat up on me because I like to go to parties. I’m not allowed to go to a party because I was sexually assaulted in 1996, so I should stay home in my hovel, never leave the house. They couldn’t understand how a so-called victim could leave the house and have a good time. I made it a point to lead as fabulous a life as I could after the event.\n\nJW: I also really liked the part in your lawyer’s summation when he emphasized the significance of Trump’s defense making a big deal out of the fact that you said you did not scream. Trump’s defense, of course, was that he never went into that dressing room at Bergdorf’s at all. None of it ever happened. He had no idea who you were. So your attorney told the jury in his summation, “if you find yourselves in the jury room talking about whether Ms. Carol consented, then she wins.” And why was that?\n\nEJC: If we’re there, if we’re in the dressing room, we win – because it means we were there, because their whole case was “it never happened.” But it did happen. And we proved it.\n\nJW: And one of my favorite parts of your case was the summation where one of your lawyers told the jury this was not a case of ‘he said, she said.’ And why was that? Because he never testified. He never swore to tell the truth and told the jury ‘I didn’t do it.’\n\nEJC: He didn’t say anything. He just stood outside on the golf course in Doonbeg, Ireland, and called me a gold digging whatever.\n\nJW: He didn’t show up at the first trial. He did not testify in his own defense. You say Trump learned a lesson from that — that not appearing to testify in his own defense made him look guilty. So he wanted to testify at the second trial. That was a trial that was just about defamation. It was about how much he owed you for all the lies he told about you. What was it like for you to have Trump in the courtroom, sitting at the defense table?\n\nEJC: I was sitting right in front of him If I turned around and reached, about two feet, I could grab him by the hair. I could hear everything he was doing and saying. I could hear the snorting, and the whining, and the hissing, and the spitting, and the groaning, and the pounding on the desk when Judge Kaplan made a ruling that he disagreed with. I could hear him saying about the judge, ‘Nasty Man!’ Here’s the thing: the jury could hear him, if I could hear him. They were utterly entranced the whole time.\n\nJW: How much time did he end up spending on the witness stand in that trial?\n\nEJC: It was very short because the first trial found him liable. The court case had been gone through; all the witnesses had been heard. It had been decided by a unanimous federal jury. He was liable for sexual abuse. He was not allowed to retry the case. He was not allowed to do that. And so it was very controlled. So his testimony had to be constrained. He could not bring a new case. He could not go over contested details. He could not bring in all the conspiracy theories that he brought in, by the way, 24 hours a day outside of court. So the questions to him had to be constrained and his answers had to be limited to the damages, not to whether he was guilty or not, because that had been decided. It had all been decided. This drove him nuts.\n\nJW: In her summary for the second trial, your attorney, Robbie Kaplan, told the jury Trump “didn’t even bother to show up for the first trial,” which was the one about sexual assault, but for the second trial, where the issue was how much money he has to pay, “here he is,” she told them, “And what does that mean? It means the one thing that Donald Trump cares about is not truth, not law. The one thing Donald Trump cares about is money.”And Trump was sitting right there in front of the jury. What was his response?\n\nEJC: His face turned vermillion and he stood up in the middle of her closing argument and walked out. Huffing and puffing. He couldn’t take it. Don’t go up against Robbie Kaplan.\n\nJW: Okay. Then your attorney told the jury, “Donald Trump sexually assaulted her. He defamed her. He keeps defaming her. Make him stop. Make him pay enough so that he will stop.” How much did the jury decide was the right amount to make him stop?\n\nEJC: 83.3 million, which is a lot more today because it is been accruing interest.\n\nJW: Trump has appealed that 83 million award to you. His argument is that defaming you was part of his official duties as president. That doesn’t sound like a very good argument to me.\n\nEJC: Well, I think you’re right. And tomorrow Robbie will argue our case in the United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit, against Trump, and she’s going to shred him. He’s going to ask that the Second Circuit overturn the jury verdict. It’s never going to happen. Don’t go up against Robbie in appeal court. Do not do it. He’s got, I mean, I’ve heard her, she’s given me her argument several times on the phone because they keep changing. And she is on fire. I’m telling you she is – that there’s flame coming off her head. She cannot wait to get into court. They couldn’t, Jon, they tried Friday to stop the arguments going forward tomorrow. They tried, because guess what? He has no attorneys.\n\nJW: He doesn’t have any attorneys. What happened to his attorneys? Where is Alina Habba right now? In the book you called her “Trump’s most beautiful attorney.” In the closing arguments for the second trial, you write, “she wore a very tight white sweater and an electric blue pantsuit hugging her round bottom.” And where is she now?\n\nEJC: Oh, poor Alina. She’s stuck in New Jersey as the acting Attorney General arresting congresswomen of the United States. She’s very busy.\n\nJW: So Alina Habba was appointed by Trump acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey. What about Joe Tacopina? Tacopina quit, is that right? He resigned from this case.\n\nEJC: He resigned. And I think it’s because you either have to go along with what Trump wants or you don’t. You either start crossing lines because the president tells you to cross a line, or you don’t, and Tacopina withdrew. And so hats off to Tacopina.\n\nJW: You’re going to have somewhere around $90, $95 million when this is over. What are you going to do with that money?\n\nEJC: Give it to everything Donald Trump hates. I don’t need it. I’m perfectly happy here in my hovel. I love it. Give it to binding up the wounds of our democracy, which he’s ripping apart. You know what? If it’s going to piss him off, I’m going to give money to it.\n\nJW: E. Jean Carroll – she proved Trump is a liar. She beat him twice. Time Magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Her new book is Not My Type: One Woman versus a President. E. Jean, thank you for suing Trump. Thank you for writing this book. And thanks for talking with us today.\n\nEJC: Well, you’re fabulous, Jon!\n\nJW: A brief update on the appeals court hearing on Tuesday: Trump’s lawyers told a 3-judge panel that the verdict finding him guilty should be overturned because of the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for their actions as president. This case, however, was civil, not criminal, so that argument doesn’t seem to be a very good one. E. Jean’s Carroll’s attorney Roberta Kaplan did not comment after the hearing, But Politico reported that quote “the panel appeared skeptical” about Trump’s arguments. One final note: of the three judges, one is an Obama appointee and two were appointed by Biden.Trump is expected to appeal their ruling to the Suprem’e Court.\n\nJon Wiener: The leading autopsies of the 2024 defeats of Democrats are missing a couple of big things – that’s what Steve Phillips has concluded. He wrote the bestseller, Brown is the New White, How the Demographic Revolution has created a New American Majority. He also hosts the podcast Democracy in Color, and he writes for The Guardian, The Washington Post and The Nation. His book How We Win the Civil War: Securing a Multiracial Democracy and Ending White Supremacy for Good is out now in an updated edition. Steve Phillips, welcome back.\n\nSteve Phillips: Thanks for having me.\n\nJW: There are a lot of opinions about why the Democrats lost in 2024, based mostly on exit polls and opinion surveys. But now we have much better data about how people actually voted. We’re talking about the long-awaited voting data report from Catalist, the progressive organization that compiles data on all 256 million voters in all 50 states. This is not statistical sampling. The Catalist report is regarded by many as kind of the gold standard, the best source of information on the success or failure of Democratic efforts to turn out the base, to win over swing voters, to persuade the persuadables and to mobilize the infrequent and low propensity voters. It answers questions about where we succeeded and where we failed. And this Catalist report confirmed what a lot of the exit polls and opinion surveys had suggested. Harris lost ground compared to Biden, especially among younger voters, men, Latino and Black voters, and infrequent voters. Now, there’s a lot of different ways you can look at this Catalist data. You have a different way.\n\nSP: I think there’s a danger with so much data that you can get so overwhelmed in it, and all of the minutiae in it – I talk about it in The Nation piece – is that being so obsessed with the trees, we miss the forest. And it remains – and even when you were talking to us about lost ground, even if you would concede that point, it remains the fact that Kamala Harris won every single racial group except whites. And so if you look at it that way, then Kamala Harris prevailed across all of these other parts of the spectrum. So what is it that’s going on with white voters? LBJ said famously that when he signed the Voting Rights Act, we may have lost the South for a generation, and that in fact, Democrats have never won the white vote since the Civil Rights Act and since the Voting Rights Act.\n\nJW: And that was 1965.\n\nSP: Correct. And so what I’ve tried to show in my work and my writing is that there still is what I call a meaningful minority of whites who support Democrats. But that this notion or that we’re going to get the majority of that population has no empirical support at all. So you do have to look at all these other dimensions to it, but the fundamental reality remains that people of color remain more drawn to Democrats and that whites remain fairly implacably siding with the Republicans and that has much larger implications in this country in future politics.\n\nJW: Yeah, the pundits have focused on the fact that support for Kamala Harris among young Black men dropped from 85%, which it had been under Biden to 75%. For Kamala, that is a drop. But I have to say 75% of young Black men voting for Harris is pretty good. If 75% of young white men voted for Harris, our troubles would be over.\n\nSP: Exactly. And so I think that there’s a way of, again, what lens are you looking at it? And we have to be careful not to scapegoat African American voters or Latino voters for something that misses the larger dynamic. And what I like to try to point out to people, again reframing, is that Black men are the most progressive Democratic voting demographic of any other demographic group in the entire country except for Black women,\n\nJW: Except for Black women.\n\nSP: And so if you look at it that way, then it’s a different thing, but it’s not like, ‘oh, all these Black men are so conservative.’ But both of these points, and then one of the things that the Catalyst report does get at, but in passing again, this forest for the trees issue, is the reality of gender and sexism and patriarchy. Our previous podcast episode we had on Anna Malaika Tubbs who wrote the book Patriarchy and really looking at the – also college educated white men moved more towards Trump. And so what’s the explanation of that? So if you see that sexism, misogyny, misogynoir, were all realities, then that explains some of the shifts that you may have seen. So that reality transcends racial groups, and so it affects whites, it affects blacks, it affects Latinos. So all of those groups may have moved a little bit towards Trump because of this sexism reality. But that’s very much buried in and overlooked in the analysis of what happened in 2024.\n\nJW: So you emphasize that all groups voted in the majority for Kamala Harris, with the exception of white people, but white people do constitute 72% of the voting population of the United States, and that’s our problem.\n\nSP: Well, they’ve compromised 72% of those who voted in 2024, which is another completely overlooked aspect. Whites were only 69% of the voters in 2020. And so this electorate was whiter. And so you hear very little about that. You hear like, ‘oh, well, Biden was too old and inflation was too high,’ and Kamala didn’t whatever, do enough 60 minutes interviews. But you don’t hear that the electorate was whiter, which meant that the voter turnout of the Republican operation was more effective at getting out their whiter voting population than progressives were, which squandered a billion dollars through the future forward Super Pac just doing TV ads trying to target that same white demographic rather than hiring staff and organizations to get the vote out in the communities of color, which would’ve made a major difference.\n\nJW: The one thing that Catalyst data does not do is it doesn’t explain anything about why this happened. It has to be interpreted. And of course, this is where the disagreements come in. I mean, Joe Biden’s interpretation is since Kamala Harris got 2% less of the white vote than he did, he should have been the candidate. I don’t think very many people agree with that. But the basic problem is the taboos against racism are very strong in America. So you are not going to get white people telling a pollster, ‘I do not want a Black woman to be president’ – even if that’s why they didn’t vote for her. So this is where your work comes in of kind of teasing out of the data. Where can we find evidence that explains what’s going on?\n\nSP: And even that Biden point is that even looking back at 2020, there’s a lot of misinterpretation there. People were like, ‘oh, Black voters love Biden’ – maybe as Obama’s vice president or whatever. So they were attributing Biden’s strong Black support in the primaries to this deep love of Biden where my analysis even back at that time was that black people were very clear-eyed about racism in this country and they were like, to get this white man Trump out of the White House, we need our own white guy. And so that really was what that, I think, was all about – then in terms of looking at the interpreting the data. It was just very interesting to me how minor the conclusion was or how under-emphasized regarding the reality of gender in particular, both within the Catalyst report. It was like one of their many findings buried among them.They didn’t lead with that at all. And then just in writ large, I mean it’s like how much longer of a data set do we need than having had elections from 1790 until 2024, and we have never elected a woman president. That’s a pretty substantial data set that suggests something about the perception of the electorate around what a leader should look like, even one as fundamentally flawed as Trump: 34 felony convictions, two impeachments, bragging about grabbing women by their private parts, still getting this increase in support. And so the fact that people just do not incorporate that into their analysis is really very poor science, frankly.\n\nJW: Another place you have looked to find relevant hard evidence about this is the competitive states, the swing states where Kamala Harris did not lose ground to Biden. Which were those, and what did we learn from them?\n\nSP: Right. So you had in that situation, so there’s this assumption that, oh, Kamala lost ground everywhere – but she actually got more votes than Biden did in Georgia, in North Carolina, in Nevada and Wisconsin. What do we take from that? And so that’s a different calculus than there’s this erosion of support. People drifted away from the Democrats. A lot of people in the Democratic Party, including many members of Congress, are proceeding from a standpoint of fear and weakness that is premised on this belief that we had all this erosion, all this gravitating away from the Democratic party, therefore we have to moderate our politics and go on bended knee in this Trump world. Whereas if you look at those numbers, what really happened is that Trump out-mobilized us, so that he got more people, more infrequent voters to come out than even we did. So Kamala and the Democrats boosted our support in those critical states of Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, and Wisconsin, but they did even more. And so it’s not that we need to retreat, it’s we need to advance. We need to be more investing in, inspiring, speaking to showing people that we are the champions of the issues that they care about, not that we’re also amenable to the right-wing agenda of Trump.\n\nJW: And another interesting comparison that you have emphasized is places where a woman of color and a man of color have both been tested at the ballot box in particular Georgia and Arizona. Tell us about that.\n\nSP: Right. And so you saw it in 2022 when Stacey Abrams ran for governor again of Georgia and the same ballot as Raphael Warnock. And that’s a situation where actually they had the same percentage of the Black vote Warnock and Abrams did, but that Warnock did better – and again, ‘better’ – this is all relative. 30% of whites, Stacey got 25% of whites. We should not be seeing 30% like some great harbinger. But to me, what is the obvious difference between Stacey and Warnock? It wasn’t their policies; it wasn’t their politics. Clearly something else was going on. And then similarly, in 2024 in Arizona, you have Kamala running and you have Ruben Gallego running for Senate and Gallego winning in Kamala losing. And so I talk about Occams’s Razor in The Nation piece – is that often the most obvious answer is the correct answer, the clearest immediate difference. You have both Democrats, both Democrats of color, both running one winning, one losing. Gender, you can’t just say it’s not a factor. And if you are honest and be able to get past what we would want, how uncomfortable it makes people, you would start to come to the conclusion that that is a meaningful determinative factor in electoral behavior in this country.\n\nJW: A lot of our friends remain puzzled though by young Black men. A higher proportion of young Black men voted for Joe Biden than voted for Kamala Harris. I wonder how surprised should we be that some young Black men are part of this same bro subculture that young white men and young Latino men are part of. We shouldn’t be surprised at all.\n\nSP: That, gender, is a very powerful reality. Sexism is an ever-present reality within our society. And to think that it doesn’t affect people of color is naive and inaccurate. So this notion around grappling with gender dynamics and relationships and the role of women and who’s an uppity woman and who’s one we actually like, et cetera, are things that span the rainbow. And so it affects people of color as well as it affects whites. So it really shouldn’t be surprising if we have an accurate understanding of history and behavioral science.\n\nJW: So the question of course, is what is to be done? We’ve talked about the centrality of racial hostility in American politics and of gender resentment in American politics. What are the best ways in your judgment to combat these powerful forces?\n\nSP: We have to take these on directly. So the policy and the approach of so many people in the Democratic side of the spectrum is to not talk about these issues, downplay them, distance ourselves from them, not fight for them. After George Floyd was killed, there was this racial reckoning. Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress, and yet were still unable to pass a bill saying that yes, we should study what should be done in terms of the legacy of slavery within this country. And so there is not an identity and a brand as being champions of the fight against racism and champions of the fight against sexism and champions for people of color and women. There’s far more fear about taking that stand resulting in white men defecting than there is excitement or belief that taking that stand will attract people of color and women to us. But as this election showed, the other approach doesn’t work. And so you take that along with the numbers that white men are 29% of the population within this country. And so a multiracial coalition that’s unapologetic and forceful about tackling racism and sexism is in fact a majority proposition. If you can get people to believe it and champion it, and work for it.\n\nJW: Steve Phillips – he wrote about ‘What analyses of the 2024 election are getting wrong’ at thenation.com.

But Cardi isn't here to split the bill; she's here to live out her Queen B era. \n\nCardi comically resumed her tour by showing fans a bathroom with a rudimentary toilet and bathtub, saying,\n\n\"This is where I'mma take that royal sexx And this where I'mma wash my royal hiney.\"\n\nCardi ended the tour by showing off a huge bed with blue curtains.\n\nThe couple ignited dating rumours after being sighted together in New York City and Miami in February 2025, according to TMZ.\n\nWatch videos below:\n\nNetizens react to Cardi B’s vacation clips\n\nLegit.ng compiled the reactions below:\n\nrae_nath said:\n\n \"She is breathing fresh air…and that’s all that matters to the sisterhood🤭.\"\n\n___debee said:\n\n \"He said “ you sit all over there at the end while I stare at you” 🫦😈 sisterhood is proud of you ❤️❤️📌.\"\n\nchinyereabia said:\n\n\"Offset did more 😂😂😂 give it time.\"\n\npretty_perfy said:\n\n \"That night will definitely be different 😍!!

The New York Times put this on the June 24 front page: “Under Trump, Ex-MTV Star Pitches Big Families.” But he used to be a bad boy on MTV, so the headline underneath was “From a Racy Past to a Key Cabinet Post.”\n\nAt 25, Duffy starred on MTV's reality show The Real World. The Times reporter on this story was Caroline Kitchener, who recently won a Pulitzer Prize at The Washington Post for her blatant abortion advocacy thinly disguised as journalism. The agony of women who are unable to delete their babies has been her cause.\n\nThat tilt surfaced as the article was being pieced together. Evita Duffy-Alonso, the oldest daughter of Duffy and his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy, tweeted: “One of the deranged questions she bombarded my parents with was if they considered aborting their first child — me.”\n\n Inside the paper, the headline was “Under Trump, Former MTV Star Pitches Big Families.” Kitchener’s overarching point in this article is how Sean Duffy has exploited his large family with nine children as a collection of props to help push his political career. This is a little funny, since most politicians pose with their children in campaign ads.\n\n“The truth is simple: we’re not a prop, a brand, or some act. We’re a real, loving, faithful, joyful family,” tweeted Evita. She called Kitchener “bitter and a creep.”\n\nThis was not how The New York Times covered the last Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who adopted twins in 2021 to the delight of liberal media outlets. No one wrote a front-page article about Buttigieg being a poseur. You could try to find a New York Times article on how Kamala Harris posed with her adult stepchildren in all of the publicity about how she’s called “Momala.” Were they just props? \n\nAs Stacey Matthews joked: “In the aftermath of the ‘MTV Reality Star in Trump’s Cabinet Who Wants You to Have More Kids’ article, we look forward to a future ‘Willie Brown's Ex Mulls California Gubernatorial Run’ write-up on former Vice President Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe difference was that Harris was childless, which they were always poised to defend against \"childless cat lady\" taunts. Buttigieg adopted twins at middle age. That’s not making the big leap of having nine children. Leftists are creeped out about “natalism,” anyone promoting more births instead of more abortions.\n\nKitchener outlined the threat this way: “As the Trump administration seeks to both exude macho masculinity and encourage men to settle down, some conservatives see Mr. Duffy as an important cultural figure who offers a middle way. A red-blooded American male who once scored with reality TV stars, he is now a devoted dad with his own chicken coop and beehives.” Are you scared yet? \n\nKitchener warned of Duffy’s “controversial memo” pledging to prioritize transportation funding for regions with higher birth rates and marriage rates, noting Democratic senators have called that “deeply frightening” and “disturbingly dystopian.”\n\nTo underline the natalist conspiracy, the Associated Press found the 14 states with the highest fertility rates backed Trump in the November election while the bottom 11 plus the District of Columbia supported Kamala.\n\nIt’s understandable that abortion-loving feminists feel threatened by any promotion of a pro-life culture of large Catholic families. “Be fruitful and multiply” sounds like God at His worst. It’s disturbing that this qualifies as their dystopia. In their utopia, abortion pills fly through the mail for liberated women to exercise their autonomy and choose death for their inconvenient babies. They are killers, hear them roar.","summary":"Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is apparently the leader of a menacing conspiracy.
