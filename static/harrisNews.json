I want us to be fighting for the most vulnerable, fighting for the unborn.\"That's what we should prioritize and that's obviously what Senator Hawley is doing as a man of faith. You have to vote for whoever is going to be the most pro-life. We have to be prayerful man to put God first and I think that's what is going to be best for our country.\"Butker was able to attend the political event during the Chiefs' bye week. Hawley is a United States senator from Missouri, but is seeking another term in Congress.Along with Trump, Hawley will also be on the Nov. 5 ballot. The incumbent is a constitutional conservative who fights for religious liberty.Butker's endorsement for Trump is because of the former president's pro-life record. The Chiefs kicker is an outspoken athlete that stands firm on his Catholic values.This isn't the first time Butker has made headlines for his political comments. The 29-year-old delivered the commencement speech at Benedictine College that sparked much controversy.Some of his most viral comments from the speech included his opinion on a woman's place in society.\"I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\" he said, and added: \"Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\"Since then, Butker has been labeled as a polarizing figure. However, the three-time Super Bowl Champion defended his controversial comments in August.\"I was really curious as to what people would be saying back to me and I respected all the viewpoints,\" Butker said. \"But in terms of what I said, I prayed about it and I thought about it and I was very intentional with what I said. I stand behind what I said. If people knew me as a person and understood that I was coming from a place of love, not a place of trying to attack of put people down, I only want the best for people. That's what I was trying to say there and I think the people that were in that gymnasium all understood what I was saying.\"Butker isn't the first athlete to endorse a presidential candidate. Kamala Harris and her campaign have created the initiative \"Athletes for Harris\", which has been supported by Magic Johnson and Emmitt Smith.For more NFL news, visit Newsweek Sports.","summary":"Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker officially endorsed Donald Trump Thursday at a Josh Hawley for Senate event.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/chiefs-star-endorses-donald-trump-president-1968003","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493928/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:18:55","author":"Valentina Martinez","authors":["Valentina Martinez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.283},{"id":259389380,"title":"Charli XCX Drops ‘Brat’ Remix Album With Ariana Grande, Troye Sivan, And More","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nCharli XCX and Troye Sivan\n\nWith just one word and a shocking shade of lime green, Charli XCX created a cultural phenomenon this summer that was seen everywhere from various clubs around the world to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. Since releasing Brat in June, Charli has embarked on two tours and released a handful of remixes to select tracks from the smash album. Now, the ever-evolving artist has reinvented the album entirely with her first-ever remix album, Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat.\n\nThe remix album’s release was preceded by the buzzed-about “Girl, So Confusing” remix with Lorde and a remix of bonus track “Guess” with Billie Eilish. Here, Charli has taken on the task of creating full-blown new versions of each track from Brat, complete with new verses, in the same vein as true remixes from the ’90s or Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” remix in 2020. Along the way she’s joined by acclaimed collaborators both new and old, from Ariana Grande on “Sympathy Is a Knife” to her Sweat Tour co-headliner Troye Sivan on “Talk Talk.” Other stars like Robyn, Caroline Polachek, Tinashe, Bon Iver, and Shygirl also share the mic to create a project that, as the title suggests, is an exciting new way to experience one of the year’s biggest albums.\n\nIn a new interview with Zane Lowe, the singer opened up about wrestling with being “caught in this dichotomy of, ‘Am I a left-field, underground artist or am I supposed to be a pop star?’” Her 2022 album Crash was admittedly her attempt at adopting the traditional pop star image, albeit in her own unique way, but Brat—and especially the Brat remix album—represents Charli in her authentic, unbridled artistic form, free of industry expectations or boxes.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhy You Missed The Northern Lights Last Night (And How To See Them Next Time)\n\nNorthern Lights Tonight?

Specifically, Charli counts Brat as a sister project to the hyperpop-packed 2017 mixtape Pop 2 and her 2020 lockdown album How I’m Feeling Now. With Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat, she shows that while Brat might have seemed left-of-center for pop upon its release, she was only just getting started in showing how much she can push the limits of what she—and all the featured artists on the remix album—can do.\n\nCharli and Sivan’s joint Sweat tour continues tonight in Denver and wraps up Oct. 23 in Seattle.","summary":"Charli XCX has completely reinvented her 'Brat' album with the remix album 'Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat.'","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2024/10/11/charli-xcx-drops-brat-remix-album-with-ariana-grande-troye-sivan-and-more/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6708b40032a3cfea3b9e7500/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:04:22","author":"Chris Malone Mendez,Contributor","authors":["Chris Malone Mendez","Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.322},{"id":259389274,"title":"Donald Trump's Colorado Crowd Size Compared to Kamala Harris' Arizona Rally","text":"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris held similarly-sized campaign rallies this week in Colorado and Arizona.Trump, this year's Republican nominee for president, appeared in front of a packed crowd at the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday. Harris, the Democratic nominee, greeted supporters at the Rawhide Event Center in Chandler, Arizona, on Thursday.Both venues list capacities of up to 10,000. The Trump campaign said that free tickets for the event in the Denver suburb were sold out, according to The Denver Post, although it was unclear how many tickets were available. Organizers of the Phoenix-area event said that around 7,000 Harris supporters attended, according to The Arizona Republic.Images shared to social media of each rally showed what appeared to be similar crowd sizes. Spectrum News DC reporter Taylor Popielarz remarked that the Trump crowd was \"one of the largest I've seen in recent months\" while sharing images and video of the event on Friday to X, formerly Twitter.\"Listen to this crowd in Aurora, CO!!!\" Trump campaign staffer Margo Martin wrote on X while sharing a video of the crowd greeting the former president. \"They want TRUMP back!\"Meanwhile, Bianca Buono, a reporter for Arizona NBC affiliate KPNX, shared videos of the Harris rally on Thursday that showed what looked like an equally enthusiastic welcome for the vice president.Harris supporters attended the event despite a sweltering 105-degree heat wave. Washington Post reporter Dylan Wells noted on X that there were \"lots of calls for medics\" due to attendees passing out, while one rallygoer was spotted \"throwing up near the press pen.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email on Friday evening.If the Trump event was fully at capacity, and the Harris rally attendance figures are accurate, around 3,000 more people may have attended the former president's rally.However, Trump and his campaign frequently boast about rally crowd sizes and the ex-president has previously artificially inflated attendance numbers, sometimes even beyond the capacity of venues.Well-attended Harris campaign rallies seemingly prompted the former president to make false claims about the Democratic ticket using artificial intelligence to fake large crowd sizes in August.Harris continued campaigning on Friday in Arizona, one of at least seven battleground states that could prove critical to either candidate in November. According to an average of recent polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight, Trump had a 1.4 percent lead over Harris in Arizona at the time of publication.Colorado is not considered a battleground, with a number of recent polls showing the vice president ahead of Trump in the state by double digits. Trump is set to appear at another rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday. President Joe Biden won California by nearly 30 percentage points in 2020.","summary":"Trump held a rally in solidly blue Colorado this week, while Harris focused her attention on swing state Arizona.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-colorado-crowd-size-compared-kamala-harris-arizona-rally-1967959","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493925/arizona-colorado-trump-harris-rally-crowd-comparison.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:01:12","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":259389778,"title":"Bầu cử Mỹ 2024: Cựu Tổng thống Obama vận động cho ứng cử viên Harris tại Pennsylvania","text":"Dự báo cách EU phản ứng với kết quả bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ\n\n Cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ năm 2024 đang tạo ra nhiều thay đổi quan trọng với tác động lớn đến toàn cầu, đặc biệt là châu Âu. \n\nBất kể kết quả bầu cử ra sao, lợi ích của châu Âu không hoàn toàn đồng điệu với Washington. \n\n Cờ Liên minh châu Âu tại trụ sở Ủy ban châu Âu ở Brussels, Bỉ. Ảnh: THX/TTXVN\n\nNhận định với tờ Politico châu Âu (Politico.eu) mới đây, ông Jrg Rocholl, Hiệu trưởng của Trường Quản lý và Công nghệ châu Âu tại Berlin (Đức), cho rằng cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ năm 2024, chỉ còn chưa đầy 2 tháng nữa, đang diễn ra với nhiều thay đổi quan trọng và kết quả sẽ có tác động toàn cầu, đặc biệt là đối với EU. Tuy nhiên, bất kể kết quả là gì, lợi ích của EU không hoàn toàn phù hợp với lợi ích của Washington và đã đến lúc EU cần nhận ra để phản ứng phù hợp trước những thay đổi chiến lược từ Mỹ.\n\nDù ai thắng cử, Mỹ đang tiếp tục chuyển trọng tâm chiến lược sang khu vực Ấn Độ Dương - Thái Bình Dương. Chính sách này đã bắt đầu từ thời cựu Tổng thống Obama và tiếp tục dưới thời Donald Trump và Joe Biden.\n\nNgoài vấn đề chiến lược, Mỹ cũng đang chuyển dịch sang các chính sách kinh tế mang tính bảo hộ, như Đạo luật Giảm lạm phát (IRA) và duy trì thuế quan đối với thép và nhôm từ thời chính quyền của ông Trump. Điều này đã gây ra căng thẳng kinh tế với châu Âu, đặc biệt khi chính quyền của ông Biden không mở rộng các khoản ưu đãi với xe điện cho các nhà sản xuất châu Âu. Nếu ứng cử viên tổng thống Kamala Harris đắc cử, chính sách kinh tế của bà nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục theo hướng này, dẫn đến cạnh tranh kinh tế ngày càng gay gắt giữa hai bờ Đại Tây Dương.\n\nThay vì hy vọng vào một kết quả bầu cử có lợi, EU cần xác định và hành động theo những mục tiêu chiến lược riêng để duy trì tự chủ và bảo vệ lợi ích dài hạn. Các biện pháp quan trọng mà châu Âu cần triển khai bao gồm:\n\n Thứ nhất, tăng chi tiêu quốc phòng và hợp tác nội khối: EU cần tăng cường chi tiêu cho an ninh và quốc phòng để củng cố năng lực tự vệ và đảm bảo rằng Mỹ sẽ tiếp tục hỗ trợ khi cần thiết. Việc tăng cường hợp tác giữa các quốc gia châu Âu có nền công nghiệp quốc phòng mạnh sẽ giúp EU xây dựng một hệ thống quốc phòng tự chủ hơn, đồng thời thúc đẩy tăng trưởng kinh tế và đổi mới trong khu vực dân sự.\n\n Thứ hai, phát triển thị trường vốn và củng cố đồng euro: EU cần xây dựng các thị trường vốn mạnh hơn và củng cố vị thế của đồng euro như một loại tiề.n tệ dự trữ toàn cầu. Việc này sẽ giúp cải thiện khả năng tài trợ cho các dự án đổi mới và tăng trưởng ở châu Âu, đồng thời tăng cường tính tự chủ và độc lập chiến lược của khu vực.\n\n Thứ ba, đàm phán các thỏa thuận thương mại toàn diện: EU cần tích cực thúc đẩy các thỏa thuận thương mại với các khu vực khác để giảm phụ thuộc vào Mỹ. Sự thất bại của Hiệp định Đối tác Thương mại và Đầu tư xuyên Đại Tây Dương (TTIP) là một bài học quý giá. EU cần tránh lặp lại sai lầm này với các khu vực như Mỹ Latinh và châu Phi, đặc biệt là với thỏa thuận Mercosur.\n\nDù vậy, Mỹ vẫn là đồng minh quan trọng nhất của châu Âu, đặc biệt trong lĩnh vực an ninh và thông qua NATO. Nhưng điều này không có nghĩa là lợi ích của hai bên hoàn toàn phù hợp. Do đó, EU cần thừa nhận rằng những thay đổi chiến lược của Mỹ không chỉ là tạm thời mà là một xu hướng dài hạn, đòi hỏi khối phải xây dựng một chiến lược độc lập và phù hợp hơn để bảo vệ lợi ích của mình.\n\nCó thể nói đã đến lúc EU ngừng đặt hy vọng vào kết quả cuộc bầu cử ở Mỹ và bắt đầu hành động quyết liệt để xây dựng sức mạnh chiến lược và kinh tế độc lập. Điều đó không chỉ giúp châu Âu duy trì được sự tự chủ mà còn bảo đảm rằng EU có thể đối mặt với những thách thức quốc tế một cách tự tin và kiên định.","summary":"Thanh niên là một trong những nhóm đối tượng mà chiến dịch vận động tranh cử của bà Harris nhắm đến với hy vọng có thể góp phần đưa bà đến chiến thắng.","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/bau-cu-my-2024-cuu-tong-thong-obama-van-dong-cho-ung-cu-vien-harris-tai-pennsylvania-20241012i7290215/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2024/10/4/bau-cu-my-2024-cuu-tong-thong-obama-van-dong-cho-ung-cu-vien-harris-tai-pennsylvania-600x432-cdc-7290215.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:00:38","author":"Nguyễn Viễn","authors":["Nguyễn Viễn"],"language":"en","category":"technology","source_country":"vn","sentiment":0.243},{"id":259389618,"title":"'Wrong' for Barack Obama to 'lecture' Black men for not supporting Kamala Harris: Ex-Bernie Sanders adviser","text":"A former Bernie Sanders campaign adviser slammed former President Barack Obama Thursday for calling out Black men who do not support Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Why are Black men being lectured to?\" former Democratic Ohio state Sen.

It is a wrong course for the Harris-Walz campaign to lay at the feet of Black men when they have their reasons.\" Turner’s comments came after Obama ripped into Black men who have not been as enthusiastic about Harris’ presidential bid as they were for his 2008 and 2012 political campaigns. \"We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said during a pre-campaign rally stop in Pittsburgh on Thursday.

President Joe Biden promised to provide everything needed, “as long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s.”\n\nFollowing two assassination attempts against Trump in recent months, his campaign has been in contact with the White House and the Secret Service to request military assets for added protection, according to multiple US media reports on Friday.\n\nPresident Biden stated that he had ordered his administration to provide Trump “all that he needs” when asked about these reports.\n\n”As long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s,” he told reporters, before adding that he “was being facetious.”\n\n“Look, I’ve instructed the department to give him every – every single thing he needs for his... as if he were a sitting president. Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But if it doesn’t, he shouldn’t,” the US leader explained.\n\nThe request for military assets includes aircraft and vehicles to transport Trump between campaign events and expanded flight restrictions over his homes and rallies. However, reports from the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN did not mention whether the Republican campaign sought fighter jet escorts.\n\nTrump's presidential rival, Kamala Harris, receives protection from the US Marines as Vice President and travels on a US military aircraft designated as Air Force Two.\n\nThe Secret Service, responsible for protecting presidential candidates, confirmed that it received requests for increased protection but did not disclose details. “The former president is receiving the highest levels of protection,” said a representative for the agency, noting that the Secret Service would continue to adjust its protective posture as needed to address evolving threats.\n\nThe agency faced criticism after the first assassination attempt against Trump in July, which resulted in the resignation of its director. Since then, it has increased its defensive measures for Trump, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, counter-drone technology, and other protective and surveillance systems.\n\nLast month, Trump claimed there are “big threats” to his life from Iran after he and his team met with representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The agency declined to disclose details of the meeting, although the Trump campaign stated it focused on “real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the US.”\n\nTrump narrowly escaped death on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a 20-year-old man fired shots from a rooftop, grazing Trump’s ear and killing one audience member. The would-be assassin, Thomas M. Crooks, was killed by the US Secret Service, and his body was quickly cremated; his social media accounts have since been scrubbed.\n\nAnother would-be assassin, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested by the Secret Service on September 15 after being spotted near a Trump-owned golf course in Florida, apparently attempting to take a shot. Routh, a convicted felon, spent much of the past three years in Ukraine, claiming to various Western media outlets that he was fundraising and recruiting for Kiev’s war effort.\n\nThe FBI is investigating both incidents as attempted assassinations, but authorities have yet to provide any information about possible motives and have not revealed any evidence linking to an Iranian plot.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump’s campaign has requested additional resources, including military aircraft, to protect him ahead of election \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605595-trump-us-military-aircraft-protection/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/6709b80e2030272b9062b27c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:44:37","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":259388694,"title":"How Arizona voters view the divisive issue of immigration","text":"Phoenix, Arizona — Aureliano Dominguez has run his hot dog stand along a busy Phoenix street for 33 years.

But in reality, it's a domino effect. These people, they spend money, they spend the paycheck,\" Dominguez said.How to secure the U.S.-Mexico border — and what to do about immigrants, legal and illegal, once they enter the U.S. — remain top concerns for voters. According to a CBS News poll taken in May, 52% of Arizona voters said recent immigrants from Mexico and Latin America had made life in Arizona worse, compared to 35% of voters when asked the same question in July of 2020. And how Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris answer those concerns is sharply different.Trump — who has spread false stories about immigrant-fueled crime and described immigrants in derogatory terms — has promised to use the military to expel 11 million undocumented immigrants.\"Those people have to be taken out and brought back to the country from where they came,\" Trump said in a Sept. 27 speech.A CBS News poll last month found that 53% of voters are in favor of Trump's plan, with 47% against it. Harris, who wants greater funding for border security and a legal pathway to citizenship for some undocumented migrants, has denounced Trump's plan. \"How is that going to happen?\" Harris asked while speaking at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18. \"Massive raids? Massive detention camps? What are they talking about?\"Republican rancher and Trump supporter John Ladd echoed that. \"How are you going to round up 20 million people?\" Ladd asked.But Ladd favors a get-tough approach to immigration. He sees people illegally cross the border every day onto his 16,000-acre ranch.\"This is mine,\" Ladd said of his land. \"This is my privacy. This is America. Don't mess with me.\"Still, he believes law-abiding immigrants deserve to stay. \"If they've been here and they're productive, there should be some consideration,\" Ladd said. Dominguez, meanwhile, is still considering his vote. He says he's heard Democrats promise they'll solve the immigration issue for years. \"I'm a registered Democrat, but I'm not 100% sure,\" Dominguez said. \"They promise, and nothing has happened.

The Tempe office is one of 18 field offices for Vice President Kamala Harris in the Grand Canyon State, so the closure is unlikely to significantly hamper Democrats' organizing efforts in Arizona.\n\nThe third shooting at the Tempe office came just days before Harris visited Arizona to campaign in Phoenix.

Trump has claimed extensively that Venezuelan gangs are taking over buildings, even though authorities say that was a single block of the suburb near Denver, and the area is again safe.\nIgnoring those denials from local authorities, Trump painted a picture of apartment complexes overrun by “barbaric thugs” and streets unsafe to travel, blaming US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival.\n\n“They’re ruining your state,” Trump said of the Democrats in the White House.\n“No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that Kamala Harris has inflicted on this community can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States,” Trump added.\nTrump often used dehumanising language, referring to his political rivals as “scum” who are destroying “the fabric of your culture” and to migrants as “animals: who have “invaded and conquered” Aurora. The town is “infected by Venezuela”, he said.\n“We have to clean out our country,” Trump said. And he reprised the first controversy of his career in politics, when he launched his 2016 campaign by saying migrants are rapists and bring drugs and crime.\n“I took a lot of heat for saying it, but I was right,” Trump said Friday, repeating the false claim that other countries are emptying their prisons and mental institutions and dumping their worst criminals in the United States.\nTo thunderous applause, he called for the death penalty “for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer”,\nTrump announced that as president he would launch “Operation Aurora” to focus on deporting members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, or TDA. The violent gang traces its origins more than a decade to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals.\nTrump also repeated his pledge to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any non-citizen who is from a country that the US is at war with.\n\nIn July, the Biden administration issued a sanction against the gang and offered US$12 million in rewards for the arrest of three leaders.\nAurora resident Jodie Powell, a 54-year-old Republican, rejected Trump’s claims that Venezuelan gangs had taken over the city.\n“That’s not the case,” Powell said, her fringe poking out below a white cap stamped with “Make America Great Again”. Still, Powell said, she has seen an increase in crime she associates with newcomers, citing a police chase that ended at a store where she was shopping.\n“It takes a small amount of people to make a big difference in the community,” said Powell, who ranks immigration as her top concern alongside the economy. “It’s scary, it’s a scary thing.”\nAt the venue where he appeared on Friday, posters displayed mug shots of people in prison-orange with descriptions including “Illegal immigrant gang members from Venezuela”.\n“Look at all these photos around me,” Stephen Miller, a former top aide who is expected to take a senior role in the White House if Trump wins, told the crowd before Trump spoke.\n“Are these the kids you grew up with? Are these the neighbours you were raised with? Are these the neighbours that you want in your city?” The crowd roared “no” in reply.\n\nSome of Colorado’s Democratic leaders accused Trump and other Republicans of overstating problems in Aurora.\n“What is occurring is minimal and isolated. And to be clear, it’s never acceptable, right? We never say any level is acceptable,” congressman Jason Crow said. “But it’s not a surge. It’s not a change. There is no takeover of any part of this city, of any apartment complex. It has not happened. It is a lie.”\nTrump and his running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, also have spread falsehoods about a community in Springfield, Ohio, where they said Haitian immigrants were accused of stealing and eating pets.\nWhile Ohio and Colorado are not competitive in the presidential race, the Republican message on immigration is intended for states that are. Vance campaigned recently in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a city of 70,000 that has resettled refugees from Africa and Asia, and touted Trump’s plan to ramp up deportations. He argues smaller communities have been “overrun” by immigrants taxing local resources.\nTrump has vowed to deport not only “criminals”, a promise he shares with Harris, but also Haitians living legally in Springfield and even people he has denigrated as “pro-Hamas radicals” protesting on college campuses. Trump has said he would revoke the temporary protected status that allows Haitians to stay in the US because of widespread poverty and violence in their home nation.\nHarris has tacked to the right on immigration, presenting herself as a candidate who can be tough on policing the border, which is perceived as one of her biggest vulnerabilities.\nShe wrapped up a three-day western swing with a campaign event on Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona, where she said she would create a bipartisan council of advisers to provide feedback on her policy initiatives if she makes it to the White House.\n“I love good ideas wherever they come from,” said Harris, who is making a push to get Republicans with doubts about Trump to support her.\n\nShe also accused Trump of letting Iran “off the hook” while he was in office and made her case that she would be a greater champion for Israel’s security than the Republican nominee.\n“Make no mistake, as president, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend American forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,” Harris said in a call with Jewish supporters ahead of Yom Kippur.\n“And I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end. But all options are on the table.”\nHarris charged that Trump “did nothing” after Iran “attacked US bases and American troops.”\nThe criticism by Harris was a knock on Trump for downplaying a January 2020 missile attack by Iran on a US base in Iraq that left several American troops with concussion-like symptoms, including some who had to be evacuated for treatment. Trump earlier this month in an exchange with a reporter referred to the injuries as a “headache”.\nThe Iranian missile attack came days after Trump ordered a strike that that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and raised tensions between the US and Iran.\nHarris took part virtually in a White House briefing with President Biden on the recovery effort from hurricanes Milton and Helene. She sought to reassure those who endured losses from the hurricane that they would get help from the government.","summary":"Often turning to false claims and dehumanising language, the Republican US

Pearson, who heads the RNC’s Youth Advisory Council, said in a video posted to X. \n\nMy name is CJ Pearson. I’m 22 years old. And in 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! And we don’t give a damn about what Barack Obama has to say about it. pic.twitter.com/tKzupKL0N1— CJ Pearson (@thecjpearson) October 11, 2024\n\nHis comments came after Obama urged young black men to vote for Harris because she is “somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences.” \n\nObama told black men that considering a vote for former President Donald Trump was “not acceptable” as he said part of their hesitancy was because they “just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nFormer Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, who was a Democratic delegate for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and served as the national co-chair of Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, also criticized the Democratic elder’s statements during a CNN interview. \n\n“Why are black men being belittled in ways that no other voting group [is]?” Turner questioned. “Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong.”\n\nHer comments responded to Obama’s “lecture” to black male voters.\n\n“You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody [in former President Donald Trump] who has a history of denigrating you because you think that’s a sign of strength because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down?” Obama said. \n\nBlack men and Black women do not vote much differently, it’s wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats.It’s patronizing and wrong. pic.twitter.com/2OXmq9q1TW— Nina Turner (@ninaturner) October 11, 2024\n\nTurner questioned the legitimacy of Obama’s argument, saying: “Some of the black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way. And even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it.”\n\n“So unless President Barack Obama is going to go out and lecture every other group of men from other identity groups, my message for Democrats is, don’t bring it here to black men who, by and large, don’t vote much differently from black women,” she added. \n\nFormer Republican Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones also chimed in, arguing that Obama’s comments treated black men as if “we are too stupid, that we can’t vote our self-interest — what’s best for us, our pocketbook, our families. As if we’ve been immune to the past three-and-a-half years, as if we don’t know that gas prices have been higher under Kamala Harris, food prices higher under Kamala Harris, interest rates or home mortgages higher under Kamala Harris, and runaway borders under Kamala Harris.” \n\nIn a video posted to X, Vernon said that while Obama “meant a lot to black people,” he didn’t “do anything for black people.” \n\n.@BarackObama should be ashamed for berating, rebuking and scolding Black men, because they won’t vote for Madam Lock Up A Brother…@KamalaHarris.

You don’t even live in Chicago anymore. You left your black community, Barack Obama, and you want to tell us how to vote? We’re not having that,” he said. \n\nObama has begun ramping up outreach to voters in battleground states as Harris’s campaign has seen cracks in support from the black community.\n\nIn states such as Pennsylvania, which will be critical to determining the winner of the 2024 presidential election, one black voter recently said he was backing Trump because Democrats “don’t offer anything to the straight black male voters.”","summary":"After former President Barack Obama rebuked black men for hesitating to support Vice President Kamala Harris, he&#8217;s receiving backlash from African American leaders.

That’s under discussion,” Biden told reporters last week.\n\n“If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oilfields.”\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-allied Iraqi group, warned that if an “energy war” were to start, “the world would lose” about 12 million oil barrels daily — about 10 percent of the global production. The spokesperson did not provide further details.\n\nA military attack on Iran’s oil sector could send global prices soaring and prove costly for American consumers, which would harm the election chances of the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nEarlier this week, Harris declared Iran as the US’s “greatest adversary” as she reasserted her “unwavering” support for Israel.\n\nBiden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and reaffirmed his “ironclad” backing of the US ally as well.\n\nUS officials have portrayed the Iranian missile assault on Israel as unprovoked, although Haniyeh was assassinated on Iranian soil in an attack widely blamed on Israel in late July.\n\nAsked after the killing of Haniyeh whether Iran “as a sovereign nation” has a right to defend itself, State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel dismissed the question, accusing Tehran of “destabilising” actions across the region.\n\nIran’s envoy to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, said this week that his country “stands fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression targeting its vital interests and security”.","summary":"US penalties come as Israeli government considers military response against Iran amid risk of spiralling escalation.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/us-imposes-sanctions-on-irans-oil-sector-over-missile-attack-on-israel?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12168695-1713523813.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:17:59","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.107},{"id":259388238,"title":"Why Trump is campaigning in comfortably blue Colorado","text":"Why Trump is campaigning in comfortably blue Colorado\n Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump campaigned in western battleground states Friday.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN KEY COUNTY NEAR BIDEN BIRTHPLACE Senior policy analyst at Independent Women's Forum Inez Stepman marveled at the video one X user dubbed \"the cringiest political ad ever created\" and replied, \"This can’t be real.\" Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino remarked, \"It's so bizarre that those on the political left, who for years proselytized the hoi poi that men can be women and women can be men, that men can compete in women's sports because we are all genderless creatures, now think they have credibility to say what a real man is all about. Sorry you blew it years ago.\" PENNSYLVANIA LEADERS IN BOTH PARTIES TALK GROUND GAME AS GOP SEEKS TO UNDO DEM GAINS Podcaster Wade Stotts poked fun at the awkwardness of one character in a cowboy hat by joking about what else he might say, like, \"Howdy, pardner. Great economy we're havin' today, ain't it? Sure hope Trump doesn't poison the water hole. Anyway, nice talkin' to ya. I've been outdoors before.\" \"Must-see Kamala ad,\" Claremont Institute fellow David Reaboi quipped. \"Not only do they have no idea how actual men speak, they couldn’t find any convincing male actors.\" \"This is amazing,\" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway said of the video. \"Can’t tell if it’s satire or not. I don’t think it is?\" Claremont Institute associate editor Spencer Klavan suggested that this video, if anything, is revealing about what the American left wants men to be. \"When Harris Walz say what men are like, they mean this is what men *should* be. You can tell because when it turns out men are revolted by this and reject it, they’ll blame men for being insufficiently enlightened, not themselves for failing to understand men.\" \"This ad is amazing because neither pole in the argument captures the spirit of ‘being a real man,’\" City Journal writer Chris Rufo said. \"It's not about barrel-aged bourbon or deadlifting 500 pounds, nor is it about supporting IVF or voting for Kamala Harris. These are both caricatures: one is a left-wing mistranslation of ‘manosphere masculinity’; the other is an attempt to ‘redefine masculinity’ in left-wing ideological terms. Taken together, they represent a phony simulacrum of the male nature.\" Manhattan Institute fellow Leor Sapir argued, \"What this ad fundamentally misses is that manliness is all about NOT waiting for encouragement or permission to stand up for (or to) something. This is what makes it at once dangerous and essential for civilization.\" \"I don't think this ad is meant to convince men to vote for Harris (LOL),\" Newsweek opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon wrote. \"I think it's meant to reassure her base—college educated women—that the Democratic Party is truly theirs. The only men the party recognizes are these emasculated, AI generated putzes.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ad's director, Jacob Reed, said it was made for Creators for Harris, and a disclaimer for the ad says it is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. He noted that the ad is a half-joking, yet earnest appeal, \"even though it’s more sketch comedy than political ad, what these men are saying is true.\" \"With the rise of role models like Tim Walz and Doug Emhoff on the national stage, I think the left is finally finding its footing on how to talk about masculinity — I think we’re overdue for a redefinition of what it means to be a man in America and I hope this campaign can start to shape that conversation.\" Fast Company reported that Reed's \"original version was a bit more scolding. It included lines like, ‘I’m not afraid of a woman having rights because what kind of creep would I be then?’\" Later however, \"After marinating on the concept a bit further, Reed realized the last thing he wanted to do was condescend to his potential audience, whom he saw as both people already on board the Harris train and people on the fence.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Reed and the Harris and Trump campaigns.","summary":"An ad made to support the Harris-Walz campaign faced a tidal wave of mockery online Friday, with many unable to tell if it was real or a parody.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/man-enough-video-supporting-harris-mocked-the-cringiest-political-ad-ever-created","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/10/931/523/harris-guys-split.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:12:18","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":259386836,"title":"Donald Trump Sees Lead in Solidly Republican States Cut in Half","text":"Donald Trump's lead in two states he easily carried in 2016 and 2020 has been cut in half in recent polls, though only one state he won in both elections—North Carolina—is viewed as a toss-up.The presidential race between Trump and Kamala Harris is poised to be very close, with polls pointing to an election battle similar to the 2020 race between Trump and President Joe Biden. On Friday, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed Harris with a mere 2.5-point lead over Trump nationally, with the core battleground states even closer.Of the 25 states Trump won in 2020, only North Carolina is viewed as a toss-up this year. The other battlegrounds—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were all narrowly won by Biden four years ago. But Democrats are investing in a handful of other states Trump won twice, particularly those home to potentially competitive Senate races, such as Florida, Ohio and Texas.Although Trump is expected to easily win them in November, the latest polls in Arkansas and Oklahoma showed his support has dropped in half since 2020. He won Arkansas by 28 points and Oklahoma by 33 points four years ago.A Hendrix College poll of 696 likely Arkansas voters, conducted from September 5 to 6, showed Trump leading Harris by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent). Meanwhile, a SoonerPoll of 323 likely Oklahoma voters, conducted from August 24 to 31, showed Trump winning the state by 16 points (56 percent to 40 percent).Harris losing these states by 15 or 16 points would mark a significant shift in two of the most conservative states in the country. Notably, no other polls have been conducted in Arkansas and Oklahoma since Harris became the Democratic nominee, so it's unclear if these polls are outliers.Harris has improved on Biden's polling since the summer, when concerns about his age caused his numbers to dip. But surveys still suggest the race mirrors that of 2020, for the most part. While some polls show Harris gaining ground in Republican states, others show Trump winning over voters in traditionally Democratic states like New York.Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly told Newsweek in a statement, \"President Trump is winning this race because everyone was better off when he was in office. Kamala Harris has wrecked our economy, driven up prices, opened the southern border, and unleashed a wave of violent crime in communities across the country.\"She went on: \"Alongside the broadest coalition in history that includes leaders like RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, and everywhere from traditional battlegrounds to longtime 'blue states' like Virginia and Minnesota, voters are tired of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris, and they are ready to Make America Great Again on November 5.\"Newsweek also reached out by email to the Harris campaign for comment.Here is an overview of polling in states Trump won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.North Carolina: Harris' Most Competitive Trump-Won StateFiveThirtyEight's average gave Trump a very narrow advantage in the Tar Heel State on Friday, showing him with a 0.9-point lead in the state, the most competitive of those Trump won in his past presidential runs.The latest independent polls in North Carolina show Trump with a narrow lead. An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters from October 5 to 8, showed Trump up 1 point in the state (50 percent to 49 percent).A Wall Street Journal poll, conducted by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates/GBAO, showed the race tied, with each candidate receiving 47 percent of the vote. It surveyed 600 registered voters from September 28 to October 8.Democrats are hoping Harris benefits from Democrat Josh Stein's more comfortable lead in North Carolina's gubernatorial race, which was shaken up after CNN reported on posts allegedly made by Republican Mark Robinson, including references to watching pornography featuring transgender individuals and calling himself a \"black NAZI.\" Robinson has said those posts were not made by him.Trump, who has praised Robinson as \"Martin Luther King on steroids,\" has not distanced himself from the candidate. Experts have said it is uncertain whether the scandal will have an impact on the presidential race.Five Other States Show Trump With Single-Digit LeadsFive other states show Trump leading in the single digits, but he remains favored to win each of them in November.Florida and Texas are viewed as the next two most competitive Trump-won states. The Cook Political report classifies them both as \"Likely Republican,\" meaning they aren't viewed as especially close but have the potential to become more competitive.In Florida, a state that has trended increasingly Republican in recent years, a Marist College poll, conducted among 1,410 registered voters from October 3 to 7, showed Trump leading Harris by 4 points (51 percent to 47 percent).But a separate survey from The New York Times and Siena College gave Trump a larger lead. It showed him up 13 points against Harris (53 percent to 40 percent). It polled 622 likely voters from September 29 to October 7.Democrats are also hoping to make Texas, where leftward shifts in cities and suburban areas have narrowed Republican margins, competitive. But polls still give Trump an advantage in November.Marist College polled 1,186 likely voters in the state from October 3 to 7, finding Trump with a 7-point lead over Harris (53 percent to 46 percent).Meanwhile, a Times/Siena College poll, conducted among 617 likely voters from September 29 to October 4, showed Trump up 6 points (50 percent to 44 percent) in the Lone Star State.Trump won Florida by 3 points and Texas by nearly 6 points in 2020.Three other states have also produced polls showing the race in the single digits, though forecasters view these states as more difficult for Harris. The Cook Political Report still rates them all as \"Safe Republican.\"An Alaska Survey Research poll, conducted among 1,182 likely voters from September 27 to 29, showed Trump up 9 points in Alaska (52 percent to 43 percent). He won the state by 10 points in 2020.A Selzer & Co. poll, sponsored by The Des Moines Register and Mediacom, showed Trump up 4 points in Iowa (47 percent to 43 percent). It polled 656 likely voters from September 8 to 11. In Ohio, a Washington Post poll, conducted among 1,002 registered voters from October 3 to 7, showed Trump up 7 points (51 percent to 44 percent).Trump won both Iowa and Ohio by 8 points in 2020.Trump's Lead Holds in Ruby-Red StatesPolling in the most conservative-leaning states is generally scant, as pollsters invest their resources in the more competitive states. But some surveys have shed light on how these states might vote in November.Harris isn't expected to be particularly competitive in any state Trump won by a large margin in both elections. Polls of a Harris-Trump matchup from some states, such as Alabama or Louisiana, are not available, so it's yet to be seen if his lead is holding there or if Harris may be making inroads with voters.No other states have changes quite as drastic as Arkansas and Oklahoma, but polls suggest Utah may be the state where Trump is most building upon his 2020 vote share. A HarrisX poll, sponsored by Deseret News and the University of Utah Hinckley Institute of Politics, showed Trump up 32 points in the state (60 percent to 28 percent). Trump won Utah by 21 points in 2020.An ActiVote poll of Tennessee, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 27 to August 29, also showed Trump improving on his past performance. The poll had Trump up 26 points in the state (63 percent to 37 percent), a slightly larger margin than the 23 points he won it by in 2024.Other red states have changed less from four years ago.A Winthrop University Center for Public Opinion & Policy Research poll of 1,078 likely South Carolina voters from September 21 to 29 showed Trump up 10 points (52 percent to 42 percent). He won the Palmetto State by about 11 points in 2020.In Missouri, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed Trump up 12.5 points on Friday, closer than his 15-point lead in 2020. FiveThirtyEight showed him up 18 points in Nebraska, which he won by 19 points in 2020.","summary":"Trump is favored in most states he won in his past presidential runs, but he may be held to a single-digit lead in several states.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-lead-republican-states-1967956","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493884/donald-trump-polling-states-he-won-twice.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:00:10","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":259387414,"title":"Andrew Schulz: The Comedy Podcaster Who Roasted Trump to His Face","text":"The hustler never thinks they’ll be hustled.

But I think any help they can get in Pennsylvania would be a good thing, because we know it is key. And so does Trump,’ she added, saying Biden could provide a needed ‘boost.’\n\nHayes was there when residents crowded around Biden during his last visit to his his old Green Ridge neighborhood as part of a campaign reboot. \n\nBiden said at the time he looked at the economy ‘through the eyes of Scranton’ rather than the eyes of Mar-a-Lago. He also came on Election Day 2020. \n\nHayes worries that after getting a debate bump, the hurricanes and war in Israel are putting Harris in a precarious position with voters. ‘It’s definitely scary for me,’ she says. \n\nHaving worked with young students, she says the Democrats may need to draw on celebrity endorsements like Taylor Swift to motivate voters. ‘I know the impact she has, but that’s what they’re going to need to do,’ she said.\n\nOver at Hank’s Hoagies, a Biden favorite just steps from his old home, retired software engineer Deanne Loftus called Biden’s decision to step back ‘selfless,’ and says Harris has her vote. \n\nShe has only an inkling Harris can prevail. ‘I think so. I’m worried about the Senate race,’ she says, pointing to the bid by Scranton native Sen. Bob Casey, who grew up a few blocks away.\n\nIt’s not just the sandwiches and the old memories that keep Biden coming back. ‘Scranton climbs in your heart. There’s no way of getting it out, even if I wanted to. I don’t,’ the president said days ago in his eulogy here for childhood friend Tommy Bell at St. Paul’s Catholic Church, where he worshipped as a kid. \n\nIt’s a potential well of Democratic support surrounded by rural areas where Trump has been making inroads in a state Biden snatched away from him in 2020. Biden beat Trump in Lackawanna County that year, prevailing by 9,000 votes and winning it 54 to 45. Scranton has a population of about 75,000.\n\n‘If we win Pennsylvania we win the whole thing. It’s over – the whole thing,’ Trump said during his trip to the state for a pair of rallies Wednesday, including one in Scranton that drew a few thousand. \n\nTop political experts agree. Pennsylvania, because of its trove of 19 electoral votes, the closeness of the polls, and the way it is flipped between Trump and Biden, is the country’s most contested state. For Harris, it’s the most worrisome section of the ‘blue wall.’\n\nOne of those Trump voters in Biden’s neighborhood is John, a Scranton firefighter and union member who didn’t want to give his second name, and who is sticking with the former president after previously voting for Barack Obama. (The international firefighters union was the first to back Biden in 2020 and didn’t make an endorsement this year.)\n\n‘When he was in the first time around, the economy was good. I know some of that’s attributable to Barack Obama before him. But I do like his hardline stance on both domestic foreign policy and promoting economic growth here in the United States, he says while walking his Dachshund by Biden’s old house.\n\nJust a few steps up a hill from Biden’s childhood home is Marywood University, a Catholic institution where some students earned extra credit by registering to vote.\n\nMia Scotti says she’ll cast her first vote for Trump. ‘I just feel like he has more of a voice, and he’s done it before,’ she said while taking a break from studying in the school’s education program.\n\nBaden Hancock, a freshman studying mathematics, is also preparing to cast his first vote for Trump, after earning five extra points in his Psychology class after registering. The golf enthusiast is hoping to scrape together enough money to buy a sporty new Maza sports car.\n\n‘Maybe I do agree with him,’ he says of Trump. ‘I just want a better economy.’ As for Harris, ‘I don’t think she’s as strong as Trump. I think she would just like be a weaker candidate, I think Trump, I know he’s gonna do what he says he’s gonna do.’\n\nBiden hasn’t lived in the Green Ridge neighborhood since 1952. But there’s another real Biden Street in Scranton – renamed after he was elected in the city’s struggling downtown. (There is also a Biden expressway with big green signage that takes drivers off the highway of Pennsylvania Route 307).\n\nAs in many industrial downtowns, there are signs of economic problems on Biden street, which is dotted with vacant businesses – including one in a prominent corner decorated with Trump signs. \n\nBut here, Harris has already snagged exactly the kind of vote she needs if she is to carry the state inside a Lackawanna County government center located just a few yards below Biden Street.\n\nDave Castellani, a self-described right-wing Republican and retired Proctor & Gamble employee, had just dropped off his vote for Harris Wednesday.\n\nAsked how he feels after his vote, he replied, ‘That’s questionable.’ \n\n‘You’ve got to look at the worst of two evils,’ he continued,\n\n‘You know, you may not think that Harris is the greatest, is going to be the greatest president, but then you look at Trump, and you’ve got to make a decision whether you’re going to stay with the Constitution or you’re going to look at somebody who wants to try to be a whatever he wants to be – He wants to be somebody that is like Putin,’ he says after dropping off his ballot.\n\n‘He’s got a huge following, so it’s like a cult situation. I mean, you look at his vice president, all the people that worked with him said that he shouldn’t be in office. He’s a danger to the Constitution, to the American way of life. And I believe that,’ said Castellani, who voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n‘At that time, I thought that it was a possibility be that he would be a different kind of a person,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Biden&#8217;s connection to his hometown of Scranton burns so strongly that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Why people living on the street where Biden grew up are extremely anxious about Kamala Harris&#8217; likelihood of winning in a crucial state that may determine the outcome of the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/why-people-living-on-the-street-where-biden-grew-up-are-extremely-anxious-about-kamala-harris-likelihood-of-winning-in-a-crucial-state-that-may-determine-the-outcome-of-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Why-residents-of-Bidens-childhood-street-are.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:57:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.161},{"id":259387210,"title":"Harris viewed more positively by Hispanic women than by Hispanic men: AP-NORC poll","text":"WASHINGTON — A solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris and a negative view of former President Donald Trump, but Hispanic men are more divided on both candidates, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nHispanic men are also more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on key issues, underscoring the potential importance of this group, which both candidates have courted aggressively.\n\nAs the election approaches, the extent to which Trump can erode Harris’ support among Hispanic voters could be an important factor in swing states like Arizona. Hispanic voters are more supportive of the Democrats overall: According to the poll, nearly half identify as Democrats, about one-third as Republicans, and around 2 in 10 as independents. But the poll signals that Hispanic men, while not overwhelmingly in favor of Trump, are more open to his candidacy than Hispanic women – and less open to Harris’.\n\nThe margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nAntonio Melcon, 65, a Republican from Florida, said Trump has his vote because he is the best option for the country. In Melcon’s view, the Biden administration has taken the nation down a bad path, and Harris has done nothing to stop it.\n\n“She wasn’t the one that implemented the route this country has taken, but she’s been there and done nothing that merits I vote for her,” Melcon said. “I would definitely never vote for her.”\n\nOverall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Harris. But there is a gender divide among Hispanic voters on Harris: About 6 in 10 Hispanic women have a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Harris, compared to 45% of Hispanic men.\n\nSimilarly, about half of Hispanic women voters think Harris would make a good president, compared to only about one-third of Hispanic men.\n\nFor some voters, one candidate may appear in a better light simply because they dislike the alternative. Sonia Montoya, a 68-year-old Democrat from Chicago, said while she disagrees with many of Harris’ policies, she still sees Harris as the lesser of two evils. Montoya said Harris is more human and has a better understanding of society, while she views Trump as “arrogant, a liar, a cheater.”\n\nIn addition to having warmer feelings toward Harris, about 6 in 10 Hispanic female voters say Trump would not make a good president, compared to about half of Hispanic male voters.\n\nAnd Hispanic men are likelier than Hispanic women to think Trump has the toughness the presidency requires. About half of Hispanic men say “tough enough to be president” describes Trump extremely or very well, compared to about one-third of Hispanic women. Hispanic men are also more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on important policies.\n\nPlenty of Hispanic men, though, remain supportive of Harris and skeptical about Trump. Sebastian Diaz, 51 and an independent from Massachusetts, views Harris “somewhat favorably” because he agrees with her ideology. He said he has a “very unfavorable” view of Trump because he is “a racist bigot.”\n\nDespite some divisions in views of the candidates, though, Hispanic voters are largely in agreement that the economy is a major factor as they consider their options for president. Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is “one of the most important issues” during this election season.\n\nDaysi Garcia, 44, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said groceries have gotten so expensive that the candidates’ economic plans are guiding her vote. A self-proclaimed Democrat until last year, Garcia said while she does not agree with all of Trump’s policies, she is unhappy with the Democrats and thinks Trump would be a better choice to run the country.\n\n“It is so bad right now,” Garcia said. “It is so hard to do grocery shopping because everything is through the roof. I don’t remember ever seeing everything skyrocket the way it is now.”\n\nMelcon agrees that the cost of living is too high. “The economy is the main thing for me,” he said. “The environment, immigration – which is also a problem – that’s second fiddle.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Hispanic voters also say that health care or crime are among the most important issues for their vote, while about half say that about gun policy. Slightly less than half say abortion or immigration are among the most important. Hispanic voters are more likely than voters nationwide to see health care as a top voting priority.\n\nDiaz said health care, like food and water, is a basic need for humans.\n\n“I think universal access to health care is incredibly important for the social development of a country,” Diaz said.\n\nMore Hispanic voters think Harris represents their culture\n\nHarris has one potential advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters: About 4 in 10 say she is the candidate who better represents their background and culture, while about one-quarter say this about Trump. A sizable share are unconvinced that either candidate fits into this role, though: About 3 in 10 say neither candidate represents their background and culture.\n\nThe fact that Harris is the daughter of immigrants may give some Hispanic voters a sense of representation, civic engagement advocates say, even though she’s not Hispanic herself.\n\nMontoya said as someone who is biracial, Harris represents her identity best. “She knows what it feels like to be insulted or put to the side or feel worthless because of prejudice in this world,” Montoya said. “I think she’ll fight harder for us than (Trump) ever would.”","summary":"A solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris and a negative view of former President Donald Trump, but Hispanic men are divided on both candidates, according to a recent AP-NORC poll","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/11/harris-viewed-more-positively-by-hispanic-women-than-by-hispanic-men-ap-norc-poll/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Election_2024_AP_Poll_Hispanic_Voters_62136_a72242-1728687556.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:55:44","author":"Fernanda Figueroa And Linley Sanders,FERNANDA FIGUEROA and LINLEY SANDERS - Associated Press","authors":["Fernanda Figueroa And Linley Sanders","FERNANDA FIGUEROA and LINLEY SANDERS - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":259386682,"title":"Herschel Walker tells Barack Obama that voting according to skin color is a step in the wrong direction.","text":"“Barack Obama, you forgot how hard we fought for our right to vote!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Terry Zeller and Eve Buckland For Dailymail.Com \n Published:23:36 BST, 11 October 2024 |Updated:23:47 BST, 11 October 2024 \n\nKanye West's representative has denied allegations made in a lawsuit that the rapper hired a 'fixer' to follow his wife Bianca Censori and investigate the Kardashian family.\nIn the lawsuit filed on Thursday, a former employee of the 47-year-old rapper — who recently refuted he had split from Censori, 29 - claims West instructed him to hire private investigators to 'tail' Censori while she was abroad, along with making other allegedly illegal requests.\n'Many of the details in his complaint are simply fantastical and false,' Kanye's representative told Page Six on Friday. \nThe rep further stated that the lawsuit—which also accuses West of abusing nitrous oxide—is 'designed to cause embarrassment and/or capitalize on perceived problems in Ye’s marriage.'\nAccording to the lawsuit obtained by Rolling Stone, John Doe's duties allegedly included mitigating West's risks and preventing bad press, involving investigations and managing nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). \n\nKanye West 's representative has denied allegations made in a lawsuit that the rapper hired a 'fixer' to follow his wife Bianca Censori and investigate the Kardashian familyl (West, Censori in February)\n\n'Many of the details in his complaint are simply fantastical and false,' Kanye's representative told Page Six on Friday; (Kim Kardashian, West pictured in 2019)\n\nEXCLUSIVE Kanye West and Bianca Censori 'divorce' takes another twist as friends say couple is 'pathetic' \nHe also claims that his investigations targeted Censori and the Kardashian family, including West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, with private investigators allegedly following Censori on West’s orders. \nThe 22 page lawsuit filed in LA reads: 'A particularly notable task by Ye was to have Doe hire private investigators to follow and ‘tail’ his wife, Bianca Censori, when she was traveling alone to visit family in Australia, without Ms. Censori’s knowledge.'\nIn May Doe cites West began exhibiting 'erratic behavior' including spending $850,000 on a set of titanium teeth and sacking a 'large majority of the Yeezy leadership - including former chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos - who has also accused West of being hooked on nitrous oxide.\nThe alleged behavior came at a time when West was claimed to be consuming nitrous oxide - which Doe believes 'played a role in West’s decision-making at the time.'\nDoe's attorney Ronald Zambrano told the publication: 'My client believes there is a direct correlation between the nitrous oxide and the increase in paranoia and siege mentality that ended up happening in that timeframe that Doe worked for West.\n'There were internal concerns about the amount of nitrous oxide that was being delivered to his house.'\nThe lawsuit claims Doe's employment ended in mid-May when he got a call from a Donda Academy teacher 'regarding safety concerns they had about some of the students.' \nDoe says he informed Yeezy leadership about the call and 'almost immediately' West allegedly 'called Doe to yell, curse and threaten Doe with great bodily injury, including death, if Doe repeated what Doe learned from the Donda employee.'\n\nThe rep further stated that the lawsuit—which also accuses West of abusing nitrous oxide—is 'designed to cause embarrassment and/or capitalize on perceived problems in Ye’s marriage.'\n\nHe also claims that his investigations targeted Censori and the Kardashian family, including West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian , with private investigators allegedly following Censori on West’s orders; (pictured 2019)\nWest allegedly told Doe he was 'f*****g dead to [him]' and played a recording of 'scary voices that were threatening to harm' Doe - per the suit.\nDoe claims in the following days West's 'enforcers' began to threaten him, triggering his PTSD from past military experience.\nThe lawsuit claims: '[Doe] experienced panic attacks, anxiety, and severe emotional distress, which caused him to seek medical treatment and was placed in a facility to address his declining mental health.'\nDoe is suing West for emotional distress, retaliation and several violations of California labor codes. \nThe plaintiff is seeking restitution of unpaid wages, attorneys’ fees, and general and punitive damages to be determined at trial. \nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Kanye West and the Kardashians for comment. \nIn August Yiannopoulo made a slew of bombshell allegations aimed at the rapper and his dentist, Thomas P. Connelly, in a legal affidavit.\nYiannopoulos, 39, who quit working for West in May after two years, claimed that West is addicted to nitrous oxide or 'laughing gas' and alleged Connelly was 'aware' of West's 'psychological vulnerabilities' and believed he 'sought to exploit them' by supplying the gas.\nFurther shock claims in the document are that Connelly continued 'to supply the gas after the emergence of distressing symptoms that led to widespread comment and concern' and charged 'more than $50,000 a month' to do so.\n(West was seen in a Reddit post three months ago with a mask on with the caption, 'Ye on nitrous.')\nIt was alleged West's 'growing dependency on the gas' - also known as 'hippy crack' which can induce feelings of euphoria - concerned Yeezy staff members and that the rapper 'seemed to be in and out of the inhaler mask on a near-constant basis' and his communications 'were becoming incomprehensible and contradictory.'\n\nIn August West's former chief of staff Yiannopoulos, 39, claimed that West is addicted to nitrous oxide or 'laughing gas' - Pictured in 2017 in NYC\n\nWest allegedly told Doe he was 'f*****g dead to [him]' and played a recording of 'scary voices that were threatening to harm' Doe - per the suit - pictured in 2024 \nWest has notably seen his career implode amid anti-Semitic comments - beginning with a vile post in 2022 that he was going 'death con 3 on Jewish people' - which got him promptly dropped by his agency CAA, production company MRC, Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga.\nThe symptoms of West's 'widely-reported bipolar diagnosis and the side effects of prolonged nitrous gas abuse are strikingly similar' claims the affidavit, with symptoms including 'erratic behavior, mood swings, paranoia and violence.'\nYiannopoulos claims a Yeezy employee told him that they had witnessed West 'self-administering the nitrous gas provided by Connelly.'\nYiannopoulos - who detailed his job duties as 'solving mysteries and fixing problems where others have failed.' said the affidavit was in tandem with a complaint he filed with the California Dental Board accusing Connelly of 'reckless, unethical, dishonest, explorative and, upon information and belief, illegal conduct. '\nHe says he was 'motivated by urgent concern' for West's health and safety' in both his own capacity of himself and 'on behalf of several individuals close to him.'\nA rep for Connelly told TMZ that claims made by Yiannopoulos were 'not only factually incorrect but also intentionally misleading.'\nYiannopoulos was 'making up these claims for attention,' Connelly's rep told the outlet, and was 'attempting to maliciously damage' Connelly while doing so.\nConnelly's rep told TMZ that the dentist follows legal and ethical standards and will continue doing so.\nThis comes after it was claimed West and Censori orchestrated speculation they are heading for divorce to create a buzz around his new album. \nOn Monday, multiple reports emerged the couple had secretly called it quits 'weeks ago', with the rapper reportedly 'ready to divorce' his wife.\nHowever, the duo were then pictured together in Japan just hours after split claims went public.\nNow, sources close to the pair believe the speculation surrounding their nearly two-year marriage was a deliberate ploy to help build publicity around Kanye's new album. \nLate last month, Ye announced his new album Bully and debuted the song Beauty and the Beast during an event in China. He has also released his album Vultures 2 in August. \n\nHis 10th studio album, Vultures 1, was released on February 10\n\nHe has two Diamond certified songs — 2007's Stronger and 2011's N***as in Paris featuring Jay-Z — and all 10 of his albums have been at least certified Gold\nSince bursting onto the rap scene over 20 years ago, West has sold an incredible 160million records worldwide and is a 24-time Grammy Award winner. \nHe has two Diamond certified songs — 2007's Stronger and 2011's N***** in Paris featuring Jay-Z — and all 10 of his albums have been at least certified Gold.\nHis 10th studio album, Vultures 1, went straight to No.1 when it was released in February 2024. It was done in collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign as their hip hop duo ¥$.\nWest previously teased that a follow-up album, Vultures 2, is in the works. The chatter around West's alleged musical retirement comes amid a slew of legal woes for the rapper - mostly relating to his crumbling Yeezy empire.\nKanye WestBianca Censori\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West DENIES he 'hired fixer to follow' Bianca Censori and 'investigate' the Kardashians\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCeline Dion's showstopping Olympics performance is slammed as 'FAKE' and pre-recorded in extraordinary row in France\n\nR.

Trump narrowly survived one assassination attempt and U.S. Secret Service agents foiled a second, though neither case has been publicly linked to Iranian actors.\n\nBeyond a military plane, the campaign has asked for special armored vehicles typically reserved for sitting presidents, expanded temporary flight restrictions over his rallies and his residences, reimbursements for decoy aircraft, and more money for the U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement agencies that assist in Trump’s protection.\n\nBoth Trump and his staff have complained that he is being restricted from campaigning the way he wants to because the agency lacks the resources to keep him safe.\n\nThe Secret Service insisted Friday that Trump is already “receiving the highest levels of protection.” And President Joe Biden told reporters that he would be happy to approve Trump’s request to use military aircraft in the final stages of the campaign, as long as “he doesn’t ask for F-15s.”\n\n“Look, what I’ve told the department is to give him every single thing he needs for his — as if he were a sitting president,” he said. “Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.”\n\nThe new security requests were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe campaign and Secret Service have gone back and forth \n\nThe Trump campaign’s requests were outlined in a letter to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr. from senior Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles and obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nShe asked the Secret Service to pre-position the ballistic glass that Trump now uses for protection at his outdoor rallies in the seven battleground states where he is expected to spend the majority of time in the race’s final stretch.\n\nCurrently, it takes more than a week’s notice to position the barriers in the right place, according to a person familiar with the requests who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. Trump aides see that advance notice as unrealistic given the frenetic nature of the final days of a campaign, when schedules are adjusted based on incoming polls and campaign strategy, the person said. \n\nIn a statement, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that since the attempted assassination on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency “has made comprehensive enhancements to its communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations” and that Trump “is receiving the highest levels of protection.”\n\nHe said the Department of Defense regularly provides assistance for Trump’s protection, including canine units, and that the Secret Service has been restricting air traffic over the former president’s residence and when he travels.\n\n“Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems,” he said.\n\nFormer American presidents are able to use military airlift only if requested by the current president. In April, for instance, former President Bill Clinton used one as he led a U.S. delegation to Rwanda. On Sept. 11, 2021, Biden, Clinton, and former President Barack Obama flew to a remembrance in New York.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of denying him resources\n\nThe Trump campaign for weeks now has accused the U.S. Secret Service of forcing it to cancel or scale back events due to a lack of resources.\n\nThat includes a speech in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, held the same week as the U.N. General Assembly in New York, that was scaled back because the Secret Service couldn’t secure a larger rally. \n\nTrump has accused Biden of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.\n\n“They couldn’t give me any help. And I’m so angry about it because what they’re doing is interfering in the election,” he said in a recent Fox News interview.\n\nTrump, however, has repeatedly praised his own security detail, commending them for their bravery.\n\nWhile the Secret Service says Trump already has presidential-level protection, there are differences. Both Biden and Harris, for instance, have military assets, including planes.\n\nBeyond her Sept. 30 letter, Wiles has also spoken with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and others about her concerns about Trump’s security and how his ability to campaign has been curtailed by threats.\n\nZients, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose details of their conversation, connected Wiles to Homeland Security Department and Secret Service leadership after she reached out and made clear that Biden had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump.\n\nIn a separate letter, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, who is close to Trump, urged the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, White House and Department of Defense to deploy additional military assets to protect Trump in the face of Iranian threats. He requested that Trump be provided with a military passenger aircraft like those used by cabinet secretaries.\n\nTrump aides call for action against Iran \n\nTrump has been targeted by Iran, which is believed to want retaliation for his administration’s killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nIn August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.\n\nIranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to “weaponize” the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.\n\nTrump’s campaign has complained that the Biden White House has downplayed the death threats.\n\n“This administration spends more time focused on a hack of emails than they do the Iranians who are trying to kill Donald Trump,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters in Pennsylvania last weekend. He noted that former President Clinton deployed cruise missiles in retaliation for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n“You know he did? He sent a bunch of cruise missiles to send a message,” LaCivita complained. “All they do is put out a press release.”\n\nIn a statement, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the Biden administration has been “closely tracking Iranian threats against former President Trump and former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration.”\n\n“We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,” Savett added, warning that: “Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.”\n\n___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller, Rebecca Santana, Lolita C.

He did call President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton but made no mention of his predecessor.Trump did seem to make a dig at Harris' campaign for calling in Obama to stump for her, writing on Truth Social Friday morning, \"Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men. I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn't like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!\"Obama's appearance in Pittsburgh has been largely viewed as a sign that Democrats are concerned about Black male voters turning out for Harris. During the rally, the former Democratic president aimed a message at the voting bloc, telling them, \"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses. I've got a problem with that.\"\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said.\"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting,\" he added.Although he kept mum at his rally in Colorado, Trump has criticized Obama in the past for making jabs at him.When Obama poked fun at Trump's \"weird obsession with crowd sizes\" during his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Trump slammed Obama for \"getting personal\" in his remarks.\"Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night taking little shots? He was taking shots at your president and so was Michelle,\" Trump told a crowd in Asheboro, North Carolina the day after Obama's DNC speech. \"You know, they always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal,' but they're getting personal all night, these people.\"Trump discussed his notorious use of nicknames for his political rivals during a podcast appearance released Thursday.\"I'm good with names you know,\" Trump joked with \"flagrant\" hosts Andrew Schultz and Akaash Singh.\"The problem with 'Tampon Tim' is it's hard to say,\" the former president said about his nickname for Democratic vice presidential candidate and Governor Tim Walz. Trump added that there are others that can be difficult for him to say, like his nickname for Harris, \"Comrade Kamala.\"In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump has made a detour from the battleground states, stopping in places like Colorado to campaign. He is scheduled to hold rallies at Madison Square Garden in New York City and in Coachella, California, later this month.","summary":"The former president bit his tongue, making no mention of the criticisms lobbied against him by a Democratic heavyweight.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-colorado-rally-unexpected-1967960","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493901/donald-trump-colorado-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:44:41","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":259389854,"title":"Trump promises to ‘renegotiate’ USMCA treaty if elected","text":"Donald Trump appears determined to not just review but also renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026 if he returns to the White House next year.\n\nIn an address at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday, the former U.S. president and Republican Party presidential candidate said that “upon taking office,” he will “formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provisions of the USMCA that I put in.”\n\nThe USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 2020, has a clause that stipulates that a joint review of the free trade pact will take place on the sixth anniversary of its entry into force. Thus the review will commence on July 1, 2026.\n\nAccording to an article published earlier this year by Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, “the conversations” between Mexican, U.S. and Canadian officials “could involve anything from minor tweaks to threats of withdrawal unless major changes are made” to the USMCA.\n\n“… If all three parties do not confirm their desire to extend the agreement as part of the six-​year review,” Baker Institute nonresident fellow Simon Lester wrote, “they will meet again in the seventh year, and each year thereafter until the 16th year.”\n\n“If they cannot agree by the 16th year, the agreement terminates,” Lester said.\n\nTrump: ‘I’m going to have a lot of fun’ with the USMCA renegotiation \n\nIn the largest city of the swing state of Michigan, Trump looked back to his 2017-21 presidency — during which the USMCA was negotiated and took effect — as well as forward to what he hopes will be a second term in the White House starting next January.\n\nThe 78-year-old former president said that the review clause in the three-way trade pact “was the hardest thing I had to get” because Mexico and Canada “didn’t want that.”\n\n“I said, ‘Nope, I want to be able to renegotiate in six years, otherwise we’re not making the deal.’ And I got it, and it’s coming due very soon. Oh, I’m going to have a lot of fun,” he said.\n\nTrump said he wanted to protect and grow the automotive industry in the United States, which is particularly important to the economy of Detroit.\n\n“I’ll also seek strong new protections against transshipment, so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products and auto parts into the United States tax free through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains,” he said.\n\n“They smuggle this stuff in. They don’t pay anything. We’re going to have very strong language on that,” Trump said.\n\nLess than four weeks before the U.S. presidential election, the ex-president also repeated his threat to impose tariffs on vehicles made by Chinese automakers in Mexico, a move that would require major changes to the USMCA.\n\n“I will impose whatever tariffs are required — 100%, 200%, 1,000% — they’re not going to sell any cars into the United States with those plants,” Trump said.\n\nThe Republican Party nominee has previously expressed particular concern about Chinese automakers’ plans to open plants in Mexico, but he has also said that he will “put a 100% tariff on every single car coming across the Mexican border.”\n\nSuch a tariff would hit vehicles made in Mexico by U.S. automakers such as General Motors and Ford.\n\nDespite his stated intention to renegotiate the USMCA, Trump said that the agreement was a “great deal” already.\n\n“I terminated NAFTA. That’s a pretty big thing. A lot of people said it would be impossible to do. I got it done, and we have a great deal now,” he said.\n\n“What we have to do is make it much better even, and we’ll be able to do that very shortly,” Trump said.\n\nHarris would also like to make changes to the USMCA \n\nThe Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, pointed out on social media last month that she was “one of only 10 senators to vote against USMCA.”\n\n“I knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers. Many who voted for this deal conditioned their support on a review process, which, as president, I will use,” she wrote in a post to X on Sept. 26.\n\nHarris, who as a senator contended that the USMCA’s environmental provisions were “insufficient,” also said on X on Sept. 26 that “American workers deserve a leader who keeps their promises and stands with workers when it matters.”\n\n“I will bring autoworker jobs back to this country, and create an opportunity economy that strengthens manufacturing, unions, and builds prosperity and security for America’s future,” she wrote.\n\n“… Trusting Donald Trump again is a risk America’s autoworkers cannot afford.”\n\nSheinbaum: The USMCA is ‘indispensable’ \n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum was asked at her Friday morning press conference about the impact a renegotiation of the USMCA with Trump as U.S. president will have on Mexico.\n\nWithout directly responding to that question, Sheinbaum noted that Trump referred “in particular” to products from China “that aren’t reported,” and agreed with the former U.S. president that “there are limitations in the current USMCA.”\n\nThe new president appeared to indicate that her government is prepared to review and renegotiate the trade pact with the U.S. government no matter who wins the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“Whoever wins, whether it’s President Trump or Vice President Kamala, we’re going to come to an agreement,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… They’re campaigning now obviously so there is greater stridency in one sense or another, but they know and we know that the agreement is indispensable,” she said.\n\nKimberly Clausing, an economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Canadian media outlet Global News that while Trump and Harris are talking tough about the USMCA during the campaign period, they might think twice about their proposals if they actually become the next U.S. president.\n\nShe questioned why they would want to make changes to “an agreement that’s basically working.”\n\nSheinbaum noted that the economies of Mexico, the United States and Canada are highly integrated, and asserted that the three countries don’t compete with each other but rather complement each other.\n\nShe pointed out that data recently showed that the value of Mexico’s exports to the United States reached a record high in the first eight months of 2024.\n\n“So the United States depends a lot on Mexico, we’re the main exporter [to the U.S.],” Sheinbaum said.\n\nEarlier this week, the head of the president’s business advisory council, Altagracia Gómez Sierra, said that Mexico is “prepared” for the 2026 USMCA review.\n\nTrudeau: ‘We’ve been here before’\n\nAt a press conference in Laos, where he attended the ASEAN Summit, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked about Trump’s USMCA remarks in Detroit as well as Harris’s plan to “renegotiate the agreement.”\n\n“We’ve been here before. We know that there is a certain amount of protectionist sentiment in the United States right now and indeed in the world,” Trudeau said.\n\nHe said that in previous trade negotiations his government had stood up for Canadian jobs and demonstrated “how integrated” the Canadian and U.S. economies are.\n\n“And we are ready to do it again if necessary,” Trudeau said.\n\nWith reports from CTV News, Washington Examiner, Global News, El Financiero and Milenio","summary":"As the U.S. presidential election nears, both Harris and Trump have criticized the treaty that governs trade between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\nThe post Trump promises to &#8216;renegotiate&#8217; USMCA treaty if elected appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/trump-renegotiate-usmca-treaty-if-elected/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:42:05","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":259385706,"title":"Church That Worships With AR-15 Is Giving Away Trump Rifle","text":"There have been two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump this election cycle, but that is not stopping the Rod of Iron Ministries from holding a raffle for a Trump-themed AR-15 at its annual Freedom Festival this weekend.People are encouraged to register early for the Freedom Festival to receive free tickets and the chance to win a \"Trump AR-15.\"The festival is put on by the Rod of Iron Ministries, a group headquartered outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania, that allows its congregants to bring their weapons to church.

Flynn, with Oklahoma entrepreneur Clay Clark, launched the ReAwaken America Tour, a far-right and Christian nationalist movement, and has been a leader in peddling claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.The rest of the Freedom Festival weekend features an art show, a session with Tom Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a talk by the author of STEALTH: Kamala Harris' Communist Roots, as well as a gun auction with proceeds benefiting the Friends of the NRA.A shooting range will also be an \"ongoing activity\" throughout Saturday and Sunday by the Kahr Firearms Group.Gun control does not rank as a top issue in an election mostly focused on the economy, despite several high-profile instances of gun violence this year that have come amid the presidential contest.The most shocking was on July 13, when Trump was grazed by a would-be assassin's bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. An AR-15 was used by Thomas Matthew Crooks to shoot the former president, striking his ear and killing one crowd member.On September 4, two students and two teachers were fatally shot by a student at Apalachee High School near Winder, Georgia.Two weeks ago, another would-be assassin hid in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, as the former president played. A Secret Service agent noticed the suspect before he was able to take a shot, possibly saving Trump's life again.As of March 2023, one in 20 Americans owned an AR-15, which was about 16 million people nationwide, according to research from The Washington Post and Ipsos.The Pew Research Center's June election polling showed voters \"have starkly different opinions\" about gun ownership, with 80 percent of President Joe Biden supporters saying it is important to control gun ownership. As almost identical inversion, 85 percent of Trump supporters had said it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns.On Wednesday, the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online surveys taken on September 26 and between September 29 and 30 found that 51 percent of likely voters believe the country needs stricter gun control laws.Earlier this week, Trump during a rally in Wisconsin called on gun owners to vote for him, saying that despite his endorsement from the National Rifle Association in May, gun owners don't \"vote much.\"A website lists a weapon, titled \"The MAGA Patriot AR 15,\" as an \"extremely limited, custom-designed, commemorative AR-15 designed to 'Trump' every other rifle available.\"The website states that behind the initiative is Caleb Lee, the founder of a shooting training center and \"boutique gun manufacturing firm\" in Alabama. The first 20 MAGA Patriot guns cost $2,997 each, and, according to the website, they come with six bonus gifts, including 30-round Magpul magazines, a \"covert\" rifle carrying soft case, a rifle training course at Lee's firing school and more.","summary":"Rod of Iron Ministries is hosting its annual Freedom Festival this weekend in Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-ar-15-rifles-freedom-festival-rod-iron-1967946","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493861/ar-15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:37:34","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.164},{"id":259385702,"title":"Donald Trump, Kamala Harris Odds of Winning in Every Major Poll This Week","text":"As the 2024 presidential race enters its final stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain locked in a tight contest, with recent polling reflecting a highly competitive landscape.With the election just weeks away, each campaign has adopted different strategies to sway voters in these critical regions. Harris' team has significantly ramped up its media presence, investing heavily in digital and TV ads across key battleground states while conducting solo interviews on mainstream media.Meanwhile, Trump has scheduled rallies in solidly Democratic states where he has virtually no chance of winning. It's an unorthodox strategy that campaign advisers say is designed to focus on areas where Democratic policies have failed, with the purpose of attracting media coverage.Here's how they performed in major polls this week.Ipsos/Reuters Poll (October 4-7)An Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted from October 4 to 7 among 969 likely voters shows Harris with a 3-point lead over Trump, holding 46 percent support compared to Trump's 43 percent.Trump trailed 6 points in a similar Ipsos poll from September 20 to 23. The improvement suggests the race is tightening as he seeks to make inroads with key voter groups.YouGov/Economist Poll (October 6-7)A YouGov/Economist poll conducted between October 6 and 7 with 1,230 likely voters places Harris 4 points ahead, with 49 percent support compared to Trump's 45 percent. Harris's support has increased slightly by one percentage point from the previous YouGov survey. Trump's numbers remained steady at 45 percent, reflecting consistent backing from his base but struggles in reaching beyond it.The New York Times/Siena College Poll (September 29 - October 6)A survey by The New York Times/Siena College, conducted from September 29 to October 6 among 3,385 likely voters, shows Harris leading by 3 points, with 49 percent support against Trump's 46 percent. This is a positive shift for Harris compared to a mid-September poll that had the two candidates tied at 47 percent. This survey is often considered one of the more reliable indicators of national sentiment, highlighting evolving voter dynamics.Pew Research Center Poll (September 30 - October 6)The Pew Research Center poll, conducted from September 30 to October 6 with 4,025 registered voters, shows a closer race, with Harris at 48 percent and Trump at 47 percent. This represents a shift from an earlier Pew poll in late August and early September, where both candidates were tied at 49 percent. The change suggests that Harris has made gains among some undecided voters as the campaign enters its final phase.Despite trailing in every poll, this week brought encouraging signs for Trump. He received a boost from pollster Nate Silver, who suggested that the former president should feel more optimistic about the race.Silver's analysis showed that Trump was gaining slight ground against Harris. His Silver Bulletin presidential model, which tracks polling data and electoral trends, shifted 0.3 percentage points in favor of Trump over the past week, signaling a more competitive race as the campaigns head into the final stretch.The updated forecast reflects small but significant gains for Trump in key swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These states, pivotal to Trump's 2016 win and his loss in 2020, are once again likely to determine the outcome of the presidential election.","summary":"As the 2024 race enters the final stretch, polls show a tight contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-odds-winning-every-major-poll-this-week-1967968","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493907/kamala-harris-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:35:37","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":259386436,"title":"Harris was asked to name three of Trump’s ‘virtues’. She couldn’t","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris could not come up with three virtues about former president Donald Trump when she was asked to do so on Thursday evening at a Univision town hall event.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee laughed upon hearing the question, posed by an audience member, and immediately shared a negative trait about Trump that she does not like.\n\n“Let me start with this, based on a life experience I know that a vast majority of us have much more in common than what separates us and part of what paints me is the approach that, frankly, Donald Trump and some others have taken – which is to suggest that it’s us vs. them, whoever that may be,” Harris said.\n\nThe vice president condemned Trump for promoting a fearful mindset in Americans and encouraging people to “point fingers at each other.”\n\n“Using language that’s about belittling people and calling them names and meant to make them afraid and live in fear. I don’t think that’s healthy for our nation and I don’t admire that,” Harris said.\n\nTrump has been subject to criticisms lately about using degrading language to describe his opponents. He recently called Harris “a dumb person” and “mentally disabled” at rallies and has mocked her appearance to supporters.\n\nHe uses aggressive anti-immigration language while speaking about migrants and immigrants, calling them “illegals” and falsely claiming most of them are committing violent crimes.\n\nThe vice president then re-directed her attention to answering the question about Trump’s virtues, stumbling over words while trying to find an answer.\n\n“I think Donald Trump loves his family,” Harris said. “I think that’s very important. I think family is one of the most important things we can prioritize.”\n\nBut the vice president admitted she couldn’t offer a better answer because she doesn’t “really know” Trump – the first time the two met in person was on the debate stage back in September.\n\nIt has been a fraught election cycle, with Trump using incendiary language against fellow Republicans before he secured the nomination, before using equally inflammatory language to describe Joe Biden and Harris.\n\nRepublicans have urged Trump to stay on message and keep his attacks focused on Democrats’ policies rather than individual’s personality or appearance but the former president has so far struggled to do so.\n\nHarris has used Trump’s own words against himself when trying to appeal to voters. On Thursday evening she told audience members at the Univision town hall that Trump would be a dictator on day one – a reference to one of the former president’s quotes.\n\nThe town hall was part of Harris’s last-ditch efforts to woo Latino voters – who have historically voted Democrat but more recently flipped to support Trump.","summary":"Approaching the end of a contentious election year, Harris struggled to find positive qualities in here political opponent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-univision-trump-virtues-b2628086.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/11/21/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FTgOHb39-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:35:02","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":259385330,"title":"Kamala Harris Vogue Cover Sparks Divide","text":"Full Digital Access \n 12 MONTH PLAN* \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Full Digital Access \n 12 MONTH PLAN* \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $5/WEEK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $5/WEEK\n \n \n for 12 months $20 charged every 4 weeks (min. cost $260).

With Trump declining to do another debate, there are no more major events that can capture a mass audience.\n\n“She has to break through the news silos in these final weeks, that’s how to get to the undecideds,” notes a veteran Democratic political operative of the estimated less than 10% of voters who haven’t locked in a candidate yet. “The network interviews, podcasts, all that stuff is good, but it’s the unexpected situations, like calling into The Weather Channel, drinking a beer with Colbert, that’s the takeaway.”\n\nHarris’ schedule was a weave between mainstream media and more apolitical avenues.\n\nMathew Littman, a former Biden speechwriter who leads a group of creative professionals engaged in Democratic politics called The Working Group, said Harris’ visit to the Call Her Daddy podcast and her sit-down with Howard Stern are what the campaign should be doing. \n\n“There is a strategy to this stuff,” he said. “These complaints from old media [that Harris is not engaging with them] are absolutely ridiculous.” It reflects where the voters she needs to reach are now, he said.\n\n“Not only do I think it is a good idea, we should have been doing it a long time ago,” he said. \n\nHe noted that Trump has done few challenging traditional media interviews. His appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists is one of the few. “Has he done anything where no one asks him a difficult question? The truth is you don’t have to anymore,” he said. The point is to reach voters who may not be paying attention or are still persuadable.\n\nThe Call Her Daddy podcast, for instance, is the second biggest podcast on Spotify and, according to Edison Research, has an audience where 76% are under 35. Host Alex Cooper also has said that her listeners are politically diverse. What’s more, Cooper has a social media presence that amplified Harris’ appearance, including a behind-the-scenes post on TikTok.\n\n“The Stern interview was the highlight, it felt very natural,” stated a regular deep-pocket Democratic donor of the VP’s media tour and the hour-plus chat with Stern, who is openly anti-Trump. “But it’s still a process,” he added of Harris’ effort to reach the pockets of undecideds she needs in early voting and on Election Day.\n\n“Maybe a Taylor Swift rally with [Bruce] Springsteen there could cross over, some social media event, whatever it is, she needs an October surprise that grabs persuadable voters,” a media executive tells Deadline, noting two of the VP’s biggest celebrity endorsements.\n\nAdditionally, in the Harris campaign’s pursuit of non-legacy media, it has become evident in tone, language and outcome that this is a different type of election in terms of standards of conduct and association. “She had guts to do Stern, who the very next day did a Cocktober gay-themed bit, and Call Her Daddy, which is so raunchy,” said a longtime media and political consultant. “We are past the days of backlash on that stuff.”\n\nAdditionally, as Deadline exclusively reported, Harris’ VP nominee Gov. Tim Walz taped a session on Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett’s bromance Smartless podcast that is scheduled to post in the next week or so. He’s also scheduled to appear on Fox News Sunday this weekend, for a second week in a row.\n\nTo that end, a Hollywood insider believes that Trump “failed this week” as a guest on the comedy podcast Flagrant and by insulting Motor City at the Detroit Economic Club. Still, despite the media action, the VP’s poll numbers haven’t moved nationally, and some battleground states are seeing Trump’s numbers go up.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on the media stops of the former president and Harris.\n\nTrump has tried to mute the impact of Harris’ appearances. He declined to sit down with 60 Minutes, but after Harris’ interview ran Monday night, he went on a tear over an edit that the newsmagazine made to one of her answers. Newsmagazines routinely edit interviews, but Trump has claimed they were trying to help Harris and, mirroring his past attacks on the press, he has called for CBS to lose its broadcast license over it.\n\nRELATED: FCC Chairwoman Condemns Donald Trump’s Calls For CBS To Lose Licenses Over ‘60 Minutes’ Kamala Harris Interview\n\nLater in the week, after Harris’ Univision town hall, Trump’s allies quickly spread the false claim that she had the aid of a Teleprompter. Univision’s Acevedo debunked the claim shortly after the town hall aired, but it continued to be repeated by figures like Vivek Ramaswamy and news outlets like Newsmax.\n\nHighlighted by a scheduled appearance in Detroit next week with the perpetually blunt radio host Charlamagne tha God, Harris will continue her schedule of media hits. An October 23 town hall on CNN with Anderson Cooper in Pennsylvania — in lieu of a now-dead debate with Trump — is also on the calendar.\n\nAs Harris has ramped up her media after taking criticism for a paucity of interviews, her campaign has pointed out that Trump has been largely choosing friendly outlets. “After backing out of 60 Minutes and doing 27 straight interviews with conservative media, unfortunately it is clear Trump would rather cocoon himself in safe spaces and avoid real questions about his harmful plans and failed divisive leadership,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement Thursday.\n\nTrump has yet to agree to his own CNN town hall, but will do a pre-taped Fox News town hall in Georgia on October 15 with Harris Faulkner and an all-female audience.\n\nStill, some political veterans say no matter how well funded and strong the Harris campaign is, the VP needs to go into the lion’s den in the final days of the race to snag the voters she needs, energize male voters on the fence, and slap down Trump in front of his MAGA base.\n\n“If she really wanted to show she’s fearless and ready to go, she’d go on Fox with Bret Baier one on one and maybe even Megyn Kelly,” says a Democratic insider, adding that HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher could be another good raid into more conservative and male-centric territory.\n\n“In an election this close, that’s how you win, surprise attack and direct interactions with voters, like on that Univision town hall,” a media executive exclaims. “Harris has to upset the table to win the game.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris’ media whirlwind of the past few days may not move&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vice President Kamala Harris Explores New Ground in Media Visits, Potentially Leading to a Major Revelation in October first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/vice-president-kamala-harris-explores-new-ground-in-media-visits-potentially-leading-to-a-major-revelation-in-october/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Charlamagne-Tha-God-Harris-Faulkner-Donald-Trump-1.jpg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:31:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":259390044,"title":"Jake Tapper Wrote ‘Holy Smokes’ to Control Room During Biden’s Awful Debate: ‘Something to Behold’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Jake Tapper revealed his response to President Joe Biden’s first and only debate against GOP presidential contender Donald Trump: “Holy smokes.”\n\n“It was something to behold,” Tapper, who moderated the June 27 debate, told Seth Meyers. The CNN anchor explained his visceral reaction that night during an appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”\n\n“We had these little iPads in front, so we could communicate with the control room. And yeah, within the first few moments I wrote, ‘Holy smokes,’” Tapper shared. As Meyers threw him a wry look following Tapper’s clean language, the journalist replied, “I didn’t know who was going to be back in the control room. I had to keep it clean.”\n\nBut as far as his shock, Tapper didn’t think he was alone in feeling that way: “That was kind of the national reaction.”\n\nAs Tapper said, many Americans — including Biden’s own political party — were taken aback by his performance. After a series of attacks against Biden’s age, some public flubs and concerns from Americans about Biden’s mental capability, the president ended up stepping down from the 2024 presidential race, passing the baton to Kamala Harris to cross the finish line.\n\nMeyers and Tapper moved on to discuss how Trump and Harris are currently doing in the polls, saying it’s a tight race that may remain within the margin of error up through Election Day.\n\n“They’re both running campaigns as if they are 10 points ahead. They’re both kind of running cautious-ish campaigns. I mean, there’s still the ‘cats and dogs eating’ thing,” Tapper said, referring to the debunked claims that Haitian migrants are eating Ohioans’ domesticated pets.\n\n“I guest I’m distinguishing between the campaign and the candidate. The campaign is relatively cautious. The candidate is, you know… he’s doing his thing,” the cable news journalist added of Trump.\n\nHarris battled it out with Trump on Sept. 10, reinvigorating Democrats’ hopes to keep the party in the White House. Since then, Harris has challenged Trump to a second debate. However, so far, Trump has refused to step back up to the podium for another round — which Harris recently called “a pretty weak move.”\n\n“I think it’s a disservice to the voters. I also think, it’s a pretty weak move,” Harris said at a rally in Chandler, Ariz. on Thursday. “But even if he will not debate, the contrast in this election is already clear. This election is about two very different visions… for our nation. One, his, focused on the past. The other, ours, focused on the future.”","summary":"“That was kind of the national reaction,” the CNN anchor who moderated the president’s confrontation with Trump tells Seth Meyers\n\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Wrote &#8216;Holy Smokes&#8217; to Control Room During Biden&#8217;s Awful Debate: &#8216;Something to Behold&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jake-tapper-joe-biden-donald-trump-debate-seth-meyers/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rump-12-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:31:09","author":"Raquel 'rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":259389362,"title":"Wendell Pierce Criticizes Barack Obama’s Message To Black Men Who Are Reluctant To Vote For Kamala Harris","text":"Wendell Pierce attends the Gotham Week Honors at Brooklyn Navy Yard on October 2, 2024, in Brooklyn, New York. | Source: Dominik Bindl / Getty Actor Wendell Pierce on Thursday offered pointed criticism in response to remarks made by former President Barack Obama during a surprise stop at a Pittsburgh campaign field office where Obama addressed the topic of Black men who are reluctant or unwilling to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s no secret that some polls have shown that Donald Trump, in the last year or so, has gained marginal support among Black people, mostly Black men, which is why Obama took the time to “speak some truths” on the matter. Before we get into Pierce’s response, here’s a quick recap of what all Obama said, via NPR: “My understanding, based on reports I’m getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,” he said. “That lack of enthusiasm for Harris,” he said, “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.” He chided voters who were voting for Trump or not casting a vote at all. “And you are thinking about sitting out?” he said. “Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” Obama said, “women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time.” “When we get in trouble and the system isn’t working for us, they’re the ones out there marching and protesting,” he said. Now, here’s how Pierce responded: “Awful message,” The Wire actor tweeted. “The party has to stop scapegoating Black men. Black men aren’t the problem. White men and White women are. No other group votes at 87-90% for Dems but Black folk. Men and women. That is a false flag. Black men voting for Trump is insignificant. This accusatorial tone will make some Black men stay home-which is worse. Black men are questioning our party to find out what their loyalty for decades earns them. That’s good. That’s healthy. Democrats have the record to stand on and should embrace the challenge. But after touring this country specifically engaging Black men, I will not let my party leaders speak [condescendingly] towards them.” So, for the most part, Pierce is right. The thing Obama appears to be missing is that when it comes to Black voter turnout, his elections, especially in 2012, have been the outliers. Ninety-three percent of Black voters voted for Obama in 2008 and that number rose to 95% in 2012. In fact, 2012 represents the only year when Black voter turnout was higher than white voter turnout per capita. In 2008 and 2012, Black voter turnout was the highest it had been since 1964, and it hasn’t been that high in the two elections since. Furthermore, in 2020, only 87% of Black voters voted for Joe Biden. In 2000, 90% of Black voters voted for Al Gore over George W. Bush, and that number dropped to 88% in 2004, when Bush beat John Kerry. In all cases, Black women voted Democrat at higher percentages than Black men. For example, 96% of Black women vs. 87% of Black men voted for Obama in 2012, and that bridge between Black women and men was similar in 2016 and 2020. But, really, none of this matters, because, when it comes down to it, what Pierce pointed out leads to the more relevant question: Why are we even talking about how Black men vote when the overwhelming majority of them still vote Democrat, and will still vote that way in November? Let’s say, for the sake of argument, 20% of Black men vote for Trump in November. That would still mean 80% voted for Harris, which means, just like in every election for the past few decades at least, more Black men will vote Democrat than men in any other racial group — by a lot. Notably, that’s an extremely generous hypothetical. Regardless of the slight uptick in Black Trump support, Black men are still an overwhelmingly Democratic base, and that is not likely to change any time soon. From the Philadelphia Inquirer: But despite his campaign’s outreach, any narrative that suggests Harris might lose out on support from young Black men ignores the data. Black people under 50 are virtually no more likely to vote Republican in 2024 than they were 30 years ago, said Kiana Cox, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. In 1994, 16% of Black voters younger than 50 leaned Republican. Today, said Cox, that number is 17%. An AP-NORC poll conducted in mid-September found most Black voters of all ages and genders viewed Trump negatively, with only 15% reporting a somewhat or very favorable view of him — a slim percentage in line with the Republican preference seen among Black voters over the last 30 years. Political experts and organizers — who are also Black men under 50 — said the hysteria about their demographic defecting to the Republican Party is at best overblown and, at worst, an attempt to cast blame on Black men in the event Harris loses to Trump. No poll has shown such a significant increase in Black support for Trump that it would even come close to being the reason the election swings his way. As Pierce noted, if that’s the way it shakes out next month, we will largely have white voters to thank as they will be what they have been for decades — the only majority racial demographic that votes Republican. White people have voted overwhelmingly for Trump two elections in a row, and they will for a third time in November. There’s so much media scrutiny when it comes to minority voters, while the GOP’s most loyal voter base largely goes un-examined. Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean Obama should have focused his attention on white people. I’m not even sure what the point would have been for him to try appealing to the same demographic that pressured him to show two forms of his birth certificate to prove he was eligible to be president after he was elected. Obama appeared to be going for a “Black man to Black man” approach, which is arguably understandable. But when Black people — men and women — are the most loyal voting bloc for a party that never really has to work very hard to earn our votes apart from being demonstrably less racist than the other side, it just seems kind of arbitrary.

Measured from a year earlier, the index rose 1.8% in September, the smallest such rise since February and down from a 1.9% year-over-year increase in August.\n\nExcluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.2% from August and 2.8% from a year earlier, up from the previous month’s 2.6% increase.\n\nThe wholesale prices of services rose modestly but were offset by a drop in the price of goods, including a 5.6% August-to-September decline in the wholesale price of gasoline.\n\nThe wholesale inflation data arrived one day after the government said consumer prices rose just 2.4% in September from 12 months earlier – the mildest year-over-year rise since February 2021. That was barely above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and far below inflation’s four-decade high of 9.1% in mid-2022. Still, with the presidential election less than a month away, many Americans remain unhappy with consumer prices, which remain well above where they were before the inflationary surge began in 2021.\n\nThe steady easing of inflation might be diminishing former President Donald Trump’s political advantage on the economy. In some surveys, Vice President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who would best handle the economy. Yet most voters still give the economy relatively poor marks, mostly because of the cumulative price increases of the past three years.\n\nThe producer price index released Friday can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge – the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.\n\nIn a commentary, economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote that Friday’s producer price report suggested that the September PCE inflation index would rise 0.2% from August, up from a 0.1% increase the month before.\n\nAshworth noted that that would be “a little hotter than we’ve seen in recent months” and added, “We still expect underlying price inflation to continue moderating back to (the Fed’s) target by early next year, but the risks to that view are no longer skewed to the downside.”\n\nInflation began surging in 2021 as the economy accelerated with surprising speed out of the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to a 23-year high. The resulting much higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the United States into recession, but they didn’t. The economy kept growing, and employers kept hiring. And inflation has kept slowing.\n\nLast month, the Fed all but declared victory over inflation and slashed its benchmark interest rate by an unusually steep half-percentage point, its first rate cut since March 2020, when the pandemic was hammering the economy. Two more rate cuts are expected this year and four in 2025.","summary":"It's another sign that inflation is returning to something close to normal after years of pressuring America’s households in the wake of COVID-19.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/11/wholesale-inflation-remained-cool-last-month-in-latest-sign-that-price-pressures-are-slowing/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/10/Producer_Prices_35892_97b9f7.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:29:06","author":"Paul Wiseman,PAUL WISEMAN - Associated Press","authors":["Paul Wiseman","PAUL WISEMAN - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":259384790,"title":"Why Nevada Latinos Are Losing Faith in Government","text":"A Struggling Economy\n\nNo other issue is as important in Las Vegas as the economy: Spend a few minutes with any voter and they will tell you about the price of groceries or gas or rent or electricity — or all of the above.\n\nWorking-class voters are especially concerned about the cost of housing, with renters struggling to keep up with their monthly payments and increasingly seeing homeownership as out of reach.\n\nLivier Maxwell, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mother, moved from San Diego to Las Vegas more than a decade ago largely because she believed that the economic opportunities would be better.

Crime is down. Factories are opening up. But those guys, all they know about manufacturing is manufacturing bullshit,\" he added.The crowd greeted the vice-presidential candidate's remarks with cheers, and the speech quickly went viral on social media. Supporters praised his direct approach and criticism of Trump's policies, with the video widely circulating on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.This speech is the latest in a series of attacks from both Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris against Trump's record on manufacturing—a central theme of the former president's re-election campaign. Their criticisms come at a pivotal moment, as recent polling data shows Trump gaining ground in Michigan, a crucial part of the Democrats' \"Blue Wall\" in the upper Midwest.Trump's growing support in Michigan is particularly concerning for Democrats, as he has made gains among blue-collar voters and those in the lower-middle and middle-class demographics. The race remains close in other Rust Belt states, such as Pennsylvania, where Harris faces similar challenges with working-class voters.What was once considered Harris' most straightforward path to the presidency—winning the \"Blue Wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, alongside Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District—has become increasingly difficult. Recent polling shows her slipping behind in Michigan and Wisconsin, raising concerns about her ability to connect with key voter groups.Harris' struggle to resonate with blue-collar workers could become a major obstacle for her campaign. With both Michigan and Pennsylvania known for their unpredictable voting patterns, any loss of support in these critical states could significantly impact the outcome of the 2024 race.Securing the \"Blue Wall\" was initially seen as Harris' clearest route to victory, especially given earlier polling that showed her with narrow but steady leads in these states. Historically, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have aligned in their voting patterns since 1988, when Wisconsin supported Michael Dukakis while Michigan and Pennsylvania favored George H.W. Bush.However, new polling indicates that Trump's campaign is building momentum in these battlegrounds, transforming what was already a competitive race into an even more intense contest.","summary":"Walz criticized former President Donald Trump's recent comments about the Midwest, particularly his views on manufacturing and cities like Detroit.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-tim-walz-trump-takes-off-online-1967849","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493720/walz-michigan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:25:32","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.319},{"id":259386214,"title":"Hot-air balloon strikes and collapses radio tower in Albuquerque during festival","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories\n\n Bloc won't hold Liberals 'hostage' over seniors' benefits: cabinet minister\n\n Liberal cabinet minister Steven Guilbeault says the Liberals will not be 'held hostage' by the Bloc Quebecois' demand to expand Old Age Security to more seniors.\n\n Police identify Toronto victim of alleged serial killer\n\n Toronto police have identified the woman who was allegedly killed by a suspected serial killer earlier this month.\n\n Missing father, kids spotted in New Zealand wilderness 3 years after disappearance: police\n\n A New Zealand man who disappeared with his three children in 2021 was spotted on a farm along the country's northwest coast, police say.\n\n No jail time for man who fatally stabbed senior in Vancouver\n\n A man who stabbed a senior to death in Vancouver's Biltmore Hotel building in 2020 has been given a conditional sentence for the killing, meaning he will not serve any jail time if he remains on good behaviour in the community.\n\n Boeing to cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global workforce\n\n U.S. planemaker Boeing will cut 17,000 jobs, or 10 per cent of its global workforce, delay first delivery of its 777X jet by a year and announced substantial new losses in its defence business as a month-long strike batters company finances, CEO Kelly Ortberg said on Friday.\n\n Trump says he'll renegotiate North America's trade deals.

Catholics React","text":"Catholics were incensed this week to see a new viral video featuring Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offering podcaster Liz Plank a Dorito on her tongue. Plank is seen kneeling in front of Whitmer with her tongue out as a nacho-cheese chip is placed on top. After closing her mouth, the YouTube star seems to beam piously as the camera pans to Whitmer in a deadpan wearing a camouflage Harris/Walz baseball cap. \n\nAt first glance, the video posted Oct. 10 appears sacrilegous. In what other setting does anyone kneel in front of someone to receive something on one’s tongue? None. There is no comparison. \n\nThe caption that goes along with the shocking video talks about the CHIPS and Science Act from 2022, signed by President Joe Biden, which provides money to the domestic semiconductor industry: \n\nIf he won’t, Gretchen Whitmer will. \n\nChips aren’t just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for U.S. tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk. \n\nHowever, online chatter attempts to correlate the video with a viral trend on social media where users feed a bite of food to someone and then slowly look blankly into the camera. Typically this happens at a table with a spoon, not kneeling in an act of reverence. Usually these videos show a spouse sitting across the table or a baby in a high chair. \n\nSome Catholics have been defending the clip in this way, but the majority are not. Bill Donohue of the Catholic League was one of the first to condemn the video, going so far as to say the governor has committed “political suicide.” \n\n“What Whitmer did was to deride Holy Communion,” Donohue states flatly. “There is no wiggle room for her to deny the obvious.” \n\nAshley McGuire of The Catholic Association agrees with Donohue’s assessment, telling the Register: \n\n“Gretchen Whitmer's mockery of Catholics is unsurprising in that she represents a political party that has shown nothing but animosity towards our faith. At the top of the Democratic ticket, after all, is Kamala Harris, who is openly bigoted toward Catholics.” \n\n“Anti-Catholic bigotry as displayed by open mockery is an insidious trend by the cultural elites, whether it's the Olympic committee mocking the Last Supper, the L.A. Dodgers mocking Catholic nuns, or the Democratic governor of Michigan mocking Communion. Their mockery is just thinly veiled bigotry, and there is nothing funny about hate,” McGuire added. \n\nCatholic author Tim Carney doesn’t think there is anything but mockery to be found in the clip, sharing on his X social-media account: “I’m ready to believe this is intentional mockery of the Blessed Sacrament because Whitmer’s AG is unabashed in her disdain for the Catholic Church.” \n\nRaymond Arroyo of EWTN’s The World Over was also quick to point out the abhorrent video clip on social media, writing: “Whatever Gov. Whitmer imagined she was doing here was wrong on nearly every level. Lampooning sacraments is not likely to win over Catholic voters … [o]r any other voting block.” \n\nTo date, Whitmer has not addressed the criticism of her video. \n\nThe governor and Plank were together filming an episode of Plank’s YouTube series, Chip Chat. \n\nIn the opening sequence of the episode, entitled, “Gretchen Whitmer Wants To Meet Her Kidnappers,” the former MSNBC columnist asks Whitmer about her children:\n\n“Okay, and you have two daughters. When they come back and they leave their cups lying around, do you ever think about getting a post-birth abortion?” \n\nWhitmer leans in, laughing, before thanking her for the question. “Thank you for raising that because there’s no such thing.”","summary":"blog","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/blog/is-gretchen-whitmer-mocking-catholics","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20241011161016_3f8e46dd5f4fd03c28c522c998ad198fe7881462be2299268a09c2885e943e79.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:17:47","author":"Alyssa Murphy","authors":["Alyssa Murphy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":259384008,"title":"Kamala Harris Vogue Cover Sparks Divide","text":"Full Digital Access \n 12 MONTH PLAN* \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Full Digital Access \n 12 MONTH PLAN* \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $5/WEEK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $5/WEEK\n \n \n for 12 months $20 charged every 4 weeks (min. cost $260).

He stressed the administration's focus on restoring power and clearing debris in affected states, jokingly calling Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm his \"boss\" and referring to vice president Kamala Harris as \"the president.\"During the briefing, Biden acknowledged the severe toll the hurricanes have taken on states such as North Carolina and Florida. \"Our hearts go out to all those folks who've lost not only personal property, but their homes and some lost lives and are grieving after the aftermath of the tornadoes, brutal wind, record downpours and historic flooding,\" he said, as quoted by Fox News. Hurricane Milton has caused an estimated $50 billion in damages, while North Carolina officials confirmed at least 92 fatalities from Hurricane Helene. In Florida, eight people were reported dead after Milton spawned four tornadoes in St Lucie County, with millions of residents still without power.Biden praised the efforts by Florida governor Ron DeSantis, which enabled 50,000 power line workers to restore electricity to 1 million customers. The president assured that the federal government, through FEMA, the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Guard, is fully engaged in rescue and recovery efforts.During his speech, Biden paused briefly before Granholm reminded him to pass the microphone to the vice president. He grabbed Granholm's hand and said, \"She's my boss here,\" before jokingly correcting himself when he referred to Harris as \"the president.\"Before giving the floor to Harris, Biden confirmed his administration would seek additional funding from Congress for hurricane recovery. \"We're going to need a lot of help. We need a lot more money,\" he said.Vice President Harris, speaking via teleconference, outlined the federal efforts to deliver food, water, medical supplies, and generators to affected areas. She also mentioned her talks with Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about preventing price-gouging in disaster zones.\"We continue to coordinate resources with local and state authorities, including food, water, medical supplies and generators,\" Harris said, assuring that the administration would \"work with teams on the ground to restore water and power as quickly as possible in the coming days and weeks.\"Harris added, \"President Biden and I will make sure that the communities that are there on the ground and have been affected will have the resources they need not only to respond to the storm, but also to recover.\"Harris's comments come amid tension with governor DeSantis, who refused her call about the hurricane response, saying she had \"no role\" in the process.\"We are in this for the long haul,\" she said, reaffirming the administration’s dedication to recovery efforts in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.","summary":"President Joe Biden provided an update on the federal response to recent hurricanes affecting North Carolina and Florida, highlighting efforts in power restoration and debris removal.

The invasion will be stopped. The migrant flights will end and Kamala's app for illegals will be shut down immediately, within 24 hours,\" he promised to do on his first day in office.The app Trump referred to was CBP One, which was initially started during his presidency for truck drivers crossing the border before being expanded in 2023 to allow migrants to apply for appointments with the Border Patrol.Newsweek reached out via email to the Harris campaign for comment Friday afternoon.Aurora and Tren de Aragua GangAurora gained national attention after a video showing violent Venezuelan gang members at an apartment complex went viral. News then spread of difficulties multiple buildings were having in the city.Aurora's Republican mayor, Mike Coffman, previously told Newsweek that while he had concerns about the southwest border, the claims about migrants in his city had been given \"exaggerated importance.\" \"I'm not dismissing the concerns at all, but whatever happened initially, happened. What I can tell you now is that the gangs are not in control of either complex,\" the mayor said on September 6.The issue was linked to the notorious Tren de Aragua gang, with some members later identified by Aurora's police department.Close to the Democratic sanctuary city of Denver, Aurora had seen an influx of immigrants in recent years, but it also has a well-established legal Venezuelan community, which Coffman said was being exploited by the gang.\"There is inadequate vetting of people at the border,\" Coffman said previously. \"So it's my understanding that when you do have a concentration of Venezuelan migrants, sometimes, sadly, that criminal element follows and exploits them within their own immigrant communities.\"The issue was picked up by Trump, who claimed that the city had been overrun by violent migrant criminals. He has said this at rallies as well as in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.After not hearing from the Trump campaign, Coffman did not attend the rally Friday.While Aurora was still in the spotlight at the start of September, GOP Congress members, including Lauren Boebert, visited the area to hold a press conference, where they blamed the Biden-Harris administration for the problems. Boebert returned to the city Friday, where she spoke ahead of Trump's appearance.Trump promised in September he would visit both Aurora and Springfield, Ohio, which became the next city of focus for his campaign. There, baseless claims that Haitian migrants were eating pets drew attention and Trump's support.While the campaign decided against visiting Springfield, Trump touted his sold-out rally in Aurora on Friday. Hundreds of supporters were seen lining up outside the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center, which has a capacity of 10,000 people.Trump Promises Mass DeportationsSteven Miller, Trump's senior adviser, spoke ahead of his boss' appearance, pointing to photos of alleged criminal migrants, who he said were not the neighbors those at the rally grew up with.\"Colorado can shock the world and send Donald J. Trump back to the White House. This state is going Republican,\" Miller said, promising a second Trump administration would remove undocumented immigrants from the country.Later, Trump spoke about his strict border policies during his previous term in office and how these had been relaxed by the Biden-Harris administration, before playing montages of news clips referencing migrant crime, including in Aurora.The former president did not appear to differentiate between alleged criminals and organized crime gangs, and those arriving seeking asylum or with legal reasons to be in the U.S.\"January 20, they're going to be out of this country,\" Trump told supporters, later saying: \"Our criminals are like babies compared to these people.\"Trump's promises of mass deportations, mainly focused on undocumented immigrants but also on those with legal status in recent weeks, have been called into question repeatedly by immigrants' rights groups, Democrats and some members of the Republican Party.Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?
