Josh Shapiro a ‘highly overrated Jewish Governor.’ ‘It is Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of “dual loyalty,” said White House Principal Deputy Communications Director Herbie Ziskend in a statement issued to reporters. ‘President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kind,’ he said, in a comment that did not mention Trump specifically or explicitly identify the posting that prompted it. It came after Trump tore into Shapiro for his speech at the Democratic National Convention, while identifying him by his religion and criticizing Harris and claiming she ‘hates’ Israel . ‘The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech talking about freedom and fighting for Comrade Kamala Harris for President, yet she hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail. Judge only by her actions! ‘ ‘Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had. I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will. Comrade Kamala Harris, the Radical Left Marxist who stole the nomination from Crooked Joe, will do even less. Israel is in BIG trouble!’ Trump’s statement tried to stir the pot on a complex and controversial issue after Shapiro did not get into Middle East politics during his convention speech. Instead, he tried to link Harris’ gauzy ‘freedom’ agenda to the nation’s early principles and patriots. ‘“E Pluribus Unum” You recognize this phrase from U.S. coins and the nation’s seal – out of many, one – it’s not merely a motto from the past, it’s our direction for the future. You see, you all give me hope and you all have the power,’ said Shapiro. The charismatic governor who got passed over for Tim Walz after being on Harris’ vice presidential short list , declared in Philadelphia when Harris announced Tim Walz as her running mate, ‘I am proud of my faith.’ Trump blasted out the statement on Truth Social at 12:09 AM, while Democrats were wrapping up Day Three of a convention featuring testimonials by Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton. It has more than 4,000 reposts and 15,000 likes. Asked why Trump identified Shapiro by his faith, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said ‘Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth to appease Hamas sympathizers while Democrats have emboldened antisemitic protests on college campuses. In contrast, President Trump has stood firmly with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, reaching many historic achievements like the Abraham Accords, moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, eliminating Qasem Soleimani, ending the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal, as well as combatting anti-Semitism in America and abroad.’ Trump’s comments came at a convention that has seen clashes and protests on the periphery, but not the major disruptions that organizers have feared. Protesters tried to unfurl a banner on the first day of the convention, and on Tuesday pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with police. The National Lawyers Guild said 72 people were arrested. The convention featured emotional testimony by parents of 23-year old American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Israel. And ‘uncommitted’ delegates complained Wednesday that their request for a Palestinian convention speaker had been denied. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Ronald Syrvud, 66, was apprehended Thursday evening, around seven hours after Cochise County Sheriff’s Office issued a wanted notice for him at about 2:30pm local time. ‘This subject has been taken into custody without incident in Cochise County. We appreciate all of the information received and the incredible collaborative efforts with all of our public safety partners,’ the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Police previously said Syvrud has several other warrants out for his arrest on separate charges, including for a DUI and failure to appear in court in Wisconsin, and for failure to register as a sex offender and felony hit and run in Arizona. It comes six weeks after an attempt on Trump’s life saw a bullet hit the former president’s ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Sheriff Mark Dannels had ramped up security in the area around the section of border wall Trump was visiting as the the search went on for Syvrud. Records show that he was a registered Democrat in the past, and owns a long rap sheet dating back to 1990 – including a conviction in 2000 for second degree sexual assault of a child, where he pleaded no contest. The exact nature of the threats is unclear, however Sheriff Dannels told DailyMail.com they were received ‘off social media.’ ‘We have zero tolerance for any kind of threats or intents of violence, so we’ll find him. He’ll go to jail,’ Dannels said. ‘He’s a registered sex offender here in Cochise County, and we were looking for him. He’s out of compliance as part of his violations. So we’re looking for him on that. ‘We’re going to arrest him on that. But also the fact his pulse was obviously directed toward this event. So we want to talk to him about that.’ As Dannels added that security was being ramped up ahead of the speech, Secret Service snipers could be seen perched on a crane surveying the area.

The planned attempt on Trump’s life was allegedly intended for his trip to the border in Sierra Vista, in a spot where his campaign has already traveled to. Arizona officials said they believe Syvrud is at large in the border region, and are urgently attempting to locate him ahead of Trump’s visit. Ahead of his trip to the area, Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday that he would be addressing ‘the plague of migrant crime that so-called Border Czar, comrade Kamala Harris has unleashed on America.’ Rather than the Secret Service or any other law enforcement it fell to Dailymail.com to inform Trump that the widely publicized manhunt was going on. The Republican nominee delivered a speech on immigration in the desert next to the border and then took questions. DailyMail.com’s correspondent asked him whether he felt he was in danger. Trump admitted he ‘hadn’t heard’ about the threat and said law enforcement probably ‘wanted to keep it’ from him. With a chuckle he said: ‘Thank you for telling me. Let’s get out of here right now!’ He added: ‘And I have great respect for Secret Service, the job they do, including a month and a half ago, when they were jumping on top of me with bullets flying right at ’em. ‘So, mistakes were made, and they’re going to learn from the mistakes. But I have great respect. But, no, I haven’t heard that, but I’m not that surprised. ‘And the reason is because I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys. So, I have heard, it’s very unsafe to make this trip. There were some people that really didn’t want me to make it.’ It comes nearly six weeks after Trump was nearly assassinated by a 20-year-old in Pennsylvania. Trump turned his head at the vital moment and only ended up with a bloody ear. He was hustled off stage by his Secret Service detail, but not before giving his supporters a clenched fist salute. Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old would-be assassin who shot Donald Trump, opened fire at the former president with an AR-style rifle from a roof 130 yards from the rally stage in Butler, Pennsylvania. A member of the crowd was killed in the deadly shooting, while two others who were wounded are in critical condition. All three are males, according to law enforcement officials. Trump was left bloodied and hurt during the assassination attempt as he was seen to suddenly grab hold of his ear as loud bangs rang out and whizzed by before he ducked to the floor. The Secret Service swarmed around the 45th US President as piercing screams were heard from the MAGA crowd. He then got to his feet with blood pouring down his cheek and raised his fist in the air and defiantly shouted ‘fight’ while the audience shouted ‘USA’ as he was dragged off stage and bundled into a vehicle. Secret Service agents could be heard shouting ‘the shooter is down’ in the ensuing chaos and the gunman was later confirmed dead.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nArizona cops have arrested a man accused of threatening to assassinate Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Significant development in search for Arizona man who threatened to assassinate Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/significant-development-in-search-for-arizona-man-who-threatened-to-assassinate-donald-trump-2/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724367126_rewrite-this-title-Huge-update-in-hunt-for-Arizona-man.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:52:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":254719738,"title":"Kamala Harris backed bail fund’s fails continue with murder, DUI death and arson charges against those it freed","text":"Kamala Harris’ public support for a controversial bail fund continues to haunt her as more examples of crimes committed by those whose release was secured in the name of “social justice” emerge. The Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF) paid bail for an assailant who turned killer a week later, a habitual DUI driver who crashed and killed a passenger after the fund freed him and a serial arsonist who attempted to burn down a mosque. The Vice President had thrown her weight behind the fund in June 2020 during the height of riots over the death of George Floyd, asking followers to “chip in” if they could. The MFF, which was also endorsed by other celebrities, raised more than $41m that year, but questions have been raised about how it make decisions about who to bail out. The Post revealed yesterday a two-time convicted rapist was bailed and went on to rape another woman landing him back in prison on rape and assault with a dangerous weapon charges. Another man was bailed after a violent assault but went on to commit an even worse attack on another victim, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury. He is also back in custody. Numerous sources have pointed to Harris’ long career as a prosecutor, District Attorney and then Attorney General in California and said she should have known better. David Zimmer, a Public Safety Policy Fellow at the Center for the American Experiment, a Minnesota-based think tank, condemned her support of the fund. “As a former AG, Harris’ support for the MFF to this day, despite the many examples of violent criminals being put back on the street only to reoffend, demonstrates a complete lack of judgment on her part,” he told The Post. Other controversial choices for bail made by the MFF include: Shawn Michael Tillman Shawn Michael Tillman went on to kill a man he had a “beef” with just three weeks after his release in 2022, on bail paid for by MFF. Tillman was known to authorities through repeated arrests for indecent exposure. While in jail he was observed “repeatedly … exposing his penis and masturbating publicly” and muttering “you know you like it” to female jail staff. “He masturbated all day, every day. Locked in his cell, people [walked] by every half-hour and … [saw] him,” a prison source told website Alpha News in 2022. Another complaint reveals that Tillman threw a Styrofoam cup containing urine and feces at a corrections officer at the Lino Lakes prison, according to a prison report obtained by Alpha News. Still he was bailed out on April 29 2022, according to court documents, and less than one month later, Tillman murdered Demitri Ellis-Strong in cold blood, shooting him on a light rail platform. He was convicted of murder and is now serving life without parole, Minnesota court records show. Devin Markus Chase Devin Markus Chase is another repeat offender who had a prior conviction for a hit-and-run while under the influence of alcohol when he was bailed out by MFF on felony charges related to drugs. Chase had failed to appear at scheduled court hearings to answer two charges and was subsequently arrested in October 2022. But Minnesota Freedom Fund quickly stepped in and provided cash bail on Nov. 8, 2022, listing both of his drug case numbers, a court document cited by AlphaNews shows. A few months later, Chase stole a car and caused another devastating drug-fueled crash which killed one of his passengers — a 30-year-old woman — in February 2023. When interviewed by police, Chase said he had been living out of the car and on the morning he had crashed he had bought methamphetamine and heroin. He said he’d driven around smoking the drugs and couldn’t remember anything about the crash, according to a local Fox news report. He was convicted of Criminal Vehicular Homicide in July last year and sentenced to just over three years in prison, court records show. Jackie Rahm Little An arsonist federally charged over lighting a Minneapolis mosque on fire in April last year was also previously bailed out by the MFF twice, court records show. After allegedly setting a car on fire in 2021, the MFF bailed out Jackie Rahm Little from felony custody. Several months later, a warrant was issued for Little’s arrest for failure to comply with conditions of release and he was again arrested. The MFF again came to his rescue and posted an additional bail amount for Little’s release in May 2022. In January the following year, a Hennepin County Mental Health Court referee found Little mentally incompetent to be prosecuted for the 2021 arson. A federal magistrate judge also ruled in November Little was not mentally competent to stand trial over the mosque blaze either, MPR News reports. Since that time he’s bounced in and out of receiving mental health treatment, according to Minnesota court records viewed by The Post. Devonte Deshawn Dickerson Meanwhile, Devonte Deshawn Dickerson already had convictions for theft, fleeing from cops and stealing cars when he was hit with a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Minnesota Crime Watch sources told The Post it was the MFF who fronted up his bail in 2021. He didn’t stay free for long and was later convicted of a felony for the firearm and another for stealing a car in 2023. He is currently in jail on yet another charge of talking a car without the owner’s consent and possession of drugs. Those charges are yet to be decided. The MFF was started in 2016 and went from receiving donations of between $100,000 and $230,000 to the huge amount of $41,655,560 in 2020 following unrest after Floyd’s death at the hands of cops. Crime watchdogs point out how big bail funds can undermine the system itself, point out judges are to set bail appropriate to the person in who stands before them. The MFF didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday. Speaking a day earlier about their mission, the organization told The Post it is “a local nonprofit led by a volunteer-based board.” “We received an unprecedented level of support following the murder of George Floyd, and we have used that support to advance our mission during the years since,” said Noble Frank, the group’s communications director. Despite their huge influx of cash, MFF listed a loss of $6.7 million on its 2022 federal filings, the latest available.","summary":"The Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF) paid bail for an assailant who turned killer a week later and a habitual DUI driver who then crashed and killed a passenger.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/us-news/kamala-harris-backed-bail-funds-fails-continue/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/kamala-mff.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:52:40","author":"Isabel Keane,Megan Palin","authors":["Isabel Keane","Megan Palin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.569},{"id":254719736,"title":"Trump vows to impose ‘tough new sentences’ on illegal migrant criminals – including death penalty for sex traffickers","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to impose stiff punishments – including the death penalty – on illegal migrants found guilty of committing heinous crimes. “We will impose tough new sentences on illegal alien criminals, including 10-year mandatory minimum sentences for anyone found guilty of human smuggling; a guaranteed life sentence for any one found guilty of child trafficking; and a death penalty for anyone guilty of child or woman sex trafficking,” Trump said at a news conference in Cochise County, Ariz., just steps from the US-Mexico border. “We’ll also impose the death penalty on major drug dealers and traffickers,” the 78-year-old former president added. Trump also called for capital punishment for anyone convicted of killing “police, sheriffs, border patrol, ICE or law enforcement officials.” “The death penalty with a quicker trial,” the Republican presidential nominee said, “not a trial that lasts for 15 years and everyone gets exhausted.” “The amount of injuries sustained in fights and shootings is just incredible,” Trump said of the difficult and dangerous job law enforcement authorities face guarding the southern border. Trump, flanked by law enforcement officials and family members of migrant crime victims, toured the remnants of sections of a border wall he approved during his presidency that was never erected once the Biden administration took control of the project. The former president inspected the piles of steel sitting in the Arizona sun, seemingly rusting from neglect. “It could have been put up in a matter of weeks. It was all set to go,” Trump said of the heaps of metal. “It’s the ‘Rolls-Royce’ of walls,” he said, lamenting that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “refused to put it up.” “That’s when I first realized they wanted open borders,” Trump explained, claiming that much of unused paneling “has been sold for five cents on the dollar.” Grieving ‘Angel Moms’ Back Trump Patty Morin’s 37-year-old daughter, Rachel, was brutally murdered on a Bel Air, Md., jogging trail last year. A 23-year-old illegal migrant from El Salvador – suspected of other heinous crimes – allegedly killed the mother of five before stuffing her body in a drain pipe. Speaking at the news conference, Patty expressed strong support for Trump’s plan to seal the border and crack down on migrant crime. “We are 1,800 miles from the border,” Patty noted. “And because of this open border, we’ve had two [cases] in the same county where illegal immigrants have come in and raped and murdered our citizens.” “I really want our words to be heard,” she pleaded. “We’re here because we are losing our moms, our daughters, our children to criminals – and that shouldn’t happen.” “This is a very very important issue,” Patty said of border security. “One that is going to make or break our country.” Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn, who police say was assaulted and murdered by illegal migrants in Houston, also spoke in support of Trump’s border policies. “There were over 300 detention beds they should have been at,” Nungaray said of the two alleged killers, one of whom was wearing an ICE ankle bracelet at the time of the crime. “They were detained and released when they shouldn’t have been released,” she argued. “We are losing very innocent people to heinous crimes that shouldn’t be happening in the first place,” Nungaray fumed. What Other Republicans are Saying Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance spoke at a news conference in Georgia, just minutes before Trump’s border speech, touting the former president’s proposed agenda. “Donald Trump believes that we ought to make our law enforcement lives easier by closing down that southern border and getting the drug cartels out of our communities,” the Ohio senator said. He also warned changes to immigration laws backed by some Democrats and Republicans over the summer but opposed by Trump, would codify policies such as “catch and release.” “This is where a person comes into our country, they claim asylum, and then they’re released into our country with no follow up. Sometimes they don’t come back for five years. Sometimes they don’t come back for 10 years,” Vance said. “Kamala Harris and Joe Biden implemented catch and release through executive order, their so called border security package would have made catch and release the law of the land. So even if you have a guy like Donald Trump come in, he can’t undo it,” he added. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, speaking on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention Thursday, told reporters that he found it amusing that the Democratic gathering was surrounded by barrier to keep protesters out. “I’m grateful that Democrats appear to now agree with Donald Trump’s policy of building a wall,” Ramaswamy quipped. “If only they cared as much about keeping illegals out of our country as they do keeping their own left wing protesters out of their own convention, our border crisis would actually be behind us.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to impose stiff punishments, including the death penalty, on illegal migrants found guilty of committing heinous crimes.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/us-news/trump-vows-to-impose-tough-new-sentences-on-illegal-migrant-criminals/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-hen1tsyg8-1724367031534.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724352656&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:51:00","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":254719660,"title":"“Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff Mark 10 Years Together as She Gears Up for Presidential Nomination”","text":"CHICAGO — Talk about a memorable anniversary!

Earlier in the day, Emhoff posted a slideshow of photos of him and Harris. “Ten years of marriage, forever to go,” Emhoff wrote. “Happy anniversary, @VP. I love you.” In his widely lauded speech Tuesday night, Emhoff recounted his and Harris’ love story, beginning when they were set up on a blind date. He said Harris saved his first bumbling voicemail to her — left at 8:30 a.m. — “and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary,” drawing laughs and cheers from the crowd. He talked about Harris coming to synagogue with him and making a “mean brisket for Passover.” He said Harris encouraged him — the first Jewish spouse, of any gender, for the presidency or vice presidency — to fight against antisemitism. On their blended family, he said that Harris has “always been there for our children, and I know she’ll always be there for yours too.” Gwen Walz, wife of Harris’ running mate, also celebrated the couple Thursday. “What a special day, @KamalaHarris and @DouglasEmhoff!

Secret Service agents could be heard shouting ‘the shooter is down’ in the ensuing chaos and the gunman was later confirmed dead.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nArizona cops have arrested a man accused of threatening to assassinate Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Significant Development in Search for Arizona Man Who Threatened to Assassinate Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/significant-development-in-search-for-arizona-man-who-threatened-to-assassinate-donald-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Huge-update-in-hunt-for-Arizona-man.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:44:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":254719392,"title":"Dublin basketball star Jalen Stokes transfers to Dougherty Valley","text":"Skip to content All Sections Subscribe Now 73°F Thursday, August 22nd 2024 Today's e-Edition Home Page Close Menu News News Latest Headlines Crime and Public Safety California News National News World News Politics Education Environment Science Health Mr. Roadshow Transportation The Cannifornian Weather Local Local News Map Bay Area San Jose Santa Clara County Peninsula San Mateo County Alameda County Santa Cruz County Sal Pizarro Obituaries Obituaries News Obituaries Place an Obituary Opinion Opinion Editorials Opinion Columnists Letters to the Editor Commentary Cartoons Election Endorsements Sports Sports San Francisco 49ers San Francisco Giants Golden State Warriors Raiders Oakland Athletics San Jose Sharks San Jose Earthquakes Bay FC College Sports Wilner Hotline High School Sports Other Sports Sports Columnists Sports Blogs Golden State Valkyries Things To Do Entertainment Things To Do Restaurants, Food and Drink Celebrities TV Streaming Movies Music Theater Lifestyle Cannabis Advice Travel Pets and Animals Comics Puzzles and Games Horoscopes Event Calendar Business Business Housing Economy Technology Best Reviews SiliconValley.com Real Estate Marketplace Subscribe Advertise Log In Logout Close Menu Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Sign Up High School Sports | Dublin basketball star Jalen Stokes transfers… Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Subscribe Log In Account Settings Contact Us Log Out Spoof a user Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Sign Up Subscribe Log In Search 73°F Thursday, August 22nd 2024 Today's e-Edition High School Sports Sports 49ers Giants Warriors Sharks Athletics Earthquakes Bay FC High School Wilner Hotline Dieter Kurtenbach Trending: High School Sports | Al Attles dies High School Sports | More West Nile High School Sports | Pumpkin Spice Latte is on High School Sports | PHG on DWTS High School Sports | Why teens aren’t driving High School Sports | Bennifer details Breaking News High School Sports | The Latest: Democrats gear up for Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech at DNC Sports High School SportsAnalysis, NewsAnalysis, News Based on factual reporting, although it Incorporates the expertise of the author/producer and may offer interpretations and conclusions., Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Roughly three dozen “uncommitted” delegates — sent to the DNC by voters in primaries who selected “uncommitted” in protest of the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza — have successfully recruited more than 200 Harris delegates to support calls for an immediate ceasefire and stop the flow of US-supplied bombs into Israel. But Uncommitted National Movement leaders announced on Wednesday that the DNC rejected their request for a speaking slot. A petition urging the DNC to reverse course has collected more than 90 signatures from Democratic elected officials and party chairs. Including a Palestinian speaker would “not only honor our commitment to inclusivity but also provide an opportunity for these deeply personal and painful narratives to be heard,” the petition reads. “Just as we have collectively mourned and stood in solidarity with hostage families who have endured unimaginable grief, we must also offer compassion and understanding to Palestinians who have suffered under indiscriminate bombing.” After vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s keynote speech on Wednesday night, uncommitted delegates and supporters staged a sit-in demonstration outside Chicago’s United Center. Demonstrators included Georgia state representative Ruwa Romman, the first Palestinian elected to public office in the state. “I have been mobilizing voters in Georgia for 10 years. We helped build Georgia the electorate that delivered Georgia their 76,000 registered Muslim voters in the state. There are 55,000 Arabs in the state. Are you really going to tell me that it doesn’t matter?” Romman said, during the demonstration. “Are you really going to tell me that we can deliver come November without them?” she added. “That doesn’t include all the people who went out and said, ‘You know what? I’m standing in solidarity with you.’ And not a single one of us wants Trump.” Uncommitted delegates and supporters have been urging the DNC and the Harris campaign to give Romman a two-minute speaking slot, or calling on other elected officials to give up their spot to let her or another Palestinian American speak instead. Romman prepared a brief speech, but she said she was rejected without any explanation why. “We literally have no feedback,” she told Mother Jones. “We are in the dark.” Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American congresswoman and Democrat from Michigan, went further on X. “I know for a fact that the @DNC did not act in good faith and continue to lie about the negotiations. They are exposing themselves,” she posted. In her remarks, Romman planned to discuss her family’s roots in the villages of Suba in Jerusalem and Al Khalil in the West Bank. Her parents, who were born in Jordan, moved to Georgia when she was eight years old. After her grandfather passed away a few years ago, and “as we’ve been moral witnesses to the massacres in Gaza, I’ve thought of him, wondering if this was the pain he knew too well,” she planned to say. “When we watched Palestinians displaced from one end of the Gaza Strip to the other I wanted to ask him how he found the strength to walk all those miles decades ago and leave everything behind.” She also planned to celebrate the “beautiful, multifaith, multiracial, and multigenerational coalition” within the Democratic Party that is calling for a “ceasefire, end the killing of Palestinians, free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages, and to begin the difficult work of building a path to collective peace and safety.” Biden has refused calls from within his own party to withhold weapons sales to Israel to pressure a ceasefire in Gaza, even as the death toll from the conflict has reached more than 40,000 and famine has spread across the territory. In his message from the stage of the conference on Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Harris and Walz are “listening.” “They agree with us,” said Ellison, a former DNC deputy chair. “If you wanna know where they stand on some of the most urgent issues … let me assure you, Kamala and Tim hear you. They listen, they care, and everyone is included in their circle of compassion.” On Thursday, he wrote that “a Palestinian-American sharing his or her story, calling for cease fire and release of all hostages, and calling everyone to support the ticket against facism would be powerful.” Campaign communications director Michael Tyler did not directly answer reporters on Thursday when pressed why the campaign is not allowing a Palestinian speaker on the stage. Harris is “committed to ending the violence, ending the conflict, making sure that we resolve this conflict with a permanent ceasefire that allows Israel to fully secure itself … and make sure that we have full humanitarian aid, and also make sure that Gazans are able to peacefully live and prosper in Gaza,” according to Tyler. In a letter to Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, Michigan state Representative Alabas Farhat -- whose district includes Dearborn, where the “uncommitted” movement was born -- said the DNC’s “failure” to address the movement “cannot be understated.” “Leaders of the [DNC] cannot claim to want peace in Gaza but actively thwart the ability for Palestinians to speak their truth at the DNC,” said Michigan House leader Abraham Aiyash. “The plight of the Palestinians isn’t just an inconvenience you can ignore because it’ll ruin ‘vibes’ — children and families are being blown to pieces by US funded bombs, and to silence folks who want to lift their stories is another sad attempt to dehumanize Palestinians,” he added. “It is shameful that this is even a conversation that needs to be had.”","summary":"Anti-war delegates and supporters are urging Democrats to open a speaking slot for Palestinian elected official","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gaza-palestine-speech-protesters-dnc-uncommitted-b2600566.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/22/20/2024-08-22T183900Z_2034802017_RC26L9AP5O4W_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-DEMOCRATS.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/y3HqbHBv-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:39:55","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":254719372,"title":"Elon Musk’s Grok AI is flooding social media with absolutely wild images of Trump and Harris","text":"Elon Musk’s new no-holds-barred generative AI program Grok is flooding social media with absolutely wild pics and videos of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in outlandish situations. The most viral so far is a clip — created with the help of Grok by AI video artists the Dor Brothers — that begins with Donald Trump in an orange sweater, armed with a handgun, robbing a convenience store. A moment later Kamala Harris in a bright pink pantsuit sticks up the same shop with an AR-15. Then comes Elon Musk with a pistol of his own, Mark Zuckerberg with a baseball bat and an iguana on his shoulder, Joe Biden in a wheelchair with a gat and then Barack Obama with a big knife. Pope Francis is there too. Each of them sticks up the same shop and then gets hailed away by the cops. Scores of other images created by following user prompts show politicians taking hard drugs, flying planes into the Twin Towers or carrying out acts of bloody violence. The images are clearly a fake — for now. But in just over a week since Musk released the latest and most capable version of his AI generator — which he billed as “the most fun AI in the world!” in a post on X. It’s also widely available: Anyone who pays to use X can access Grok and images are generated directly within the service with simple prompts. And though the platform bars nudity and explicit content, many images nevertheless are sexually suggestive and degrading — with most of those being targeted at Harris, who is generally depicted in revealing outfits. But not all are so salacious. A surprising proliferation of content shows Trump and Harris not just getting along — but being deeply in love and sharing a happy family. Videos of the presidential opponents tenderly kissing, strolling hand-in-hand on a sunset beach, canoodling babies together, or rubbing Harris’ pregnant belly, turn up almost as frequently across X as the scenes of violence, depravity, and animosity between the two. Some even manage to blend both the harmony and the chaos. A series of images produced by X user “Luffy” show Trump and Biden smiling and playing the guitar together — and also laughing over loads of hard drugs and heavy weapons in their arms.","summary":"The images are clearly a fake — for now.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/us-news/elon-musks-grok-ai-is-flooding-social-media-fake-images-of-trump-and-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88143398.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VUDhBFL2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:39:50","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.266},{"id":254719452,"title":"Social media speculation runs wild after Beyonce rumored to be DNC mystery guest","text":"Social media speculation is swirling that Beyonce will perform at the Democratic National Convention for Vice President Kamala Harris’s acceptance speech. White House Political Director Emmy Ruiz posted a bee emoji on X, which many social media users took as a reference to the Beyhive and an indication that Beyonce is set to perform on Thursday night. “Sorry guys my 6-year-old took my phone,” Ruiz added, which didn’t stem the flow of hopeful posts that the artist would appear. “The White House director of political strategy and outreach has tweeted a emoji. The Beyonce DNC buzz is really buzzing now,” Joey Garrison of USA Today wrote on X. “Taking this as Beyonce at the DNC confirmation,” former Obama staffer and podcaster Tommy Vietor added. City officials and Democratic party organizers have been preparing for a surprise performance, according to Rolling Stone magazine. Two sources told the magazine that local law enforcement has been prepping for a possible Beyonce visit to the Windy City, with one person saying that “it’s been crazy.” “People running the show and working here obviously will prepare for Beyoncépalooza… We just keep being told ‘I don’t know’ when this comes up,” the individual said. “It has come up frequently.” While no one has spotted Beyonce in Chicago, two people told the magazine that they heard a marching band checking the sound for Beyonce’s song Cuff It on Thursday. The artist’s song Freedom has been used as the theme song of the Harris campaign, with the vice president walking out on stage at the DNC on Monday to the song. “Live update from the @DemConvention: The band is practicing @Beyonce songs,” Fentrice Driskell, the minority leader of the Florida House of Representatives, wrote on X on Thursday afternoon. Writer and educator Sari Beth Rosenberg shared a video of a band practicing on stage, saying “It’s definitely going to be @Beyonce right?” Beyonce’s team is reported to have given the green light to the Harris campaign to use Freedom only hours before the campaign was launched last month. The artist backed President Joe Biden and Harris a day before the 2020 election, she also spoke at a rally for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and fundraised for Barack Obama during his re-election campaign in 2012, Rolling Stone noted.","summary":"White House political director’s cryptic bee emoji tweet spurs on speculation of surprise performance as Harris set to accept presidential nomination","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/beyonce-dnc-mystery-guest-kamala-harris-b2600549.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/22/22/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zQsMRdWl-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:39:39","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":254719096,"title":"DNC 2024 Goes All in for the Youth Vote. Will it Pay Off?","text":"The 2024 Democratic National Convention marks the first time the party has invited digital content creators to cover the event, which has led to feature panels on youth outreach and Gen Z-created memes.However, the youth vote has long occupied a polarizing role in U.S. politics. In the past, it has helped drive candidates to the White House, but it can also represent hours of lost time and millions in wasted campaign dollars.Prior to President Joe Biden's exit from the race, the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government found that 53 percent of young Americans indicated they will \"definitely be voting,\" a slight tick down from 54 percent in 2020.However, with Vice President Kamala Harris' ascent to the top of the ticket, alongside a team dedicated to online youth outreach and grassroots canvassing, Democrats are optimistic youth voters will play a key role in determining 2024.\"We have like, 200 creators here right now at the DNC, and we're seeing a really positive reaction and reception to things that are being posted and the conversations that are being had,\" Harry Sisson, a 21-year-old content creator, told Newsweek. \"I think the DNC and the Harris campaign is doing an amazing job of kind of like meeting people where they're at.\"Sisson boasts over 1.2 million followers on TikTok, over 285,000 followers on X, and over 135,000 followers on Instagram. The outspoken Democrat has created content that has featured both Biden and former President Barack Obama. He has also interviewed Secretary of State Antony Blinken.While concerns have been raised by some regarding a significant presence of creators like Sisson, warning that their friendly interviews detract from time that could be spent putting politicians under rigorous questioning, Sisson said creators play a different role.He said creators provide political figures a platform to offer understanding to the creator's audience. Sisson believes this helps digital consumers better understand a politician's policy proposals, via the channel of a personal voice that they trust.Through these efforts, Sisson said Democrats can help motivate young people to channel the excitement they're experiencing online into tangible results at the ballot box.\"President Obama talked about it [in his speech] saying, like, 'this has to translate, right, this can't just be memes and vibes, and that's what we run on and hope to win on,\" Sisson said. \"We still gotta knock doors. We still gotta talk to our friends, family, and loved ones. We still gotta convince people and change their minds.\"Doug Sosnik, a veteran of the Clinton White House and adviser to over 50 U.S. Senators and governors, sees the DNC's outreach to creators as an effort that offers strong upside and little downside.He said, in politics, it's best to reach people where they're at, and, according to the Pew Research Center, 32 percent of adults aged 18 to 29 get their news on TikTok.Democratic efforts to meet people on the highly popular platform signals the campaign understands what it must do to expand its appeal, Sosnik said, so expending resources on this type of outreach makes sense.\"In the last month since she announced, they've raised half a billion dollars—This is a campaign that's not stretched on resources,\" Sosnik told Newsweek. \"They're not having to make a choice about whether or not to try this based on limited resources. They have that covered now, so it seems smart to me.\"Based on observations by Newsweek, the DNC is making a concerted effort to focus on digital creator outreach.Emily Slatkow, communications director of NextGen America, a progressive advocacy group that refers to itself as the \"nation's largest youth voter organization,\" believes the DNC's efforts will prove fruitful.She believes the engagement with youth groups and creators shows youth voters that Democrats are \"listening to them and is wanting to bring them in.\"While youth voters were receptive to Democratic policy priorities—like reproductive care and climate change—with Biden at the top of the ticket, Slatkow said Harris' ascension has allowed their organization to shift its programming from \"persuasion to mobilization.\"Slatkow sees trust building as an essential part of his process. By providing young creators and youth organizers a significant presence at the convention, she believes the party can prove its commitment to voters under the age of 30, perhaps winning the White House in the process.\"I think we're really seeing the party coalesce and support those young voices and bring them into the fold,\" Slatkow told Newsweek. \"We know that the typical like politician reaching out or trying to connect does not resonate as well, and having trusted voices that are on their feeds, on Twitch, on Instagram, on Twitter, on TikTok, is a great way of bridging that gap with young voters.\"","summary":"The youth vote has often been difficult to predict, but can help catapult a candidate to the White House.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/dnc-2024-youth-vote-kamala-harris-election-1943254","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2456408/kamala-harris-goes-youth-vote.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:36:43","author":"Alex J.

By Jonathan Allen CHICAGO — For now, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is running on vibes, and many Democrats hope she can ride them to victory on Election Day. That may mean she will try to avoid laying out a comprehensive policy plan for the country. Whether she can do that and still win remains an open question. In the month since President Joe Biden stepped aside, Harris has offered a ton of talk about joy, vision and values, but very little in the way of detailed plans. The Democratic Party’s platform, released Sunday, didn’t change as a result of the switch at the top of the ticket. On the campaign trail, Harris has unveiled a handful of proposals that are largely retreads or souped-up versions of items on Biden’s wish list — among them, a 28% corporate tax rate, a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, an expanded tax credit of up to $6,000 for the first year of a child’s life. The latter two could create inflationary pressures at a time when Harris is promising to keep prices low. But Harris and her campaign team aren’t saying anything about a broader plan to bolster the economy or national security. At a roundtable with reporters this week, hosted by Bloomberg News, Harris policy adviser Brian Nelson repeatedly said he didn’t want to “get ahead of the vice president” when pressed for details of her agenda. “I think, you know, fundamentally she’s going to continue to do sort of more specific policy initiatives with a lot of detail behind them as she builds out this picture for her vision of the future both in the economy and domestic policy,” Nelson said. At the same event, longtime Harris policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu suggested that the Harris campaign would rather draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump and the “Project 2025” agenda he has disavowed than put down its own map of her plans. “The questions about even what voters want to hear in terms of her work over her career, her time as vice president and then moving forward may sound a little bit different than our traditional sort of longer-term campaigns that have had, you know, these huge apparatuses,” Kosoglu said. “On the opposing side, there’s a Project 2025 out there, and people also need to understand what’s in those 900 pages. What does it mean for their everyday life?” Harris campaign aides have said that she will not propose a single-payer, universal health insurance program — “Medicare for All” — as she once did and that she now opposes a fracking ban she once supported. Harris has yet to sit down for a major interview since she became the Democratic standard-bearer, so it may be some time before she is pushed to fill in her vision with more specifics — and do so in her own words, rather than through statements issued by campaign aides. There are risks to offering too few details and to offering too many of them. Democrats have tried to make Project 2025 an anchor on Trump. But given a short window to get to know Harris better, voters may not be willing to hold their breaths and hope that she will deliver what they want if she’s not willing to make hard promises on policy. Only time will tell whether she feels compelled to do that — and whether she will be rewarded or rejected if she doesn’t. Harris prepares for history-making convention speech By Yamiche Alcindor CHICAGO — Harris is set to deliver what is arguably the biggest speech of her life Thursday night, when she will make history as the first Black woman and first Asian American person to accept a major party’s nomination for president. Harris intends to focus her speech on three areas: sharing her personal and professional background, contrasting her vision for America with the one offered by former President Donald Trump and rooting her vision in “a deep and abiding sense of patriotism,” according to a campaign official, who requested anonymity to share details about the remarks. The speech will be one of her most significant opportunities to define herself since she took over the top of the ticket from Biden last month. She has been crafting the speech over the past two weeks, making trips to Howard University in Washington, D.C. — her alma mater — for both debate preparation and speechwriting sessions, two sources familiar with her preparations said. One person familiar with the speech preparations said Harris plans to dedicate the early part of her speech to praising Biden. Harris also plans to connect her policy proposals with her middle-class upbringing, including talking about plans for issues like taking on price gouging, lowering rent and helping first-time homebuyers, the two sources familiar with the speech said. A former aide familiar with the speech preparations said Harris’ team has also been cautious about how they will incorporate talking about race and gender while understanding that it will be important to acknowledge the history-making position Harris is in. The speech will focus on why Harris is qualified to be president, detailing, among other areas, her time as a lawyer and the types of cases she handled. ?️The lineup: Prior to Harris, several other prominent Democrats are slated to speak on the fourth and final night of the convention. They include: Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords; Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Roy Cooper of North Carolina; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Rep. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida; former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; and state Reps. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, also known as the “Tennessee Three.” In addition, Democratic candidates in key Senate races are on the schedule: Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; and Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. But as Henry J. Gomez and Bridget Bowman note, the party’s two most vulnerable Senate Democrats — Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — are skipping the convention.

Follow along with tonight’s speeches on our live blog → Trump says he will make ‘provisions’ for mixed-status families but doesn’t rule out separations with mass deportations By Garrett Haake, Jake Traylor and Alexandra Marquez SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — Trump on Thursday said the cost to deport millions of undocumented immigrants is justified and would not rule out separating families that are compromised of citizens and immigrants. “It’ll cost trillions of dollars to keep these people, and I’m talking about in particular, starting with the criminals,” Trump told NBC News in an interview during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. “That’s costing us a lot more than deporting. But we have no choice, regardless, we have no choice, we’re going to have to deport.” When pressed, Trump provided no details on how he would pay for his plan, which could cost billions of dollars to implement at scale. Trump spent much of his first term fighting with Congress to give him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an expensive undertaking that the legislative branch never agreed to fund. Ultimately, he took the money from other parts of the Pentagon budget. Asked whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who are part of mixed-status families, like those married to American citizens or those who are parents to American citizens, Trump said: “Provisions will be made, but we have to get the criminals out.” That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

Instead, they were with social media influencers, including Vidya Gopalan, a North Carolina mom known to her 3.4 million TikTok followers as @queencitytrends. Gopalan, who largely posts lifestyle content, asked Harris to reflect on their shared Indian heritage and her memories of spending time in India with her grandfather. The video, posted Tuesday, has more than 1.9 million views. That engagement represented a recognition from the Harris campaign that reaching voters in the countdown to Election Day will require Democrats to go beyond a traditional media strategy and into new spaces. One piece of this strategy is creating their own content, including on the popular @KamalaHQ account across platforms. The other – and arguably more significant – piece is to harness the power of influencers. There is a plan in place, officials say, to reach Americans – and particularly young voters. And that is increasingly on social media platforms. “You have to meet the voters’ eyeballs and ears where they are – and where they are is at their lunch, during their lunch breaks, scrolling through their phone. They are sitting on the subway, scrolling through their phone. They are on the couch with the TV on with CNN, maybe on mute, scrolling through their phone. They’re walking their dog, looking at their phone,” said Alex Pearlman, a self-described “ranting comedian” known on as @pearlmania500 TikTok, where he has 2.7 million followers. Pearlman is among the 200 content creators credentialed for the DNC this week, marking an unprecedented effort by Democrats to engage this community. There are multiple “creator lounges” across the United Center, spaces with mirrors and ring lights and charging stations where the creators, many of whom are longtime followers of one another but have never met in person, are networking and collaborating. They are on the convention floor on a special “creator platform,” prime real estate for viewing each night’s events. And they are meeting and interviewing top Democratic surrogates – including Harris herself. The creators represent a vast swath of the internet – and, thus, a vast swath of followers. Some of them have long been political, like Carlos Eduardo Espina, who posts immigration-focused content, or Olivia Julianna, who focuses on reproductive rights and other Democratic issues. But also on hand are cooking influencers, beauty experts, comedians and sports creators. “The DNC realizes if a bunch of people have millions of followers, if you bring 200 of them together, the reach is amplified,” said Nimay Ndolo, a current-events comic with 3.5 million followers across platforms. But it’s a mutually beneficial relationship. Keith Edwards, a Democratic strategist with a 550,000-strong following who interviewed Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this week, said, “Exclusivity is the name of the game. So us being here and getting access only helps us grow. It only helps them, and only helps us help them, being here,” predicting “exponential” growth for this type of engagement in future conventions. Having access to voices like Buttigieg, he said, “legitimizes me … and also helps him get eyeballs, and then also helps me expand my audience.” In conversations with more than a dozen content creators in Chicago this week, the influencers roundly praised the Harris campaign’s outreach as a model for Democrats. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising Democratic star who was on Harris’ vice presidential short list, has also been “really impressed” with the state of her digital organization. “The burden is not on the Pennsylvanian to find the Harris campaign. The burden is on the Harris campaign to find that voter. And they’re doing an exceptional job of that: knocking on doors and showing up on your ‘For You Pages,’” Shapiro told CNN. And for many Gen Z influencers, the week has offered an opportunity to instill some humanity in the political process. “Social media and speaking directly to the people humanizes them in a lot of ways that they don’t realize. We’re just kind of disillusioned with a lot of institutions. We’ve grown up, especially Gen Z, watching these institutions fail us in so many different ways,” Awa Sanneh, a 23-year-old with 503,000 followers who posts on a range of topics, from the Black Lives Matter movement to her outfit of the day. Beyond just influencers, the groundswell of support in the immediate days after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee brought with it something difficult to purchase or build: a coolness factor, from coconut tree memes to the ubiquity of the candidate on social media feeds. “It is really cool to talk about Kamala Harris on the internet right now,” deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a recent interview. “The volume of folks who are posting, who have lots and lots of followers, gives people who share content with their friends and family more coverage to do it themselves.” And in a sign of the energy and enthusiasm for the new candidate, multiple creators CNN spoke with said they would not have been as eager to attend a convention for President Joe Biden. “I don’t know that I have a definitive answer for you,” said Raven Schwam-Curtis, a Black and Jewish educator posting to 220,000 followers. “But I will say I’m very energized and excited, and it was a very easy yes to say yes to coming to this.” For Schwam-Curtis, though, the question remains whether the enthusiasm for Harris can translate into action at the ballot box. “It’s been cutesy and it’s been demure – but to what extent will the memeification of Kamala Harris get Gen Z to the polls?” Schwam-Curtis said.

But comedian Jon Stewart isn't buying it. The Obamas' speeches were full of jabs at Trump, with Michelle Obama ripping her husband's successor in the White House by saying his \"narrow\" worldview meant he was \"threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black.\" She further added that the presidency could be \"one of those Black jobs,\" in reference to a comment he made at the June presidential debate. Barack Obama mocked the 45th president's \"weird obsession with crowd sizes,\" notably manipulating his hands in a manner similar to Trump, drawing laughter from the crowd of more than 20,000 DNC attendees. In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Trump referred to the 44th president of the United States as a \"nice gentleman,\" saying \"I respect him and I respect his wife.\" But in the most recent episode of his podcast, Daily Show host and executive producer Jon Stewart called Trump's compliment \"bulls—.\" READ MORE: 'Total hatred': Trump most upset about this DNC speech On his podcast, The Weekly Show, Stewart railed Trump's remarks and reminded viewers of his past \"disgusting treatment\" of the First Family. He further opined that he could tell Michelle Obama in particular was still \"wounded\" by the \"vile, conspiratorial, personal [and] disturbing\" attacks from Trump and his movement during her husband's administration. \"Him saying it doesn't make it true. He was the leader of an absolute torrent and river of slime [toward the Obama family]. And I imagine for her, she thought, 'we've given our pound of flesh to this endeavor, and I don't want any part of that anymore,'\" Stewart said. Trump was famously the first major cultural figure to start promulgating the false \"birther\" claim that Barack Obama was not actually born in the United States (his birth certificate shows he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August of 1961). As the New York Times reported in 2016, Trump still refused to walk back the lie for years despite the matter of Obama's birth being settled. At the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, when Trump was in attendance, Obama singled him out for ridicule. \"There's a rumor floating around that I think could really hurt Mitt Romney. I heard he passed universal healthcare when he was governor of Massachusetts! Someone should get to the bottom of that. And I know just the guy to do it: Donald Trump! Now I know that he's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier — no one is prouder — to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,\" Obama said. \"And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\" READ MORE: 'Not great': Jon Stewart struggles to defend Biden's 'resting 25th Amendment face' Michelle Obama's speech was considered the more high-profile event of Tuesday night, with pundits and commentators praising her speech even more than her husband's. This was likely due to the starkly more combative tone the former first lady took at the lectern, which was a departure from her old motto of \"when they go low, we go high.\" Thursday night marks the final night of the DNC, with numerous prominent members of Congress, U.S. senators and governors all taking the stage. Harris will be accepting the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination at the conclusion of the convention, making her the first woman of color to do so in American history.

Some say Vice President Harris’ race to the White House is a divine destiny, especially those who are a member of the legendary sorority that she is still a part of. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at Howard University in 1908, is part of the historic Divine Nine group of sororities and fraternities, which started after African Americans were kept out of white colleges and similar organizations. There are 360,000 members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which includes the vice president. Nearly four million members make up the Divine Nine historic Black fraternities and sororities. In July, Harris visited the 2024 AKA Convention held in Dallas — 11 days before President Joe Biden decided to drop out of the race and endorse the vice president. Now, Alpha Kappa Alpha Inc., whose headquarters is 10 miles away from the United Center and where Harris will accept the nomination at the DNC, is in the spotlight. Florida State Sen. Rosalind Osgood is also an AKA member and is in Chicago to witness this historic moment from a fellow sorority member. “About 24 and a half years ago, I became a member of the world’s greatest sorority, and I couldn’t imagine in my wildest dreams that it would bring me to this moment and this time,” said Osgood. “My heart is just filled with joy.” Former Broward County Mayor Dr. Barbara Sharief is also a proud member of the historic Black sorority and is at the DNC to support Harris. “Well, I think for me, it tells all of the little girls out there that you can do whatever you want to do. You can be whoever you want to be, and you can reach the highest office in the land,” said Sharief. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries is a fellow member of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. “Trump is like an old boyfriend, who you broke up with, but he just won’t go away,” said Jeffries during his DNC speech. “He has spent the last four years spinning the block, trying to get back into a relationship with the American people. Bro, we broke up with you for a reason.” Many politicians and leaders represent the Divine Nine fraternities and sororities. U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, belongs to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Jim Clyburn are both members of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore belong to Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. It is not new to see these organizations and its members in politics. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, and his wife Coretta Scott King belonged to Alpha Kappa Alpha. This election is a moment these service organizations, leaders and networks are likely to mobilize in a new way. Many are in attendance for the DNC wearing their organization’s colors and letters, along with others wearing white to honor their suffragettes. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) mocked as “childless cat ladies” before becoming former President Donald Trump’s running mate. The Democratic National Convention has elevated female leaders of the party, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to former first lady Michelle Obama, in each night of programming, all while nodding to the historic significance of nominating Vice President Kamala Harris, the first black woman to lead a major party ticket. But Democrats have also continued to latch on to the controversial remarks of Vance, in which he disparaged the party as being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies.” The label has been celebrated throughout the four days of festivities, with delegates proudly wearing pins and hats with the phrase emblazoned on it and cheering as speakers including legendary talk show host Oprah Winfrey mentioned it in their convention addresses. “When a house is on fire, we don’t ask about the homeowner’s race or religion,” Winfrey said on the third night. “We don’t wonder who their partner is or how they voted, no. We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too.” Vance has said his remarks were taken out of context, specifically that he was not mocking those women who are unable to conceive. But in the lead-up to the convention, social media content creators spun Vance’s comments into memes, while the Trump campaign endured a dayslong news cycle focused on the remark. “The cat ladies of America are united, OK? This went right back in their face,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said while speaking to the New York delegation on Monday. Many delegates were delighted to revel in the mockery, part of the political honeymoon the party has enjoyed since President Joe Biden agreed to drop out of the 2024 race. “It’s so fun to watch as they make these ridiculous comments and Democrats come back with empowering videos on social media — I love seeing all the swag of cats on a blue wave,” said Kelly Green, a delegate from Philadelphia. As Democrats prepare to wrap up the week in Chicago, the themes they’ve embraced during their gathering stand in stark contrast to the largely masculine programming from Republicans during their convention in Milwaukee last month. At that confab, Trump drew headlines for entering to a rendition of the song “It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World,” while the event also included hypermasculine theatrics from wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who ripped off his shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance logo. “I was not involved in the programming decisions, but I think what we are showing is that our speakers really represent America, they represent the Democratic Party,” said Jason Rae, secretary of the Democratic National Committee, speaking with the Washington Examiner. “We are really trying to showcase some great talent.” On Thursday night, when Harris accepts the nomination and addresses the convention, many female delegates and elected officials on the floor will be clad in white, a nod to the women’s suffrage movement. “White is a symbol of solidarity — women showing not just our strength but our strength and our unity. Being of one accord when it comes to fighting for the rights of women — equal rights for women in every arena,” said Lottie Shackelford, chairwoman of the women’s caucus at the DNC. “To see that sea of white, it lets you know the importance of the moment, we are on the verge of making history.” Democratic women in Congress have often used their clothing to send a message. This past year, they wore white pantsuits, turtlenecks, and scarves in a sea of dark suits at the State of the Union address to draw attention to abortion access and reproductive care. They have also worn white as a form of solidarity and protest against Trump in the past. “Many of us want to let Kamala know that we’re there for her and we always remember that we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), who is in her 15th term in Congress. “This isn’t about us; it’s about the people who came before us, and hopefully we will be putting some things in place so that our daughters and granddaughters have a better chance than we had.” Over the last few election cycles, single women have demonstrated that they are the backbone of the Democratic Party. In CNN exit polls from the most recent midterm elections, single women supported the Democratic Party, 68% to 31% for Republicans. Never-married voters of both genders turn out at lower rates than their married or divorced counterparts, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Nevertheless, women are credited with propelling a wave of Democratic wins during the midterm elections in 2018. The group of voters was once again galvanized after the high court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022. This election will be the first presidential cycle since the Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and the week has been dominated by a focus on it, from morning delegate meetings to party panels in which women have shared their stories. In a post-Roe landscape, Democrats are counting on it to be a mobilizing factor that gets voters to the polls. “Women have become empowered as a result of the MAGA extremist movement and Trump’s nomination of three justices for the United States Supreme Court, who were confirmed, who then overturned Roe v. Wade,” said Gloria Allred, a renowned California-based attorney, speaking to the Washington Examiner. “Women, women of color, and young women, they are mad as hell, and they are not going to take it anymore, and a lot of men also, they care about their wives,” she said. Trump has attempted to attract female voters, too, as he runs for a second term in the White House. He is rejecting a national ban on abortion, in part, because it has jeopardized Republicans’ electoral prospects with suburban women. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER But Democratic leaders have attempted to frame the conversation over abortion into one about the Democrats being on the side of “freedom,” a frequent theme of Harris’s campaign. “When women are free to make their own decisions about their lives and to follow our dreams, we are unstoppable,” said Cecile Richards, a former Planned Parenthood leader, speaking to the convention on Wednesday.","summary":"CHICAGO — Democrats are working to energize a key demographic at their national convention: the women Sen.

It’s that Beyoncé will enter the 2024 political race, by performing her hit Freedom ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ nominating speech Thursday night. Supporters have tried to will both a Beyoncé and Taylor Swift endorsement into existence, with more than 70,000 signing a MoveOn.org petition asking the two stars to step up. But it’s Queen Bey who’s been on the tip of everyone’s lips during the four-day convention in Chicago – with one Democratic state party chair openly saying in front of reporters that she was coming. Of course a Swift appearance would also make the convention hall go wild, with the pop star largely expected to endorse Harris – but in the past has usually waited until October. Campaign sources, convention organizers and even a publicist for Beyoncé DailyMail.com reached out to haven’t bit, but one source said the star’s name is on the backstage security list for Thursday night. The White House’s political director Emmy Ruiz also teased a Beyonce appearance by posting an emoji of a bee on X – which could signify the ‘Beyhive.’ Ruiz later posted: ‘Sorry guys my 6 year old took my phone.’ A Beyonce cameo would create a hat trick of the nation’s most powerful black women coming out in support of Harris – after former first lady Michelle Obama spoke Tuesday night and Oprah’s endorsrement of Harris on Wednesdy. Beyonce already signaled her support of Harris – by allowing the vice president to use Freedom in her campaign ads and at rallies. She threatened to send a cease-and-desist to the Trump campaign after the same song was used in Trump’s social media. And DailyMail.com reported earlier this month that Beyonce planned to attend a fundraiser for the Democratic nominee. Convention organizers have already been able to pull off one surprise – Lil Jon’s appearance representing Georgia during Tuesday night’s musical roll call vote. Ashley Spillane, the former head of Rock the Vote who was mastermind behind the rapper’s appearance said they were able to keep it quiet because only a small circle of people knew the rapper was coming. ‘He didn’t go to soundcheck the other day,’ Spillane also told DailyMail.com. Most of the convention’s performers have done a mic check earlier in the day. It’s how reporters knew that James Taylor was expected to perform – and then got cut from the schedule on day No. 1 after programming dragged on too late. It went so long that President Joe Biden’s swan song speech ended after midnight on the east coast. Winfrey knew going to mic check could ruin her surprise appearance so she went through her speech at the United Center wearing a hat, sunglasses and a face mask, The New York Times reported. When Winfrey said hello to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the California congressman didn’t recognize her, Winfrey’s best friend, CBS’ Gayle King said. During Thursday’s sound checks, attendees and those observing the convention from home were looking for any clue that the Cowboy Carter songstress would grace Chicago with her presence. A drum line went through their performance – further sparking a frenzy that Beyonce could come. Two white bedazzled jackets were also brought out onstage – stoking speculation that Swift and Beyonce could both come. The Democratic National Convention has been far more Hollywood-friendly than its Republican counterpart – which boasted Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan as the top celebrity VIPS. On Thursday alone, Scandal’s Kerry Washington did her mic check. She was seen practicing a bit with the grand-nieces of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris – Meena Harris’ daughters Leela and Amara. ‘Hello, hello, I don’t want to say this part. I don’t want people to hear this part,’ Washington teased during the mic check – another sign there could be more surprise convention guests. Actress Eva Longoria watched Washington’s soundcheck and then did one of her own. Later in the afternoon, Pink appeared onstage and sang her hit, What About Us, several times. The Chicks are also expected to perform that National Anthem Thursday night.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEverybody&#8217;s talking about it at the Democratic National Convention &#8211; but nobody&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Excitement builds as rumors suggest Beyoncé might make a surprise appearance at the DNC while Kamala Harris accepts the nomination first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/excitement-builds-as-rumors-suggest-beyonce-might-make-a-surprise-appearance-at-the-dnc-while-kamala-harris-accepts-the-nomination/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Rumors-of-Beyonce-appearing-at-the-DNC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:22:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":254718618,"title":"Final day of the DNC: Kamala Harris to accept the party's nomination","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Sport court dismisses Canada's appeal in women's soccer case The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Canada's appeal of a six-point penalty against its Olympic women's soccer team.

The last one was Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Of course, we all know how that one worked out. “We cannot help but reflect the sadness we feel at the violence in the streets of this great city and for the personal injuries which have occurred,” the Minnesota Democrat told delegates at the International Amphitheater in August of 1968. “Surely, we have learned the lesson that violence cannot be condoned, whatever the source. I know that every delegate to this convention shares tonight my sorrow and my distress at these incidents.” Not quite the vibe you want in an acceptance speech — especially from the politician who actually coined the phrase, “the politics of joy.” Sound familiar? But luckily for Harris — and Chicago — the convention is going a bit better this week. Only time will tell if whatever bump Harris gets from Chicago will be enough to propel her into the presidency. But if she is elected in November, Harris will join the exclusive club of sitting vice presidents who moved right into the Oval Office. And she will be only the second Democratic V.P. to do so. A Harris victory will certainly blaze even greater trails — first woman president and first Asian American president. But making the leap directly from No. 2 to No. 1 has proven no easy feat. Only four have done so. Spoiler alert: All were white men. Of course, other vice presidents have been elected after they left office, including Democrat Joe Biden, who returned to the White House four years after he served as Barack Obama’s vice president, and Republican Richard M. Nixon, who lost his first presidential bid in 1960, when he was Dwight D. Eisenhower’s V.P., but returned eight years later to beat Humphrey. But Harris is seeking to follow a path last successfully traveled by Republican George H.W. Bush, who went directly from serving as Ronald Reagan’s wing man to the top job in 1988. Coincidentally, Bush’s son, George W. Bush, would thwart the efforts of Vice President Al Gore to win the presidency in 2000 — although Gore’s popular vote victory earned the Tennessee Democrat historical bragging rights of sorts. And another eight vice presidents moved directly into the top job when presidents died in office either by assassination or illness — a cold caught on inauguration day, in the case of William Henry Harrison in 1841. And Republican Gerald Ford has the dubious distinction of being the only vice president to replace a president who quit. Ford himself took over from scandal-plagued Spiro Agnew, who resigned in 1973, and then succeeded Nixon, when he resigned in disgrace in 1974. Yeah, those were pretty wild times, too. As for the handful of sitting vice presidents elected president, besides George H.W. Bush, they are Federalist John Adams in 1796, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson in 1800 and Democrat Martin Van Buren in 1836. Perhaps the most unusual vice-presidential ascension came in the case of Adams and Jefferson, the second and third presidents. They were of different parties, but Jefferson wound up Adams’ vice president in 1796, because at the time the No. 2 position went to the candidate finishing second in electoral votes. Four years later, Jefferson challenged Adams for the presidency in a campaign that was, not surprisingly, heated and contentious. But Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr wound up tying in electoral votes, forcing the House of Representatives to decide. And Burr, of course, would famously kill Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804. Makes this year’s event seem almost dull.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/22/dnc-2024-election-vice-presidents-history","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f46ed63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x1781+0+291/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7c%2Ff3%2Fd43a49524549af5623a761b7b773%2Fhump","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:12:20","author":"Scott Fornek","authors":["Scott Fornek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.075},{"id":254718000,"title":"St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter finds his voice as DNC’s Minnesota chant leader","text":"St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter has worn many hats in the political arena, from state employee to city council and, for the past six years, capital city mayor. During the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, he added one more title to his political resume — that of chant leader. The mayor’s image has been captured by more than one media outlet, in pictures and videos, making a joyful noise for Gov. Tim Walz, who was chosen as running mate this month by Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the White House. “I am happy to report I made it out of the Minnesota delegation alive,” wrote MSNBC political analyst Jacob Soboroff on the social media platform X on Wednesday, rebroadcasting video of Minnesota delegates shouting “Walz! Walz!,” “Coach!” and “Minnesota!” under Carter’s direction as the mayor led chanting and high-fived delegates in front of the camera. The Walz selection hasn’t just elevated the governor’s profile on the national stage. It’s also placed an unusual media spotlight on Minnesota and Minnesotans, including the governor’s political allies, family and fans. Carter is no exception. The mayor has been sharing clips of the delegation — and himself — in high-energy mode through his personal X account, @melvincarter3. “All the other delegations have left the floor — but Minnesota is still here chanting,” wrote Kaitlan Collins, a CNN anchor, on X shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday. In the center of her photo was Carter himself, looking exuberant and, if pictures could talk, a bit loud. “The United Center turned the lights off on us chanting for our Gov. Tim Walz last night & (the) Minnesota Delegation only cheered louder!” wrote Carter the next morning. “It felt like ‘Miracle On Ice’ in there!” Carter also shared video of the governor Thursday morning. “A surprise visit from our Gov. Tim Walz sent the Minnesota Delegation energy right back through the roof this morning!” said the mayor on X. The four-day convention, which featured Walz on Wednesday night, was scheduled to wrap Thursday night with speeches from Harris and others.

By Jonathan Allen CHICAGO — For now, Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is running on vibes, and many Democrats hope she can ride them to victory on Election Day. That may mean she will try to avoid laying out a comprehensive policy plan for the country. Whether she can do that and still win remains an open question. In the month since President Joe Biden stepped aside, Harris has offered a ton of talk about joy, vision and values, but very little in the way of detailed plans. The Democratic Party’s platform, released Sunday, didn’t change as a result of the switch at the top of the ticket. On the campaign trail, Harris has unveiled a handful of proposals that are largely retreads or souped-up versions of items on Biden’s wish list — among them, a 28% corporate tax rate, a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, an expanded tax credit of up to $6,000 for the first year of a child’s life. The latter two could create inflationary pressures at a time when Harris is promising to keep prices low. But Harris and her campaign team aren’t saying anything about a broader plan to bolster the economy or national security. At a roundtable with reporters this week, hosted by Bloomberg News, Harris policy adviser Brian Nelson repeatedly said he didn’t want to “get ahead of the vice president” when pressed for details of her agenda. “I think, you know, fundamentally she’s going to continue to do sort of more specific policy initiatives with a lot of detail behind them as she builds out this picture for her vision of the future both in the economy and domestic policy,” Nelson said. At the same event, longtime Harris policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu suggested that the Harris campaign would rather draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump and the “Project 2025” agenda he has disavowed than put down its own map of her plans. “The questions about even what voters want to hear in terms of her work over her career, her time as vice president and then moving forward may sound a little bit different than our traditional sort of longer-term campaigns that have had, you know, these huge apparatuses,” Kosoglu said. “On the opposing side, there’s a Project 2025 out there, and people also need to understand what’s in those 900 pages. What does it mean for their everyday life?” Harris campaign aides have said that she will not propose a single-payer, universal health insurance program — “Medicare for All” — as she once did and that she now opposes a fracking ban she once supported. Harris has yet to sit down for a major interview since she became the Democratic standard-bearer, so it may be some time before she is pushed to fill in her vision with more specifics — and do so in her own words, rather than through statements issued by campaign aides. There are risks to offering too few details and to offering too many of them. Democrats have tried to make Project 2025 an anchor on Trump. But given a short window to get to know Harris better, voters may not be willing to hold their breaths and hope that she will deliver what they want if she’s not willing to make hard promises on policy. Only time will tell whether she feels compelled to do that — and whether she will be rewarded or rejected if she doesn’t. Harris prepares for history-making convention speech By Yamiche Alcindor CHICAGO — Harris is set to deliver what is arguably the biggest speech of her life Thursday night, when she will make history as the first Black woman and first Asian American person to accept a major party’s nomination for president. Harris intends to focus her speech on three areas: sharing her personal and professional background, contrasting her vision for America with the one offered by former President Donald Trump and rooting her vision in “a deep and abiding sense of patriotism,” according to a campaign official, who requested anonymity to share details about the remarks. The speech will be one of her most significant opportunities to define herself since she took over the top of the ticket from Biden last month. She has been crafting the speech over the past two weeks, making trips to Howard University in Washington, D.C. — her alma mater — for both debate preparation and speechwriting sessions, two sources familiar with her preparations said. One person familiar with the speech preparations said Harris plans to dedicate the early part of her speech to praising Biden. Harris also plans to connect her policy proposals with her middle-class upbringing, including talking about plans for issues like taking on price gouging, lowering rent and helping first-time homebuyers, the two sources familiar with the speech said. A former aide familiar with the speech preparations said Harris’ team has also been cautious about how they will incorporate talking about race and gender while understanding that it will be important to acknowledge the history-making position Harris is in. The speech will focus on why Harris is qualified to be president, detailing, among other areas, her time as a lawyer and the types of cases she handled.

Mark Kelly of Arizona and his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords; Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Roy Cooper of North Carolina; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Rep. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida; former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; and state Reps. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, also known as the “Tennessee Three.” In addition, Democratic candidates in key Senate races are on the schedule: Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; and Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. But as Henry J. Gomez and Bridget Bowman note, the party’s two most vulnerable Senate Democrats — Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — are skipping the convention. Alex Seitz-Wald also reports that a number of progressive lawmakers and officials, as well the United Auto Workers, have called on Democrats to reverse their decision not to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot. ?

Follow along with tonight’s speeches on our live blog → Trump says he will make ‘provisions’ for mixed-status families but doesn’t rule out separations with mass deportations By Garrett Haake, Jake Traylor and Alexandra Marquez SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — Trump on Thursday said the cost to deport millions of undocumented immigrants is justified and would not rule out separating families that are compromised of citizens and immigrants. “It’ll cost trillions of dollars to keep these people, and I’m talking about in particular, starting with the criminals,” Trump told NBC News in an interview during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. “That’s costing us a lot more than deporting. But we have no choice, regardless, we have no choice, we’re going to have to deport.” When pressed, Trump provided no details on how he would pay for his plan, which could cost billions of dollars to implement at scale. Trump spent much of his first term fighting with Congress to give him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an expensive undertaking that the legislative branch never agreed to fund. Ultimately, he took the money from other parts of the Pentagon budget. Asked whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who are part of mixed-status families, like those married to American citizens or those who are parents to American citizens, Trump said: “Provisions will be made, but we have to get the criminals out.” Read more → That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

The Uncommitted National Movement said Wednesday that a Democratic National Committee official delivered a firm response: “The answer is no.” In response, delegates decided to stage a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center and vowed to remain until their request is granted or the convention ends on Thursday night. The sit-in has exposed the most visible cracks in the Democratic Party during an otherwise energized week. The news came just a day after featuring the parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, igniting a firestorm of criticism from some on the left. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. ▶ Read more about the “Uncommitted” movement’s DNC shutout Will Beyoncé perform at the DNC tonight? The internet sure thinks so. Intense speculation that Beyoncé will make an appearance at the DNC has built to a frenzy in recent hours. The pop icon already gave Harris permission to use her hit song “Freedom” as a campaign anthem. But many have surmised that Beyoncé herself will make an appearance at the Democrats convention, pointing to a cryptic tweet by a top Harris aide, as well as an afternoon soundcheck inside the United Center that featured the Beyonce song “Cuff It.” An hour before festivities were set to kick off, White House political director Emmy Ruiz tweeted out an emoji of a bee, which some took as a reference to the Beyhive, a colloquialism for avid Beyoncé fans. Beyoncé isn’t the only star who was rumored to be making a surprise appearance. Some on social media postulated that Taylor Swift could appear, too. Live from the DNC, it could be one of your favorite online influencers Across this week’s convention, more than 200 online influencers, streamers and other social media personalities have been capturing and livestreaming their impressions of what’s going on. There’s the 12-year-old nicknamed “Knowa,” who’s posted with a swath of prominent Democrats and went head-to-head with Republican personalities like MyPillow founder Mike Lindell inside the convention hall. A veteran from rural North Carolina with more than 5 million TikTok followers proclaimed himself a “Hillbilly for Harris.” Other influencers and social media personalities are sharing everything from the food available at trucks outside the United Center to attendees’ thoughts on more serious issues, such the war in Gaza. The creators were invited to the DNC by convention organizers, a new but significant part of a digital strategy that aims to leverage the sizable followings of creators across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Discord and Twitch, according to officials with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign. They hope it will help Harris and running mate Tim Walz reach new voters who might not be following along with political news via traditional media. ▶ Learn more about Democrats’ influencer strategy Trump visits the US-Mexico border alongside victims of violent crime Trump ticked through a list of brutal crimes blamed on people who were living in the country illegally during a campaign event on the Arizona-Mexico border. Trump invited relatives of two victims to join him in front of the wall. Alexis Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter Jocelyn was killed in Houston, said the men charged with killing her should have been in immigration detention. She implored Americans to vote for Trump, saying he would get the border controlled. “Please, please, I really hope everybody can hear my pain,” she said. “He needs to be in office. We need better control. We need to stop this. We need to stop losing our littles.” Trump said Harris likes to talk about the future, calling out a central message she’s promoting at the Democratic convention, but the families joining him in Arizona, he said, “want to go back to the safe past.” Sudden fame for Tim Walz’s son focuses attention on challenges of people with learning disabilities “That’s my dad!” 17-year-old Gus Walz could be seen exclaiming Wednesday night during his father’s speech at the DNC. He stood, tears streaming down his face, and pointed to his father, the governor of Minnesota, who accepted the party nomination for vice president. Gus wept through much of the 16-minute speech, and took the stage with his family afterward, wrapping his dad in a tight bear hug, burying his face in his shoulder. The high school senior’s joy quickly went viral. He was still trending Thursday on X. And his newfound fame is focusing attention on the challenges of people with learning disabilities. His parents recently revealed to People magazine that Gus has ADHD, an anxiety disorder and something called a nonverbal learning disorder. Searches on Google have spiked since Thursday night this week for the disorder and for the teen’s name. ▶ Read more about Gus Walz and Democrats’ policy on disabled Americans Denied a DNC speaking slot, uncommitted delegates call shutout ‘soul-crushing’ Uncommitted delegates who oppose U.S. support for Israeli military operations in Gaza said Thursday that they still want Democrats to feature a Palestinian American speaker on stage. Sabrene Odeh, an uncommitted delegate from Washington, said that “it’s incredibly soul-crushing” to have their voices shut out of the convention. She said party leadership gave them a “flat out no” on Wednesday, leading the uncommitted delegates to spend the night outside the United Center in protest. “The lowest bar we could set is asking for a Palestinian American to speak,” said Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota. The delegates represent voters from several states who chose “uncommitted” during primary votes to protest President Joe Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza. Layla Elabed, a leader of the movement, said the goal was “not another bomb.” Trump criticizes Harris’ handling of border security Before his remarks, Trump began criticizing Harris’ record on immigration and border security, calling her “the worst vice president” as he walked and talked to a few locals near a fence. “She was the border czar. All of a sudden she is saying she is not the border czar,” he said. “There’s never a border in the whole world that’s leaked like this border.” Harris was tasked in March 2021 with tackling the “root causes” of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — Central America’s so-called “Northern Triangle” — but was not given the title of “border czar” or put in charge of border security. Trump’s motorcade has arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border near Sierra Vista, Arizona He plans to look at the fence with local law enforcement and border officials, then will speak to reporters. Trump sees border security, the issue that defined his first presidential campaign, as a major liability for Harris. Illegal border crossings reached record levels during the Biden-Harris administration, though they’ve ebbed more recently. Trump stepped out of his SUV wearing a suit and red tie and was talking to about a dozen people who greeted him, including several wearing law enforcement uniforms. In addition to it being the day of her DNC speech, Thursday is also Harris’ wedding anniversary Thursday isn’t just the biggest day of Kamala Harris’ political career as she accepts her historic presidential nomination. It’s also her 10th wedding anniversary with Doug Emhoff. Harris and Emhoff met on a blind date in 2013. In a speech Tuesday night, Emhoff recalled introducing himself in a rambling voicemail. “I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth,” he said. Emhoff added that “Kamala saved that voicemail and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.” CEO of Democratic-leaning think tank: ‘Folks don’t vote for 10-point plans’ Patrick Gaspard, the CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the large Democratic-leaning think tank, says Vice President Kamala Harris doesn’t need to roll out detailed policy plans to win in November. “Folks don’t vote for 10-point plans, if they did, we probably would have had President Warren emerge in that contest or Hillary Clinton’s campaign might be remembered differently,” Gaspard told reporters at a Bloomberg event at the Democratic National Convention. He said voters are more focused on values and their perceptions of whom candidates are fighting for. Said Gaspard: “It’s a vibes election, but guess what, every election for the last 200 years has been a vibes election. And that’s actually one of the reasons that I feel more confident today than I thought I could feel, at this point in the election.” Sen. Schumer talks about his hopes for Harris’ speech at the DNC Hours before Harris’ DNC speech, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he hoped “Kamala will talk about the aspirations of working families and what we, as Democrats, will do to help make their lives better.” He said he’d be listening specifically for efforts to reduce costs on housing, prescription drugs and groceries and to create new jobs, particularly green ones — all themes Harris has spoken about while campaigning around the country recently. “Talking about the aspirations of working families, what we can do to both lower costs and create ladders to give people greater income,” Schumer told a small group of reporters Thursday. Asked if it felt like Trump — rather than President Joe Biden — was the incumbent given how much the Democratic convention has focused on the former president, Schumer said Harris “will also talk about the danger of Trump winning again.” “The reason he’s mentioned so much is the great depth of the danger” Trump poses, Schumer said. “The feeling about the danger.” Police: It may have been mealworms, not maggots, that sickened hotel diner during the DNC Mealworms may have been what sickened a diner at a Chicago hotel earlier this week during the Democratic National Convention, the city’s police superintendent said Thursday. While the investigation continues, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said clues point toward the foreign object being mealworms. “I’m not sure that those were maggots,” Snelling said when asked for an update on allegations of maggots being placed in food. “There was sawdust, so they were probably mealworms. They look the same. But that’s still under investigation.” Mealworms are common insects that have worm-like, yellow-to-brown colored bodies. They are the larval form of the mealworm beetle. Maggots are similar in appearance, but soft-bodied with white to transparent color. They are the larval stage of flies. Multiple female suspects entered the Fairmont Chicago, which was hosting a breakfast for delegates at the DNC and began placing “unknown objects” onto tables with food before leaving the area at around 6:45 a.m. Wednesday, police said. One person who ingested the food was treated by medical personnel and released at the scene, according to Chicago police. Shapiro responds to Trump calling him ‘the highly overrated Jewish Governor’ of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Donald Trump is “obsessed” with spewing hatred after the Republican nominee for president criticized Shapiro as “the highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Shapiro spoke Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention and said Trump “wants to take away our rights and our freedoms.” Trump’s missive on social media also said Shapiro had “refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had” and that “Shapiro has done nothing for Israel.” Asked about Trump’s statement by a reporter Thursday morning, Shapiro said “it’s clear over the last few years, Donald Trump is obsessed with me and obsessed with continuing to spew hate and division in our politics. He’s someone who has routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this.” Shapiro has years of experience making Trump the focus of his rhetorical attacks, first as state attorney general and now as governor. The White House issued a statement, saying “it is antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Senate’s top Democrat shrugs off possible political effect of protesters staging a sit-in outside DNC Asked about a small group of uncommitted delegates doing a sit-in because convention organizers haven’t including a pro-Palestinian voice among the speakers, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer recalled Vice President Kamala Harris saying when protesters interrupted her at a recent rally in Michigan that their disruptions might benefit Republican Donald Trump. “She said, ‘Be quiet unless you want to elect Trump,’” Schumer told a small group of reporters Thursday, ahead of the convention’s final evening. “We believe we need unity and there’s overwhelming — I have never seen such unity,” he said. “A small handful of people does not represent close to even a sliver of where the Democratic Party is right now.” Pressed on whether a pro-Palestinian voice should have a convention speaking spot, Schumer responded, “I think Kamala Harris has had a very diverse convention.” Chicago police say they’re not changing tactics and are ready for final night of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at DNC On Wednesday night, more than 2,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched peacefully past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered earlier. That demonstration came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests at a much smaller, unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Chicago. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said the protest Wednesday night ended without arrests and that no one was injured. ▶ Read more about DNC protests Democrats are rounding out list of speakers for DNC’s final night before Harris takes the stage Among the politicians on tap are Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who was considered as a possible running mate for Harris, and his wife Gabby Giffords, a former representative who was nearly killed in a mass shooting in 2011. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive leader, is scheduled to speak as well. So is former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who became one of the few elected leaders of his party to oppose Donald Trump. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healy will also deliver remarks. And Tennessee state lawmakers Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson, the “ Tennessee Three, \" will speak. Jones and Pearson were expelled from the state Legislature for participating in a protest on gun control at the state Capitol. Chicago police superintendent says Wednesday night protest ended with no arrests and no one injured Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said the protest was pretty large though “not as large as we had necessarily anticipated.” Snelling praised organizers of the Wednesday protest, saying it’s an example of how people can hold First Amendment protected demonstrations peacefully by collaborating with law enforcement ahead of time. “Did we have a couple dustups? Sure, but those things were quickly rectified,” he said. Ramaswamy says media not giving enough coverage to Harris’ ‘policy deficits’ At a Thursday morning Trump campaign news conference in Chicago, Vivek Ramaswamy also blamed the media for what he characterized as lack of probative coverage of Harris’ policy proposals. “Many covered for Joe Biden’s cognitive deficits in the same way that I worry the media is now covering for Kamala Harris’ policy deficits, and Americans are left holding the bag both times over.” Ramaswamy also listed celebrities participating in this week’s DNC, portraying them as a distraction from the issues at stake in this campaign. “I see Oprah Winfrey. I see John Legend. I see Lil Jon,” Ramaswamy said. “Great — then still tell me what she stands for.” Trump says he plans to do a ‘LIVE PLAY BY PLAY’ on Truth Social of Harris’ speech at the DNC Trump has been largely quiet on the platform during convention programming, commenting mostly in interviews and events he’s been holding in battleground states. White House responds to Trump criticizing Shapiro as ‘the highly overrated Jewish’ governor of Pennsylvania The White House issued a statement on antisemitism the morning after Donald Trump criticized Josh Shapiro as “the highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Trump wrote on social media that Shapiro had “refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had.” Herbie Ziskend, the White House principal deputy communications director, said “it is antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” He added that “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat antisemitism — and hate and bigotry of all kinds.” Trump’s allies are still counterprogramming against Harris’ policies as DNC wraps up At a news conference Thursday morning, Carlos Trujillo, who served as Trump’s ambassador to the Organization of American States, decried Biden-Harris administration policies that “completely eliminated” Trump-era immigration achievements. Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman who went from one of Trump’s GOP primary rivals to one of his most vocal surrogates, listed crime statistics for the city of Chicago. The DNC host city, Ramaswamy said, has been “ravaged and devastated … by rampant crime worsened by the effects of illegal mass migration to this country” he blamed on the Biden-Harris administration and the vice president specifically, due to her responsibilities related to the border. “From one kid of legal immigrants to this country to another, my message to her is, shame on you,” Ramaswamy said. Trump also said Democrats are spending more time at DNC talking about him than issues “It’s like they’re having a party. They don’t mention the border. All they do is make up lies about me,” the GOP presidential nominee complained as he called into “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning. Trump is set to visit the southern border in Cochise County, Arizona, on Thursday as he continues to criticize the Biden administration’s border policies. He’s been spending the week campaigning across battleground states. Democrats on Wednesday night argued that they’re offering leadership on the U.S.-Mexico border, working toward policy solutions rather than simply demonizing immigrants and trying to use the issue as a political motivator for their base. Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, from the border city of El Paso, said, “Forget what you hear on the news, I’m from there. … When it comes to the border, hear me when I say, you know nothing, Donald Trump.” Trump criticizes Democrats for linking him to Project 2025 Former President Donald Trump is taking issue with continued efforts by Democrats to tie him to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 at this week’s Democratic National Convention. Calling into “Fox and Friends” on Thursday ahead of the convention’s final night, Trump called the efforts “disgraceful.” “They know I have nothing to do with it. I had no idea what it was,” he said, despite the fact that the plan — which Trump and his campaign have repeatedly disavowed — was written by many longtime former staffers. “I have no idea what Project 2025 is.” He took particular issue with Democrats saying he would sign a federal abortion ban after appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. “I would never,” Trump said. “There will not be a federal ban. This is now back in the states where it belongs.” Trump also lashed out at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, who spoke at the convention Wednesday night, calling him a “total lightweight.” Dems gave freedom an expansive definition Wednesday night’s convention theme was “Freedom.” Backed by Beyoncé’s song of the same name, which the musician has authorized the Harris campaign to use, the word flashed on the video screen and in speech after speech at the United Center. Democrats firmly tied it to the fight over reproductive rights that went into overdrive after the fall of Roe v. Wade. But Democrats also used the freedom argument to slam Republicans on other social issues, from gay rights to the spread of book bans in schools. Hundreds of protesters rallied at park and train station on Democratic convention’s 3rd night More than 1,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched Wednesday past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered earlier. The demonstration, which stayed largely peaceful, came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests. As marchers passed under a new elevated train station near the United Center that was completed just before the DNC, officers were seen bringing a person to the ground on the platform above. In response, hundreds of protesters pushed against the edge of the station, banging on the glass with their hands and flag poles as they called on police to free the person. The person left through the station’s emergency exit moments later, accompanied by officers but not in handcuffs, prompting cheers from the crowd. ▶ Read more about Wednesday’s demonstrations","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention kicks off its fourth and final night Thursday.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Update: Democrats prepare for Kamala Harris to give her acceptance speech at DNC first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-update-democrats-prepare-for-kamala-harris-to-give-her-acceptance-speech-at-dnc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-The-Latest-Democrats-gear-up-for-Kamala.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:00:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.275},{"id":254717424,"title":"Kamala Harris To Take The Stage On Last Day Of Democratic Convention","text":"TCF vendors Exponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Privacy choices, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Probabilistic identifiersmoreCookie duration resets each session.

The video featured the Lemonade track playing as Trump walked off a plane in Michigan. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung posted the video on Twitter on Tuesday with the caption \"Touchdown in Michigan!! @realDonaldTrump.\" The tweet has since been deleted. The 2016 song has become Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' unofficial presidential campaign anthem with her running mate Tim Walz, and Beyoncé's team previously gave Harris' camp permission to use it. Harris has used the song since beginning her presidential campaign earlier this summer, walking up to the podium while \"Freedom\" played in her first appearance after President Joe Biden's endorsement, and as recently as Monday in a new ad also featuring Jeffrey Wright's narration. Beyoncé's \"Freedom\" has also been played throughout the ongoing Democratic National Convention, currently taking place in Chicago. Representatives for Trump's campaign and Beyoncé did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly's request for comment. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. This is not the first time Trump's team has used music without permission, prompting swift pushback from the artists. Earlier this month, Isaac Hayes' estate took legal action against the Trump campaign for its use of \"Hold On, I’m Coming\" at multiple Trump rallies over the last two years. And Celine Dion posted a statement on Instagram calling out the Republican presidential candidate for playing a video of her performing “My Heart Will Go On” at a recent campaign stop without her permission. In April, the estate of late Irish singer-songwriter Sinéad O’Connor blasted him for playing her 1990 hit \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" at several events, saying in a joint statement with Chrysalis Records, \"it is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a 'biblical devil.'\" Other artists who have spoken out against Trump for using their music include Pharrell, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Adele, Guns N’ Roses, Aerosmith, Neil Young, Rihanna, Ozzy Osbourne, Nickelback, Linkin Park, the Rolling Stones, Village People, Panic! at the Disco, Queen, R.E.M, and the estates and families of Tom Petty, Laura Branigan, Prince, and George Harrison.

Tim Walz walk on stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday, August 21, 2024. (Renée Jones Schneider) The 14 former players from the Mankato West High School football team who jogged onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention say it’s been surreal seeing their glory years unexpectedly celebrated on the national stage. The players had been flown out to Chicago to support Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on the night of his acceptance speech as the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate Wednesday. Walz had been a coach for Mankato West’s football team during their championship runs in 1999 and 2002, before the former geography teacher ran for Congress and then governor. And just as Walz’s star has quickly climbed in the weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate, so have those teams from long ago ascended past local legend into the national consciousness. Now in their late 30s, the former players, wearing old football jerseys that didn’t quite fit, marveled at how their school’s fight song was being played in front of a national audience. “It was unreal, like pinch me now,” said Drew Hood, 38, and a former outside linebacker at Mankato West. They relished reliving tales about football games decades past that are now being retold across America: how the team suffered a winless 0-27 run in the years prior to Walz joining as the defensive assistant, how the team ran a 4-4 scheme — four linemen and four linebackers — on their way to an unlikely championship. Many of them had scrambled to get to Chicago on short notice. The Harris-Walz campaign flew them out and paid their expenses, they said. A spokeswoman for the campaign confirmed they flew out the former players, as well as Rick Sutton, head coach at Mankato West during those years. Many of the former players reunited for the first time in decades in Chicago. “The world’s best high school reunion,” said Sean Koomen, 42, who had been a kicker on Mankato West’s 1999 team. Koomen had flown into Chicago from the state of Washington. After graduating high school and college, he moved to the West Coast and now teaches people how to build wooden boats. Like the other players flown to Chicago, Koomen said he wanted to support his former coach. Several of the players are members of a group, Mankato West Alumni for Harris-Walz, in support of his campaign. “He changed our life,” said Tim Wussow, 42, and a tackle on the 1999 team.

Tim Walz’s Mankato West High football team introduce him as vice president nominee Elections Harris and Walz ‘politics of joy’ theme traced back to another prominent Minnesotan Elections Minnesota delegation elated after Tim Walz’s speech at the DNC Wednesday night in Chicago was a blur, Wussow said. Prior to walking on stage, the former players marveled at the celebrities and politicians who seemed to be starstruck by them. “I’ll never forget, Bill Clinton walking down the hallway and saying ‘That’s the Mankato West football team!’” said Wussow. As Walz gave his acceptance speech, the players said friends and family watching the convention back home in Mankato kept sending them messages whenever their hometown was mentioned. Later, the former players said they gave Walz a football they had signed, shook hands and hugged him. Sutton could be seen grinning ear-to-ear with Walz after the speech. He said he was glad to support his former assistant coach and see players he hadn’t seen in decades. Sutton, 62, spoke in the middle of football practice. Now co-head coach at Farmington High School, he had flown to Chicago after practice Tuesday, attended the convention Wednesday, and took a 7:15 a.m., flight Thursday so he could still run morning practice, he said. Sutton said he’s heard the criticisms that Walz is taking too much credit for the 1999 and 2002 runs, but said Thursday that he doesn’t put much stock in them. “People have inferred in the media that he’s coach and that means head coach — Tim has never said that,” Sutton said. “Tim and I had and have a good relationship.

With this excitement, there's also a more optimistic outlook. We've been asking whether in general voters see this election as more about hope for what could happen or fear for what might happen. For Democrats, hope now eclipses fear. While Democrats may be excited and strongly backing Harris, she still faces some of the same deficits with the broader electorate that President Biden did. Harris runs behind former President Donald Trump on some key issues in this election, like the economy. Harris may take the opportunity to re-introduce herself to the country — a third of voters say they don't yet know what she stands for — and try to convince voters she would handle the issues that matter to them better than Trump.Democrats excited about HarrisTwo-thirds of Democrats are excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee, with majorities of Democratic men and women and both liberal and moderate Democrats feeling excited (although excitement is higher among liberals). Nearly all Democrats are at least satisfied with Harris as their nominee. Along with excitement for Harris, as we reported on Sunday Democrats have continued to close the gap with Republicans in expressing their intention to definitely vote. They now are effectively even with Republicans in saying so. And Democrats are thinking about this election differently now — feeling more hopeful than fearful about what might happen. The percentage of Democrats who say the election is about hope has risen 17 points since the spring and now outnumbers those who say it's about fear. What does Harris need to do?Harris may have made this a closer race with Trump, but some factors in the race remain the same.The economy and inflation are top issues for voters, and Harris trails Trump among those who say these issues are major factors in their vote, just as Mr. Biden did. And Trump leads Harris by an even greater margin among those who say the U.S.-Mexico border is a major factor for them. Harris does maintain advantages on other issues like abortion, the state of democracy and issues of race and diversity. Many voters don't know where Harris standsWhile most Democrats feel they know where Harris stands, many voters are still learning about her. A third of voters overall say they don't know what she stands for, a number that rises to 44% among independents, a group she will try to persuade to back the Harris-Walz ticket. This analysis is based on a CBS News/YouGov survey conducted with a representative sample of 3,258 registered voters nationwide interviewed between August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is ±2.1 points.","summary":"Democrats are excited about Harris, but she trails Trump on some key issues among the electorate overall.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-democrats-excitement-poll-analysis/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/22/41326db8-d544-419b-bdbf-13f7fb083a02/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e917b2fdcbed77a2815e3e753d92f9ae/gettyimages-2167668185.jpg?v=29ebd300d9a3cd24077d945a46991f72","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3137293_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:58:00","author":"Jennifer de Pinto","authors":["Jennifer de Pinto"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":254717486,"title":"What Tim Walz's son Gus Walz means to the disability community","text":"CHICAGO -- In a moment that captivated a nation, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz gave a heartfelt shoutout to his family during his speech accepting the nomination for vice president Wednesday night. \"Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world and I love you,\" he said.

The site claimed that the Atlas actress motivated the Argo director to be more 'family oriented.' During their two year marriage - which Ben dropped a clue about months ago - the kids were 'very important to them,' added the insider. Lopez shares twins Max and Emme, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner: Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12. But the way they spent their time with the kids divided them, it was claimed. While JLo was happy to take the little ones out shopping and to fun events, Affleck preferred to hang out at home. Jennifer Lopez had a hand in getting Ben Affleck to focus more on his children, a new report from People has alleged. The site claimed that the Atlas actress motivated the Argo director to be more 'family oriented.' Seen with Emme and Samuel in 2021 During their two year marriage the kids were 'very important to them,' added the insider. Lopez shares twins Max and Emme, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner: Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12 (pictured in March) 'They are very different people,' the source added of Affleck and Lopez. 'She's super public and wants to go out, and he's more of an introvert and is happy to hang out at home.' Read More Ben Affleck dropped a major clue MONTHS ago that his marriage to Jennifer Lopez was over Indeed, Jennifer was often seen traveling with the kids as she has a busy schedule. And she likely wanted to take all five of the children with her during her summer tour, which has been postponed to 2025. Ben may not want to go out as much as he is just not as gregarious as Lopez. In an interview with Kevin Hart earlier this year, Ben said he was 'shy': 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention,' he told the comedian. 'This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why is this dude always mad?' Because someone had their camera sticking in my face, and I'm like, 'OK, here we go.'' 'You have resting b***h face,' Hart joked. 'B****h? Now,' Affleck responded as he pretended to be mad. 'I have resting hard face. People are projecting onto me something that I don't feel about myself at all.'

Seen at the after party for the Los Angeles premiere of Shotgun Wedding in January 2023 in Hollywood Also in the Hart interview, Ben went into great detail about how Lopez has crazy fame while he has sorta fame. Read More Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's split 20 years ago under microscope The Air star said fans went 'bananas' when they spotted the 55-year-old Bronx-born beauty with him in Times Square. Turns out, it was his idea to walk through one of the busiest neighborhoods with a superstar on his arm. 'We went somewhere with [Jennifer]—I can't remember because she's so famous, and she creates this—people love her, and she really represents something important to people,' Affleck stated. '[To me,] people are like, 'Hey, I like your movie,' and then they're like 'AAAHHHH! J-LO!' he yelled. 'It's amazing, you know what I mean?' Then he got more specific. 'I think it was when we rolled through Times Square,' he continued. In an interview with Kevin Hart earlier this year, Ben said he was 'shy': 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention,' he told the comedian. 'This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why is this dude always mad?' Because someone had their camera sticking in my face, and I'm like, 'OK, here we go'' 'We get out of the car, we were going to a play, and I was like, 'F*** it, babe, we're going to be late, we gotta walk a block and a half.' [Lopez] was like, 'Alright,' she didn't say s***.' They were with all their children - he has Violet, Seraphina and Samuel with Jennifer Garner and Lopez has Max and Emme with Marc Anthony. 'We get out with her, all the kids, through Times Square, and the s*** was like f****n' bananas,' Affleck noted. 'I was like, 'Oh my God.' There was a lady, she was smoking weed, in a full purple skintight suit—she's a heavy lady—and she starts running backwards filming, going '-LO!!' He added, 'Like a herald, that then gets everyone else, and then all the tourists come in.' Affleck said the chaos was a lot to take in. The stars seen in 2003 at the Los Angeles Lakers v. San Antonio Spurs playoff game at the Staples Center 'Then we've got our five kids, it's me and Jen and what feels like hundreds of people, and they're all screaming.' Meanwehile, Lopez is reportedly feeling 'disappointed and sad' after filing for divorce from Affleck but she knew it was 'time to move on'. The superstar was engaged to Hollywood actor Ben, 52, in the early 2000s and the pair famously reconciled in 2021 before tying the knot in two ceremonies in 2022 but the relationship is now over once again and Jennifer filed for divorce on Tuesday to bring the union to an end. Now a new report suggests Jennifer felt the time was right to start moving on with her life. A source told PEOPLE: '[She knows] it's time to move on' for various reasons 'She's very disappointed and sad, but Ben hasn't given her any signs that he wants to continue their marriage. He hasn't shown any commitment and interest in making their marriage work. It's gotten to the point that she just needs to look out for herself.' Affleck and Lopez got back together in 2021; seen in September 2021 in Italy The divorce filing came exactly two years after the couple's extravagant second wedding in Georgia on August 20 2022 - and an insider told the publication the significance of the date wasn't lost on Jennifer. They said: 'She was done waiting and the date she did it speaks a tonne ... [The divorce filing] gives her control of the process ... It's good that she did it ... 'She tried really hard to make things work and is heartbroken.' The source went on to insist the former couple's blended family is taking priority, adding: 'The kids are a top priority, as they always have been.' The singer/actress wrote a whole album - 'This Is Me ... Now' - inspired by the pair's reignited love affair and even made a film version. She was even gushing about the relationship just months before the official date of their separation, which is listed as April 26 2024. She told the Metro newspaper: 'I wrote This Is Me... Then when Ben and I fell in love 20-something years ago. As fate would have it, we came back into each other's lives. And on the 20th anniversary of This Is Me... Then, I announced that I would do This Is Me... Now.' 'It was inspired by the surreal miracle that had happened. Him coming back into my life and the two of us reuniting in a way that we never expected that was the inspiration for even going in the studio. 'The album just poured out of me. It was just something organic and beautiful, but it was definitely inspired by getting this incredible second chance at real, true love.'

The negotiations stalled late Wednesday when leaders with the Uncommitted National Movement say a Democratic National Committee official called and delivered a firm response: “The answer is no.” The leader, Abbas Alawieh, an “Uncommitted” delegate to the convention and co-founder of the movement, described the call as shocking after weeks of talks that he felt were positive. In response, he and other delegates decided to stage a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center, where the convention is being held. They spent the night on the sidewalk on Wednesday, and vowed to remain until their request was granted or the convention ended Thursday night. “When we ran out of options — doing everything we can and working from the inside, when we ran out of options as uncommitted delegates, we just sat down,” Alawieh said in an interview Thursday. The Harris campaign declined to comment. The sit-in outside the United Center has exposed cracks in a Democratic Party that otherwise has rallied around the Harris campaign that has energized the vast majority of party members this week. The news that the DNC had denied the request of a Palestinian American speaker, just a day after featuring the parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, ignited fresh criticism from some on the left. The politically powerful United Autoworkers Union, which has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, said the party “must allow a Palestinian American speaker to be heard from the DNC stage tonight.” Cook County, where Chicago and the convention is located, holds the largest population of Palestinian Americans in the country. The party, however, has not budged. The Senate’s top Democrat shrugged off the potential political impact of the sit-in outside the convention. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer recalled Harris saying when protesters interrupted her at a recent rally in Michigan that their disruptions might be benefiting Republican Donald Trump. “She said, ‘Be quiet unless you want to elect Trump,’” Schumer told a small group of reporters on Thursday, ahead of the convention’s final evening. “We believe we need unity, and there’s overwhelming — I have never seen such unity,” he said. “A small handful of people does not represent close to even a sliver of where the Democratic Party is right now.” Tensions over the war in Gaza have at times escalated outside the convention center this week, as thousands marched through Chicago demanding a cease-fire. A smaller group of activists clashed with police outside the Israeli Consulate on Tuesday night, leading to 56 arrests. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Muslim Democrat, spoke Wednesday at the convention and praised Harris for saying “we need a cease-fire and an end to the loss of innocent lives in Gaza and to bring hostages home.” In an interview Thursday, he said that “not only is the content of the message important, the messenger is also important.” “A Palestinian-American sharing his or her story, calling for cease-fire and release of all hostages, and calling everyone to support the ticket against fascism would be powerful,” Ellison said on social media Thursday. Many other Democratic leaders urged the party to reconsider the request. In a statement, California Rep. Ro Khanna said that “the Democratic Party, which aspires to be the party of human rights, must not in 2024 perpetuate this erasure of the Palestinian story.” When asked at a roundtable discussion Thursday whether he agreed with the “Uncommitted” delegates’ demand to add a Palestinian American speaker to the DNC lineup, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said, “Yes, of course.” “We’re talking about thousands of babies and elderly people being brutalized by an act of war,” said Johnson. “You have to have a voice that can call for peace as well as the releasing of hostages.” According to Alawieh, the “Uncommitted” movement provided a number of potential Palestinian Americans who could speak at the convention, including Georgia State Rep. Ruwa Romman. Romman on Thursday released a draft of the speech she said she planned to deliver if asked. In it, she calls for electing Harris, defeating Donald Trump — and outlines demands for a cease-fire and to “end the killing of Palestinians, free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages.” Earlier this week, activists were granted unprecedented space at the convention to hold a forum addressing the plight of Gaza residents, who have been under Israeli bombardment since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and its taking of hostages, as well as to share deeply personal stories about family members lost in the conflict. The panel was viewed as an olive branch from the Harris campaign, with hopes that other requests might be fulfilled later in the week. The convention has officially made Harris the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, with the vast majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates enthusiastically casting their votes for her. But those calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war — among other demands, such as an arms embargo on Israel — believe they will have an outsized influence in the November election, now just over 70 days away. Michigan, one of the key swing states, has the largest percentage of Arab Americans in the country. The UAW, which hosted Harris at a union hall event earlier this month, also has its largest membership base in Michigan. Through Thursday, Democrats on their way into the convention stopped by the sit-in. Rep. Cori Bush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the “Squad,” who lost her primary earlier this month, stopped to mingle with “Uncommitted” delegates. “We are Democrats. We are a part of this party. And we are just saying, ‘hear us because it matters,’” said Bush.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO – Leaders of an “Uncommitted” movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Pro-Palestinian delegates denied speaker at DNC, despite their request first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/pro-palestinian-delegates-denied-speaker-at-dnc-despite-their-request/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-039The-answer-is-no039-Pro-Palestinian-delegates-say.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:57:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":254718070,"title":"‘The Daily Show’ at the DNC: Why the Show Is More Nimble Than Ever Ahead of Jon Stewart’s Live Episode","text":"The last time “The Daily Show” was physically at the Democratic National Convention was in 2016 — two presidents, a global pandemic and many hosts ago. So going into the DNC this week, head writer Dan Amira felt a bit like he was “learning it all over again.” But few shows on television are better suited to adapt on the fly than Comedy Central’s late night gem. “We’re gotten very used to adjusting. I don’t think we’ve had a normal period at ‘The Daily Show’ for quite a while now,” Amira said. Starting in 2020, the series filmed from Trevor Noah’s home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That was followed by a period when the show returned without a studio audience before last year’s unconventional season. In the wake of Noah’s departure as host, “The Daily Show” tried out new guest hosts weekly, a challenge that required the writers to adjust to vastly different comedic voices on the fly. Now the series is facing another major challenge: four shows on the road, including a live show from Jon Stewart tonight at 11:30 p.m. ET. “I almost feel like we are so nimble now,” Amira said. “It’s a challenge, but it’s a fun challenge as a writer to have to adjust to that stuff.” Going into the DNC, Jon Stewart, who returned to executive produce the series through 2025 and host it one night a week through the election, was adamant about making “the most” of being at the Chicago event in person. During his first go-round as host, “The Daily Show” became known for its on-the-ground coverage at both the DNC and RNC. Former correspondent John Oliver even met his wife while covering the RNC for the show. “We’ve been talking a lot about going full coverage of it … ‘Let’s get on the floor of the convention and get our correspondents involved and talking to people. Let’s go around town and do field pieces,’ ” Amira said, pointing to this week’s pieces with governors Wes Moore and Gretchen Whitmer as well as correspondent pieces talking to delegates. “Let’s not just go to Chicago and then make a show there. Let’s make the most out of out of being here. I think we’ve done a good job at that.” Switching to this on-the-ground show didn’t come without its challenges. A big one was adjusting to the size of the Athenaeum Center. The Chicago staple can hold up to 950 occupants, a venue that is more than twice the size of the show’s studio home in New York. “I would liken it to if you’re playing an acoustic set in a coffee shop, and then you’re playing an arena show. You’re going to play that song differently,” Amira said. “That was something we found out on the first night, and that’s part of remembering. Again, it’s been eight years.” To account for the “high-energy” crowds, the team adjusted how they wrote their jokes, adding in more time for laughter and applause breaks than a typical “Daily Show” episode. “The hosts have done a great job in calibrating their delivery a little bit — waiting for that huge applause or that huge laughter to subside before you do the next joke. Otherwise, they’re not even going to hear the next thing you say. [The crowd] is literally too loud in there,” Amira said. “The Daily Show” has an even bigger challenge ahead of it tonight, given it’ll be airing a live episode hosted by Stewart. The series will air at 10:30 p.m. CT/8:30 p.m. PT, a mere 30 minutes after the DNC is expected to conclude its fourth night with Kamala Harris accepting the Democratic nomination. To prep for the show, the “Daily Show” plans to incorporate “themes and takeaways of the week” with commentary about what happens onstage. Amira admitted that writing a live show can get “pretty hectic at times.” Logistically, there are two rooms that exist during a live show: a room with Stewart and some of the “top people” and the writers room. When the first room decides on a topic they want to cover during the episode, they will typically write up a temporary joke before throwing it to the writers room for a punch up. “The writers will be incredibly fast, because they know it’s a time crunch, and send back 30 jokes in the next two minutes or something,” Amira said. The strongest joke then gets chosen, and the team moves on. “There’s not a lot of time to sit there and reflect on what you have,” Amira said. The team is typically writing up until the last second, “and sometimes even beyond that. We can’t help ourselves,” Amira added. It’s not uncommon for the team to look up and realize they only have five minutes left on the clock before they need to conclude an act. “Then, as soon as it’s over, you feel this wave of relief, and now it’s in Jon’s hands,” Amira said. “He’ll do a great job with it, obviously, just as he’s done before, but it’s a high pressure situation, for sure.” As for what fans can specifically expect tonight, Amira suspects there will be a lot of correspondent segments. “Jon loves getting the correspondents involved, especially on a special show like a live show. So I’m sure we’ll have even more correspondent involvement than usual, hopefully,” Amira said. “”Whatever comes tonight, we have to be nimble and work those into the script pretty much in real time. So that’ll be a fun challenge for us.” As high-stress as writing a live show on the fly may be, it’s one of the parts of this job that Amira loves. “Over 10 years now, I’ve done like a billion shows. If you don’t mix things up once in a while — even a great job like this and a great show — it can run the risk of delving into becoming monotonous,” Amira said. That desire for a challenge is also why he appreciates the current formula of “The Daily Show.” While Stewart consistently hosts on Mondays, each week the series alternates between senior correspondents Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng and Jordan Klepper as its hosts. “They bring a lot of their own preferences to the table, and they’re involved in the process, from start to finish. We might cover a story for Dessi that we wouldn’t cover for Ronny, or vice versa,” Amira said. “It’s very cool to have the ability to write all these different viewpoints and styles, and you’re not getting stuck in one ritual of how you write.”","summary":"Head writer Dan Amira describes preparing for Thursday's installment as going from \"an acoustic set in a coffee shop\" to \"playing an arena show\"\n\n\nThe post &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; at the DNC: Why the Show Is More Nimble Than Ever Ahead of Jon Stewart&#8217;s Live Episode appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/the-daily-show-jon-stewart-dnc-live-show-dan-amira-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/the-daily-show-news-team-comedy-central.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:56:00","author":"Kayla Cobb","authors":["Kayla Cobb"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.2},{"id":254718360,"title":"Ameshia Cross Talks Strategies for Harris with Just Two Months Left to Campaign","text":"Views 1.1K • Aug-22-2024 Ameshia Cross, former advisor to the Obama Campaign, tells NTD’s Luis Martinez about the challenges of a short campaign time ahead of the Harris-Walz ticket—and possible strategies for Kamala to tackle it. “She’s got to be in the battleground states, pounding the pavement regularly ...

The much anticipated moment follows a week of celebrating Joe Biden’s presidency while also crediting him for stepping aside to allow Harris an opportunity to run for president — a decision that has upended the polling trajectory of the 2024 election in the vice president’s favor. Keep reading to find livestream options for how to watch online Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the DNC. The DNC has been a veritable party, no pun intended, with a steady parade of everyone from folks up and down the Democratic Party’s ranks, Hollywood A-listers, pop music superstars and everyday citizens tapped by the Harris campaign to participate. Aside from the celebratory aspect of the Democratic National Convention, some of the most pressing issues facing the U.S. have been front and center. That was particularly true on Wednesday night when the daily theme of the DNC was “A Fight for Our Freedoms” — a nod to Project 2025, the Republican-led plan that Democrats say will reduce civil liberties and freedoms. On Thursday, the DNC’s theme is fittingly “For Our Future,” an obvious nod to Harris’ candidacy and the expectations that she will beat Donald Trump and become the next — or, future — president. The contents of Harris’ acceptance speech were not revealed ahead of her appearance on Thursday night. However, on the heels of her speech earlier this month laying out her plan for the economy, there is a good chance that Harris will at least address some other element of her planned presidential platforms that she will prioritize should she win the 2024 election in November and advance to the White House. Thursday is also the 10th wedding anniversary of Harris’ marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, making the day all that much more special. Aside from Harris’ speech, there is plenty more to look forward to at the DNC Thursday night. That includes an unverified report quickly gaining steam on social media that the Queen B herself — pop superstar Beyoncé — will make an appearance. If that happens, it would only add to the established star power that’s been on display at the DNC thus far, including Oprah Winfrey, former President Barack Obama and our Forever First Lady Michelle Obama on Wednesday night. There’s also a rumor that all-world singer Taylor Swift may be on the schedule. Here’s who is for sure confirmed to appear: • Texas Rep. and U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred • Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin • Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey • North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper • Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost • Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego • Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control activist and notable shooting survivor • Interior Secretary Deb Haaland • Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey • Arizona Sen, Mark Kelly • Former Rep.

The groundwork for her performance has been laid by her boss, US President Joe Biden, who said \"She is tough, experienced and has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story.\" Barack Obama tweaked his 2008 campaign \"Yes We Can\" to Yes, She Can\", to praise Ms Harris. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama termed Kamala Harris's story as \"the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country.\" Kamala Harris is expected to talk about her past experiences, and her life story from a successful lawyer to becoming the first Black, South Asian female Vice President in American history. The seasoned lawyer will present her case in front of the delegates at United Center Arena in Chicago. From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Ms Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump. Tim Walz, the Minnesota Governor, yesterday, accepted the Vice President nomination. He called it the \"honour of his life\" and shared his upbringing in a middle-class family in Nebraska, how he learned from helping his family on the farm and his experience of teaching students. These stories are intended to connect with the larger middle-class American population that is reeling through an economic slowdown coupled with inflation and unemployment. Mr Walz's son, Gus, stole the spotlight on day 3 of the event. The 17-year-old who is neurodivergent and has ADHD, was overcome with emotion as he watched his father take the stage. With tears streaming down his face, Gus stood up and proudly pointed at his dad, exclaiming, \"That's my dad!\". Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey endorsed the party's nominees. Ms Winfrey made a surprise entry yesterday and said \"What we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!\" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC.\" The chemistry between 59-year-old Harris and Walz and the noisy energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Donald Trump. A recent poll showed Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat. Immigration is set to be a key issue in the upcoming Presidential elections. A slowdown in the economy which leads to unemployment and inflation, deeply impacts the attitude towards immigration. The immigrants fear a second Trump term, who has been a staunch hardliner on such issues.","summary":"The Democratic National Convention, a four-day mega event which saw a tearful Joe Biden getting a farewell, and Kamala Harris making a surprise entry in a tan suit, will end today.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-take-the-stage-on-last-day-of-democratic-convention-6396362","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/4i5380b_kamala-harris-_625x300_20_August_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:50:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.423},{"id":254717136,"title":"What to know about Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey ahead of her DNC speech","text":"The NPR Network will be reporting live from Chicago throughout the week bringing you the latest on the Democratic National Convention. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, one of the first Democratic governors to suggest that President Joe Biden should end his reelection bid, will address the DNC Thursday night in Chicago. Healey is scheduled to speak shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris accepts the party’s presidential nomination. Healey was elected governor in 2022, becoming Massachusetts’ first female chief executive and the nation’s first openly lesbian governor. Like Harris, she is a former two-term attorney general. Her office initiated or joined dozens of legal challenges against the Trump administration. Healey is expected to highlight her experience working with Harris and talk about “the stark choice in this election between a convicted felon and a dedicated prosecutor for the people,” according to her office. In July, shortly after President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, Healey, a campaign surrogate for Biden, released a statement urging the president “to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump.” Soon after that, Healey joined fellow Democratic governors on a call to the White House, telling chief of staff Jeff Zients that Biden’s political position was “irretrievable,” according to the New York Times. Healey, 53, grew up on the New Hampshire coast, and found success in sports. At Harvard University, she co-captained the women's basketball team, and went on to play professionally in Austria. Healey, a 5’- 4” point guard, said despite her height, she was always comfortable competing on the court. \"I never even realized how short I was,\" Healey told WBUR. \"Being that small and playing that game, I think you learn a little bit about toughness. You learn about taking on bigger people and bigger interests.\" After two years playing in Austria, Healey returned to Massachusetts to attend law school at Northeastern University.","summary":"Massachusetts Gov.

Nikema Williams shared similar thoughts, telling the outlet that voters are “looking for that candidate to bring us together.” “I haven’t heard from many voters looking for white papers and policy papers.” Williams compared Harris to former President Donald Trump, saying “Harris is for thinking, looking toward the future and moving out of the hatred and division of Donald Trump‘s politics.” Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee agreed, saying that the election will not be decided on policy but rather on character values. “The American people think about this choice is less about the minutia of policy and more about the direction of the country, number one, and secondly, about the person, character it does matter,” he said. MAIN EVENT As Harris gears up for her acceptance speech, speculation is still swirling on who will take the stage to introduce the vice president. Dozens of celebrities have already shown their face inside Chicago’s United Center, including Oprah Winfrey, rapper Lil Jon, director Spike Lee, singer John Legend, and actress Mindy Kaling, among others. But viewers are growing anxious to see who will serve as the penultimate speaker on night four. Many have created their own lists, narrowing it down to Ella Emhoff, the daughter of Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Queen Bey herself, Beyoncé.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTOP lawmakers have urged Vice President Kamala Harris to focus on her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Leading Democrat emphasizes that Americans prioritize an individual&#8217;s character over their policies, while Kamala Harris prepares for a highly anticipated speech at the DNC. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/leading-democrat-emphasizes-that-americans-prioritize-an-individuals-character-over-their-policies-while-kamala-harris-prepares-for-a-highly-anticipated-speech-at-the-dnc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Top-Democrat-insists-Americans-‘care-about-character-not-policy-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:49:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":254719076,"title":"Police hunt Arizona man who threatened to kill Trump","text":"The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office says Syrvud is also wanted for failing to register as a sex offender.

Police say he is from Benson, Arizona, which is located about 50 miles (80km) south-east of Tucson. The Cochise County Sheriff's Office is asking the public for help to locate him. Mr Syrvud is described as a 6ft white male with white hair and green eyes. Trump spent Thursday in Cochise County, visiting the US-Mexico border. During his remarks, he sought to blame his rival, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, for allowing illegal immigrants into the US. The Republican's running mate, JD Vance, toured the same stretch of border in Sierra Vista several weeks ago. This isn't the first threat against a presidential candidate this election cycle. Earlier this month, a 66-year-old Virginia man was arrested on suspicion of making death threats against Vice-President Harris, among other public officials.","summary":"The search for a 66-year-old man who targeted Donald Trump in social media posts came as the ex-president visited the border state.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86l4p583y6o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d016/live/004c4670-60c4-11ef-bdfd-ad05dcd732b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:47:30","author":"Rachel Looker","authors":["Rachel Looker"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.072}]}
