He will have his day in court. The American public and the world will learn even more information through the legal process.”Who is Brian Cole?Cole lived in Woodbridge, Virginia, a Washington suburb, reported AP.He was arrested on Thursday morning local time and is scheduled to be arraigned in a federal court in Washington, DC, at 1 pm.AP reported that hours after Cole's arrest, law enforcement vehicles arrived in numbers in the area where his home is, and agents from the FBI helped shoo away onlookers. Presently, it is unclear what Cole will be charged with.Authorities say Cole could have ties to “anarchist” ideology, reported Right Angle News Network. The 6 Jan 2021 pipe bomb caseThe case pertains to the placing of two fully functional, potentially lethal pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters between approximately 7:30 pm and 8:30 pm on the evening of 5 January 2021.The bombs were discovered the following day, 15 to 17 hours later, around the time the US Capitol was overrun by rioters.Despite an extensive investigation over the years, including a $500,000 reward, investigators found it difficult to pinpoint a suspect, as per AP.CCTV footageSurveillance footage from the time the bombs were placed showed a hooded figure behind it all.At 7:40 pm on 5 Jan, the suspected bomber was seen standing in a residential neighborhood on South Capitol Street with a bag.Two minutes later., the suspect was seen seated on a bench in front of the DNC, where the first pipe bomb was reportedly placed under a bush.Subsequently, at 8:14 pm, the suspect was seen in an alleyway near the RNC, from where the second pipe bomb was found, as per ABC.Moments later, a security camera captured the suspect walking by the front of the Capitol Hill Club, adjacent to the RNC.Was anyone at the White House affected by the pipe bomb?Then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both came “within feet” of the two potentially lethal devices as they traveled to and from the DNC headquarters on South Capitol Street on 6 January, reported NY Post.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/what-was-the-jan-6-pipe-bomb-case-and-who-is-brian-cole-all-you-need-to-know-11764873554359.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/04/1600x900/logo/Brian_Cole_1764874526449_1764874526614.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 18:56:24","author":"Shiladitya Ray","authors":["Shiladitya Ray"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":385144852,"title":"Karoline Leavitt's top-streamed artist in 2025 is a Trump nemesis: Guess who?","text":"You don't know the Life of a Showgirl, Trump. It seems they stick together, if not in optics, surely in lyrics. If there's one thing that has the globe united right now, it's everyone's Spotify wrap. It's creating conversations and uniting people like no other thing has in 2025.In the MAGA world, foes are more permanent than friends and when it comes to Trump, he makes sure his enemies know who they are. The members of the Trump administration are just as supportive when it comes to their leader's choices. Among his staunch supporters is the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. But now, it seems there's one place where she has finally betrayed her idol. Karoline Leavitt's favourite pop starOn Wednesday, Leavitt revealed her most-streamed artists on the platform Spotify. While country star Morgan Wallen took the top spot in her wrap, Forrest Frank came second. The third and fourth spots were taken by Brandon Lake and Anne Wilson, both Christian worship singers. But guess who the fifth artist on Leavitt's list was? Taylor Swift, that's who! The 28-year-old shared the results on her Instagram stories proudly showing off Swift as her top 5 artists of 2025. Why is this shocking?Well, there's no one unaware of Trump and Taylor's feud. Swift has had no reaction to the White House using her songs in ICE videos, unlike the other artists in the fraternity. However, she did endorse Kamala Harris for President during the 2024 Presidential election campaign. As Trump's press secretary, Leavitt has been dragged into this tiff quite a few times and has had to answer for her boss even more often. In August, Trump even called Swift \"no longer hot\" in a Truth Social post, writing, “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”When asked about the post in a press meet Leavitt criticised her now top-artist saying, “Look, he is speaking about Taylor Swift’s political views and how perhaps it has impacted the support of the American public for her work, and I will leave it at that.”This also comes after Leavitt also said the \"Fate of Ophelia\" singer \"could not be trusted.\" “This woman has made a career off of writing songs about picking the wrong guy. We should not trust her to pick the wrong guy in this presidential election,” she said to right-wing YouTuber Benny Johnson. Guess we are all Taylor Swift fans, some openly, others inside the closet.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/karoline-leavitts-top-streamed-artist-in-2025-is-a-trump-nemesis-guess-who/articleshow/125774414.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125774502/125774502.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 00:30:00","author":"Toi Trending Desk","authors":["Toi Trending Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.3},{"id":385134142,"title":"FBI says Jan. 6 pipe bomb suspect purchased bomb parts in 2019","text":"The FBI said in the affidavit that cellphone location data and a license plate capture of Cole’s in the area on the night of the crime also helped them identify Cole as the pipe bomb suspect.\n\nAccording to an affidavit dated Dec. 3, Cole’s bank and credit card records show that as early as fall 2019, Cole began purchasing the same electrical wire, battery connectors, kitchen timers, steel wool, end caps, and galvanized pipe used in the devices planted on Jan. 5, 2021. The FBI stated that he made purchases from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Walmart, and Micro Center stores across northern Virginia, and that records link him to the exact brands and manufacturers used in the bombs.\n\nInvestigators say he bought at least six galvanized pipes matching the bomb casings, 14 end caps, multiple 9-volt battery connectors from a distributor that sold fewer than 8,000 nationwide, and two white kitchen timers matching those recovered at the scene. Agents also detailed a series of purchases of tools—wire strippers, sandpaper, a machinist’s file, and safety gear—consistent with home manufacturing.\n\nStrikingly, Cole continued buying bomb components even after Jan. 6, including more galvanized pipe, timers, and batteries purchased between Jan. 21 and Jan. 23, 2021, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance trail and cell-tower mapping\n\nThe affidavit lays out a detailed reconstruction of the pipe bomber’s movements between 7:34 p.m. and 8:18 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2021. Surveillance footage released years ago by the FBI showed a masked figure in a gray hoodie, Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers, gloves, and glasses carrying a backpack through Capitol Hill’s residential blocks.\n\nA forensic height analysis conducted in 2021 placed the bomber at approximately 5’7”, within one inch of Cole’s recorded height.\n\nThe FBI’s Cellular Analysis Survey Team matched pings from Cole’s cellphone to specific towers and near the RNC and DNC at times that align almost perfectly with the movements caught on surveillance video. A license plate reader also captured his 2017 Nissan Sentra as it turned off I-395 into the Capitol Hill area, minutes before the footage shows the suspect appearing on foot.\n\nCole had limited spending history in Washington, D.C., but the FBI cited a notable Dec. 14, 2020, restaurant purchase he made three weeks before the pipe bombs were placed. The restaurant was located directly across from Rumsey Court, the same alley where the bomber was filmed walking shortly before planting one of the devices.\n\nFBI leadership touts case after years of scrutiny\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who has said the case was a top priority since joining the bureau in March, said at a news conference that the arrest was the result of grinding forensic work, rather than new leads. In fact, FBI and DOJ leaders stated that they collected no new evidence in the case and instead solved it by examining existing evidence from the Biden DOJ.\n\n“You’re not going to walk into our capital city, put down two explosive devices and walk off into the sunset,” Bongino said. “We were gonna track this person to the end of the earth.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said there was “no new tip” and “no new witness” that led to the identification of a suspect, adding that the bureau and its partner agencies succeeded only after revisiting evidence long in hand. The case had become a symbol of the FBI’s investigative lapses under former Director Christopher Wray, stoking speculation about the political motives of the FBI’s failure to follow the evidence it had.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said agents sifted through three million lines of data, including years of cell-tower records and video surveillance.\n\n“When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant. When you get a search warrant, you get an address. When you get an address, you hit the house, and that’s what we did,” Patel said.\n\nFederal agents raided Cole’s home Thursday, sealing off the quiet cul-de-sac as bomb technicians searched his residence and car.\n\nA politically charged cold-case breakthrough\n\nThe bombs were discovered separately but nearly simultaneously around 1 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, just as Congress began certifying former President Joe Biden’s electoral victory. Investigators later determined that both then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) passed within feet of the devices hours before they were found.\n\nA House Republican report released earlier this year blasted the FBI for making “little meaningful progress” in the case after February 2021, accusing the bureau of diverting resources and providing Congress with “no substantive updates.”\n\nBefore joining the FBI, Bongino himself had publicly suggested the bombing was an “inside job.” Bondi leaned into that frustration Thursday, saying the case “languished for four years” until the Trump administration revived it.\n\nStill, significant questions remain for the current administration despite the DOJ’s success at finally finding a suspect. It’s unclear why the current administration required more than 10 months to solve the case if such compelling evidence was already available to the FBI, and officials declined on Thursday to answer questions about when officials finally zeroed in on Cole or whether anyone else was involved or knew about Cole’s plans.\n\nJAN. 6 PIPE BOMBS SUSPECT ARRESTED USING NO ‘NEW INFORMATION’: DOJ\n\nDuring a press conference at the DOJ headquarters on Thursday afternoon, officials repeatedly declined to answer specific questions, vowing that future court filings would address many of the public’s questions about the FBI’s handling of the case.\n\nCole made his initial appearance at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., on Thursday afternoon.","summary":"A Virginia man charged with planting pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot had allegedly been stockpiling bomb components for more than a year before placing the bombs, even continuing to purchase parts afterwards, according to a newly unsealed FBI affidavit.

For example, when Ms. Bolger was asking questions about an AP article about Ms. Loomer dated September 11, 2024, Mr. Klayman stated the following:\n\nMr. Klayman: Objection. What's the relevancy of this? It's written by Associated Press … a Trump-hating organization, which the Israelis even had to bomb their building in Gaza because they were supporting Hamas.\n\nAs Ms. Bolger questioned Ms. Loomer about additional articles, Mr. Klayman improperly commented that the articles were from \"leftist Trump-hating publications\"; and \"ultra-leftist rags … [w]hich have no credibility at all.\" Mr. Klayman accused Ms. Bolger of \"pull[ing] out all your friends in the leftist media to try to smear [Loomer] on a public record?\" And he told Ms. Bolger that the articles \"will never come into evidence. You can have your fun right now, but that will be the last fun you have.\"\n\nMr. Klayman also improperly advised Ms. Loomer not to answer questions about whether the First Amendment protects her right to give her opinion or make jokes. Rule 30(c)(2) provides only three justifications for instructing a deponent not to answer a question—i.e., to preserve a privilege; to enforce a limitation imposed by the court; or to present a Rule 30(d)(3) motion. [Rule 30(d)(3) provides, in relevant part, \"At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.\" -EV] Here, Mr. Klayman did not raise any of these objections, nor did he move for a protective order…. [C]ounsel violates Rule 30(d)(3) by instructing a deponent not to answer questions but never moving for a protective order ….\n\nMoreover, Mr. Klayman violated his professional responsibility when he declined to restrain Ms. Loomer's patently improper conduct at her deposition. Objectively, Ms. Loomer was a difficult witness. She repeatedly argued with Ms. Bolger and went on tangents unrelated to any pending question. At one point, she told Ms. Bolger: \"I know what you're doing. I know what type of people you are. You're fucking Democrats: okay? You represent the filthiest fucking people in our country—Democrats scumbags.\" {The Court was also concerned by Ms. Bolger's response—which was in a taunting, patronizing tone—\"I thought you didn't like the word, \"fuck,\" Ms. Loomer? I thought you were offended by the word fuck.\"} Ms. Loomer accused Ms. Bolger of \"hat[ing] America.\"\n\nIncredulously, Mr. Klayman took no action to rein in this outrageous conduct. And on at least one occasion, he appeared to egg Ms. Loomer on when she was refusing to directly answer what she meant by her own tweet about Marjorie Taylor Green and the meaning of the phrase \"Arby's in your pants.\" Mr. Klayman asked, \"[w]here's the meat?\" and Ms. Loomer, who was laughing, quipped, \"[i]t's in her pants.\" As an officer of the Court, Mr. Klayman's complete failure to check Ms. Loomer's wildly inappropriate behavior was inexcusable.\n\nMs. Bolger was clearly frustrated by Ms. Loomer's failure to directly answer questions, some of which were bordering on the absurd. {For example, Ms. Loomer's testimony surrounding her own tweet about Marjorie Taylor Green and the meaning of the phrase \"Arby's in your pants\" is objectively ridiculous.} Unfortunately, in a few instances, Ms. Bolger lost her cool and took the bait. For example, when Ms. Loomer obfuscated about the meaning of a previous tweet she had made about Kamala Harris {\"I guess you would know a thing or two about trashy Montel Williams, given the fact that you dated and stuck your cock inside Kamala Harris many years ago. I've heard everything her infested snatch touches also dies a miserable, painful death.\"}, Ms. Bolger taunted Ms. Loomer to answer with statements like, \"I thought you were a First Amendment warrior who was fearless in what you say\" and called her a \"coward.\" There is simply no excuse for this name-calling.\n\nLikewise, when Ms. Loomer wouldn't directly respond to questions about whether the First Amendment protects her right to give her opinion or make jokes—and Mr. Klayman improperly instructed her not to answer—Ms. Bolger lapsed into unprofessional conduct.. Rather than seeking assistance from the Court, Ms. Bolger continued to repeatedly ask the same (or similar) question, and as she grew more exasperated even asked, \"Isn't it the case that, in the United States of America, the First Amendment express[es] a right to have opinions; and isn't that fucking fantastic?\" She repeatedly asked Ms. Loomer if she was going to take her lawyer's instruction and attempted to goad her into a response with jabs about being a \"free speech warrior.\" At one point, Ms. Bolger even stated, \"God. It's embarrassing that you, the free speech warrior, won't answer a simple question like that.\"\n\nSadly, the deposition transcripts are replete with countless other instances of unprofessional conduct. Rather than taking personal responsibility for their own misconduct, counsel largely points to the misdeeds of opposing counsel to somehow offset their behavior. However, \"[m]utual enmity does not excuse the breakdown of decorum\" that occurred at the depositions. The Court cannot, and will not, ignore counsel's unacceptable conduct….\n\nAccordingly, on or before December 18, 2025, Mr. Klayman and Ms. Bolger must show cause why, for the conduct described, they should not be sanctioned under the Court's authority to maintain standards of civility and professionalism. Sanctions may include, but by no means limited to: nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty to the Court; an order revoking special admission; a Local Rule 2.04 referral to a grievance committee; or some combination of these sanctions.","summary":"The magistrate judge is not amused.","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/04/lawyer-hijinks-in-laura-loomers-and-bill-mahers-deposition/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/reason-logo-featured-placeholder.jpg.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 23:06:37","author":"Eugene Volokh,Jeff Luse","authors":["Eugene Volokh","Jeff Luse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":385140058,"title":"Trump Hints MAGA Crowd Is Stupid as He Declares 'Smart People Don't Like Me' in Embarrassing Video... as Support for Prez Dwindles","text":"Despite his increasingly low approval ratings and serious concerns about his mental and physical health, Donald Trump was ready and willing to crack jokes at the expense of his loyal supporters.\n\nThe president was caught throwing shade at MAGA voters by insinuating they're not as intelligent as his critics in an embarrassing video taken at his private New Jersey golf club, RadarOnline.com can reveal.Dressed in his signature navy suit and red tie, the controversial politician clutched a microphone as he addressed what appeared to be an exclusive crowd at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. \n\nWhile the video is making its rounds on social media is only five seconds long, Trump seemingly revealed his true thoughts about Americans who voted for him in three presidential elections. \n\n\"Smart people don't like me, you know,\" Trump said as the room burst out in laughter. \"And they don't like what we talk about.\"Social media users were quick to amplify Trump's own words and mock his supporters, including those seen with him in the video. \n\n\"And the dummies that do like him are standing there smiling like the idiots Trump knows they are,\" one X user said as a second echoed, \"Do the people in the room understand he’s insulting them to their faces?\" \n\n\"I like him calling his own followers dumb,\" quipped a third user as another mocked, \"That's why they're smart!\" \n\n\"Don't worry, Trump. The dumb ones are starting to catch on, too,\" warned a user.Trump 'Loves the Poorly Educated'Many pointed out similar past remarks from Trump, including when he boasted about loving \"uneducated people\" after seizing a key victory in February 2016. \n\n\"We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated,\" then-candidate Trump said in his speech after winning the Nevada Republican caucuses. \n\nWhile critics branded Trump's comments insulting, his supporters insisted his words were being taken out of context. \n\nExit poll data have consistently found Trump has benefitted from voters without a four-year college degree in each of his presidential campaigns, and given the nature of politics, it's safe to assume the president has been informed of his base's demographics.No College Degree? No ProblemAccording to a Pew Research Center analysis of the 2024 presidential election, Trump held a 14-point advantage among voters without advanced degrees over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris at 56 percent to 42 percent. \n\nIn fact, data revealed his support among the so-called \"poorly uneducated\" doubled from the 2016 election. Harris, on the other hand, saw more support from voters with college degrees at 57 percent to Trump's 41 percent. \n\nMany critics and political pundits have pointed to exit polls and Trump's own statements about his base while condemning his administration's overhaul of the Department of Education. \n\nCritics have accused the Trump administration of enacting policies intentionally designed to gut the public school system and discourage higher learning. \n\nTrump recently faced backlash after he signed a provision that demoted numerous advanced degrees, including nursing, social work, physical therapy, and physician assistant programs, from \"professional\" to \"non-professional\" status. \n\nUnder the provision, federal student loan borrowing limits were substantially reduced.","summary":"Donald Trump seemingly dissed his own supporters while speaking at his private New Jersey golf club.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-shades-maga-voters-admits-smart-people-dont-like-me/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/AHsTfMLas/0x0/donald-trump-shades-maga-admits-smart-people-dont-like-me-2-1764887273112.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 23:05:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":385132980,"title":"Top Trump FBI officials claimed pipe bombs were an FBI 'inside job'","text":"WASHINGTON – Prior to joining the Trump administration, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino promoted conspiracy theories about the pipe bombs planted in Washington, DC, ahead of the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, going as far as calling it an “inside job.”\n\nThe Department of Justice, which includes the FBI, identified a suspect in the case on Dec. 4 after a nearly five-year investigation.\n\nBut years before, both Patel and Bongino repeatedly cast doubt on the investigation into the pipe bombs found outside the facilities, specifically the one found at the Democratic National Committee headquarters because Kamala Harris, who was then-vice president-elect, was at the facility. \n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, alongside Patel and Bongino, on Dec. 4 identified Brian Cole Jr., 30, of Woodbridge, Virginia, as the suspect in the investigation into the pipe bombs found outside both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters. \n\nCole is being charged with use of an explosive device as more search warrants were still being executed on Dec. 4, Bondi said at a press conference.\n\n“You're not going to walk into our Capital city, put down two explosive devices and walk off in the sunset,” Bongino said at the news conference on Dec. 4. “Not going to happen. We were going to track this person to the end of the earth.”\n\nConspiracy theories surrounding pipe bomb case\n\nPatel and Bongino praised President Donald Trump’s FBI and Justice Department in finding the suspect in the pipe bomb case. But last year, they promoted conspiracy theories about whether the incident actually happened.\n\nIn a January 2024 interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, Patel called the case “extremely troubling.” \n\n“If the allegations aren't true, or there was some government ruse, or some FBI rogue source or whatever… then there is another corruption scandal in and around an election time narrative that they're advancing,” Patel said.\n\nBongino claimed the pipe bomb case was a “setup” and an “inside job\" in several episodes of his show, The Dan Bongino Show, spanning several years from 2022 to just last year.\n\n“I have zero doubt it was a setup,” Bongino said on his show in January 2024. “Was it government? I don't know. I'm not going to speculate on who did it. Someone who hated Donald Trump planted those bombs there.”\n\nIn a September 2024 episode, Bongino claimed a whistleblower told him that a government contractor planted the pipe bombs “to set up a fake assassination plot on Kamala Harris to basically generate sympathy, to shut down people from questioning the vote on January 6.” \n\n\"There is a massive cover-up because the person who planted those pipe bombs, they don't want you to know who it was, because it's either a connected anti-Trump insider, or this was an inside job,\" he said on his show in November 2024.\n\nPatel points fingers in pipe bomb investigation\n\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September, Patel, who was now the head of the FBI, defended himself and Bongino as being “private citizens” when those comments were made.\n\n“What we have the ability to do is set aside our personal beliefs to deliver the mission of justice for this country and we're doing it day in and day out,” he said.\n\nShortly after officials announced the pipe bomb suspect on Dec. 4, Patel quickly appeared on Don Trump Jr.’s podcast Triggered and criticized the Biden administration's FBI for how the case was handled.\n\n“We said, ‘hey, let’s let cops be cops. We got video, let’s enhance it. We have cell phone data that wasn’t triaged properly, let’s triage it. We have the technology and the capability to do it and let’s go back and work with the investigative team and ask them where the pitfalls were,” he said.\n\n“I want to remind everybody, they took four years off,” Patel added. “We put eight months of hard work into this.”\n\nContributing: Natalie Neysa Alund, Bart Jansen, Sarah D.

I think it’s kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic.” Vance offered the comments — his first on the subject since Cruz began raising it — during an interview inside his West Wing office, wading into an issue that has roiled his party in recent weeks amid a broader focus on antisemitism by the Trump administration. Sipping from a cup of coffee while a fireplace crackled behind him, he also volunteered the names of three progressives he said he has come to appreciate, for various reasons: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. And the vice president talked about what he views as key areas of progress and disappointment since he and President Donald Trump were inaugurated in January, including recognizing that voters are “impatient” to see more progress on prices and the economy. Increased deportations and the sharp decline in illegal border crossings, Vance said, stand among the administration’s early victories. “I think Kristi’s done a good job. I think Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, all these people have done a very good job,” said Vance, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials involved in U.S. border and immigration policy. “That’s where you see the clearest numbers and the most immediate return on all of our time and all of our hard work, and so that’s what I’m proudest of.” Vance, who has played a role in Middle East diplomacy and efforts to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, said he feels he was most effective this year in helping Trump get his signature “big beautiful bill” through Congress. Vance helped whip support for the legislation and cast the tie-breaking vote to clinch passage of the tax and spending bill in the Senate. “I spent hours at the Capitol with a bunch of United States senators, late into the night on the first vote, and I frankly didn’t know whether we were going to be able to get it passed, and we did,” Vance said. “And we did because the president was making phone calls, and we did because I was there encouraging people to vote the right way. That’s probably where I see the most tangible connection between the hard work that I did and a good outcome for the American people.” Asked about his biggest frustration so far as vice president, Vance cited the failure so far to broker a deal to end Russia’s war against Ukraine. “Oh, man. I mean, look, the Russia-Ukraine thing has been a source of perennial frustration, I think, for the entire White House,” Vance said. “I think that we really thought — and you’ve heard the president say this a million times — that that would be the easiest war to solve. And if you would put, you know, peace in the Middle East as easier to achieve than peace in Eastern Europe, I would have told you you were crazy.” Vance added that he remained optimistic. “I do think, for what it’s worth, that we have made a lot of progress, but we’re not yet quite across the finish line there,” he said. “I think there’s hope — should hopefully be some good news the next few weeks on that front.” The vice president also expressed frustration that prices have not come down as fast as he and Trump promised on the campaign trail last year, while deflecting the blame onto former President Joe Biden. He cited several metrics, including a four-month drop in rent, as signs of better days to come. Trump, meanwhile, has chosen a different message, arguing in recent days that Americans’ affordability concerns are part of a “fake narrative.” “I think the president certainly understands that prices got way too high,” Vance said when asked about Trump’s remarks. “But I think what the president’s saying is the idea that, 11 months into the administration, that we could solve all of the affordability problems created by Democrats — I mean, that’s the hoax. The hoax is the idea that it’s our fault and not the Democrats’ fault. And I do think that’s a totally bulls--- narrative.” Recent polls have shown Americans are unhappy with Trump’s management of the economy. In an NBC News poll conducted in late October, 63% of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said they felt Trump had fallen short of their expectations on the economy. “I think the voters will ultimately have to make that choice,” Vance said. “I certainly see some of the polling that you’ve seen. But I think that the reason why we have elections every two years and not every year, at least for Congress, thank God, is you’ve got to give a little bit of time for this stuff to work.” “I think I would certainly say voters are impatient. I think voters have every right to be impatient,” Vance continued. “We are impatient, too, and we’re going to see if what we do and what we think we have to do converges with what the voters think we should be doing.” Next year’s midterm elections will help answer that question, Vance added. “We’ll find that out in about a year,” he said, “and we’re just going to keep on working as hard as we can until then.” The midterms also are a key waypoint for Vance as he weighs a campaign to succeed the term-limited Trump in 2028. Vance has routinely sidestepped questions about his political future by saying “the politics will sort themselves out” if he and Trump do a good job. He jokingly repeated that talking point when reminded of it Thursday and asked under what circumstances he would not seek the presidency. “We’re going to find out a lot in the midterms and afterwards — what we got right, what we got wrong, what we could have done better on, what we did very well on,” he said. “I try to not wake up and ever think, ‘What does this mean for my future?’ I always try to think, ‘How can I do a good job right now,’ right? And that’s one of the reasons why I’ve tried to steer away from the 2028 conversation. … I never want the focus on the future to come at the expense of this job.” Vance steered away again when pressed with the same question that haunted then-Vice President Kamala Harris while running for president last year. Vance and other Republicans ridiculed Harris when, during an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently than Biden. Vance at the time cast it as Harris whiffing on a “softball” question, but he asserted Thursday that it was too soon to lob it at him. “The president really needs a vice president who is loyal to him and doesn’t use the media to backstab or to set himself up well for 2028,” Vance said. “So what you will never hear me do in this job is attack the president of the United States. Of course, if I run for another office in the future, it’s going to be reasonable for people to ask me, ‘Would you have done this thing? Would you have done that thing?’ And if that time ever comes, let’s have that conversation. But I am never going to attack the president of the United States.” While Vance said there’s no Democrat who greatly worries him as a potentially strong 2028 presidential contender, he singled out Sanders, Khanna and Mamdani. “I’ve always been fascinated by Bernie,” Vance said. “I will one day tell you what Bernie said to me, like the second day that I was in the United States Senate. It’s one of the funniest things that I’ve ever heard, and it’s actually a pretty good summary of my politics, but it would probably really hurt me on both the left and the right. If I told you what Bernie told me, it would probably hurt Bernie, too.” Khanna, Vance noted, has sparred with him on social media. “I think sometimes he’s very annoying, but he also — he occasionally will say something interesting, which is more than I could say for most politicians,” Vance said. And Vance described Mamdani, the democratic socialist mayor-elect who recently had a friendly Oval Office visit with Trump, as “fascinating.” “Obviously, I’m not a communist, and I think he is,” Vance added, “but the fact that he focuses so aggressively on the affordability question in New York City, which does have one of the worst affordability crises anywhere in the world, is smart, and he’s at least listening to people. He continued: “Most politicians, it’s a very low bar, but they don’t even listen to people. I would put Mamdani, Bernie and Ro Khanna in the category of those who, at least sometimes, they are.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/vance-says-antisemitism-isnt-exploding-right-rcna247414","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-jd-vance-gk-c98422.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 22:19:22","author":"Henry J.

She said he was charged with use of an explosive device and that more search warrants were still being executed on Dec. 4.\n\n“There could be more charges to come,” Bondi told reporters. \"There was no new tip. There was no new witness, just good diligent police work and prosecutorial work.\"\n\n'No way he was getting away': Bongino\n\nBondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said authorities focused on evidence they already had, rather than receiving new tips.\n\n“You're not going to walk into our Capital city, put down two explosive devices and walk off in the sunset,” Bongino said. “Not going to happen. We were going to track this person to the end of the earth. There was no way he was getting away.”\n\nOfficials noted the alleged pipe bomber was from Woodbridge, a city roughly 25 miles from Washington. Bondi did not disclose Cole’s alleged motive, saying the investigation is ongoing.\n\nOn Don Trump Jr.’s podcast, Triggered, Patel repeatedly criticized the Biden administration's handling of the case.\n\n\"The key piece here is we didn’t come up with a new piece of information that didn’t exist five years ago,\" he said.\n\nPatel said directly after the news conference that a “crystal clear” timeline and picture of what happened will come in 24 hours when the suspect makes his first appearance in court. He also indicated that the FBI has searched Cole’s place of work and has already spoken with him.\n\nInvestigators find 'needle in a haystack': Pirro\n\nCole bought components that were consistent with the bombs from October 2019 through November 2020, including the galvanized pipe, end caps, electrical wire, battery clips and white kitchen timers, according to court records. Investigators tracked Cole’s purchases at Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart and Micro Center.\n\nCole also bought items such as safety glasses, a wire-stripping tool and a machinist’s file, which could be used to make pipe bombs, according to court records. The man continued to buy the components after the pipe bombs were found, including a kitchen timer, more nine-volt batteries and galvanized pipes during January 2021.\n\nJeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for Washington, said investigators sifted through millions of pieces of data to find the suspect.\n\nInvestigators reviewed the sale of 233,000 black end caps like the ones used on the pipe bombs, to find potential connections to the suspect, according to Pirro. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said officers reviewed thousands of hours of closed-circuit television recordings.\n\nInvestigators also tracked the whereabouts of Cole's cellphone the day the bombs were planted, based on contacts with cellphone towers, which was consistent with where the bombs were left, according to court records.\n\n“It was a huge win because it was like finding a needle in a haystack,” Pirro said.\n\nThe explosives were placed near the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, according to the FBI. Authorities deactivated the bombs and neither exploded.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Georgia, the head of a House committee reviewing the Jan. 6 investigation, called the arrest “a tremendous breakthrough in a mystery that has haunted the country for nearly five years.”\n\nThe bombs were discovered on the same day supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.\n\nThe FBI had offered a $500,000 reward and received hundreds of tips in the search for the suspect.\n\nVideos released by FBI show hooded person carrying backpacks\n\nThe identity of the person who placed the pipe bombs has been one of the lingering mysteries of the Jan. 6 insurrection, with dozens of FBI agents tasked with tracking them down in the weeks after. The focus was aimed in part at determining how much of the day’s violence had been planned, according to details of the investigation first fully outlined in a report released in January by a House Judiciary subcommittee.\n\nOne bomb was found near a dumpster outside the Republican Party headquarters, and the other near a bush and garage entrance to the Democratic National Committee building. Kamala Harris, who was then vice president-elect, was inside the Democratic National Committee office when the first bomb was found.\n\nAgents collected surveillance and doorbell camera footage from the area and focused on a person in a gray hooded sweatshirt and sneakers. They determined that the bombs were operable, scoured businesses where the parts could have been sourced and crawled through credit card purchase records, the report said. They identified the shoes and backpack worn by the would-be bomber in security footage, and identified and cleared multiple suspects without releasing their names.\n\nThe devices were placed between 7:30 and 8:30 the night before the riots, officials previously said.\n\nAt times, the search for the pipe bomber appeared to become lost in what was the largest investigation in FBI history, as agents and prosecutors waded through security video, body camera footage and social media to identify the thousands of people who clashed with police and entered the Capitol.\n\nFBI worked around the clock\n\nMore than 1,200 people were convicted in connection with the riot, with more than a third involving attacks on law enforcement. Trump pardoned most of those convicted in relation to the Jan. 6 attack when he was inaugurated in January.\n\nStill, work continued within the FBI on the shocking pipe bomb incident. Every January, officials renewed their pledge to keep working on the case. On the fourth anniversary, David Sundberg, the then chief of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, told NPR that the bureau remained convinced that “there are people that still know something.”\n\nDan Bongino, before becoming deputy director of the FBI in Trump's second term, told his podcast listeners in January that the pipe bomb case was “the biggest scandal in FBI history” and that the FBI knew the identity of the bomber and “just doesn’t want to tell us because it was an inside job.”\n\nBongino posted on X Nov. 13 that the bureau remains “passionate about solving this case” and that the FBI had been working around the clock “on RECENT open source leads in the case.”\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a press conference announcing the arrest of Brian Cole Jr. that existing evidence led to the FBI’s breakthrough in a cold case that had \"languished\" for nearly five years. \"What I will tell you is that evidence has been sitting there collecting dust,\" Bondi said. \"This wasn't a new tip. It wasn't some new evidence. It was the hard work of President Trump's administration.\" Bondi said federal investigators were able to identify Cole after spending months \"sifting through evidence that had been sitting at the FBI with the Biden administration.\" She said that bringing charges against Cole was not a result of any new witnesses or leads but rather \"good, diligent police work and prosecutorial work.\" FBI ARRESTS SUSPECT IN DC PIPE BOMB CASE AFTER 5-YEAR INVESTIGATION Court papers unsealed Thursday revealed that bank records showing purchases of the pipe bomb material and cell phone tower data were used to identify Cole. The suspect is now in custody facing charges of using explosives, with more charges possible, and he is expected to make his first court appearance Friday. Surveillance footage released by the FBI showed an unidentified suspect in a hoodie planting two explosive devices near the Republican and Democratic National Committees’ headquarters on the night of Jan. 5, 2021. Authorities said the devices were \"viable\" and could have detonated. The first one was discovered by a woman out in an alleyway doing her laundry, investigative reports said. She immediately reported her finding to the police, spurring a search that led to the discovery of the second bomb, the reports said. A congressional report revealed that the FBI during the Biden administration began \"diverting resources\" away from the investigation at the end of February 2021, after less than two months. \"In the immediate aftermath of January 6, the FBI’s case team worked aggressively to cultivate and pursue leads toward apprehending the pipe bomb suspect,\" the report stated, but added that the inquiry might have fizzled out because of a lack of credible leads. The years-long mystery left many in Trump’s base raising questions and theories about the case. Speculation centered on the discovery of the bombs timing up with the riot on Jan. 6 and the security failures that allowed top politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, to unwittingly come into proximity with the explosives. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino was among the top voices promoting the theory, before he joined the bureau, that the Biden administration was hiding evidence about the case and that planting the bombs was an \"inside job.\" DOJ leaders have given no information on the suspect's motive and said the investigation is in an early stage. FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR CLAIMS BUREAU ‘CLOSING IN’ ON SUSPECTS WHO PLANTED JAN. 6 PIPE BOMBS At the press conference, Bongino said he made the pipe bomb case a top priority, a remark that comes after he told Fox News in May that the bureau was \"closing in\" on suspects.

The Eras Tour headliner closed out 2025 as Spotify’s most-streamed artist in the United States, as well as the second-most-listened-to artist in the world, just behind Bad Bunny.\n\nThose stats certainly contradict President Donald Trump’s claim earlier this year that Swift isn’t as popular as she once was. “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” he wrote on Truth Social in May.\n\nThe twice-impeached POTUS has also indicated that Swift’s vocal support of Democratic politicians and her opposition to the Trump administration would cause Republican fans to boycott her music. In September, after the singer endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris, for the presidency, Trump said, “I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time … She’s a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Despite a staggering reward of £394,000 ($500,000) for information, the trail went cold. That changed Thursday, when a suspect was taken into custody not because of a public tip, but through what new FBI leadership describes as a complete overhaul of the investigation.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel revealed exclusively that Brian Cole was arrested based on 'old-fashioned police work' and a renewed investigative push under the Trump administration. The breakthrough solves a high-profile case that loomed over the nation's capital since the eve of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, with Patel taking direct aim at the previous administration's lack of success.\n\nWhy A £394,000 Reward Went Untouched For Years\n\nThe significant reward offered by the FBI during the Biden administration ultimately yielded no results in identifying the person responsible for planting pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters. For years, the culprit remained at large, a ghost in one of the most scrutinised security events in modern American history. This failure occurred even as the FBI successfully prosecuted hundreds of individuals involved in the Capitol riot itself.\n\nThe arrest of Brian Cole on Thursday morning in a quiet Woodbridge, Virginia, cul-de-sac marks a pivotal moment in the long-dormant case. FBI agents descended on the property to collect evidence, finally putting a face to the suspect who had eluded them for almost five years. The capture was achieved without any new public intelligence, rendering the substantial financial incentive irrelevant.\n\nPatel Details 'Relentless' New FBI Strategy\n\nAccording to Director Patel, the case was cracked after he ordered a complete re-evaluation of the investigation upon taking office. He stated that the previous leadership's four-year effort had produced 'no success', prompting his team to start from scratch. This rebooted effort proved decisive.\n\n'The FBI examined every piece of information available, leveraged new technology, brought in experts from around the country, and methodically developed the evidence needed to nail this suspect', Patel explained. He made it clear that the arrest was not a stroke of luck or the result of a sudden confession. 'This breakthrough didn't come from new tips, it came from relentless FBI work'.\n\nThe gravity of the original crime was underscored by the fact that then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came dangerously close to the explosive devices on January 6. The bombs were planted along a route they travelled to and from the DNC headquarters, highlighting the potential for catastrophic harm.\n\nA Focused Bureau Finally Delivers Results\n\nPatel emphasised that his agency's renewed approach was key to bringing the suspect to justice. The investigation was not just continued but fundamentally re-engineered to find new leads from existing evidence that had long been available. Patel's comments suggest the crucial information needed to solve the case was there all along, but the previous investigation was unable to piece it together.\n\n'Our team re-examined the case from the ground up', Patel said, noting that his leadership constructed a new evidentiary trail and secured the warrants that led to Cole's arrest. He framed the success as a testament to a reformed agency, one that can deliver on its promises to the public when properly directed. 'This is what a focused, disciplined Bureau delivers for the American people', he added, a clear signal that after years of questions, federal investigators finally had their man, even as the massive reward went untouched.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"FBI Director Kash Patel reveals a rebooted investigation led to the arrest of DC pipe bomb suspect Brian Cole, solving a case where a £394,000 reward went unclaimed.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/kash-patel-flaunts-relentless-fbi-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-seized-leaving-500k-gathering-dust-3791976","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4636155/kash-patel.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 21:54:53","author":"Pete Hegseth Over","authors":["Pete Hegseth Over"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":385117808,"title":"What Are the Charges Against Brian Cole Jr, Accused in the January 6 Pipe Bomb Case?","text":"A Virginia man has been arrested and charged with planting pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican National Committees on the eve of the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot, US federal officials say. ,Brian Cole Jr, 30, from Woodbridge, Virginia, was taken into custody on Thursday morning and charged with transporting explosives across state lines with intent to kill or injure, as well as attempted malicious destruction. Authorities said additional charges were possible. ,According to federal investigators, Cole began assembling the devices as early as 2019, purchasing materials including electrical wire, battery connectors and explosive caps from local retailers. A probable cause affidavit also states he bought steel wool, end caps and galvanised pipe throughout 2020. ,At a news conference in Washington, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the case had been a priority for the bureau since he took office in March.,,\"You're not going to walk into our capital city, put down two explosive devices and walk off into the sunset,\" he told reporters. \"Not gonna happen. We were gonna track this person to the end of the earth. There was no way he was getting away.\" ,FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators had reviewed \"three million lines of information\", including extensive mobile phone data. \"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant,\" he said. \"When you get a search warrant, you get an address. When you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did.\",Also Read: Who Is Brian Cole? Suspect Arrested In January 6th Pipe Bomb Investigation ,The arrest marks a significant development in a case that has troubled investigators for nearly five years, and one that has long fuelled speculation about the identity of the person seen on surveillance footage placing the devices on 5 January 2021. ,Authorities say both bombs were \"viable explosive devices\" and were planted by an individual wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt, mask, gloves, glasses and Nike Air Max Speed Turf trainers. The devices were discovered the following afternoon, around 17 hours later, as Congress convened to certify Joe Biden's election victory — a session halted when rioters breached the US Capitol., ,According to investigators, cell-tower data placed Cole near Capitol Hill at the time the bombs were planted. The affidavit also notes that then Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi passed \"within feet\" of the devices as they travelled to and from the DNC headquarters that day. Pelosi's motorcade later drove past one of the bombs after it had been located by law enforcement. ,Cole's arrest comes nearly a year after a congressional report criticised the pace of the investigation, saying \"little meaningful progress\" had been made and accusing federal agencies of withholding updates from lawmakers. The report, released by Representatives Barry Loudermilk and Thomas Massie, said the FBI had diverted resources away from the case by February 2021 despite having \"a promising array of data\". ,Neighbours in Cole's Woodbridge cul-de-sac described him as quiet and withdrawn.

Rounding out her top five artists was Swift. \n\nLeavitt isn’t the only person in Trump’s inner circle to have a soft spot for the Grammy-winning singer. In fact, his 14-year-old granddaughter, Arabella, is known for being a loyal Swiftie.\n\nIn July 2024, Arabella celebrated her 13th birthday with a Swift-themed birthday cake. In an Instagram photo shared by her mother, Ivanka, the young teen was pictured holding a white, heart-shaped cake, embossed with the phrase “boys only want love if it’s torture” — lyrics from Swift’s 2014 hit “Blank Space.”\n\n“Best cake for my favorite Swiftie,” Ivanka wrote on another picture showing the cake with a slice missing.\n\nIn October of that year, weeks after Trump expressed his hatred of the “Fate of Ophelia” singer, Ivanka and Arabella were spotted in attendance at Swift’s Eras Tour show in Miami, Florida, at Hard Rock Stadium. \n\nDespite Trump previously describing Swift as “unusually beautiful” and conceding that she’s “got a great star quality” in Ramin Setoodeh’s 2024 book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass, he has since turned on the singer, following her public endorsement of his most recent presidential rival, Kamala Harris. \n\n“I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift wrote on Instagram hours after Trump’s and Harris’s first and last presidential debate.\n\n“I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” she added. \n\n“I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.”\n\nDays after Swift’s declaration, Trump exclaimed, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” on Truth Social. Meanwhile, this past May, he doubled down on his criticism of the “Blank Space” singer, writing from his Truth Social account: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”","summary":"Trump has launched several unprovoked attacks on the pop star since she announced her endorsement of Kamala Harris during the 2024 election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-karoline-leavitt-spotify-trump-b2878381.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/04/19/56/Taylor-Swift-and-Karoline-Leavitt.png?crop=2034,1356,x7,y0&trim=0,7,0,7&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WisTkceL-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-04 21:20:34","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.419},{"id":385124542,"title":"New boat strikes video sparked 'different understandings of what we saw,' senator says","text":"New boat strikes video sparked 'different understandings of what we saw,' senator says\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Vance says antisemitism isn't 'exploding' on the right\n\nIE 11 is not supported.

Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years. The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.The devices — made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder — did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect — grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie — and offered $500,000 for information.In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"","summary":"Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pipe-bomb-suspect-arrest/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/03/09/be32aba1-2ad4-4ff4-9dac-2c75988edb51/thumbnail/1200x630/74b643ea56318c81216c6e1207f743da/pipe-bomb-suspect-DC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 20:20:28","author":"Alex Sundby,Anna Schecter,Daniel Klaidman,Jennifer Jacobs,Joe Walsh,Pat Milton,Scott Macfarlane","authors":["Alex Sundby","Anna Schecter","Daniel Klaidman","Jennifer Jacobs","Joe Walsh","Pat Milton","Scott Macfarlane"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":385097266,"title":"January 6 Pipe Bomber Who Planted Devices' Within Feet' of Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi Finally Arrested: FBI","text":"After nearly five years the FBI has arrested someone related to the planting of pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican National Committees on the eve of the January 6 riot.\n\nFox News reported that authorities took Brian Cole Jr., 30, of Virginia into custody Thursday morning.

With subpoena power, Democrats would have more muscle to probe the criticism-averse president and his administration’s many efforts to control the free press.\n\nBut House Dems aren’t waiting until then. In late November, Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused CBS’ parent company, Paramount Skydance, of stonewalling their investigation into allegations of bribery in connection with the Trump administration’s oversight of the company’s merger earlier this year. \n\nOn Wednesday, Raskin announced he’d launched another investigation into CBS’ newly appointed, conservative ombudsman Kenneth Weinstein over the news outlet’s selective edits to a recent “60 Minutes” interview with Donald Trump. \n\nThe television interview, which aired in early November, was heavily edited to omit sections in which Trump spoke about the outlet having paid him millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit over its edits to a 2024 interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The channel also omitted portions of the interview in which Trump praised CBS News’ controversial pro-MAGA editor in chief Bari Weiss and touted pro-Trump billionaires Larry Ellison and his son, David, who largely owns and controls Paramount Skydance. \n\nA transcript of the interview shows that Trump told the interviewer to omit some of his responses, which were ultimately left out of the version that was broadcast. The outlet also omitted Trump’s evasive answer to a question about alleged corruption surrounding his pardon of a Chinese crypto scammer with business ties to his family. \n\nIn his letter to Weinstein, Raskin wrote that Trump “forced CBS to install a monitor to police newsroom decisions and guard against anti-Trump bias—the farcical Orwellian role you now fill as ‘CBS News Ombudsman.’” Raskin continued, “And now, it appears President Trump has successfully coerced CBS into corruptly and misleadingly editing his own 60 Minutes interview.” \n\nHis letter demands all documents and communications related to the Trump interview, “including any input from Paramount executives, CBS corporate leadership, or outside parties.” The letter also seeks a briefing from Weinstein on CBS News’ editorial standards and independence.\n\nCBS News declined to comment.\n\nScrutiny of Paramount Skydance’s appeasement of Trump amid its merger approval process isn’t limited to the federal level.

After Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Harris considered selecting Shapiro as her running mate before ultimately choosing Minnesota governor Tim Walz.\n\nAs Alberta began to read Shapiro the 107 Days excerpts, he “moved between outrage and exasperation,” the journalist claimed.\n\nAccording to Alberta, “Harris had accused him, in essence, of measuring the drapes, even inquiring about featuring Pennsylvania artists in the vice-presidential residence; of insisting ‘that he would want to be in the room for every decision’ Harris might make; and, more generally, of hijacking the conversation when she interviewed him for the job, to the point where she reminded him that he would not be co-president,” the profile read.\n\n“She wrote that in her book?” Shapiro asked in response to the claim about the art. “That’s complete and utter bulls**t.”\n\n“I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies,” Shapiro added.\n\nRegarding the time Harris interviewed him for candidate consideration, Shapiro admitted, “I did ask a bunch of questions,” adding: “Wouldn’t you ask questions if someone was talking to you about forming a partnership and working together?”\n\nWhen asked if he felt betrayed by what Harris wrote, Shapiro said, “I mean, she’s trying to sell books and cover her ass.”\n\nHe then clarified, “I shouldn’t say ‘cover her ass.’ I think that’s not appropriate. She’s trying to sell books. Period.”\n\nFinally, when asked if he was disappointed that he wasn’t chosen to stand beside Harris during the presidential campaign, Shapiro implied he wasn’t.\n\n“On the scale of life’s disappointments,” Alberta wrote of Shapiro’s reaction, “this one barely registered.”","url":"https://nationalenquirer.com/governor-josh-shapiro-blasts-kamala-harris-recollections-about-him-in-her-book-blatant-lies/","image":"https://nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Featured-6-Josh-Shapiro-Kamala-Harris.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:45:36","author":"Michael Gioia","authors":["Michael Gioia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":385105684,"title":"Halle Berry torches Gavin Newsom's presidential hopes — for devaluing half of the population","text":"Hollywood actress Halle Berry said she vehemently opposes the reported presidential aspirations of California Gov.

If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison.\nAccording to an affidavit, investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020.\nCole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day.\nSenior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it.\n“Though it had been nearly five years, our team continued to churn through massive amounts of data and tips that we used to identify this suspect,” said Darren Cox, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s criminal investigative division.\nThe bombs were planted near the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night of January 5, 2021, as Congress prepared to certify Joe Biden’s electoral victory over Donald Trump. Both failed to detonate, but their discovery the following day added to the chaos and confusion unfolding as a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol building, causing millions of dollars in damage and injuring approximately 140 Capitol and Metropolitan Police Department officers.\nThe FBI says the pipe-bomb suspect moved through the Capitol wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, mask, gloves, and Nike Air Max sneakers, placing one device in an alley near the RNC and another beneath a bench outside the DNC. The bureau has consistently said that the devices, built from threaded metal pipe, a kitchen timer, and homemade black powder, were “viable” and could have been lethal, though it remains unclear whether they would have detonated absent intervention.\nA passerby spotted the RNC bomb the following day and reported it to Capitol Police, who logged the call at 12:42 pm. A police countersurveillance team discovered the second bomb at the DNC headquarters at around 1:05 pm. Then-vice-president–elect Kamala Harris, who was on site at the time, was evacuated. US Secret Service agents had conducted a security sweep earlier that morning—including with a bomb-sniffing dog.\nPerimeter failures were extensive at both sites as police responded simultaneously to breaches at the east front and west front of the Capitol building. Security footage captured two civilians walking by the RNC bomb more than half hour after its discovery, with no officers nearby to hold a blast perimeter. At the DNC building, numerous cars and pedestrians passed through what should have been a secured zone.\nIdentifying the January 6 pipe-bomber became an obsession in large swaths of Trump's MAGA base in recent years. Indeed, Bongino played a significant role in his previous life as a right-wing influencer in criticizing the agency he now helps lead over its perceived lack of process in the case.\nBongino called the failure to identify a suspect “the biggest scandal in FBI history\" on his podcast in January, adding that the agency already knew the name of the bomber and \"just doesn’t want to tell us, because it was an inside job.\"\nLast month, far-right media outlet the Blaze, founded by Glenn Beck, claimed it had identified the alleged suspect as a former Capitol Police officer, basing its findings on an analysis of how the person walked. Bongino dismissed the allegations as “grossly inaccurate,” but the report led to many on the right once again slamming Bongino and his boss for failing to find the bomber.\nDespite little being known about the suspected bomber, far-right figures online were already speculating on Thursday morning before he was officially named that he was a member of “antifa.” Others simply didn’t believe that the FBI had arrested the right guy: “Let’s see what they’ve got,” Republican congressman Thomas Massie wrote on X, adding, ”I’m not buying it.”","summary":"The 30-year-old Virginia resident evaded capture for years after authorities discovered pipe bombs planted near buildings in Washington, DC, the day before the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/6931cf4888e958488fbb263f/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/security_jan6_GettyImages-2249286724.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:42:18","author":"David Gilbert,Dell Cameron","authors":["David Gilbert","Dell Cameron"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":385099568,"title":"AI chatbots can influence voters &#8211; Studies","text":"A brief conversation with a partisan AI chatbot can influence voters’ political views, studies published Thursday found, with evidence-backed arguments — true or not — proving particularly persuasive.\n\nExperiments with generative artificial intelligence models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Chinese alternative DeepSeek, found they were able to shift supporters of Republican Donald Trump towards his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris by almost four points on a 100-point scale ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nOpposition supporters in 2025 polls in Canada and Poland meanwhile had their views shifted by up to 10 points after chatting with a bot programmed to persuade.\n\nThose effects are enough to sway a significant proportion of voting decisions, said Cornell University professor David Rand, a senior author of the papers in journals Science and Nature.\n\n“When we asked how people would vote if the election were held that day… roughly one in 10 respondents in Canada and Poland switched,” he told AFP by email.\n\n“About one in 25 in the US did the same,” he added, while noting that “voting intentions aren’t the same as actual votes” at the ballot box.\n\nHowever, follow-ups with participants found that around half the persuasive effect remained after one month in Britain, while one-third remained in the United States, Rand said.\n\n“In social science, any evidence of effects persisting a month later is comparatively rare,” he pointed out.\n\n– Being polite, giving proof –\n\nThe studies found that the most common tactic used by chatbots to persuade was “being polite and providing evidence”, and that bots instructed not to use facts were far less persuasive.\n\nSuch results “go against the dominant narrative in political psychology, which holds that ‘motivated reasoning’ makes people ignore facts that conflict with their identities or partisan commitments”, Rand said.\n\nBut the facts and evidence cited by the chatbots were not necessarily truthful.\n\nWhile most of their fact-checked claims were accurate, “AIs advocating for right-leaning candidates made more inaccurate claims”, Rand said.\n\nThis was “likely because the models mirror patterns in their training data, and numerous studies have found that right-leaning content on the internet tends to be more inaccurate”, he added.\n\nThe authors recruited thousands of participants for the experiments on online gig-work platforms and warned them in advance that they would be speaking with AI.\n\nRand said that further work could investigate the “upper limit” of just how far AI can change people’s minds — and how newer models released since the fieldwork, such as GPT-5 or Google’s Gemini 3, would perform.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/12/ai-chatbots-can-influence-voters-studies/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/artificial-intelligence.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:42:15","author":"Ayobami","authors":["Ayobami"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":385085418,"title":"Erika Kirk supports GOP infighting following husband’s death as ‘healthy’","text":"Sorkin asked Kirk what she liked about the Republican Party as part of the final discussion of the summit on Wednesday. Turning Point USA is credited for boosting Republican candidates, most notably President Donald Trump, across the country, particularly among younger voters. Kirk said she supports the “infighting” happening, even at times against Trump.\n\n“What I love about our party is that we have a common thread of wanting to seek truth,” Kirk said. “What I find interesting about our party is that right now there is a lot of shuffling and mixing up, and I feel like when things are shuffling and mixing up, they’re falling into place in a different way.”\n\n“When there’s infighting just in general — I’m not talking about extensively just politicians, I’m talking about just in general, whether that’s influencers, whether that’s other voices within the Right — there’s a lot of uprising,” Kirk added.\n\nThere are many examples Kirk could have been referring to. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) announced her intention to resign from Congress after a public spat with Trump.\n\nAdditionally, there has been an exodus of staffers at the Heritage Foundation after the conservative think tank’s president, Kevin Roberts, said that “Christians can critique the state of Israel without being antisemitic.” Talk show host Tucker Carlson was under fire for interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes.\n\nEven earlier during the interview, Kirk admitted she has disagreed with Trump, citing that “he can’t forgive” as an example.\n\nWithin her own organization, there is a battle. Talk show host Candace Owens, who claims to have traveled the most with Kirk’s late husband for TPUSA campus events, has spurred her own investigation into the September assassination. The controversy surrounding Owens and the Heritage Foundation prompted Sorkin to interrupt and ask, “Is this the Nick Fuentes-Tucker Carlson debate we’re talking about?”\n\n“I’m talking about everything,” Kirk said. “Ever since Charlie was murdered, there has been conversation across the whole right side of who believes this, what believes that, where are we standing on behalf of, you know, where is the youth going this direction. It’s a conversation that’s being had that is, again, uncomfortable and riling things up, but I think it’s healthy because once you have those conversations, then you come to a full point, and maybe it takes a little while, but usually you come to a point of understanding of this is what we believe in.”\n\n“I think it’s good to have in-home arguments,” Kirk said. “It irons some things out. I think it’s important.”\n\nTurning Point announced on Wednesday, hours before Kirk took the stage, that it would be hosting a livestream on Monday featuring “a collection of Charlie’s friends will respond to statements made by @RealCandaceO to set the record straight once and for all.”\n\nOwens criticized the sudden announcement on X.\n\nThe Washington Examiner has reached out to Greene, Owens, Tucker, and the Heritage Foundation for comment.\n\nKirk encouraged young women not to “put off having a family or a marriage because you’re relying on the government to support you” when asked about her stance at the summit hosted in New York. Before marrying her husband at 33, Kirk explained she was once a Manhattan resident and “loved this city.”\n\n“I think there’s a tendency, especially when you live in a city like Manhattan, where, again, you are so career-driven, and you almost look to the government as a form of replacement for certain things, relationship-wise even,” Kirk said.\n\nKirk added that New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani largely won over young women.\n\n“What I don’t want to have happen is young women in the city, look to the government as a solution to put off having a family or a marriage because you’re relying on the government to support you, instead of being united with a husband where you can support yourself and your husband can support you and you can guys all combine together,” Kirk added.\n\nMamdani won just over 50% of the vote in New York, while his predecessor, Mayor Eric Adams, won 67% of the vote, and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won the city with 70% of the vote during last year’s presidential election.\n\nAccording to an ABC News exit poll, Mamdani swept the majority of voters who have lived in New York for less than five years, with 8 in 10 voting for him. However, a majority of voters who have lived in the city for over 10 years voted for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.","summary":"Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk defended Republican influencers and politicians who are&#160;“riling things up” and “wanting to seek truth” from the Republican Party.

He declared the controversial \"good jeans\" campaign was the \"HOTTEST ad out there\" as he compared the PR nightmare to Jaguar's rebrand, which featured a hot-pink car and androgynous models. \n\nWhile it may not have been obvious to anyone but the president, Swift, somehow, was roped into Trump's rant.\"Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift,\" Trump's Truth Social post continued. \"Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!).

Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now.\" \n\nThe cycle repeated itself when Swift endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris over Trump last year – and sparked a surge in voter registration. \n\nOnce again, Trump took to Truth Social and declared: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\"","summary":"The White House press secretary's Spotify Wrapped raised eyebrows when the pop star appeared on her top artists list.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/karoline-leavitt-taylor-swift-fan-donald-trump-feud-spotify-wrapped/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Cc0rED524/0x0/donald-trump-taylor-swift-karoline-leavitt-spotify-wrapped-top-artist-2-1764869281221.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:36:32","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.173},{"id":385081740,"title":"Kash Patel Flaunts 'Relentless' FBI as DC Pipe Bomb Suspect Seized, Leaving $500K Gathering Dust","text":"For nearly five years, the case of the Washington, DC pipe bomber remained a troubling mystery, a stark failure of federal law enforcement that persisted through an entire presidential term. Despite a staggering reward of £394,000 ($500,000) for information, the trail went cold. That changed Thursday, when a suspect was taken into custody not because of a public tip, but through what new FBI leadership describes as a complete overhaul of the investigation.FBI Director Kash Patel revealed exclusively that Brian Cole was arrested based on 'old-fashioned police work' and a renewed investigative push under the Trump administration. The breakthrough solves a high-profile case that loomed over the nation's capital since the eve of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, with Patel taking direct aim at the previous administration's lack of success.Why A £394,000 Reward Went Untouched For YearsThe significant reward offered by the FBI during the Biden administration ultimately yielded no results in identifying the person responsible for planting pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters. For years, the culprit remained at large, a ghost in one of the most scrutinised security events in modern American history. This failure occurred even as the FBI successfully prosecuted hundreds of individuals involved in the Capitol riot itself.The arrest of Brian Cole on Thursday morning in a quiet Woodbridge, Virginia, cul-de-sac marks a pivotal moment in the long-dormant case. FBI agents descended on the property to collect evidence, finally putting a face to the suspect who had eluded them for almost five years. The capture was achieved without any new public intelligence, rendering the substantial financial incentive irrelevant.Patel Details 'Relentless' New FBI StrategyAccording to Director Patel, the case was cracked after he ordered a complete re-evaluation of the investigation upon taking office. He stated that the previous leadership's four-year effort had produced 'no success', prompting his team to start from scratch. This rebooted effort proved decisive.'The FBI examined every piece of information available, leveraged new technology, brought in experts from around the country, and methodically developed the evidence needed to nail this suspect', Patel explained. He made it clear that the arrest was not a stroke of luck or the result of a sudden confession. 'This breakthrough didn't come from new tips, it came from relentless FBI work'.The gravity of the original crime was underscored by the fact that then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came dangerously close to the explosive devices on January 6. The bombs were planted along a route they travelled to and from the DNC headquarters, highlighting the potential for catastrophic harm.A Focused Bureau Finally Delivers ResultsPatel emphasised that his agency's renewed approach was key to bringing the suspect to justice. The investigation was not just continued but fundamentally re-engineered to find new leads from existing evidence that had long been available. Patel's comments suggest the crucial information needed to solve the case was there all along, but the previous investigation was unable to piece it together.'Our team re-examined the case from the ground up', Patel said, noting that his leadership constructed a new evidentiary trail and secured the warrants that led to Cole's arrest. He framed the success as a testament to a reformed agency, one that can deliver on its promises to the public when properly directed. 'This is what a focused, disciplined Bureau delivers for the American people', he added, a clear signal that after years of questions, federal investigators finally had their man, even as the massive reward went untouched.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kash-patel-flaunts-relentless-fbi-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-seized-leaving-500k-gathering-dust-1760407","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1773622/kash-patel.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8602e250089cca86dcf3a98aa8f5e814","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:09:43","author":"Luis Vincent Gochoco","authors":["Luis Vincent Gochoco"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":385095266,"title":"Karoline Leavitt Reveals Taylor Swift Was One of Her Top Spotify Artists Months After Trump Called Her 'No Longer Hot'","text":"Like many music lovers, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took to social media to share her 2025 Spotify Wrapped this week.

Her list was country and worship heavy, with Morgan Wallen topping the chart, followed by Christian artists Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Anne Wilson.\n\n However, Leavitt's No. 5 top artist of the year was none other than Taylor Swift, a longtime target of President Donald Trump.\n\n Leavitt did not share her top songs or albums of the year, so it's unclear which era she tuned into the most.

The clip attempted to match up lyrics from the song with images of Washington, D.C., the president, first lady Melania Trump, military troops and more.\n\n \"Don't care where the hell you been,\" Swift sang over a photo of Trump's 2023 mug shot from when he was indicted on charges related to attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n \"'Cause now you're mine\" the song continued, over a picture of Trump kissing the American flag.\n\n \"OUR VIBES,\" the White House captioned the post, which has since amassed nearly a million likes.\n\n While Swift kept mum about the White House's use of her music, her fellow pop star Sabrina Carpenter fired back this week after the Trump administration used one of her songs in a similar manner.\n\n On Dec. 1, the White House X account shared a clip of ICE agents making combative arrests, set to audio from Carpenter's track \"Juno.\"\n\n Within 24 hours, Carpenter had made a rare post on the platform to reply to the clip. \"This video is evil and disgusting,\" she wrote. \"Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.\"\n\n The 26-year-old singer also \"ratioed\" the White House, earning 1.6 million likes on her reply, as compared to the 84,000 on the original.","summary":"The White House press secretary's 2025 Spotify Wrapped came as a surprise given her boss's frequent attacks on the pop artist","url":"https://people.com/karoline-leavitt-reveals-taylor-swift-top-spotify-artist-11862173","image":"https://people.com/thmb/CvIY6JskxEsbtRQPzFvspd4hbk0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Karoline-Leavitt-Taylor-Swift-120425-9e9fa9b15b044417b25a7c425bcda805.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:04:12","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.152},{"id":385132272,"title":"AI Chatbots Shown to Sway Voters, Raising New Fears about Election Influence","text":"Forget door knocks and phone banks—chatbots could be the future of persuasive political campaigns.\n\nFears over whether artificial intelligence can influence elections are nothing new. But a pair of new papers released today in Nature and Science show that bots can successfully shift people’s political attitudes—even if what the bots claim is wrong.\n\nThe findings cut against the prevailing logic that it’s exceedingly difficult to change people’s mind about politics, says David Rand, a senior author of both papers and a professor of information science and marketing and management communications at Cornell University, who specializes in artificial intelligence.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nStephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the new studies, says they raise important questions: “First, how can we guard against—or at least detect—when LLMs [large language models] have been designed with a particular ideology in mind that is antithetical to democracy?” he asks. “Second, how can we ensure that ‘prompt engineering’ cannot be used on existing models to create antidemocratic persuasive agents?”\n\nThe researchers studied more than 20 AI models, including the most popular versions of ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama.\n\nIn the experiment described in the Nature paper, Rand and his colleagues recruited more than 2,000 U.S. adults and asked them to rate their candidate preference on a scale of 0 to 100. The team then had the participants chat with an AI that was trained to argue for one of two 2024 U.S. presidential election candidates: either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. After the conversation, participants again ranked their candidate preference.\n\n“It moved people on the order of a couple of percentage points in the direction of the candidate that the model was advocating for, which is not a huge effect but is substantially bigger than what you would expect from traditional video ads or campaign ads,” Rand says. Even a month later, many participants still felt persuaded by the bots, according to the paper.\n\nThe results were even more striking among about 1,500 participants in Canada and 2,100 in Poland. But interestingly, the largest shift in opinion occurred in the case of 500 people talking to bots about a statewide ballot to legalize psychedelics in Massachusetts.\n\nNotably, if the bots didn’t use evidence to back up their arguments, they were less persuasive. And while the AI models mostly stuck to the facts, “the models that were advocating for the right-leaning candidates—and in particular the pro-Trump model—made way more inaccurate claims,” Rand says. That pattern remained across countries and AI models, although people who were less informed about politics overall were the most persuadable.\n\nThe Science paper tackled the same questions but from the perspective of chatbot design. Across three studies in the U.K., nearly 77,000 participants discussed political issues with chatbots. The size of an AI model and how much the bot knew about the participant had only a slight influence on how persuasive it was. Rather the largest gains came from how the model was trained and instructed to present evidence.\n\n“The more factual claims the model made, the more persuasive it was,” Rand says. The problem occurs when such a bot runs out of accurate evidence for its argument. “It has to start grasping at straws and making up claims,” he says.\n\nEthan Porter, co-director of George Washington University’s Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics, describes the results as “milestones in the literature.”\n\n“Contra some of the most pessimistic accounts, they make clear that facts and evidence are not rejected if they do not conform with one’s prior beliefs—instead facts and evidence can form the bedrock of successful persuasion,” says Porter, who wasn’t involved in the papers.\n\nThe finding that people are most effectively persuaded by evidence rather than by emotion or feelings of group membership is encouraging, says Adina Roskies, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who also was not involved in the studies. Still, she cautions, “the bad news is that people are swayed by apparent facts, regardless of their accuracy.”","summary":"Chatbots can measurably sway voters&rsquo; choices, new research shows.

The researchers found that chatbot interactions could reinforce existing support—but more notably, they were often successful in persuading undecided or opposing voters too.\n\nFor the U.S. study, 2,306 participants indicated their preferred candidate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Each person was randomly assigned a chatbot advocating for either candidate. Even brief conversations led to statistically significant shifts in candidate support.\n\nSimilar results were observed in Canada, where the AI supported either Liberal Party leader Mark Carney or Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, and in Poland, where it backed either centrist-liberal Rafał Trzaskowski or right-wing Law and Justice party’s candidate Karol Nawrocki.\n\nConversations focused on facts and policy were more effective than those centered on personality. However, AI chatbots promoting right-wing candidates were consistently more prone to factual inaccuracies, a pattern that held across all three countries.\n\nIn another experiment, voters in Massachusetts were exposed to chatbot discussions regarding a ballot measure to legalize psychedelic drugs. With participants randomly assigned pro- or anti-legalization bots based on their initial views, the researchers again found persuasive effects—especially among those with moderate, undecided or neutral views on the issue.\n\nWhile most chatbot statements were rated highly for factual accuracy, discrepancies remained. For example, pro-Trump chatbots inaccurately attributed job growth solely to his administration, overlooking economic continuity from the Obama era. \n\nJason Ross Arnold—a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert in AI governance and ethics told Newsweek that the ability of chatbots to simplify political information while shaping perceptions poses a new kind of risk to democratic engagement.\n\n“AI chatbots have become powerful intermediaries between voters and political information,” Arnold said. “They can simplify complex issues and broaden access to civic knowledge, yet they also carry hidden risks that can distort opinions without users realizing it.”\n\nThe vulnerabilities are layered. Arnold identified five core dangers of political chatbot use. The first is misgrounding, where AI models pair citations from real sources with claims those sources don’t actually support, making misinformation appear credible. \n\nSecond is sycophancy, where AI chatbots tend to reinforce users’ existing biases rather than challenge them, creating echo chambers that amplify certainty in one’s beliefs.\n\nSubtle political bias in framing and emphasis can also shift opinions without detection. Users may wrongly assume chatbots are neutral or not programmed with pre-existing attitudes and persuasions, though research shows even minor asymmetries in language can influence decisions.\n\nAI systems are often optimized for rhetorical effectiveness over factual precision, leading to what Arnold calls “persuasiveness over accuracy.”\n\nLastly, over-reliance on AI for summarizing political choices risks what Arnold describes as cognitive offloading—an erosion of critical thinking that undermines informed democratic participation and harms the concept of having freedom of opinion and choice to pick the leaders we like and hold others to account.\n\nStill, the same tools do offer potential benefits if properly designed and regulated, Arnold explained. AI chatbots can break down complex legal language in ballot measures, reducing voter “roll-off” by encouraging voter participation and a larger demographic to vote in down-ballot initiatives. \n\nThey can also fill information gaps in under-reported local elections, providing consolidated, personalized data for voters.\n\nIn multilingual democracies, AI chatbots can offer real-time conversational translations, support linguistic inclusion and allow voters to ask clarifying questio...","summary":"AI chatbots are subtly shaping voter opinions—new research shows they could sway future elections worldwide.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/why-chatbots-could-influence-the-next-election-11156899","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2121696615.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 19:00:00","author":"Melissa Fleur Afshar","authors":["Melissa Fleur Afshar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.259},{"id":385143286,"title":"Trump to visit Pennsylvania in push on domestic issues, sources say","text":"President Trump, facing criticism that he's focused more on international issues than kitchen-table concerns, will rev up his domestic messaging aimed at selling his economic agenda ahead of the midterms, according to Republican sources familiar with his plans.

Mr. Trump's trip was first reported by Axios. Sources tell CBS News the focus of this messaging event will be on gas prices, which recently fell below $3 nationwide for the first time in over four years, and rising wages. Affordability is an issue that helped lift him over Kamala Harris last year and has propelled Democratic campaigns in this year's off-year elections.

Under the proposal, the Ukrainian military would be permitted to build a fighting force of up to 600,000 troops. “That’s unacceptable to the Russians,” says political scientist John Mearsheimer.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) may be the first lawmaker to need personal armed guards specifically because of threats made against him by the president of the United States. \n\nAfter Donald Trump called him a traitor and suggested he be hanged for telling service members that they can disobey illegal orders, Kelly’s office received graphic threats not only on his life, but on that of his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in a politically motivated mass shooting nearly 15 years ago, fueling the couple’s advocacy for gun violence prevention ever since. \n\nIn an interview with HuffPost this week, Kelly said he’d never imagined that he would now be the one in the crosshairs, walking around the U.S. Capitol with a security detail, something normally reserved only for congressional leadership.\n\n“I understand political violence pretty well,” Kelly said in an interview with HuffPost. “It’s something my family’s dealt with. It’s something the president has dealt with, and his family has dealt with. He should get it. He shouldn’t be threatening to hang U.S. senators.”\n\n“I think it’s rather pretty unique to him in the history of our country, of all the presidents that have come before, he’s probably the only one who has threatened to kill a senator,” he added.\n\nKelly has a visceral reminder at his side of what that kind of rhetoric can lead to. The head of his new security detail is an officer who was also on his wife’s detail after she was shot. The officer spent months protecting Giffords, including standing outside her hospital door while she recovered and underwent months of physical and speech therapy.\n\nSince appearing in a video last month with other Democratic lawmakers reminding the military they can defy illegal orders, something that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth himself acknowledged in 2016, Kelly has seemingly been everywhere, blanketing cable news and late-night talk shows to slam Trump and Hegseth for their handling of military strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. He’s called both men unqualified for their office, dismissed their attempts to silence him as “ridiculous” and “embarrassing,” and insisted he won’t be bullied into backing down. \n\nThe row with Trump has earned Kelly the kind of national attention that other Democrats also eyeing a run for the presidency can only dream of. As a former astronaut and decorated U.S. Navy veteran of 25 years who flew combat missions in the Middle East, and as a Democrat from a battleground state, Kelly would make a compelling candidate if he decides to enter what will likely be a crowded race to succeed Trump in 2028.\n\n“They’ve chosen the wrong guy to make a target here,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told HuffPost. “He is resisting this attempt to silence and stifle him with courage.”\n\n“I think this only points out, number one, his experience, but also his reputation,” added fellow Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who is also viewed as a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028. “So I think it is backfiring on them.”\n\nRepublican senators said the video Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers recorded was unnecessarily inflammatory, but they acknowledged that Trump’s inability to let things lie has only served to elevate Kelly as a hero in the Democratic Party and set him up for a run for higher office.\n\n“I think that it’s playing right into the Democrats’ hand. I think that’s why they did the video to begin with,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost, calling it “rage bait” — the new Oxford dictionary word of the year — that Trump simply couldn’t ignore.\n\nAsked what he made of Republicans and other pundits suggesting he was laying the groundwork for a presidential run, Kelly declined to directly answer. He said he recorded the video as a “friendly reminder’ to service members of their legal obligations as Trump deploys National Guard troops into U.S. cities and threatens war against Venezuela.\n\n“We wanted to send a message to members of the military that we have your back, and just give them a friendly reminder, because as I view the situation we’re in, we’ve got a president that talks about killing people and has talked about shooting protesters in the legs, and said the military will not refuse his orders, even when they’re illegal,” Kelly told HuffPost. \n\nKelly, 61, was first elected to the Senate in 2020, winning a special election to replace the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), another veteran on the receiving end of Trump’s attacks. He won reelection in 2022, defeating Republican challenger Blake Masters. In 2024, he was considered as a vice presidential running mate for Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris. (Kelly is up for reelection in 2028, which could potentially pose a barrier to a presidential bid.)\n\nKelly’s seeming preparedness for a presidential run goes beyond defense issues — he’s rolled out a plan to deal with the transition to artificial intelligence, which is likely to be a top issue in the 2028 race, and was pitching it at the Center for American Progress on Thursday morning. He also traveled to South Carolina, which will likely be one of the first states to vote in the 2028 primaries, for the 10th anniversary of the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting in June. \n\nAnd he’s started making the podcast rounds, appearing with figures as disparate as investigative sports journalist Pablo Torre and right-wing commentator Bari Weiss, to discuss political violence.\n\nBut it’s his positions on both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee that have given him the high-profile job conducting oversight of the Trump administration’s national security policies.\n\nThe retired Navy fighter pilot has faced a barrage of attacks from Trump, who said he and the other five Democratic lawmakers who participated in the video message to the troops were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” The president then shared a post online calling for their hanging.\n\nHegseth, meanwhile, has asked the Navy secretary to review Kelly’s comments in the video for “potentially unlawful conduct,” suggesting he could face a court-martial. The senator maintains he did nothing wrong and that he only learned about the investigation from an online post.\n\n“He tweeted something, that’s how I got notified. That’s all I’ve heard from the Navy, and that says everything about Pete Hegseth,” the senator told CNN this week. Later, in another CNN appearance, he accused Hegseth of being focused on seeing “how many views he can get on Twitter,” adding, “that’s what he cares about — he doesn’t care about the law or process.”\n\nKelly has heard from Republican colleagues who agree with him. Only a few have stepped up to defend him in public, however. \n\n“Mark Kelly’s a great friend, a great Senate member, and brings lots of contributions to this body,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) told HuffPost when asked about Trump’s attacks. \n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), meanwhile, called the Pentagon investigation of Kelly “frivolous.”\n\n“To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong,” she added. \n\nHegseth has requested to be briefed by next week on the results of a Pentagon review into Kelly’s rhetoric. The FBI, meanwhile, has launched a separate probe into Kelly and the other Democrats in the video and is considering investigating them for seditious conspiracy, according to Bloomberg. \n\nBut Kelly has shown no signs of backing down. Earlier this week, he convened a press conference at the Capitol where he contrasted his record with that of Trump in a stemwinder one might hear on the campaign trail one day. \n\n“In 1991, when Donald Trump was driving the Taj Mahal casino into bankruptcy, I was getting shot at over Iraq and Kuwait,” he said on Monday. “In 2001, after Donald Trump said that the collapse of the Twin Towers meant he now owned the tallest skyscraper in Manhattan, I was carrying flags honoring 9/11 victims into space on a rocket ship.”\n\n“In 2003, when Trump was writing birthday greetings to the monster Jeffrey Epstein, I was the first on the scene to recover the bodies of my fellow astronauts who died when Space Shuttle Columbia exploded on reentry,” he continued. “In 2011, when Trump was peddling conspiracy theories against President Barack Obama, I was sitting next to my wife’s hospital bed as she recovered from a gunshot wound to the head.” \n\n“My point is this: I’ve been through a lot worse in service to my country,” he added. “The president and Pete Hegseth are not going to silence me.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mark-kelly-hegseth_n_6931c059e4b0cee44382dc37?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6931c185190000e2536a0f88.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 17:59:56","author":"Igor Bobic","authors":["Igor Bobic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":385061374,"title":"‘They’ve Chosen The Wrong Guy’: Mark Kelly Rises As Foil To Trump","text":"WASHINGTON — As threats against members of Congress skyrocketed in recent years, some lawmakers have required added security while going to and from their jobs on Capitol Hill. \n\nBut Sen.

Wouldn’t you ask questions if someone was talking to you about forming a partnership and working together?”\n\n When asked if he felt betrayed by how Harris depicted him in her memoir, Shapiro — who has known the former vice president for 20 years — replied, \"I mean, she’s trying to sell books and cover her ass.”\n\n \"I shouldn’t say ‘cover her ass.’ I think that’s not appropriate,\" he added, rewriting his statement as: \"She’s trying to sell books.

Shapiro was someone who would likely want to be “in the room for every decision,” and someone with political ambitions of his own. She said Shapiro often hijacked conversations, and he had to be frequently reminded that he wouldn’t have equal power. Speculation has grown that she wanted someone more moldable to be her running mate, someone who wouldn't outshine her. \n\nThat led her to choose Tim Walz.\n\nAlberta said Gov.

Inside the FBI's Five-Year Pipe Bomb Investigation","text":"After nearly five years of investigative work — from analysing tens of thousands of video files to tracing the sale of a specific pair of Nike Air Max trainers — the FBI has arrested a Virginia man suspected of planting two pipe bombs near the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican National Committees on the eve of the 2021 Capitol riot. ,An FBI official confirmed that the arrest took place on Thursday morning. The Justice Department is expected to formally announce the development at a news conference later in the day. ,Multiple law enforcement officials have identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr, a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. ,The arrest marks a big breakthrough in the investigation. The suspect was captured only in grainy surveillance footage, masked and wearing a hooded sweatshirt and gloves. The poor quality of the footage, coupled with the fact that both devices went unnoticed for 15 hours, hindered early efforts to identify him.,Also Read: Who Is Brian Cole? Suspect Arrested In January 6th Pipe Bomb Investigation ,The FBI said both devices, discovered on January 6, 2021, were viable and could have caused serious injury or death. One of the bombs, placed outside the DNC headquarters, was located only metres from then Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who visited the building the following morning. Their discovery diverted police resources away from the US Capitol as supporters of then-President Donald Trump began breaching security lines. ,To identify the suspect, investigators reviewed mobile phone tower data, examined thousands of public tips and narrowed in on a key detail: the black and grey Nike Air Max trainers worn by the individual seen in surveillance footage. Fewer than 25,000 pairs had been sold at the time the devices were planted, helping to narrow the list of potential suspects. In total, investigators conducted more than 1,000 interviews., ,The slow pace of the investigation fed conspiracy theories among some of Trump's allies, who claimed that the attack was an \"inside job\". Among them was Dan Bongino, a prominent conservative commentator who is now the FBI's deputy director. ,Before joining the bureau, Bongino said on his podcast: \"I believe the FBI knows the identity of this pipe bomber on January 6, four years ago, and just doesn't wanna tell us 'cause it was an inside job.\" He also suggested the bureau might later claim the bombs were a \"training exercise.\" ,After assuming the deputy director role, Bongino continued to highlight the case. In a Fox News interview, he said: \"I'm pretty confident that we're closing in on some suspects.\" According to people briefed at the time, that was not accurate, and several leads subsequently fell through. ,However, in recent months, investigators developed new lines of inquiry. Last month, Bongino wrote on X that the FBI had expanded its investigative team, flown in \"police officers and detectives\" to reassess earlier work, and conducted internal reviews. ,Relatives of the suspect have declined to discuss the arrest. His step-grandfather, Earl Donnette, confirmed in a brief telephone call that he had spoken with the FBI but would not comment further. Cole's father, Brian Cole Sr, also declined to comment. ,The FBI had previously offered a $500,000 reward for information identifying the bomber.,Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"The slow pace of the investigation fed conspiracy theories among some of Donald Trump's allies, who claimed that the attack was an \"inside job\"","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/what-led-to-arrest-brian-cole-inside-fbi-pipe-bomb-investigation-article-153247583","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153247599,thumbsize-76696,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153247599.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 17:27:01","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":385074420,"title":"Nolte: Number of Americans Who Closely Follow the News Crashes","text":"In 2016, 51 percent of U.S. adults said they closely followed the news.

Well, the answer is the same for anything people consume less of: They no longer find the product helpful, worth their time, appealing, or necessary.\n\nSince 2016, the corporate media has simply burnt people out in all of those categories and accomplished this among every demographic. The media are not helpful because all they do is lie. The media are not worth your time because nothing they report is accurate. The media are not appealing because they treat everyone like fools. The media are not necessary because all they do is mislead you.\n\nWhat is the media good for? Nothing.\n\nTake Democrats. For a decade, Democrats have been assured by the corporate media that the end of Donald Trump will happen right after the next commercial break. That never happened. Then they were assured there was no way he could beat Kamala Harris after supposedly losing the 2020 election. There was no way. It was impossible. This is Brat Summer, baby. Except it was not only possible, but anyone reading the polls accurately knew it was more than likely Trump would be back in the White House.\n\nThe legacy media lie, mislead, and lead everyone down their delusional path, and I think people are sick of it — sick of the hate campaigns, the 24/7 outrage over nonsense (like the White House remodeling), and the entire institution turning itself into a sporting event of who’s up, who’s down, and why the home team (Democrats) are the only team decent people cheer. It’s all so manipulative, dishonest, and shallow… It’s all noise without substance, context, or clarity.\n\nSimply put, people are sick of the media, sick of news, and hopefully looking for healthier ways to spend their time.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

I wouldn't say we're obsessed with royalty,\" Colbert contested. To which Harry responded, \"Really? I heard you elected a king.\"\n\n The Duke of Sussex was referencing President Trump, who likened himself to a king in a February social media post. The White House also showed support for the idea at the time by sharing an AI-generated image of Trump wearing a crown. \n\n However, ahead of the nationwide No Kings events protesting his administration last month, Trump denied any affiliation with royalty. \"They're referring to me as a king,” he said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. \"I'm not a king.\"\n\n Harry's comment drew swift boos from the audience, but he wasn't done just yet, adding, \"And after making such a big deal about my great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather, George III!\"\n\n To which Colbert could only respond, \"Well, he was kind of a jerk.\"\n\n When Harry asked what he needed to do to land a role in the Hallmark Christmas movie of his dreams, Colbert was quick to remind him that show business is all about who you know.\n\n \"Do you have a personal connection to any famous TV actresses?\" the host asked, making a not-so-subtle nod to Harry's wife, Suits alum Meghan Markle.\n\n The prince joked, \"I mean, I might know one.\"\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n But Harry is ready to blaze his own trail, too. \"I'll do anything. I'll record a self-tape,\" he said. \"I'll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House — all the things you people in TV do!\"\n\n The latter, of course, was a knock against CBS' parent company, Paramount, which paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump over the network's 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\n \"Harry, I didn't do any of those things,\" Colbert said, to which the royal quipped, \"Maybe that's why you're cancelled.\"\n\n The prince then worried that his Christmas stardom wasn't meant to be. \"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm never gonna be an American Hallmark prince,\" he lamented. \"And now I'm stuck here spending the holiday season in your quaint little village of Midtown Manhattan.\"\n\n However, it was beginning to look a lot like Christmas as the background shifted behind him and Colbert to reveal a group of snow-dusted trees and a jolly snowman.\n\n \"Stephen, look! It's snowing!\" Harry exclaimed. \n\n \"This isn't snow,\" Colbert replied. \"They're just already starting to tear down the Ed Sullivan Theater. This is asbestos!\"\n\n But Harry had already been hit with the holiday spirit. \"Stephen, you just have to believe!\" he said. \"Doesn't this prove anything can happen? I mean, minutes ago you said it was impossible, but look, isn't there a handsome prince standing in front of you right now?\"\n\n Swept up in the winter wonderland around them, the pair began awkwardly putting their hands on each other's shoulders and neck as if they were about to share a kiss. \n\n \"I know you want this,\" Colbert said, pausing before they could get any closer, \"but I'm afraid I have to say: I was testing you.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip has not been formally announced. It was not immediately clear where in Pennsylvania Trump would be visiting.\n\nLast month’s off-year elections showed a shift away from Republicans as public concerns about affordability persist. White House officials said afterward that Trump — who has done relatively few events domestically — would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies.\n\nThe president has said that any affordability worries are part of a Democratic “hoax” and that people simply need to hear his perspective to change their minds — an approach also embraced by Biden, who in early 2024 went to the Pennsylvania borough of Emmaus to take credit for economic improvements after inflation spiked in 2022.\n\nThe trip hints the dilemma faced by Trump. He wants to take credit for rewiring the U.S. economy with his large tariff hikes and extension of income tax cuts, but he also continues to blame Biden for the increase nationwide in inflation rates that occurred this year during his own presidency. Overall, inflation is tracking at 3% annually, up from 2.3% in April when Trump rolled out a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\n“We fixed inflation, and we fixed almost everything,” Trump said at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. He called affordability “a hoax” that was “started by the Democrats who caused the problem of pricing.”\n\nTrump won Pennsylvania narrowly last year with 50.4%, besting Democrat Kamala Harris by roughly 120,000 votes. The win was part of a broader sweep in battleground states that helped return him to the White House after his 2020 loss.\n\nAP VoteCast, an extensive survey of voters in the 2024 election, found that 7 in 10 Pennsylvania voters were “very concerned” about the cost of food and groceries. Roughly half expressed the same degree of worry over health care costs and the price of gasoline.\n\nWhile Trump can point to a decline in gasoline prices, he’s now facing inflationary pressures on utilities and a massive increase in insurance premiums for people who get their health care through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPennsylvanians who buy their own health insurance coverage are likely to see their costs increase on average by 21.5% because of the expiration of tax credits tied to the Affordable Care Act, the state said in October.\n\nPennsylvania has yet to see the boom that Trump promised would instantly happen with his return to the White House.\n\nThe state has largely preserved its Biden era job growth under Trump, but its unemployment rate has risen to 4% from 3.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There has been an increase of roughly 24,000 people who say they’re unemployed.\n\nAnnual inflation in the Philadelphia area is 3.3%, roughly the same as last year.\n\nThe Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s Beige Book in November documented an economy in decline, saying that hiring has flattened, warehouse workers are getting fewer hours on the job, inflationary pressures are coming from tariffs and sales of existing homes are decreasing. Separately, the regional Fed branch’s manufacturing survey last month showed that factory activity weakened.\n\nThe news outlet Axios first reported Trump’s plans to travel to Pennsylvania.","summary":"Trump to visit Pennsylvania to highlight efforts to curb inflation as high prices squeeze Americans  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-visits-pennsylvania-e39cd8b6253e521d909370012bf3e7af","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/72f2bef/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5851x3901+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F96%2Ff6%2F7bef313944b610f61feb3d88159d%2F7dc7002b1c364fc9aad7b95fe74abbe3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 16:39:00","author":"Josh Boak","authors":["Josh Boak"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":385032002,"title":"Mid-Day Digest","text":"THE FOUNDATION\n\n“Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections.” —George Washington (1796)\n\nIN TODAY’S DIGEST\n\nExecutive News Summary\nFeatured Analysis: Garbage In, Garbage Out\nMore Analysis\nReader Comments\nBest of Right Opinion\n\nBest of Videos\n\nToday’s Meme\n\nEXECUTIVE NEWS SUMMARY\n\nThe Editors\n\nJanuary 2021 pipe bomber in FBI custody: After nearly five years of apparently fruitless searching and finding no more information than the height of the suspect, the FBI has finally made an arrest in the case of the pipe bombs discovered near the Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters in January 2021. Brian Cole, a Virginia resident, was arrested this morning and will be arraigned later today. The Patriot Post’s Mark Alexander asks, “WHY did this take five years to resolve? The answer is in part because Biden’s weaponized DOJ spent so much time on the J6 prosecutions of the mostly nonviolent offenders. But that is not the only answer…” This story is still developing.\nIG report on Hegseth and Signal: A War Department Inspector General investigation into Secretary Pete Hegseth’s Signal snafu has concluded that he did violate departmental policy in using the app to share sensitive information, but it also noted that Hegseth had the authority to declassify intelligence. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell welcomed the IG’s report, stating that it “is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared.” He proclaimed, “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.” Hegseth also responded, posting on X, “No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.” After seeing the report, Sen. Eric Schmitt appeared to agree, calling it a “nothing burger.”\nImmigration applications frozen: Foreign aliens from 19 countries pursuing U.S. citizenship have just had their proceedings halted under a new directive from President Donald Trump. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has placed a hold on green cards, citizenship, benefit applications, and even naturalization ceremonies for nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Venezuela, and 16 other high-risk countries of concern. Additionally, all asylum applications have been frozen regardless of the nation of origin. The hold will allow USCIS to perform a “comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens” from the affected countries. This action comes on the heels of the Islamic terror attack by a legal Afghan migrant who killed one National Guardsman and injured another.\n\nHenry Cuellar pardoned: On Wednesday, President Trump announced that he had given a “full and unconditional pardon” to Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife. In May 2024, the Biden administration’s DOJ charged the couple with accepting $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan oil company and a Mexican bank. In issuing his pardon, Trump asserted that Cuellar was a victim: “the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents.” Trump noted that Cuellar had spoken out against “the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe.’” Cuellar thanked Trump “for his tremendous leadership and for taking the time to look at the facts.” It was Cuellar’s daughter who reached out to Trump in a letter, asking for compassion and clemency for her parents.\nCongress subpoenas Jack Smith’s testimony on Trump’s classified docs: The House Judiciary Committee will compel former Special Counsel Jack Smith to appear for a deposition on December 17. Smith will need to turn over documents relating to his prosecution of Donald Trump by the 12th. Committee Chairman Jim Jordan says the deposition is meant to delve into Smith’s tactics, such as placing a leading presidential candidate under a gag order during an election year. Smith’s attorneys are objecting to the deposition’s closed-door nature and requesting that it be open to the public. Smith’s desire to get Trump has been apparent, with him going so far as to say that he would have secured a conviction had Trump not won the 2024 election. Smith has said that the implication that his actions were politically motivated is “laughable.”\nTrump’s ninth cabinet meeting: On Tuesday, President Trump met with his cabinet for 2.5 hours. It was the ninth such meeting, which, as Gary Bauer pointed out, is “the same number of cabinet meetings that Joe Biden held over all four years!” Foreign policy took the main stage at the meeting, with Venezuela remaining in the spotlight. Of narco-terrorists smuggling drugs out of Venezuela on speedboats, Trump’s stated policy was “taking those son of a b****es out.” He added that strikes against cocaine manufacturing plants and drug cartels on land are coming soon. Trump once again suggested that the tariff income from his new policies is so high that soon Americans “won’t even have income tax to pay.” News media and economists are skeptical that tariffs could ever again pay for the national budget — as they did toward the end of the 1800s — but Trump has confounded them before.\n\nMedal of Honor Act raises pensions: Since 1863, some 3,528 service members have received the highest military decoration in the United States — the Medal of Honor. Up until this week, the 61 living recipients — heroes in every sense of the word — were receiving a special pension of $16,880 annually. The Medal of Honor Act, signed by President Trump on Monday, quadrupled that pension to approximately $67,500. MOH recipients “spend most of their time traveling our country, telling their stories,” says Rep. Troy Nehls, a sponsor of the legislation. This special pension will “lift the financial burden off of these selfless warriors” as they continue to inspire “the next generation of America’s heroes.”\nTrump undoes Biden’s fuel standards: In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump announced that he was rolling back Joe Biden’s restrictive fuel economy standards, asserting that doing so will save Americans some $109 billion. “Combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate, Biden’s burdensome regulations helped cause the price of cars to soar more than 425%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,” Trump explained. “Today, we’re taking one more step to kill the Green New Scam.” Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to increase vehicle fuel efficiency standards to an average of 50 miles per gallon by 2031. Trump has now eliminated that onerous and costly CAFE standard and allowed the free market to direct manufacturing output.\nWas DC killer threatened by the Taliban? The 29-year-old Afghan national who attacked two National Guard members in DC last week may have been threatened by the Taliban. Investigators are reportedly digging into information indicating that the Afghan attacker may have been motivated to carry out the attack after receiving a threat from the Taliban that they would murder his family in Afghanistan if he did not perpetrate the terrorist attack. As one intelligence source explained, “Most of them have families back home, and if the Taliban cannot get to them, they are making it very clear that they will go after their families.” The investigation is also focusing on the vetting process following Joe Biden’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan. With tens of thousands of Afghans brought into America following the U.S.‘s exit, the effort by the Taliban to blackmail and weaponize them for terrorism against Americans is troubling.\nICE arrests another Afghan terrorist in the U.S.: Not only did the U.S. waste $148 billion on Afghanistan reconstruction from 2002 to 2025 to no avail, but it also spent $14 billion to resettle nearly 200,000 Afghans in the U.S. with shoddy vetting. After the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration abandoned certain protocols in the interest of processing tens of thousands of Afghans into our country quickly. There was no way to check the identities of anyone coming in because, at the time, the Afghan government was in chaos. As a result, on Wednesday, another Afghan man with links to the terrorist group that killed 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate was arrested by federal immigration officials. Jaan Shah SafiSafi is a terrorist linked to ISIS-K and is the third Afghan to be detained in the past week.\n\nICE agents descend on Minneapolis to crack down on Somali migrants (NY Post)\nVenezuela resumes accepting U.S. deportation flights after Trump closes airspace to country (Fox News)\nCalifornia announces new online portal to report alleged misconduct by federal agents (Just the News)\nIllinois police department rehires illegal alien arrested by ICE earlier this year (Not the Bee)\nTrump-backed congressional push to halt state AI regs falls short (National Review)\nTexas Tech restricts teaching of race and gender (Fox News)\nHumor: Democrats accuse Luke Skywalker of war crimes for using more than one proton torpedo against Death Star (Babylon Bee)\n\nFor the Executive Summary archive, click here.\n\nComment | Share\n\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\n\nGarbage In, Garbage Out\n\nNate Jackson\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage,” said President Donald Trump of the Democrat representative from Minneapolis Somalia. “She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage.”\n\nHoo boy, Trump does know how to stir the pot!\n\nNo one should even pretend to be shocked by what Trump says anymore. Ruffling feathers is his MO. But by all means, let’s talk about presidents and presidential candidates saying insulting things.\n\nTrump made those remarks in a cabinet meeting, though it’s not the only time he’s had bad things to say about Somalis.\n\nI don’t want 'em in our country, I’ll be honest with you. Some people will say, “Ooh, that’s not politically correct!” I don’t care. I don’t want 'em in our country. Their country’s no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want 'em in our country. …\n\nOur country’s at a tipping point. We could go bad. … We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.\n\nIlhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people that work. These aren’t people that say, “Let’s go, come on. Let’s make this place great.” These are people that do nothing but complain. …\n\nWhen they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but b****, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.\n\nPerhaps those comments are or should be beneath the dignity of the Oval Office. Imagine George Washington or Ronald Reagan saying such a thing.\n\nHowever, Trump is just saying out loud what many Americans think and say themselves. And he’s right about the specifics. He also didn’t insult anyone for immutable characteristics (i.e., racism), but focused on their actions and contributions to society, or lack thereof.\n\nSomali migrants, many represented by Ilhan “I Married My Brother to Commit Immigration Fraud” Omar, have been working a huge scam to steal a billion dollars from American citizen taxpayers. The level of COVID relief and Medicaid fraud is astounding. Democrats particularly hate it when money for their redistribution schemes is threatened by constitutional or tax restraint. But they have no problem when Somalis steal from programs meant for poor families, children, and the disabled.\n\nAmericans have every right to think those criminals are “garbage.”\n\nEspecially when those criminals and their representative hate America. Though the “fact-checkers” rallied to her defense, one might have good reason to doubt Omar’s loyalty.\n\nOur Samantha Koch has more on that scam today.\n\nIn response to Trump, National Review’s Kathryn Jean Lopez argues, “It is despicable to call human beings 'garbage.’” She makes a compelling pro-life case for how we talk about other people, and, as a fellow Christian, I certainly agree that humans are made in God’s image and we ought to be very careful and circumspect when harshly condemning others. We’re all pretty messy sometimes. I know I don’t enjoy being on the receiving end of pointed criticism, especially when I deserve it, and I try to remember that when dishing it out.\n\nHowever, I also don’t think that “judge not” is a blanket prohibition on deciding whether another person is doing terrible things or has bad character.\n\nIf you steal massive amounts of money, you might be garbage. If you violently traffic humans and drugs, you might be garbage. If you sexually abuse minor girls as a rich guy with an island — or as a “refugee” from Somalia — you might be garbage. If you murder innocent Americans, you might be garbage. I have little problem saying so.\n\nWhether the American president — maybe especially one with Trump’s personal history — ought to say such things is another matter.\n\nYet even there, consider these things:\n\nBarack Obama derided his political opponents because they “get bitter” and “cling to guns or religion.” Hillary Clinton called her political opponents a “basket of deplorables.” In the most direct comparison, Joe Biden labeled Trump’s supporters “garbage,” which, fortunately, precipitated Trump’s hilarious garbage truck response. All of those Democrats, especially Biden and his sidekick/replacement Kamala Harris, falsely derided (implicitly or explicitly) people on the Right as Nazis, fascists, white supremacists, and the like. They clearly hold conservative Americans in contempt, and on multiple occasions, Biden even threatened those Americans.\n\nTim Walz, Harris’s running mate and the Minnesota governor who might be complicit in the aforementioned fraud, said we “should demonize” people like Elon Musk and “bully the s**t” out of Trump. Now he worries that Trump has “normalized this type of hateful behavior.”\n\nDo you know what the difference is between their comments and Trump’s?\n\nThose Democrats were condemning law-abiding Christian conservative Americans. Trump is expressing justifiable frustration with criminal Somalis who generally hate this country. Yes, Omar is a U.S. citizen, but she is also a criminal. She just didn’t have a Manhattan DA fabricate a bunch of felonies to get a conviction.\n\nSo, I guess if people want to get especially worked up about Trump because his rant was more colorful than the typical slimy utterances of Democrats, fine. Just don’t pretend that somehow he’s “breaking norms” or is a unique brand of awful.

Harry, 41, entered to a standing ovation after Colbert explained how impossible it would be to happen upon a prince, as many a Hallmark holiday film has insinuated. But the seemingly confused Harry remarked that he \"thought this was the audition for 'The Gingerbread Prince Saves Christmas in Nebraska.'\"\n\nWhen Colbert questions why Harry would want to audition for such a film, the prince said Americans are \"obsessed with Christmas movies, and you're clearly obsessed with royalty,\" given that \"I heard you elected a king,\" referring to President Donald Trump.\n\nPrince Harry sasses Duchess Meghan in ambient Netflix holiday special\n\nStill trying to get an audition for the nonexistent Hallmark movie, Harry said he would do \"anything.\"\n\n\"I'll record a self-tape, I'll fly myself to an audition, I'll settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House, all the things you people in TV do!\" he added.

During a cameo appearance on CBS’ \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" the British royal family member chided Americans for electing a \"king.\" Joking about his desire to play the \"Gingerbread Prince\" in a fictional Hallmark Christmas movie, Harry told Colbert, \"Well, you Americans are obsessed with Christmas movies and you’re clearly obsessed with royalty, so why not?\" \"Hold on, I wouldn’t say we’re obsessed with royalty,\" Colbert replied. \"Really?

ADVOCACY GROUP CEO CLAIMS HE WAS OFFERED $20 MILLION TO RECRUIT PROTESTERS FOR ANTI-TRUMP DEMONSTRATIONS Harry’s jab echoed the anti-Trump sentiment at October’s \"No Kings\" protest, during which scores of liberals and Trump critics demonstrated nationwide to express their opposition to the president’s second-term agenda. Organizers of the protests claimed they were defending democracy from what they saw as Trump’s authoritarian rule. Harry followed up by poking fun at Americans for electing \"king\" Trump after \"making such a big deal about my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, George III\" – his reference to the American Revolution. PROTESTERS TARGET TRUMP ADMIN POLICIES WITH MARCH TO WHITE HOUSE, DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT COUNTRY \"Well, he was kind of a jerk,\" Colbert shot back. \"OK, let it go,\" Harry joked.

He mentioned that he’d even go so far as to sue the Trump administration. \"I’ll record a self-tape, I’ll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House – all the things you people on TV do,\" he said. The line was meant as a dig for Colbert’s parent company, CBS, which settled with Trump earlier this year after the president sued the broadcaster for allegedly editing its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.

Her friends are garbage.”\n\nHoo boy, Trump does know how to stir the pot!\n\nNo one should even pretend to be shocked by what Trump says anymore. Ruffling feathers is his MO. But by all means, let’s talk about presidents and presidential candidates saying insulting things.\n\nTrump made those remarks in a cabinet meeting, though it’s not the only time he’s had bad things to say about Somalis.\n\nI don’t want ‘em in our country, I’ll be honest with you. Some people will say, “Ooh, that’s not politically correct!” I don’t care. I don’t want 'em in our country. Their country’s no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want 'em in our country. …\n\nOur country’s at a tipping point. We could go bad. … We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.\n\nIlhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people that work. These aren’t people that say, “Let’s go, come on. Let’s make this place great.” These are people that do nothing but complain. …\n\nWhen they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but b****, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.\n\nPerhaps those comments are or should be beneath the dignity of the Oval Office. Imagine George Washington or Ronald Reagan saying such a thing.\n\nHowever, Trump is just saying out loud what many Americans think and say themselves. And he’s right about the specifics. He also didn’t insult anyone for immutable characteristics (i.e., racism), but focused on their actions and contributions to society, or lack thereof.\n\nSomali migrants, many represented by Ilhan “I Married My Brother to Commit Immigration Fraud” Omar, have been working a huge scam to steal a billion dollars from American citizen taxpayers. The level of COVID relief and Medicaid fraud is astounding. Democrats particularly hate it when money for their redistribution schemes is threatened by constitutional or tax restraint. But they have no problem when Somalis steal from programs meant for poor families, children, and the disabled.\n\nAmericans have every right to think those criminals are “garbage.”\n\nEspecially when those criminals and their representative hate America. Though the “fact-checkers” rallied to her defense, one might have good reason to doubt Omar’s loyalty.\n\nOur Samantha Koch has more on that scam today.\n\nIn response to Trump, National Review’s Kathryn Jean Lopez argues, “It is despicable to call human beings 'garbage.’” She makes a compelling pro-life case for how we talk about other people, and, as a fellow Christian, I certainly agree that humans are made in God’s image and we ought to be very careful and circumspect when harshly condemning others. We’re all pretty messy sometimes. I know I don’t enjoy being on the receiving end of pointed criticism, especially when I deserve it, and I try to remember that when dishing it out.\n\nHowever, I also don’t think that “judge not” is a blanket prohibition on deciding whether another person is doing terrible things or has bad character.\n\nIf you steal massive amounts of money, you might be garbage. If you violently traffic humans and drugs, you might be garbage. If you sexually abuse minor girls as a rich guy with an island — or as a “refugee” from Somalia — you might be garbage. If you murder innocent Americans, you might be garbage. I have little problem saying so.\n\nWhether the American president — maybe especially one with Trump’s personal history — ought to say such things is another matter.\n\nYet even there, consider these things:\n\nBarack Obama derided his political opponents because they “get bitter” and “cling to guns or religion.” Hillary Clinton called her political opponents a “basket of deplorables.” In the most direct comparison, Joe Biden labeled Trump’s supporters “garbage,” which, fortunately, precipitated Trump’s hilarious garbage truck response. All of those Democrats, especially Biden and his sidekick/replacement Kamala Harris, falsely derided (implicitly or explicitly) people on the Right as Nazis, fascists, white supremacists, and the like. They clearly hold conservative Americans in contempt, and on multiple occasions, Biden even threatened those Americans.\n\nTim Walz, Harris’s running mate and the Minnesota governor who might be complicit in the aforementioned fraud, said we “should demonize” people like Elon Musk and “bully the s**t” out of Trump. Now he worries that Trump has “normalized this type of hateful behavior.”\n\nDo you know what the difference is between their comments and Trump’s?\n\nThose Democrats were condemning law-abiding Christian conservative Americans. Trump is expressing justifiable frustration with criminal Somalis who generally hate this country. Yes, Omar is a U.S. citizen, but she is also a criminal. She just didn’t have a Manhattan DA fabricate a bunch of felonies to get a conviction.\n\nSo, I guess if people want to get especially worked up about Trump because his rant was more colorful than the typical slimy utterances of Democrats, fine. Just don’t pretend that somehow he’s “breaking norms” or is a unique brand of awful. And for heaven’s sake, quit with the fantasies that places like Somalia aren’t complete disasters because the people there do terrible things. We have enough trouble in this country without importing that kind of, well, garbage.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/123213-garbage-in-garbage-out-2025-12-04","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KBMZQNYTQW5SA220Y1NAX286.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 15:39:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"culture","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.443},{"id":385012508,"title":"Why US economy is 'heading for trouble': analysis","text":"During former President Joe Biden's four years in the White House, liberal economist and former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman repeatedly praised his economic record — emphasizing that the United States enjoyed record-low unemployment rates under Biden's watch. Biden, Krugman notes, inherited a deadly pandemic that ultimately killed more than 1 million Americans, yet in early 2023, U.S. unemployment was as low as 3.4 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nBut frustration over inflation, polls showed, gave Donald Trump an advantage in the 2024 election, and he defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by roughly 1.5 percent in the national popular vote. Now, ten and one-half months into Trump's second presidency, Krugman is warning that a variety of Trump policies — from steep new tariffs to compromising the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve — are putting the U.S. economy in grave danger.\n\nThe United States, in late 2025, isn't in a recession. But in an opinion column published on December 4, Hamish McRae — a columnist for the i Paper in the UK — lays out some reasons why the U.S. could face a recession in 2026.\n\n\"The American economy is heading for trouble, and it may go into recession next year,\" McRae warns. \"If that happens, it would be bad news for the rest of us, including the UK. That old adage still applies: when the U.S. sneezes, Europe catches a cold. At first sight, that might seem an overly pessimistic outlook. U.S. shares are still close to their all-time highs, with the S&P 500 index up 16 per cent this year. Unemployment, at 4.4 per cent, is the highest since 2021, but is only creeping upwards. And while consumer confidence fell sharply last month, that was probably associated with the government shutdown, which is now over.\"\n\nMcRae goes on to list some \"powerful reasons to expect things to slow down sharply in the coming months.\"\n\n\"One is that the stock market boom has been driven by its technology giants, with the top 10 companies accounting for more than one-third of the total capitalization, up from 18 per cent 10 years ago,\" the i Paper columnist explains. \"Another is that U.S. house prices have weakened. They are not facing an overall collapse, though in some regions, notably Florida, they are very soft. But the big rises of recent years have come to an end, and prices overall are expected to run behind pay increases. The greatest concern, however, is what artificial intelligence will do to the job market. In the long-run it is clear that AI will give a huge boost to the overall efficiency of the world economy, and since the U.S. is in the forefront of its development, it should in theory at least be the principal beneficiary. But in the short-run, it is killing jobs.\"\n\nMcRae adds, \"An analysis by a U.S. firm, Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that AI was cited in U.S. company reports and presentations in enabling a headcount reduction of nearly 50,000 jobs this year. Some 31,000 of those were cut in October alone.\"\n\nThe British columnist stresses that if the U.S. goes into a recession, there is no way the UK won't be affected by it.\n\n\"First, the chances are that recession would pop the equity bubble in America and would inevitably affect share prices in London too,\" McRae argues. \"Not a catastrophe, for our markets are much more reasonably valued than the U.S. ones. But it would cast a cloud. Second, any economic slowdown in the U.S. affects our economy directly because it is our largest single export market, though smaller than the EU as a whole. Third, the forces that are cutting jobs there are the same as those affecting employment here.\"\n\nHamish McRae's full i Paper column is available at this link.","summary":"During former President Joe Biden's four years in the White House, liberal economist and former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman repeatedly praised his economic record — emphasizing that the United States enjoyed record-low unemployment rates under Biden's watch.
