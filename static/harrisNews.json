They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the number of job losses was “likely going to be in the thousands” — on top of the dismissal of nearly 300,000 federal workers and contractors earlier this year under the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency initiative.\n\nVought requested Reduction in Force (RIF) plans last week from agencies across the roughly 3 million-strong federal civilian workforce, setting the stage for deep cuts as Democrats balked at a temporary spending bill that would have averted a shutdown.\n\nAbout 750,000 federal employees are furloughed during the shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office, though the precise number varies each day.\n\nHeavily impacted agencies include the Food and Drug Administration, which planned to temporarily dismiss 40% of its 80,000-person workforce, and the Education Department, which planned to furlough 95% of employees not tasked with administering student aid.\n\nLeavitt said Thursday Trump and Vought intend to “look at agencies that don’t align with the administration’s values” for the deepest cuts.\n\nThe country entered its first multi-day shutdown since January 2019 due to Democratic demands for the continuation of more generous pandemic-era subsidies for about 22 million people who purchased health insurance through Obamacare exchanges.\n\nRepublicans note those benefits don’t expire until Dec. 31 — providing ample time for negotiations — and oppose items in a Democratic counter-proposal that would restore National Public Radio funding and hospital reimbursements for care of illegal immigrants. The Democratic plan would cost an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years and has been voted down by the Senate along party lines twice.\n\nThere’s been little progress between the two sides, with Republican leaders hoping for more defections from Democratic senators.\n\nThe shutdown started Wednesday when a majority of Senate Democrats used the 60-vote filibuster in the upper chamber to block a House-passed bill to continue federal spending at current levels through Nov. 21. The vote failed, with 55 senators in favor and 45 opposed.\n\nThree Democrats — Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats— voted to advance the temporary spending bill. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the lone Republican opposed.\n\nA post-shutdown vote on Wednesday produced the same 55-45 split and there were no votes Thursday in recognition of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. \n\nAnother vote to advance the seven-week stopgap bill is expected to fail on Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) told reporters Thursday. \n\nThune added that it was “unlikely” there would be weekend votes — meaning that the shutdown would stretch into at least next week barring unexpected developments.\n\n“They’ll have a fourth chance tomorrow to open up the government. If that fails, we’ll give them the weekend to think about it. We’ll come back, vote again Monday,” Thune said.\n\nThe White House has warned of potential disruptions to major programs, including the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program, which provides financial assistance to low-income mothers with young children to improve nutrition.\n\nThe WIC program has enough funding to run for about a week or two before benefits begin to run dry for recipients, Ali Hard, director of public policy for the National WIC Association, told ABC News.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has sought to increase the pressure on Democrats while calling for more centrists to defect.\n\nVought on Wednesday paused $18 billion in Transportation Department funds for New York’s Gateway Tunnel project and Second Avenue subway extension — ostensibly to review Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies among grant beneficiaries — in a move meant to undercut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who both hail from Brooklyn.\n\nHours later, the budget chief announced the Energy Department’s clawback of $8 billion in green-energy spending in 16 states including California and New York, all of which backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who met with Trump at the White House Thursday afternoon, insisted the Vought “takes no pleasure in this.”\n\n“Russ does this reluctantly,” Johnson claimed. “He is not enjoying that responsibility.”\n\nThe most recent shutdown lasted 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019 as congressional Democrats refused Trump’s demand to fund a US-Mexico border wall. Trump ultimately directed military funds to the project, ending the impasse.","summary":"About 750,000 federal employees are furloughed during the shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/02/us-news/trump-sharpens-ax-on-government-shutdown-day-two-with-thousands-of-federal-firings-planned/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-s91bwiw91-1759446498963.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1759432160&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6BOdEpvs-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-02 22:55:39","author":"Diana Nerozzi,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Nerozzi","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.04},{"id":365676106,"title":"Trump ally threatens immigration sweep at Bad Bunny Super Bowl show","text":"Bad Bunny recently said his worldwide tour skipped the United States over fears that immigration officials would target his concerts.

Nelson \n\nThe hierarchical equivalent of a pope, Russell M. Nelson, died on Saturday. Next Tuesday’s funeral for the 101-year-old leader will likely be translated into some 93 languages and beamed by satellite from downtown Salt Lake City to more than 19,000 local Latter-day Saint Church buildings worldwide.\n\nUnder centralized leadership, adherents of the 17 million-member church whose assets approach $300 billion—dwarfing most national gross domestic products—deemed Nelson a “prophet, seer and revelator.”\n\nNelson’s final address to church members, in April, referenced Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.”\n\n“And so, [Nelson] talked about looking for peace, looking for ways to bring down the temperature, and how prescient that was,” former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney told Deseret News.\n\nNelson’s death came just one day before the tragic murder of four parishioners worshipping in a Michigan Latter-day Saint chapel last Sunday morning. The gunman, who destroyed the church via arson, died in a shootout with police.\n\nNelson’s nearly eight-year term brought significant changes to the Church of Jesus Christ, including changing nomenclature away from “Mormon Church” to greater emphasis on Jesus Christ. Nelson instructed members to invoke the church’s full name whenever possible, rather than referring to Mormon, a prophetic figure in one of the church’s canonical texts.\n\nNelson allowed women and youth to serve as witnesses for baptismal ordinances and women to serve as witnesses for temple rituals. He also shortened Sunday services, from three hours to two hours, to encourage greater teaching at home for a “home-centered church.”\n\nNelson forged a partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, donating $10 million to the organization. Under Nelson’s watch, the iconic hymn “Amazing Grace,” returned to the Latter-day Saints hymnal, along with other Christian songs shared by Protestant denominations.\n\nUnlike Catholics’ smoke-signaling conclave, Nelson’s successor has long been known because Latter-day Saint prophetic succession is based on seniority of the longest-serving Apostle. That is Dallin Oaks, whose secular career included serving as a Utah Supreme Court justice, University of Chicago law professor, and clerk for former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren.\n\nDallin Oaks’ Devotion to Religious Liberty \n\nGiven rising hostilities toward people of faith, it is fortuitous that Oaks is a brilliant legal mind at the forefront of defending religious liberty, urging ecumenical efforts to protect religious freedom on platforms ranging from Duke Law School and First Things magazine to University of Virginia.\n\n“I am one of many Latter-day Saints whose DNA includes a desire for religious freedom, felt as fundamental as the marrow in our bones,” Oaks told the 2022 Notre Dame Religious Liberty Summit in Rome. “For me personally, religious liberty is not academic,” Oaks said, sharing his painful family history of Latter-day Saint ancestors murdered, imprisoned, driven from their burning homes at the hands of state and federal government or violent mob action due to religious discrimination.\n\nOaks said, “We have learned that the best remedy for religious persecution that affects us is to join in efforts to reduce religious persecution that affects others.”\n\nGiven that conservatives generally value traditional faith and religious liberty more than progressives today, it’s no coincidence that Latter-day Saints have become more Republican over time. Pew reported 73% of Latter-day Saints identified as Republican last year, compared to 65% in 2007. Latter-day Saints are heavily involved in conservative politics, and during the 2024 election, President Donald Trump defeated rival Kamala Harris in Utah by nearly 22 points.\n\nYet in America, Oaks faces challenges: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints struggles mightily with public perception. A 2023 Pew survey measuring religious attitudes found Americans view members of that church as least favorable—below atheists and Muslims. Pew reported that non-Latter-day Saints who know someone from that church are “more likely to express an unfavorable view (31% vs. 22%),” of the faith.\n\nA Church at the Crossroads \n\nNow a non-denominational Protestant, I am a former Latter-day Saints Church member and Brigham Young University graduate. My ancestors helped found the church—working directly with early leaders like founder Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. I am proud of what my ancestors built in Utah: America’s strongest social mobility.\n\nI met Nelson and his wife when I lived in New York City, where my cousin invited me to sing during the Nelsons’ visit to young professionals. They welcomed my choral voice even though I’d left the fold; I found the Nelsons warm and gracious.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faces a crossroads, and I believe it’s turning toward interdenominational bridge building. Next month, the basketball arena of Utah Valley University, a Latter-day Saints-dominated school and site of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, will host evangelical megachurch pastor Greg Laurie for a revival event called “Hope for America.” Aimed at healing wounds and reviving students grieving Kirk, it could be a pivotal step toward bringing Latter-day Saints into greater fellowship with people of faith around the world.\n\nCarrie Sheffield is author of ”Motorhome Prophecies: A Journey of Healing and Forgiveness” and program manager of Healthy Faith. \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Three voters in Stafford County went to court to allege candidate Stacey Carroll does not live in the 64th district and instead in the neighboring, Democratic-majority, 23rd – and want her booted from the ballot. Plaintiffs Stephen Schwartz, Judith Anne Parker and Juliet Schweiter alleged Carroll continues to live near US-1 in Aquia, Virginia – at the southern edge of the 23rd district, but filed to run for office from an address about seven miles southwestward near Stafford Court House, Virginia, in the 64th. Local residents are asking the court to throw out Carroll’s voter registration at the Stafford address, which they argue would disqualify her from the ballot. RAMASWAMY ENDORSES WINSOME EARLE-SEARS FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR, RALLY PLANNED NEXT WEEK IN SWING SUBURB That address is reportedly registered to another family, and a 1966 Virginia court ruling puts the burden of proof-of-residency on the voter registrant or ballot applicant, according to the Virginia Mercury. While a seemingly local matter, the result of the case could have wide-ranging implications for the final tally on Election Day as all 100 House of Delegates seats are up for grabs and Democrats achieved the rare accomplishment of running candidates in all of them – including reliably Republican seats in far-flung rural regions like St. Charles, Big Stone Gap and Tazewell. COURT SHUTS DOWN REDISTRICTING FIGHT IN KEY SWING STATE — HERE’S WHAT IT MEANS If her candidacy stands, Carroll will face Republican Del. Paul Milde of Stafford in a district that narrowly went for President Donald Trump in 2024 by just under two points. If she is found to truly live in Aquia, her home-district seat would be that of Democratic Del. Candi King of Prince William; a much safer and more suburban seat that went for former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 66-31. A tie loses in the House of Delegates, meaning Republicans need only three seats to win back the majority, but cannot afford to lose tight ones like Milde’s. ‘DON’T MARYLAND MY VIRGINIA’: YOUNGKIN, 2025 GOP TICKET RALLIES TOGETHER FOR FIRST TIME AHEAD OF KEY ELECTION Democrats won back the House of Delegates in the last election in 2023, scoring a 52-48 majority. Republicans currently have one vacancy after House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Luray, resigned to now-briefly become U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Carroll’s chances of flipping Milde’s seat give Republicans an additional roadblock in their quest to take back the chamber. They are also fielding other tightly contested races, including in Hampton Roads. LONE MARYLAND GOP CONGRESSMAN WARNS REDISTRICTING COULD CUT WHITE HOUSE TIES FOR ENTIRE STATE Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Poquoson, is the only Black Republican in the chamber and represents a district Harris narrowly won. Republicans are laser focused on the seat, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and lieutenant gubernatorial candidate John Reid have all stumped for Cordoza. Like exurban Stafford, Hampton Roads is perennially competitive: Democrats tend to have the edge in state races, while Republicans, such as incumbent Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, often prevail in federal contests. DEMS WANTED TO DRAW EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT OF MARYLAND BUT NOW LAMBAST TEXAS REDISTRICTING Earle-Sears previously shocked the area in 2001 by winning an otherwise routinely-Democrat-held seat in Virginia Beach – launching her into the commonwealth’s political conscience. Several other seats in the region – which also includes Norfolk, Portsmouth, Hampton, Chesapeake and Isle of Wight – are seen as potential pickups for the opposing party. Reid’s race is also expected to weigh heavily on Republicans' chances of controlling Richmond beyond the governor’s seat. While Democrats control the upper chamber, Earle-Sears is statutorily the tie-breaking vote. Divided similarly to the House, the Senate’s partisan future may hang in the balance depending on whether Reid can defeat state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Reid would break ties in favor of Republicans, meaning they only need to win back two more Senate seats. Hashmi would do the opposite, meaning the GOP would need three.

Vought has the authority to determine which programs are essential during a shutdown. \n\nSchumer was furious at the news, telling reporters shortly after voting for a second time against funding the government that Vought “is using New Yorkers and New Jerseyites as pawns, and it’s a disgusting thing, and it shows how little regard Vought and [President Donald] Trump have for working families.”\n\nRepublicans have responded to criticism of the shutdown by placing blame on Democrats, who they say forced a situation where Vought has to eliminate some spending after Democrats voted down a seven-week funding extension.\n\n“Sometimes you have to do things you don’t want to do, and it’s because the Democrats have put us into this position,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday, when asked about Vought’s measures, adding:\n\nIf the Democrats did not vote to shut down the government, we would not be standing up here talking about layoffs today.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., has similarly stood by the administration, saying Thursday morning, “As you know, whomever is seated in the chair at OMB during the shutdown has to do the same thing,” and that Vought “has to sit down and decide, because he’s in charge of that office—which policies, personnel, and which programs are essential, and which are not.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who represents a swing district in the lower Hudson Valley that favored Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, however, has urged the administration to go easy on the Empire State.\n\n“Congressman Lawler strongly opposes these harmful cuts, which undermine, amongst other things, our counterterrorism efforts and critical infrastructure projects in New York,” his spokesman, Nate Soule, said in a statement. “Congressman Lawler has been in active discussions with the White House since Tuesday morning to reverse both of these decisions and fully restore the funding.”\n\nRep.

Trump attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook for cause this summer, accusing her of mortgage fraud and marking the first time a president has ever attempted to remove a Fed governor from office in the central bank&apos;s 112-year history. Cook has denied wrongdoing and filed suit to block her firing, with the Supreme Court to hear arguments in January after lower courts sided with Cook. \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told FOX Business. \"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\" The Fed&apos;s Board of Governors is a seven-member body led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. FED PRESIDENT WARNS INFLATION IS &apos;GOING THE WRONG WAY&apos; AS TARIFF CONCERNS MOUNT The seven Fed governors all serve on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the panel that is responsible for setting interest rate policy and adjusting the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate as needed to fulfill the Fed&apos;s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability in-line with the Fed&apos;s 2% long-run inflation target. The FOMC has five other members who include the New York Fed president, as well as four positions that rotate annually among the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. To help insulate policymakers from political pressure, members of the Fed&apos;s Board of Governors serve 14-year terms that are staggered across presidential administrations. That allows them to make monetary policy moves based on their view of economic conditions, rather than being subject to political influence and potential removal if they don&apos;t do the bidding of a given administration. FED&apos;S GOOLSBEE SAYS CENTRAL BANK HAS OTHER DATA OPTIONS IF SHUTDOWN DISRUPTS ECONOMIC REPORTS Currently, four of the seven members of the Fed&apos;s Board of Governors were appointed by Republicans, with Powell, Michelle Bowman, and Christopher Waller appointed to their roles during Trump&apos;s first term, and Stephen Miran, who was confirmed to the role last month. Miran&apos;s current term only runs through Jan. 31, 2026, as it&apos;s the remainder of the term that belonged to former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August. He may be reappointed to the role to fill the next term for that seat, as he hasn&apos;t served a full-term, though it&apos;s unclear at this time whether he will return to the Trump administration or be nominated to stay on the Fed&apos;s board. If Trump&apos;s effort to remove Cook from the Fed is successful, it would give him the opportunity to nominate another governor who would serve on the Fed&apos;s board over the long-term – as Cook&apos;s term doesn&apos;t expire until 2038. Cook was confirmed in 2022 for her initial term with a party line vote of 51-50 when then Vice-President Kamala Harris had to cast the tie-breaking vote in her role as President of the Senate. She was confirmed again in 2023 for a full 14-year term by a vote of 51-47. TRUMP&apos;S NEWEST FED GOVERNOR STEPHEN MIRAN VOWS TO BE &apos;AS INDEPENDENT AS I CAN&apos; Other than the Fed governor post currently filled by Miran that opens in January and the potential removal of Cook pending the outcome of her lawsuit, only one other governor&apos;s term is scheduled to expire in the remainder of Trump&apos;s term. Fed Chair Jerome Powell&apos;s term as chairman expires in May 2026, although he may continue to serve out his term as a member of the board through January 2028 if he chooses to do so. Powell hasn&apos;t indicated whether he plans to resign from his role as a Fed governor when his term as chairman expires. While recent Fed chairs have resigned and left the central bank entirely after their terms as chair ended, it wouldn&apos;t be unprecedented for Powell to remain as a governor. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE That dynamic played out most recently with Marriner Eccles, who served as Fed chair from 1934 to 1948, then remained on as a member of the Fed&apos;s board of governors until 1951.

The Californian Governor recently took to X to troll JD Vance with an edited picture of him. While many applauded Newsom for the post, several called him out for his “hypocrisy” considering his previous statements regarding the use of AI.\n\nNewsom is often quick to retaliate with his online trolling every time he is targeted by Donald Trump. This time, though, it was not the President whom the Governor had in mind as he took to X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nA video of JD Vance looking eerily similar to a cartoon character was posted to X by Newsom. In the edited video, the Vice President’s face was noticeably pale yellow. He also donned a pair of white frames on his face. If you look closely, the 41-year-old can be seen wearing overalls as well.\n\nThe Vice President’s edited clip made him look like the animated characters known as the Minions. “PSA from JD,” the caption on the post read. “If you’re flying today, I hope, of course, you arrive safely and on time,” Vance was heard saying in an unusually high pitch.\n\nThe original clip, which was edited and posted, came from Vance’s interview with Fox News. In a voice that does not belong to him, he can be heard explaining how people might face flight delays due to the government shutdown.\n\nNetizens did not miss a beat while they took to social media and called out Newsom’s “hypocrisy.” Last year, the California Governor had expressed his disapproval of AI’s use to manipulate an individual’s voice. The post from Newsom came after Elon Musk used AI to manipulate Kamala Harris’s campaign ad.\n\n“Manipulating a voice in an ‘ad’ like this one should be illegal,” Newsom had written back then. He then went on to pledge to sign a bill “in a matter of weeks to make sure it is.” Social media users were quick to repost the original post while questioning Newsom’s recent online activity.\n\nOthers cut the Governor slack by noting that there was a difference between using AI to manipulate a campaign ad and a “satire” post. Newsom’s attack on Vance comes right after he took to the platform to troll President Trump.\n\nThe 57-year-old recently posted an AI-generated image of the President portrayed as the French Queen Marie Antoinette. “TRUMP ‘MARIE ANTOINETTE’ SAYS, ‘NO HEALTH CARE FOR YOU PEASANTS, BUT A BALLROOM FOR THE QUEEN!” he wrote in the caption that accompanied the picture.","summary":"Netizens question Gavin Newsom's 'hyporcrisy' for using AI to troll JD Vance in new post.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/gavin-newsom-accused-of-hypocrisy-after-using-ai-to-troll-jd-vance-in-new-post","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gavin-Newsom-criticised-for-trolling-JD-Vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 21:10:45","author":"Donald Trump.

Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency, Grid Deployment, and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.\n\n“Of the 321 financial awards terminated, 26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Those awards alone were valued at over $3.1 billion,” the department said in the announcement.\n\nMassachusetts officials did not immediately respond to inquiries about programs affected here.\n\nBut the cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.\n\n“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”\n\nThe DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November.\n\n“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.\n\nThe Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.\n\nDemocrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.\n\n“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.\n\nVought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.","summary":"The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election, including Massachusetts.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/02/feds-slash-billions-in-green-new-scam-cash/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25247701722332.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 20:45:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":365646828,"title":"Newsom slams Trump for following Project 2025, clean energy cuts in blue state","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Donald Trump for working with Russell Vought, who helped create Project 2025, a far-right plan for a second Trump presidency.On Thursday, Trump announced on Truth Social that he was meeting with Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to decide which Democratic federal agencies should be cut during the government shutdown, as per the report by The Daily Beast.Trump meets vought for agency cutsTrump wrote, “I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies… he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent”.He also wrote, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.

As OMB director, Vought is responsible for overseeing and implementing the president's budget priorities across the federal government. President Trump said Thursday that he's meeting with Vought to determine whether \"many Democrat agencies\" are cut temporarily or permanently. Mr. Trump has said the ongoing government shutdown is a chance for Vought to cut out programs Democrats like, making it clear who is in charge of slashing the federal workforce. \"I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"Vought wants to slash federal jobs and spending, and has worked to in the past As Mr. Trump suggested, Vought is leading the charge of cutting federal agencies and employees, a vision he's been trying to implement during the president's term thus far. \"You all know Russell Vought,\" the president said Tuesday. \"He's become very popular recently because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way. So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown, because, because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits. We can cut large numbers of people.\"Vought has also sought to claw back congressionally authorized federal spending through rescissions. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said Thursday on Fox News that Vought has been \"dreaming about this moment, preparing for this moment since puberty.\" Vought told Fox Business this week that \"there are all manner of authorities to be able to keep this administration's policy agenda moving forward, and that includes reducing the size and scope of the government, and we will be looking for opportunities to do that.\" Vought is freezing or cutting funding in blue states during the shutdown On Wednesday, Vought announced the administration will cancel $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 states. All of the states voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and have Democrats in the Senate. \"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" he wrote on X Wednesday. Vought also announced the administration is withholding $18 billion in funding for two infrastructure projects in New York City, a city represented by the two Democratic leaders in Congress. \"Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,\" Vought wrote on X. The Department of Transportation specifically mentioned Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in announcing the funding freeze, blaming them for the government shutdown. Vought is one of the authors of Project 2025As the president highlighted, Vought is one of the co-authors of Project 2025 the Trump-aligned Heritage Foundation's ultra-conservative policy blueprint for a Republican administration. Vought is responsible for writing a key chapter in the 900-page document on the executive office of the president, arguing agencies should carry out the president's agenda and that the president should restrict the autonomy of agencies' bureaucratic experts.Vought was also the vice president of Heritage Action, Heritage's lobbying arm. Vought was part of the first Trump administration Vought was also in leadership at OMB during Mr. Trump's first term, serving as both its deputy director and director.

For example, Comey once railed against lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, who was convicted of misleading federal investigators, and said her case served as an example to deter others from lying to officials. \"The Stewart experience -reminded me that the justice system is an honor system,\" Comey wrote in his book, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" released in 2018. \"We really can’t always tell when people are lying or hiding documents, so when we are able to prove it, we simply must do so as a message to everyone. People must fear the consequences of lying in the justice system or the system can’t work.\" MARTHA STEWART'S ANGER AT JAMES COMEY FOR MAKING HER 'TROPHY' CRIMINAL IS 'UNDERSTANDABLE,' ATTORNEY SAYS \"There once was a time when most people worried about going to hell if they violated an oath taken in the name of God,\" Comey wrote. \"That divine deterrence has slipped away from our modern cultures. In its place, people must fear going to jail…To protect the institution of justice, and reinforce a culture of truth-telling, she had to be prosecuted.\" Comey served as the lead prosecutor who indicted Stewart on charges of obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI in 2003, which stemmed from the FBI's insider trading investigation into Stewart's friend's company, ImClone. Stewart ultimately was convicted on four counts of obstructing justice and lying to investigators. She was sentenced to five months in prison. Comey's statement in his book aligns with those he made at the time. After the charges were filed against Stewart in 2003, Comey said Stewart's \"case is about lying — lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC and investors.\" \"That is conduct that will not be tolerated. Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not because of who she is, but what she did,\" Comey said at a news conference in 2003. Stewart took a swipe at Comey in her Netflix documentary called \"Martha,\" which was released October 2024. \"It was so horrifying to me that I had to go through that to be a trophy for these idiots in the U.S. Attorney’s office,\" Stewart said. Fox News Digital reached out to Comey for comment and has yet to receive a reply. Trump–Comey vendetta back in the spotlight Meanwhile, Comey's feud with President Donald Trump is also back in the spotlight following Comey's indictment. The two men have gone head-to-head against each other for years, dating back to Trump’s first administration amid the FBI’s investigation into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and they have continued to trade barbs during Trump’s second term. While Trump has lobbed out terms like \"sick person\" and \"untruthful slime ball,\" Comey also has hurled criticism against the president and said he's not fit for office. HOW JAMES COMEY'S INDICTMENT COULD GO SOUTH FOR THE DOJ For example, Comey described Trump as someone who \"lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it,\" and questioned whether Trump embodied U.S. values during an interview in April 2018 with ABC News ahead of the release of his book, \"A Higher Loyalty.\" \"I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president — I think he’s morally unfit to be president … that’s not a policy statement,\" Comey told ABC News. \"Again, I don’t care what your views are on guns, or immigration, or taxes. There is something more important than that, that should unite all of us, and that is our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country, the most important being truth. This president is not able to do that.\" That same month Comey attracted the ire of Trump, who accused Comey of being a \"terrible\" FBI director and that it was his \"great honor\" to fire Comey. \"James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH,\" Trump said in a social media post in April 2018. COMEY DENIES CHARGES, DECLARES 'I AM NOT AFRAID' \"He is a weak and untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI…It was my great honor to fire James Comey!\" Trump said. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, just after Comey revealed in March 2017 before the House Intelligence Committee that the FBI had launched a criminal investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. At the time, Trump said that he had ousted Comey due to his handling of an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Comey, who previously identified as a Republican, went on to endorse former President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. He also called for \"everyone who cares about the rule of law and America’s indispensable role in the world\" to get behind former Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee during the 2024 election when she went up against Trump. TRUMP SAYS COMEY 'PLACED A CLOUD OVER THE ENTIRE NATION' WITH CROSSFIRE HURRICANE, REACTS TO INDICTMENT \"Kamala Harris made me feel like it’s finally morning in America,\" Comey wrote in a post on X in August 2024. More recently, Comey and Trump sparred after the former FBI director posted a photo on Instagram in May depicting shells arranged on a beach to spell out \"86 47.\" The term \"86\" can mean getting rid of something or someone, and Trump is the 47th president. Following backlash from Trump allies who interpreted Comey’s post as a threat to remove Trump, Comey said that the thought hadn’t crossed his mind and he opposed \"violence of any kind.\" Still, Trump didn’t buy Comey’s explanation. \"He knew exactly what that meant,\" Trump told Fox News. \"A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination.\" Following Comey’s indictment, Trump said in a social media post Friday that Comey is \"one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to,\" and labeled the former FBI director a \"DIRTY COP.\" The charges against Comey are tied to his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020 regarding the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Meanwhile, Comey has denied the allegations leveled in the charges against him, and said that he is \"not afraid.\" \"My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way,\" Comey said in an Instagram video. \"We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.

Most of the projects being terminated were budgeted for states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election and have Democratic governors and senators.\n\nAri Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, said in a written statement that the office had not formally received any official federal notices of termination, but understood that two of its projects were on the list, “which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for president.”\n\n“This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution and create instability in our business community,” Rosenblum said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Aurora, accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the federal government to punish people who did not vote for him.\n\n“This spiteful and cruel decision will raise energy bills and mean the loss of good-paying jobs in Colorado,” Crow said in a statement. “We will not kiss the ring of a wannabe king. This blatant intimidation and act of retribution is illegal.”\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright, who is from Colorado and is the founder of Denver-based Liberty Energy, an oilfield services company, said in a news release that his department had been reviewing financial awards since he was appointed by Trump and was attempting to trim waste.\n\n“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” said Wright, who has opposed any efforts to combat climate change. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”\n\nThe Energy Department did not respond to The Denver Post’s request for an interview with Wright.\n\nThe cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nThe elimination of hundreds of grants is likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nOfficials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.\n\nThe cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.\n\n“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nThe DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.\n\nThe Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules that it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health.\n\nMany climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.\n\nVought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our Mile High Roundup email newsletter.","summary":"Most of the projects being terminated were budgeted for states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris last year.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/02/trump-clean-energy-cuts-colorado/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Housing_Cuts_Rural_America_13869.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 20:07:59","author":"Noelle Phillips,The Associated Press","authors":["Noelle Phillips","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":365639140,"title":"White House holds firm on shutdown, signals federal layoffs and funding cuts","text":"The White House is standing firm in its position that there will be no negotiations with Democrats while the government remains shut down.Republican leadership has said such discussions could take place only after the government reopens, but officials have not engaged in any substantive policy talks while the shutdown continues.In the meantime, the administration has taken steps that appear aimed at increasing pressure on Democrats.

No further details could be immediately learned about how Weiss would work with Cibrowski.\n\nInsiders said the hiring of Weiss casts doubts on speculation about the possible return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source saying their job candidacies were an “either/or” situation.\n\nSources told The Post that Weiss could be a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is regarded more as a production wizard than a journalist.\n\nOthers said they expect it will only be a matter of time before Weiss — who has emerged as a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media — zeroes in on Cibrowski’s job.\n\n“Bari is extremely ambitious. Tom had better watch out,” a source close to both parties said. \n\nAs previously reported, Paramount Skydance is expected to acquire The Free Press in a deal valued at around $150 million. Sources said the transaction is expected to include a mix of stock and cash and will include earn-out provisions to reach its full value.\n\nA source with knowledge said The Free Press will remain a standalone property operating separate from CBS News and owned by Paramount. It is unclear if the site will eventually be integrated into CBS News’ digital site.\n\nEither way, it appears clear that Weiss is likely to take a major role steering the editorial coverage of the network. It is unclear whether Weiss — who has a podcast, “Honestly with Bari Weiss” and a column in The Free Press — will take on an additional journalistic presence at CBS News.\n\nA Paramount Skydance spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOthers expect the new leadership structure to create a strain on the already “dug in” culture at CBS at programs like “60 Minutes,” which recently elevated longtime assistant Tanya Simon to executive producer.\n\n“It would be like dropping a grenade” in the newsroom, one former CBS News veteran told The Post last month, of Weiss’ addition to the network.\n\n“They are used to doing things their way,” another source said of CBS News and “60 Minutes” veteran staffers.\n\nNews of a potential partnership has sparked anger at the news division, which has been under fire over its alleged left-leaning bias.\n\nWeiss has been closing in on a deal with Ellison for roughly a year, sources told The Post, but his overtures grabbed the attention of the media when the two were spotted in July at the Allen & Co. summit, known as the “summer camp for billionaires,” in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nAs previously reported by The Post, Ellison first approached Weiss about taking a top role at “60 Minutes” as he looks to make major changes at the organization that will bring more conservative voices to the network.\n\nAs part of Ellison’s post-merger reset, Skydance Paramount recently named Kenneth R. Weinstein as CBS News ombudsman — a Federal Communications Commission condition aimed at addressing bias complaints.\n\nWeeks before the merger was approved by the FCC, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nThe network denied any wrongdoing, but it eventually settled the lawsuit with Ellison sweetening the deal by agreeing to throw in an additional $20 million in pro-MAGA advertising to get the deal done, Trump has said.\n\nAside from the Harris scandal, the network was forced to fend off calls of bias over its Israel coverage, which roiled the company’s then-controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\n\nLast October, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil was thrust into the spotlight after a tense interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who described Israel as a state built on “apartheid” and “ethnocracy.”\n\nDokoupil, who is Jewish and has two children living in Israel, slammed Coates for omitting historical context — to the shock of “CBS Mornings” staff, who later complained to network brass.\n\nAdrienne Roark, the president of the news division at the time, rebuked Dokoupil in an all-hands meeting on Oct. 7 — the two-year anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel — saying his work didn’t meet the standards of the network.\n\nMonths later, “60 Minutes” aired a controversial segment featuring State Department officials who quit over American support for Israel’s efforts to root out Hamas terrorists in Gaza — a piece the American Jewish Committee blasted as “shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information.”","summary":"Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she helps set the editorial direction at the third-place CBS News, a source close to the situation said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/02/media/paramount-skydance-to-name-bari-weiss-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/photo-noam-galai-getty-images-112651853.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 19:24:42","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":365633416,"title":"Gavin Newsom Loves AI Satire Now!","text":"It looks like California Gov. Gavin Newsom has learned to stop worrying and love fake, AI-generated political satire videos—or at least, he loves them enough to share one on X.\n\nNewsom has discovered a meme streak that is positively Trump-ian as of late, and now constantly publishes troll-ish posts on social media, with the aim of getting under the president's skin and also calling attention to himself; he seems to be succeeding on this second goal, and is currently arguably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.\n\nHere was his latest contribution: a heavily manipulated video of Vice President J.D. Vance discussing the government shutdown. (Note the squeaky voice and cartoonish wardrobe embellishments.)\n\nPSA from JD. pic.twitter.com/fhnuX7leOL\n— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 1, 2025\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this, of course. Newsom is free to use his own speech to belittle Trump, Vance, or anyone else. The irony, however, is that Newsom adamantly tried to prevent other people from doing something incredibly similar.\n\nIndeed, Newsom is a major advocate of legislation to criminalize so-called deep fakes: convincing misrepresentations of other people on social media. In the midst of Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign, Elon Musk retweeted a fake, AI-engineered video of Harris appearing to admit to being a DEI pick; the video used AI to accurately mimic her voice. Newsom wrote on X that this should be illegal, and shared that he would soon be banning the practice in California. Sure enough, the governor signed the deep fake bill into law a few weeks later.\n\nUnfortunately for Newsom, the First Amendment broadly protects political satire, even if the underlying speech is wrong or misleading. And so a federal judge struck down the law—just in time for Election Day—noting that it \"hinders humorous expression and unconstitutionally stifles the free and unfettered exchange of ideas.\"\n\nNow that the governor is enjoying channeling his inner troll, perhaps he has gained more appreciation for this right. One can perhaps argue that the optics of the Vance video make it much more obviously fake than the sound from the Harris video, but this is a difference of distinctions. It's key that the widest possible latitude be given to speech that makes fun of politicians, as there is no kind of expression more obviously protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI'm joined by Amber Duke and Niall Stanage to process the news of the week.

At the center of the fight is whether the package should include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Democrats argue are vital to protecting health care coverage, while Republicans contend that the issue should be handled separately.\n\nGOP leaders have tried to frame the dispute as Democrats pushing for health care for undocumented immigrants, a claim that has been debunked. Democrats, however, counter that their goal is to ensure that lawful residents and U.S. citizens are covered.\n\nEven though Republicans control every level of government, Trump has been eager to pin the crisis on Democrats—and now seems ready to use the shutdown as cover for mass layoffs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed each day of the shutdown. But OMB has gone a step further, circulating a memo asking agencies to prepare full-blown reduction-in-force plans.\n\nRelated | It’s simple: Republicans have the votes to end their shutdown\n\nAhead of Trump’s meeting with Vought on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that layoffs will likely be “in the thousands.”\n\nUnions representing federal employees have already filed suit, calling the administration’s threats “contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.” Democrats, too, say the firings would be illegal.\n\nStill, Vought told House Republicans Wednesday that mass cuts could begin “in a day or two.” And Trump has been openly gleeful about it.\n\n“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” he wrote. “Maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is trying to spin layoffs as a necessity.\n\n“If [Democrats are] so worried about the effect this is having on the American people—and they should be—what they should do is reopen the government, not complain about how we respond,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday\n\nTrump, of course, doesn’t have the power to eliminate agencies created by Congress, but there are other levers. Vought has already announced $8 billion in energy cuts across 16 states—all of which voted for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024—and is now threatening to pull infrastructure funding for New York City.\n\nWhat’s striking about Trump’s post is how he’s suddenly leaning into Vought’s ties to Project 2025. He spent months pretending to keep his distance from the Heritage Foundation blueprint, which Democrats made a centerpiece of their 2024 campaign. Now he’s bragging about having one of its architects by his side.\n\nProject 2025 was written as a 900-page playbook to overhaul the federal government, expand presidential authority, and embed right-wing control across federal agencies. Vought helped write it, and now he’s deciding which “Democrat Agencies” to target as the shutdown drags on.\n\nVought pushes what he calls “radical constitutionalism,” a brand of Christian nationalism that tosses aside the usual checks on presidential power. In practice, it treats Congress as essentially irrelevant and casts the president as something closer to a monarch than a constitutional leader.\n\nIn other words, Trump is turning a shutdown of his own making into a test run for Project 2025—and pushing to see just how far he can bend the system before it breaks.","summary":"President Donald Trump has found a new way to weaponize the government shutdown.

Instead, the administration seems to prefer dinging members of the opposing political tribe rather than effecting any sort of across-the-board changes.\n\n\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" OMB Director Russell Vought wrote Wednesday in a post on X. While there is not yet an official announcement, he added that there would be \"more info to come\" from the Department of Energy. Vought said the newly rescinded funds would come from terminating projects in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nIf it feels like those 16 states have something in common, it's true: All voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent, in the 2024 election. In fact, other than Maine, Rhode Island, and Virginia, Vought's list includes every single state that didn't go for Trump.\n\nTrump would be justified in wanting to rescind all such grants. Instead, he's apparently content to let states who voted for him keep the cash. This naked partisanship is unseemly, but unfortunately par for the course under Trump. It's also particularly ironic, since red states were much bigger beneficiaries of Biden-era grants.\n\n\"The Biden administration has announced hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure projects since the passage of several landmark government funding bills,\" CNBC's Rebecca Picciotto wrote in May 2024. \"Several of the biggest awards went to battleground states that will be pivotal to the 2024 presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan.\" (Biden exited the race in July 2024.)\n\nPicciotto noted that the 10 largest recipients of Biden-era funding were California, Texas, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Arizona, Maryland, Ohio, and Michigan. Vought targeted only four of those 10 for rescission, leaving tens of billions of \"Green New Scam\" dollars in red states.\n\n\"Growth from post-IRA projects…is particularly pronounced in Republican-led districts and states in the South,\" according to an August 2024 report from E2, a nonpartisan group that advocates for clean energy. \"Nearly 60 percent of the announced projects—representing 85 percent of the investments and 68 percent of the jobs—are in Republican congressional districts.\"\n\n\"Five states are home to 20 or more projects: Michigan, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and North Carolina,\" the report noted. \"Six others are home to at least 10: Ohio, Tennessee, California, New York, Indiana and Arizona.\" Of those 11 states, only California and New York went for Harris—and only those two will see cuts under Vought's proposal.\n\nStudies often find that Republican states receive more government assistance than states that vote Democrat. \"Using non-adjusted and population-weighted numbers, the federal government provides 8 percent more in benefits to red states than to blue states,\" according to a May 2025 article from the Milken Institute Review. \"But taking [cost-of-living adjustments] into consideration, this gap widens significantly: red states receive 23 percent more from the federal government than blue states.\"\n\nThese programs can also take a more sinister form, where lawmakers dole out federal grants for states based on favoritism. \"My own research on the way stimulus spending was allocated showed that the party affiliation of a congressional district's representative was a factor,\" George Mason University economist Veronique de Rugy wrote in 2013, about the 2009 federal stimulus bill. \"Districts represented by Democrats got more money than districts represented by Republicans, even controlling for variables such as state capital, income, and unemployment.\"\n\nAs CNBC's Picciotto noted last year, after the states with the largest economies—California, Texas, New York—billions of federal dollars went to swing states that Biden would need if he hoped to win reelection.

But some budget experts have argued that spending money to conduct permanent layoffs during a shutdown is illegal.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump’s move, saying that the president has the power to fire workers and cut spending during a shutdown. He pinned blame for the lapse in appropriations on Democrats. \n\n“If they keep the government closed it will get more and more painful,” Johnson told reporters. The White House, he added, is “going to look to the administration’s priorities and make sure they are funded.” \n\nVought has begun withholding spending for New York City transit projects and clean energy programs in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nIt’s not yet clear what the scale of the federal downsizing could be, but Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, predicted there could be sizable cuts.\n\n“Do I think Russ Vought wants to shrink government in a dramatic way? Absolutely. He’s pretty clear about that,” Capito told CNBC Thursday.\n\nThe White House’s moves to pull back funding and dismiss federal workers aims to put pressure on Democrats to vote to re-open the government. The hardball tactics go well beyond what is common in a shutdown, where typically many federal workers are furloughed and then receive back pay once the government is funded.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 750,000 employees will be furloughed during the shutdown at a cost of $400 million per day in lost compensation.\n\nPolitical Posturing\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Democrats of negotiating in bad faith over government funding.\n\n“The Democrats want to negotiate like terrorists,” Bessent told CNBC Thursday, adding that Republicans are seeking a “clean” extension of government funding. Democrats are seeking to include health care subsidies in that spending bill.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CBS that Democrats have been “begging” Republicans to negotiate but so far there have been “zero” talks because the GOP hasn’t engaged.\n\nA Washington Post poll found that more voters blame Trump and Republicans for the government shutdown than they do Democrats — by a 17-point margin.

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nRepublican lawmakers proposed a clean continuing resolution that, if passed, would have allowed the government to remain open by extending funding past the start of fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1. This CR would have acted as a temporary stopgap through November 21, allowing lawmakers time to negotiate a new full-year budget.\n\nHowever, Democrats, who have refused to support the bill, blocked the bill by triggering a filibuster. Democrat lawmakers refused to budge unless Republicans allowed an extension for Affordable Care Act tax credits. It is important to note that these tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, after the Republicans' CR would already have dropped off.\n\nRepublicans refused to accept Democrats' request, arguing that the health care programs use federal tax dollars to provide services to illegal aliens. Additionally, they contended that specific programs could be negotiated in the full-year budget.\n\nTo override the Democrats' filibuster, Republicans filed for cloture, which, if passed, would have forced a vote on the CR.\n\nWith a slim Senate majority, Republicans theoretically have enough members to pass a CR in a straightforward vote. However, they do not have the supermajority, 60 votes, needed to invoke cloture and end debate.\n\nRELATED: Democrats deny shutdown is about health care for illegal aliens — then one admits the truth\n\n Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans' attempt to invoke cloture fell short by five votes, causing the CR to die by the October 1 deadline, thus triggering a shutdown.\n\nRepublicans have referred to the gridlock as New York Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's shutdown.\n\n\"Chuck Schumer has led them all to vote against it,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) stated. \n\n\"I sent them in good faith exactly what they had voted for before.

Democrats join call to oust president after military threats to US cities","text":"Donald Trump’s administration is facing another round of calls to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office in the wake of his remarks to an unprecedented assembly of the nation’s military leaders.\n\nTrump’s Cabinet and then-Vice President Mike Pence faced similar demands in the aftermath of the January 6 attack, when a mob of the president’s supporters stormed the halls of Congress to derail the certification of an election he lost.\n\nAnd it’s not the first time Trump has faced calls to step down since he returned to the White House in January. Liberal commentators and critics on social media routinely demand his Cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that Trump’s allies and a Republican-dominated Congress would vote to oust him. The president has the ironclad allegiance of his Cabinet and Vice President JD Vance, who would effectively have to agree with their political opponents that the president can no longer serve.\n\nBut prominent Democrats claim the president is unfit for office, that his cognitive health is in decline, and that a speech to military leaders this week all but endorsed the idea of active-duty troops fighting civilians in U.S. cities.\n\nAfter Trump suggested cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds for our military,” Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said the 25th Amendment should be invoked to oust the president, marking the first time that the governor has publicly called for his removal.\n\n“It appears that Donald Trump not only has dementia set in, but he’s copying tactics of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,” Pritzker said Wednesday.\n\nTrump is set to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, among several Democratic-led cities where he is surging federal law enforcement and military assets.\n\n“Sending troops into cities, thinking that that’s some sort of proving ground for war, or that indeed there’s some sort of internal war going on in the United States is just, frankly, insane and I’m concerned for his health,” Pritzker said.\n\n“There is something genuinely wrong with this man, and the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked,” he added.\n\nThat call was publicly supported by at least one Democratic member of Congress: California Rep. Eric Swalwell wrote “25TH AMENDMENT!” on social media as Trump spoke to military officials.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Independent that “Pritzker is a slob of a governor” and that “it appears he’s particularly hangry today based on his unhinged ramblings.”\n\n“The only reason anyone has even heard of him is because he’s failed his constituents so spectacularly that the raging crime crisis and dangerous sanctuary city status of Chicago is national news,” she said. “President Trump is deeply concerned with the safety and security of all Americans, including those in Chicago — and he’s stepping in where J.B. failed. J.B., here’s a tip: eat a snickers; you’re not you when you’re hungry (which is all the time).”\n\nMilitary veterans and former defense officials speaking to The Independent and other outlets were furious with the president’s remarks to the nation’s top military brass in Quantico. \n\nThe event was an “expensive, dangerous dereliction of leadership by the Trump administration,” according to a statement from Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Forces Committee.\n\nThe president’s remarks amounted to “authoritarian and un-American” rhetoric, Air Force veteran Gretchen Klingler, director of Veterans for American Ideas at Human Rights First, told The Independent.\n\nTrump was “incoherent, exhausted and… at times stupid,” according to Ret. Army General Barry McCaffrey, who called the president’s address “one of the most bizarre, unsettling events I’ve ever encountered.”\n\nOne U.S. defense official mentioned invoking the 25th Amendment in an interview with The Intercept. “This is truly disturbing. He is clearly unwell, even for Trump,” the official said.\n\nCongressional Democrats publicly urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump after failing to stop hundreds of his supporters from breaking into the Capitol in a violent attempt to halt the certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHouse lawmakers voted 223-205 on January 12, 2021 to adopt a resolution that would compel Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment. Pence rejected the effort in a letter to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump was later impeached by the House for inciting an insurrection.\n\nRepublican officials and Trump allies also routinely called on former President Joe Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment against him, including most notably after his decision to end his re-election campaign last year.\n\nTrump himself had baselessly claimed that Democratic leaders told Biden to end his campaign or be removed from office. During the campaign, Vance also called on Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him.\n\n“You don’t get to do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats,” he said on Fox News at the time. “If it’s an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.”\n\nGOP lawmakers also called on officials to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden after a report from special counsel Robert Hur suggested that then-president Biden’s mental fitness was “significantly limited.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment, however, has been invoked as a practical matter several times to temporarily transfer power from a president to the vice president during medical procedures.\n\nRonald Reagan briefly transferred power to then-Vice President George Bush when Reagan underwent colon cancer surgery in 1985. George W. Bush similarly transferred authority to his Vice President Dick Cheney, twice, in 2002 and 2007, during his colonoscopies. Biden also transferred authority to Kamala Harris for a colonoscopy in 2021.\n\nPrior to the ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1965, the rules of succession were constitutionally vague and did not spell out how, exactly, the vice president would become acting president if the president were to die, resign or be removed from office.\n\nFirst, the amendment explicitly makes clear that the vice president becomes president “in case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation.”\n\nBut removing the president would require the vice president and a majority of the 16-member presidential cabinet to jointly agree that “the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nAnother option would require the creation of a disability review panel that would need approval by Congress and signed into law by the president, or, if vetoed, the support of at least two-thirds of the House and Senate.\n\nOnce the vice president and either the cabinet or a disability review panel agree that the president must be removed, the vice president would then immediately be able to “assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.”\n\nThe president can tell Congress that “no inability exists” and will “resume the powers and duties of his office,” which the Cabinet or disability panel can then challenge.\n\nCongress then has 21 days to settle whether the president is fit to serve. A two-thirds vote from both chambers of Congress must agree to let the vice president step in.","summary":"It’s not the first time Trump has faced calls to step down since he returned to the White House in January","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-25th-amendment-military-threats-health-dementia-b2838126.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/02/15/12/-BESTPIX-President-Trump-And-Pete-Hegseth-Address-U-S--Senior-Military-Leaders-At-Quantico-2bvh3933.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/E4hikLQM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-02 17:09:21","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":365601864,"title":"Gavin Newsom signs bill that reverses Kamala Harris’s anti-truancy law","text":"Harris pitched the bill in 2010 as a form of crime prevention. At the time, her office worked with the San Francisco Unified School District to target parents of truant children, sending them letters and having them meet with prosecutors. A “chronic truant” was defined as a child absent from class for 10% or more of the school year.\n\nHarris claimed that putting pressure on the parents would “allow local jurisdictions to establish and strengthen efforts like these to hold parents accountable and get elementary school children back in school.”\n\n“My bottom line is these children have to be in school,” she said. “There will be outrage when, in 10 years, they’re a menace to society hanging out on the corner.”\n\nHer words came back to haunt her as her political aspirations rose.\n\nCoverage of police handcuffing mothers of truant schoolchildren sparked backlash and led to Harris eventually walking back her support.\n\n“I regret that that has happened,” she said in 2019. “The thought that anything I did could have led to that … because that certainly was not the intention.”\n\nDemocratic Assemblyman Patrick Ahrens sponsored the legislation to reverse the law but stated his motivation came from personal childhood experience and that the repeal had “nothing to do with our former VP.”\n\n“Thank you Governor Newsom for signing my bill to repeal this failed policy of criminalizing struggling California families for their children missing school,” Ahrens wrote in a statement. “Families and kids need support, not criminal charges and fines, to improve school attendance. Fining or imprisoning parents did nothing to get kids the education and support they need.”\n\nRebecca Gonzales, a policy advocate with the Western Center on Law & Poverty, also commended the law’s reversal.\n\n“This outdated and ineffective strategy criminalizes families rather than offering support,” she said. “This bill will assist families who may be facing challenges such as fear of deportation, poverty, and mental health challenges.”\n\nNewsom did not make any additional comments when he signed the bill reversing Harris’s legislation.\n\nThe moment comes at a crossroads for the pair, who have seen their relationship fray over the years. In Harris’s new book, 107 Days, she claimed that Newsom did not return her phone call to request his endorsement after then-President Joe Biden bowed out of the 2024 race. Newsom told her that he was hiking and would call back. She noted in her book that he did not.\n\nNewsom brushed off her jab, telling reporters that he had not read the book and described a chaotic scene in the hours after Biden’s announcement, explaining that after missing Harris’s call, he was busy scrambling for more information about Biden’s decision.\n\nCLINTON AND HARRIS SLAM TRUMP AND GOP OVER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nNewsom and Harris came up through local politics together. \n\nThey are both considered contenders for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.","summary":"Gov.

By contrast, 34% say they have no trust at all, and another 36% say they have “not very much” confidence.\n\nConfidence in the media breaks sharply along party lines. Republican trust in the media has fallen to 8%, the first time it has dropped into single digits. Among Democrats, 51% say they have a great or fair amount of trust in the media, while only 9% say they have no trust. Independents are more divided, with 27% expressing trust and 32% reporting none at all.\n\nTrust in the media also shows a clear generational divide that has widened over the past decade, according to three-year aggregated data. From 2023 to 2025, 43% of adults 65 and older said they trust the media, compared with no more than 28% in any younger age group, Gallup found.\n\nAmericans’ overall confidence in the media has been declining steadily since Gallup first began tracking it in 1972.

Trump and Republicans faced criticism over the plan, but Trump dismissed having connections to it, calling parts of it “ridiculous and abysmal.”\n\nTrump wrote on Thursday that he and Vought, who founded The Center for Renewing America (CRA), will discuss cuts to federal agencies. The meeting comes after the administration sent out a memo last week warning that federal workers could be fired amid the government shutdown standoff with Democrats.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have both sought to cast blame on each other for the shutdown. Democrats have accused Republicans of not willing to make any concessions to earn their support, particularly around the extension of health care tax credits set to expire and a rollback of recent Medicaid cuts. But Republicans have said Senate Democrats are to blame for not agreeing to the bill passed by the House.\n\n What To Know\n\nTrump announced the meeting in a Truth Social post in which he noted Vought’s association with Project 2025.\n\n“I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent. I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DJT,” he wrote.\n\nMany of his critics were quick to note that he previously distanced himself from the project.\n\n“Oh, so NOW we’re talking about Project 2025!” journalist Yashar Ali wrote on X.\n\nJessica Tarlov, co-host of The Five on Fox News, wrote, “Remember the good ole days where Trump told us he didn’t know what Project 2025 was?”\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to President Barack Obama’s White House, wrote, “I have this vague memory of everyone in the Republican Party from Trump on down claiming that Project 2025 was a ‘Democratic Hoax.’”\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to senior military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, on September 30.\n\nWhat Has Donald Trump Said About Project 2025?\n\nThe president wrote in a July 2024 post to Truth Social that he knew “nothing about Project 2025.”\n\n“I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and, unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it,” he wrote, describing attempts to tie him to the proposal as “pure disinformation.”\n\nHe wrote in another post, “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.”\n\nHowever, in December 2024, after his presidential election victory against former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump told Time magazine he doesn’t “disagree with everything in Project 2025, but I disagree with some things.”\n\n“I specifically didn’t want to read it because it wasn’t under my auspices, and I wanted to be able to say that, you know, the only way I can say I have nothing to do with it is if you don’t read it. I don’t want—I didn’t want to read it. I read enough about it. They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don’t like,” he said.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nProgressive commentator Mehdi Hasan wrote to X: “The journalists who produced ‘factchecks’ during 2024 suggesting Trump had nothing to do with Project 2025, or took him at his word (!) that he knew nothing about it, should hang their heads in shame.”\n\nRepresentative Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat, wrote to X: “This is illegal, and yes is the same guy who claimed he’d never heard of Project 2025. But there’s a larger point to make here about public service. No one who wins elected office wins 100% of the vote. But everyone who holds public office represents 100% of their electorate.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom’s press office wrote to X: “Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025. But 9 months in, he has already put 48% into action.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems.\n\nOther states affected include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nThe states with canceled projects were confirmed in a tweet from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Donald Trump. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” \n\nAll 16 states voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level.\n\nThe awards were originally granted by the office for Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Grid Deployment, and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.\n\nThe Department of Energy said 26% of the awards were granted between Election Day and Inauguration Day in January; the president’s authority doesn’t end after Election Day, but runs until Inauguration Day. \n\nThe awardees have 30 days to appeal the decision.\n\nThe Trump administration has made no secret that it wants to undermine any transition away from fossil fuels. Last week, the Department of Energy banned staffers from using certain words, including “climate change” and “emissions.”\n\nIn May, the agency canceled $3.7 billion worth of clean energy and manufacturing awards. Those cancelations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.\n\nThe Trump administration’s aggressive cancelations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was quick to cancel contracts worth $20 billion, has been an early target of legal action. So far, the plaintiffs have had mixed success.\n\nWhile a federal district court said the EPA’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” an appellate court ruled in favor of the agency, saying that the contract cancelations were valid and showed the government exercising “proper oversight and management.”\n\nIn the instance of the recent DOE cancelations, several award recipients have already appealed the decision, the agency confirmed.","summary":"The Trump administration canceled over 300 awards related to clean energy on October 1.

By contrast, 34% say they have no trust at all, and another 36% say they have “not very much” confidence.\n\nConfidence in the media breaks sharply along party lines. Republican trust in the media has fallen to 8%, the first time it has dropped into single digits. Among Democrats, the numbers are down to 51% who have a great or fair amount of trust in the media. Only 9% say they have no trust. The Independents are more evenly divided, with 27% expressing trust and 32% reporting none at all. (RELATED: Corporate Media Still Too Scared Of Pronoun Mafia To Admit Only Women Get Pregnant)\n\nTrust in the media also shows a clear generational divide that has widened over the past decade, according to three-year aggregated data. From 2023 to 2025, 43% of adults 65 and older said they trust the media, compared with no more than 28% in any younger age group, Gallup found.\n\nAmericans’ overall confidence in the media has been declining steadily since Gallup first began tracking it in 1972. At the time, 68% said they had a great deal of trust, while just 6% said they had no faith in the institution at all.\n\nDespite the growing trend of left-wing extremist violence, between Jan. 21 and June 21, news outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS used labels such as “far right” 1,222 times compared with just 86 mentions of “far left” or similar labels, according to the Media Research Center.\n\nMoreover, corporate media outlets largely ignored the stabbing death of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina, for several days, despite news of the brutal incident going viral on social media, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found in September.

Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand. To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said. It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown — which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 — cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been — an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012. Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens. Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion — at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\" The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees. 2025 shutdownBut this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force — or RIF — cuts would begin in two days. The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats. \"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"","summary":"A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-costs-economy-taxpayers/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/02/77baa75c-074b-46c9-9c2a-5334522d57b3/thumbnail/1200x630/c9e91ebb01fc9d25e5b2a0e123c81af7/gettyimages-2238243986.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 15:05:47","author":"Kathryn Watson","authors":["Kathryn Watson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":365577584,"title":"Speculation swirls as AOC is rumored to harbor 2028 aspirations: 'Savvy politician'","text":"Rumors have swirled about \"Squad\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's political future since she joined Sen. Bernie Sanders' high-profile \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour earlier this year. The youngest woman ever elected to Congress has become a leading progressive voice in the Democratic Party, amassing millions of social media followers and sparking speculation about a potential U.S. Senate run or White House bid in 2028. Her rise to the national stage comes as Democrats look for fresh leadership after losing up and down the ballot last year. Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff and campaign manager are both alumni of the Sanders campaign. Mike Casca, her chief of staff, was formerly Sanders' deputy chief of staff and a fixture of Sanders' political operation, both on the presidential campaign trail and back on Capitol Hill. Her campaign manager, Oliver Hidalgo-Wohlleben, has worked in politics for over a decade. Prior to joining Ocasio-Cortez's team in 2023, Hidalgo-Wohlleben was the political director of Sanders' super PAC, Friends of Bernie Sanders, according to his LinkedIn. AOC STARS IN NEWSOM REDISTRICTING AD, URGING CALIFORNIANS TO 'FIGHT' TRUMP FOR DEMOCRACY Hidalgo-Wohlleben also worked on Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign before joining former President Joe Biden's campaign in Iowa, Hidalgo-Wohlleben's LinkedIn profile revealed. AOC ALLEGEDLY EYEING 2028 RUN AS DNC VICE CHAIR RALLIES PARTY NEEDS MAMDANI TO OCASIO-CORTEZ AS LEADERS \"AOC is a pretty savvy politician with a strong operation,\" Democratic strategist Mike Nellis told Fox News Digital. \"No matter what she decides to do, they're setting her up for the future.\" A Sanders alumnus himself, Nellis cautioned against placing too much weight on what it means for former Sanders staffers to lead Ocasio-Cortez's campaign. \"I think that’s just who she knows and who she trusts,\" Nellis, a former adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris, said, adding that Ocasio-Cortez has a \"really good team around her.\" \"It's strategic in the sense that they have a lot of relationships already,\" Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff said, while emphasizing that it can be a \"mistake to keep the old guard\" when you are trying to build something new. \"I don't know that somebody is going to inherit the legacy of Bernie Sanders,\" Shroff added. Axios recently reported that, according to people familiar with Ocasio-Cortez's political operation, her team is positioning her to run for president or the U.S. Senate in 2028. Schumer is up for re-election in 2028. By then, he will have served 47 years in Congress. \"AOC doesn't need the Senate,\" Republican strategist Matt Gorman told Fox News Digital. \"The Senate, at this point, is too small for her. I would expect her to run for president 2028.\" Whether she chooses to run for president or the Senate, Nellis said Ocasio-Cortez has the potential to attract voters who don't typically engage in the political process, much like the coalition President Donald Trump has built. \"When you are an unconventional candidate outside the mainstream, outside the establishment, you can get a lot of people who will tune in and engage that maybe otherwise wouldn't because you're giving voice to them in a meaningful way,\" Nellis said. But Shroff said that Ocasio-Cortez isn't ready for a presidential campaign. \"She absolutely should not run for president,\" Shroff said. \"It would be way too soon. I don't think she's really achieved enough to justify that.\" \"For the Senate, I see that as more realistic, especially in a state like New York, that's obviously more liberal,\" Shroff added, arguing that \"some very loyal base Democrats have lost their patience\" with Schumer, so his vulnerability could boost Ocasio-Cortez's chances of securing the Senate seat. Shroff said Ocasio-Cortez's \"media profile and personality and charisma\" aren't enough to win the presidency, especially when running against figures like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, long considered to harbor presidential aspirations. The New Yorker sparked more campaign buzz this month for participating in an advertisement directly challenging Trump and advocating in favor of California redistricting. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have both endorsed and campaigned this year for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic socialist. If Mamdani wins the mayoral election in November, Shroff said it could be a litmus test for the modern progressive branch of the Democratic Party. \"It will be challenging for him because I don't think he can do a lot of the things that he said, and so how soon will that leftist ideology be debunked on a national level? The sooner that happens, the worse it is for AOC,\" Shroff said. In April, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign account posted a video on X that drove rumors she could be mulling a presidential run as the four-term Democrat from New York City and the progressive leader proclaimed, \"We are one.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked later that month if she was harboring any presidential ambitions, the young Democrat did not rule out 2028 presidential aspirations to Fox News Digital. \"Bernie and AOC, one thing they understand is that Democrats need to be more than just anti-Trump,\" Gorman said, before adding, \"I certainly disagree with Bernie and AOC's strategy of how to lead the party and where to take America, but at least they have one. That's more than just, ‘I hate Trump.'\" The Republican strategist said the Democratic Party's \"establishment is not going to be able to stop a united, far-left wing of the party this time,\" Gorman said. Ocasio-Cortez's and Schumer's campaigns did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&apos;s political operation is staffed by Sen.

The book, released Sept. 23, set the stage back when Harris had just 94 days to go before Americans cast their ballots. She called on former President Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for advice on how to choose a running mate. \"Very few people have ever made this decision.

We were as different as daylight and dark and it worked.\" \"'You have to level with them and watch how they answer,'\" she wrote of Bill Clinton's advice on how to vet potential running mates.

The selection of Walz over other liked or well-known Democrats, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, was viewed as a campaign misstep that contributed to the party's loss to President Donald Trump. Walz was slammed over claims of \"stolen valor,\" and his previous strict rules for his state during the pandemic, as well as a debate performance against then-Sen.

We all hope to have support from those who come before. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. And certainly that's true of politics. Hillary Clinton is one of those people that believes in lifting people up and supporting people,\" Harris said from the stage of The Town Hall, a theater venue in Midtown Manhattan, where she kicked off her book tour Sept. 24. \"And she follows through,\" Harris added.

ICE out of Lancaster.”\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nIn the 2024 presidential race, President Donald Trump secured a win over then Vice President Kamala Harris in Lancaster County, around 60 miles west of Philadelphia, earning 57.2 percent of the vote (166,261 ballots) compared to Harris’ 41.3 percent (120,119 ballots).\n\nICE is facing increased scrutiny as Trump’s administration enacts plans to deport millions of immigrants who do not have legal status. The agency’s expanded authority to carry out raids, including operations conducted in plain clothes and with face coverings, has prompted criticism from immigrant rights organizations, legal experts, and local communities, who question the legality, ethics, and human impact of these actions. \n\nPositioned near the Amtrak station along Prince Street, the signs read, “Without due process, it’s just kidnapping. ICE out of Lancaster.” (Facebook)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe billboards, sponsored by the nonprofit Lancaster Stands Up and local activist Alison Moon, are intended to raise public awareness about immigration issues in the area.\n\nMoon, who has been funding similar billboards for months, told WHP-TV that “the goal is to spread awareness and make sure that everyone knows this is happening and it’s real and it’s a problem.”\n\nShe told the outlet that there has been a significant response since the latest installations, which cost around $1,100 each. Moon initially distributed stickers, but opted for billboards to get her point across to residents.\n\n“This has worked. None of my stickers got 55,000 views on threads overnight, but this did,” she said.\n\nAs the debate continues, Lancaster County finds itself at the center of a national conversation on immigration enforcement.\n\nScott Mechkowski, a retired ICE agent who worked for the agency from the mid-1990s until 2019, told Newsweek that Moon “possesses the unequivocal right to allocate personal funds toward billboards conveying her perspectives, but it does not inherently substantiate the claim.”\n\n“The billboard’s inflammatory equation of ICE enforcement with ‘kidnapping’ is a dangerous falsehood that erodes institutional trust and sows division,” Mechkowski told Newsweek in a statement.\n\nDHS has said that ICE agents are facing a 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nRetired ICE agent Mechkowski told Newsweek in a statement: “ICE has never kidnapped anyone; it adheres to legal frameworks ensuring due process in detentions. This narrative originated from a hoax, where a woman staged a fake abduction to solicit donations, resulting in federal charges for conspiracy and false statements, a fabrication exploited for its shock value, regardless of truth, which turned out to be a scam, but generated millions of clicks. It’s obvious Ms. Moon knows nothing about immigration law, nor law itself.”\n\nLancaster Stands Up wrote on a post on Facebook: “If you’re heading out of the city down Prince Street, you may have seen our new billboard collab with Alison Moon! We’ll all be safer when ICE is off our streets.”\n\nPennsylvania Representative Lloyd Smucker, a Republican, said: “The bottom line is we are a country. We are a country with a role [sic] of law, and there are laws in place about our immigration system and how to come here legally. ICE is doing its job, and so I think we should continue to support ICE as we have,” CBS 21 reported.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe billboards are expected to remain in place for about a month.","summary":"The billboards read, &quot;Without due process, it&#039;s just kidnapping.

No songs in English should not be allowed at one of America’s highest rated television events of the year… not just for sports,” Patrick, 43, replied. \n\nPage Six has reached out to Bad Bunny’s rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n\nOn Sunday, Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, announced he would be the headliner for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, which is slated for Feb. 8, 2026, at the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nThe “Tití Me Preguntó” singer, 31, shared the news with a video of him sitting on top of a goal post in a football end zone. He captioned the social media post: “Super Bowl LX. Bay Area. February 2026. #AppleMusicHalftime.”\n\nIn a press conference obtained by Page Six, Bad Bunny said, “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.”\n\nIn Spanish, the hitmaker added: “Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL,” which translates to, “Go and tell your grandmother, that we will be the halftime show of the Super Bowl.”\n\nBad Bunny has frequently criticized the Trump administration and the cruelty of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nLeading up to the 2024 presidential election, Bad Bunny endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, the three-time Grammy winner released a music video for his song “NUEVAYoL,” which featured an artificial Trump voice apologizing for his stance on immigration.\n\nSeveral far-right commentators slammed Bad Bunny being chosen for the show, including Jack Posobiec, who took to X to blame “Barack Obama’s best friend Jay-Z” for the artist selection. (Jay-Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation, produces the Super Bowl halftime show.)\n\nHowever, Bad Bunny was supported by several stars, including the ladies of “The View.”\n\n“A lot of the MAGA folks apparently are very upset with the NFL. But they’re upset all the time,” Whoopi Goldberg said on the talk show Monday. \n\n“Another great American performer is going to be performing. I don’t see the problem. Because y’all do remember Puerto Rico is part of the United States,” the “Sister Act” actress, 69, added.\n\nJennifer Lopez, who brought out Bad Bunny as a guest during her Super Bowl 2020 halftime performance, tweeted, “Now it’s your turn !!!!! bori gang lets gooooo.”","summary":"The ex-racer responded to a tweet that claimed the Puerto Rican rapper was \"massive [President Donald] Trump hater, and \"anti-ICE activist\" and had \"no songs in English.\"","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/10/02/celebrity-news/danica-patrick-insists-bad-bunny-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-headline-super-bowl-2026-halftime-show/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/112635687.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/g9kntnzR-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-02 12:35:43","author":"mliss1578,Tamantha Ryan","authors":["mliss1578","Tamantha Ryan"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.32},{"id":365497326,"title":"How Trump wants to reshape the federal government during the shutdown and more top headlines","text":"Good morning and welcome to Fox News' morning newsletter, Fox News First.

In fact, SNL’s 82 percent matched the figure for the combined totals of ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, CBS’s Stephen Colbert, NBC’s own Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, and Comedy Central’s The Daily Show in 2024. \n\nIn Season 50, Jost and Che combined to tell 249 political jokes, 203 of which were about right-leaning people, groups, or things. That left 45 against left-leaners and one for non-partisans.\n\nIn the five episodes before the election, Jost and Che told 3.4 liberal jokes per episode. After the election, they told 1.8. By contrast, they told 9.6 conservative jokes per show both before and after the election.\n\nJost and Che’s top ten included seven right-leaners and three left-leaners. They were Donald Trump (96), Joe Biden (18), Elon Musk (16), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (15), JD Vance (13), Matt Gaetz (7), Pete Hegseth (6), Kash Patel, Kamala Harris, and Democrats (5 each).\n\nThe cold open is the skit before the opening credits and is probably what most people think of when they think of Saturday Night Live. In Season 50, conservative or Republican characters appeared 43 times, while liberal or Democratic figures appeared 29 times, or 60 percent to 40 percent. In terms of unique characters, it was split 15-15.\n\nHowever, the relative closeness of the numbers can be deceiving. In the five pre-election episodes, Democrat characters appeared 21 times, or 4.2 Democrat parodies per episode. In the 16 post-election shows, Democrats appeared eight times, or 0.5 per episode, and five of those came on the last pre-inauguration episode satirizing MSNBC.\n\nIn the five pre-election shows, Republican characters actually appeared less often, at 2.4 instances per episode, or 12 total. After the election, the number dropped to 1.9 Republican characters per episode, or 31 total.\n\nThe top ten recurring characters featured 5 left-leaners. They were James Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump (15), Dana Carvey’s Joe Biden and Bowen Yang’s JD Vance (6 each), Marcello Hernandez’s Marco Rubio and Maya Rudolph’s Kamala Harris (5 each), Jim Gaffigan’s Tim Walz and Andy Samberg’s Doug Emhoff (4 each), Dana Carvey/Mike Myers's Elon Musk (3), Colin Jost’s Pete Hegseth, Sarah Sherman’s Matt Gaetz, and Chloe Fineman’s Kaitlan Collins (2 each).\n\nThese numbers do not take into account the content of the satire. For instance, the real Harris joined Rudolph in one of her skits to do some last-minute campaigning. Another one satirized Harris’s interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier, but Baier and Fox were clearly meant to be the butts of the joke. Skits satirizing Trump were less friendly.\n\nAs SNL enters its 51st season, it will experience quite a bit of turnover. Cast members Heidi Gardner, Devon Walker, Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim, and Ego Nwodim have all left—Gardner and Nwodim more willingly than the others. Writer Celeste Yim (they/them pronouns) also left. Joining the cast will be Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Ben Marshall, Kam Patterson, and Veronika Slowikowska. The show also screen-tested different Weekend Update anchor combinations amid speculation Jost and Che would also depart, but they will be back for Season 51.","summary":"Season 51 of NBC’s Saturday Night Live is set to premiere on October 4, but before that a new NewsBusters study looked back and found that 82 percent of Season 50’s Weekend Update jokes targeted conservatives and that 60 percent of its cold open political characters were conservatives or Republicans.\n\nNewsBusters analysts looked at 21 shows (20 regular episodes plus one additional 50th anniversary special) from September 28, 2024, through May 17, 2025.\n\nWeekend Update\n\nCo-anchored by Colin Jost and Michael Che, the Weekend Update segment is the part of the show that is most like the nightly comedy shows that NewsBusters analyzes elsewhere.

His speech – which he took a more direct role in drafting – was that of the man left-leaning members elected in 2020: socially progressive, economically interventionist. The implication of Starmer’s words is that other addresses – such as “islands of strangers” – were not him.\n\nBut which Starmer are we getting today? The day after he again condemned Reform’s deportation policy as “racist” – which some in government fear was a “big error” – the Prime Minister has declared that he will end the “golden ticket” available to asylum seekers who wish to settle in the UK. Refugees will no longer be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years and will lose the automatic right to family reunion. “These measures are taken straight from the populist playbook the government itself has condemned,” argues the charity Freedom from Torture. Confused? Voters might well be.\n\nThere is, of course, a technical explanation of all this. Starmer used his conference speech to criticise those who “ignore the crisis in our asylum system” and to argue that “controlling who comes here is an essential task”. Unlike Reform’s plans, government sources confirm, the policy is non-retrospective: “no families sent home, no settlement rescinded”.\n\nBut the politics, so soon after Starmer declared a “fight for the soul of the nation” is undeniably messy. And that battle, extolled with passion by the Prime Minister, is one that plenty inside Labour are questioning whether he can win.\n\n“We cannot make the next election about whether you are a patriot or not,” warns one minister. “Nigel Farage loves this country just as much as I do. He is wrong about what makes it stronger in a very profound way.”\n\nIn Labour circles, unhappy comparisons are being drawn with the doomed campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. “If Starmer’s speech has licensed moral superiority, a permission to think that those persuaded by Reform might be less British or less moral than us it will be a dangerous failure,” says one minister (the PM has emphasised that he does not regard Farage or his supporters as racist).\n\nAnd there’s concern from the left too. “All of this ignores the reality in the country where millions are struggling to get by,” warns one senior MP of Labour’s unexpectedly upbeat conference. “This is where Farage’s hand is stronger because he is an insurgent and Starmer looks, talks and sounds like the ‘British establishment’.”\n\nThere’s a common thread to those criticisms: until people see a material improvement in their lives, moral condemnation will do Labour little good. And that’s a danger Stamer and his strategists are alert to.\n\n“We must go into that battle armed, not just with words and condemnation but with action,” argued Statmer in advance of a lengthy section on immigration. “And that means tackling all the problems that they [Reform] prey upon”.\n\nBut only a day after Labour conference, the political danger is clear: an unpopular Prime Minister who is shedding voters both to his left and right because neither side believes he is truly for them.\n\nThis piece first appeared in the Morning Call newsletter; receive it every morning by subscribing on Substack here\n\n[Further reading: Reject X, embrace trains]","summary":"MPs from left and right fear the Prime Minister’s new moral crusade against Reform has set him up for failure.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2025/10/has-keir-starmer-picked-the-wrong-battle","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/02/GettyImages-2238124369.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 09:17:13","author":"George Eaton","authors":["George Eaton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.08},{"id":365457494,"title":"Kamala Harris blames everyone but the Black voters who rejected her","text":"Let’s get one thing straight: Vice President Kamala Harris didn’t singularly lose because of President Joe Biden. She didn’t lose because of so-called racism. She didn’t lose because of \"misinformation,\" or because Mercury was in retrograde. Harris lost because millions of Black Americans like me abandoned both her and her party. And that’s the one truth she can’t stomach to say out loud. Her new memoir, \"107 Days,\" is being sold as an inside look at the shortest presidential campaign in modern American history. But let’s call it what it is: a 320-page therapy session. A master class in finger-pointing. Page after page, Harris places the blame everywhere but where it belongs. She blames President Donald Trump. She blames the media. She blames unnamed campaign staffers who, in her telling, never quite understood her brilliance. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS But notice what’s missing? Not once does she blame the very voters who had the power to decide her future. Not once does she wrestle with the reality that Black Americans, the group Democrats have long counted on as their most loyal constituency, looked at her record, her rhetoric and her hollow promises, and decided to walk away. Because if Harris admitted that, she’d have to confess something Democrats have spent half a century pretending isn’t possible: that the Black vote is not guaranteed. That the coalition they’ve smugly taken for granted is cracking at its foundation. That the very people they thought they owned are no longer buying what they’re selling. And on Nov. 5, 2024, that’s exactly what happened. HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE 'DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH TIME’ TO WIN 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE According to Pew Research Center, Trump’s share of the Black vote doubled from 8% in 2020 to 15% in 2024. Among Black men, it hit 21%. Among Black women, 10%. That might sound modest to some, but it was campaign-ending for Harris. In reality, it was the strongest showing for a Republican candidate in more than 50 years. What Democrats and their media allies can’t admit is that numbers like that are not just statistics. They’re seismic shifts. They reveal a political reality the left is desperate to ignore: Black Americans are no longer willing to be taken for granted. They’re no longer content to be told to \"vote blue no matter who.\" They’re no longer falling for the tired fear tactics that tell them Republicans are out to get them while Democrats fail to deliver decade after decade. This isn’t apathy. This isn’t disengagement. This was an active choice. Black voters didn’t just stay home. They didn’t just sit it out. Many actively showed up and chose someone different. That’s what terrifies Democrats more than anything else. OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE And that’s why Harris can’t bring herself to admit what really happened. It’s not just about her own humiliation. It’s about the unraveling of an entire political strategy that the Democratic Party has relied on for generations. If the foundation crumbles, the house falls. And that’s exactly what 2024 put into motion.

Conversations where Black Americans are asking: What have Democrats actually done for us? Why should loyalty be automatic? And what do we have to lose by trying something different? Those conversations aren’t just happening in whispers anymore. They’re happening out loud. They’re shaping elections. They’re changing history. According to Pew Research Center, Trump’s share of the Black vote doubled from 8% in 2020 to 15% in 2024. Among Black men, it hit 21%. That’s the story Democrats can’t tell. That’s the story Kamala Harris can’t put on the page. But it’s the story America needs to hear. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because when the history of 2024 is written, it won’t be about excuses, or staff drama or media narratives. It will be about one undeniable truth: Black voters looked at the Democratic Party and said, \"No more.\" That’s the real legacy of 2024.

While 57 percent of Asian voters opted for Democratic candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election, the proportion of Asians who voted for Trump increased from 30 percent in 2020 to 40 percent, showing a remarkable rightward shift.\n\nMaintaining the support of this demographic will be important for Trump particularly when voters head to the midterms.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump attends a news conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer (not pictured) at Chequers at the conclusion of a state visit on September 18, 2025 in Aylesbury, England.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn their July poll of 1,935 adults, AtlasIntel found that 57 percent of Asian voters said they approved of Trump while 43 percent said they disapproved of him. This left him with a net approval rating of +14 percentage points.\n\nAt the time, Trump had announced tariffs on countries including Japan and South Korea but had also reached trade deals with Japan, Vietnam and Indonesia. The administration also announced an intention to double the number of Chinese students at U.S. universities.\n\nBy September, only 26 percent of Asian voters said they approved of the President while 75 percent said they disapproved—a net approval rating of -49 percentage points.\n\nWhile the poll did not address why people’s opinion of the president had soured, in September, as polling was being conducted, more than 300 South Korean workers were detained by U.S. authorities in Georgia, then returned home on 12 September, testing relations between the two countries.\n\nThe July poll, conducted between July 13 and July 18 had a margin of error of +/-2 percentage points. The September poll was conducted between September 12 and September 16 and had a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.\n\nOther communities have also turned away from Trump, polls have indicated. New polling by The Economist/YouGov says Trump’s net approval rating among millennials plunged by 14 percentage points in the last month.\n\nOverall, a recent Echelon Insights poll, conducted between September 18-22, showed that Trump’s disapproval rating had jumped from 51 percent to 53 percent since last month, while his approval rating was down two points to 45 percent. Overall, his net approval dropped by four points. Last week, according to political analyst Nate Silver, Trump’s net approval also slightly declined.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nThomas Whalen, an associate professor who teaches U.S. politics at Boston University, told Newsweek: “This development is about as surprising as the New York Jets losing another game, which is to say it isn’t. The administration’s harsh stance on immigration and comments like the president made last week at the U.N. on how Asia allegedly dumps its “garbage” on the U.S. and world have taken a toll. Asian voters are responding to reality. Trump and his MAGA supporters have hung out a ‘America is for whites only’ sign for everyone to see. Not for similar dismal polling numbers from other nonwhite minority groups. RIP inclusion.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s popularity with all demographic groups will likely fluctuate as his presidency continues. It will be tested when voters participate in the midterm elections in November 2026.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#039;s net approval rating among Asian voters has dropped by 63 percentage points in two months.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-approval-rating-asian-voters-10796319","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2235539595_d4cb1c.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 09:00:00","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":365456164,"title":"Furloughs, closures and mass firings threats: What's next in the shutdown fight","text":"The effects of a government shutdown are rippling across the country. Yesterday, federal workers stayed home from work, national parks prepared to close down and people seeking services from the federal government met a patchwork of availability and access.\n\nIn Washington, White House officials and Congressional leaders spent the day pointing blame in public while a small group of lawmakers in the Senate began talks about a potential offramp.\n\nCongressional Republicans were quick to dub the funding lapse \"The Schumer Shutdown\" — in a dig at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., — and maintain that the government should be reopened before any bipartisan negotiations begin. Senate Democrats remained largely united in opposition to the short-term spending bill passed by the House earlier this month, as they continue to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nAt the White House, Vice President JD Vance warned that federal workforce layoffs would be coming if the shutdown continues, in a break with past precedent of temporary furloughs. Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, also announced that the government would cancel or delay infrastructure and green energy projects that the administration says do not align with their policy goals – all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile party leaders refused to deviate from their demands, a handful of Republican and Democratic senators started informal talks about potential paths forward, although it's not clear any compromise they strike could advance in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWhat the White House is saying\n\nThe White House is not backing down from the message that Democrats are to blame. Administration officials at all levels say the push to undo Medicaid cuts Republicans passed this summer amounts to providing health care to undocumented immigrants. \n\nThat description does not fully or accurately describe the demands Democrats are making. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts that were in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill that Republicans passed the summer. That bill also included a provision that would punish states that provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants. But to be clear, people who are in the country without legal status are not qualified for Medicaid or able to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe White House is also calling the proposed layoffs one of the \"unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown,\" as press secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Wednesday. Leavitt and Vance told reporters that a prolonged shutdown would require permanent cuts, even while lapses in spending generally only lead to temporary furloughs.\n\nAt the center of those cuts is White House budget director Russ Vought, who was also a key architect of the controversial Project 2025 blueprint, where he advocated for a more activist approach to cutting spending and overhauling the federal workforce.\n\nNow as part of the administration, Vought has expressly stated that the \"appropriations process has to be less bipartisan.\"\n\nFederal employees' unions are suing over the Office of Management and Budget memo preparing agencies for layoffs during a shutdown. The complaint argues that the Trump administration is \"deviating from historic practice and violating applicable laws.\"\n\nTop congressional leaders aren't talking, but informal bipartisan talks have started\n\nA pair of partisan stopgap bills failed once again in the Senate on Wednesday. One bill was the House-passed stopgap bill written by Republicans to fund the government until Nov. 21. The other was an alternative written by Democrats that includes several health care policy changes. Throughout the day top party leaders pointed fingers about who was to blame for the shutdown.\n\nStill, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., aren't engaged in negotiations. Thune has said he's willing to talk about health care once the government reopened.\n\nBut a small group of lawmakers from both parties has been huddling in more informal talks.\n\nGroups of lawmakers have been huddling on the Senate floor and in hallways around the chamber working to craft a compromise to reopen government and extend the expiring health care tax credits and subsidies. \n\nRepublicans are floating ways to put income caps on the subsidies or limit the number of people who are eligible to receive them. They also maintain a new plan must eliminate waste from the program. Democrats want to preserve the credits for as many working and middle class people as they can in a bipartisan bill.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who has been part of those efforts working on a deal on the health care subsidies, told reporters, \"I am encouraged there are so many people on both sides who think we can work this out.\"\n\nSchumer told reporters Wednesday that he has been pushing for talks for some time, even if he is not directly involved.\n\n\"It's a good thing that Republicans and Democrats are now talking,\" he said.\n\nThune said he is receiving briefings on the talks and has told people involved to come and talk to him when they have \"critical mass,\" meaning enough votes from Democrats to end a shutdown.\n\nNo votes are planned for Thursday to allow lawmakers to observe the Jewish holiday. Senate GOP leaders are expected to call for another vote on Friday on the House-passed stopgap bill that funds federal agencies through November 21. Leaders are still discussing plans for possible weekend votes. But the three times they've attempted to pass the measure did not result in the 60 votes needed to advance. Two Democrats — Catherine Cortez Masto of New Mexico and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania — and one Independent, Angus King of Maine, did vote with most Republicans on that bill on Wednesday, but Thune needs another 5 Democrats to clear it through the chamber.\n\nThe House is out of session until October 7.\n\nNPR's Elena Moore and Tamara Keith contributed to this report.","summary":"On the first day of the government shutdown, Republicans and Democrats traded blame while a small bipartisan group of senators began to negotiate.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559296/government-shutdown-trump-house","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7386x4925+0+0/resize/7386x4925!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2F84%2Fec9dd85c47069fea0eabddeb0730%2Fgettyimages-2238181361.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 09:00:00","author":"Lexie Schapitl","authors":["Lexie Schapitl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":365438570,"title":"Lucas: No joke, Trump’s on the ‘get even’ track","text":"With all the shenanigans going on in DC, the next thing you know President Donald Trump will have FBI agents raiding Joe Biden’s house in Wilmington.\n\nIt will be like the raid on Mar-a-Lago by Biden’s Justice Department when armed FBI agents swooped unannounced into Trump’s home Aug. 8, 2022 searching for classified documents.\n\nOnly this time the FBI will not be searching for classified documents Biden is not supposed to have.\n\nBiden turned those over to the federal government following the Mar-a-Lago raid. Remember? They were stored in boxes in his garage beside his vintage 1967 Chevy Stingray.\n\nNo, this time the Trump’s FBI will be searching for Biden’s autopen.\n\nThis is the device that Biden used to “sign” thousands of commutations and pardons for convicted criminals, including pardons for his entire family, during the dying days of his administration.\n\nWhat if Biden had taken the autopen with him when he left the White House to use for signings when his book on his presidency is published? It could be called “107 Nightmares,” a “companion” book to Kamala’s Harris’ “107 Days.”\n\nIn any case, Trump said Biden had no idea who signed what in the closing days of Biden’s administration. Biden or his autopen even signed pardons for people who did not ask for them.\n\n“He was a horrible president,” Trump said.\n\nI’m joking, of course. Trump will not further embarrass Biden by raiding his house or driving off with his Stingray.\n\nHe will just continue to mock him, as he did last week when he eliminated Biden from the list of portraits of former presidents in the White House that he lined up in the West Wing. Trump called it the “Presidential Walk of Fame.”\n\nWhere Biden’s portrait should have been — between the two portraits of Trump — the president in a display of Trumpian humor, replaced Biden’ portrait with a picture of an autopen and a replica of Biden’s signature.\n\nIt was Trump’s idea of humor, but only half the country laughed. The other half cringed.\n\nClearly, though, Trump is getting even against those who sabotaged his first administration, ridiculed him, impeached him, indicted him and then tried to jail him to prevent his return to the White House.\n\nIf Trump’s enemies have anything in common is that they continually and foolishly demean and underestimate him.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, 65, is one of them, which may help explain why he is under indictment by Trump’s Justice Department for allegedly lying to Congress and for obstruction.\n\nComey, originally appointed by President Barack Obama, was fired by Trump in 2017 after charges that he helped push and leak the phony anti-Trump Russian collusion story along with the fake Russian dossier that Democrats used to malign Trump.\n\nBut the 6′ 9” often self-righteous Comey, who looked down on everybody, both literally and figuratively, did not go quietly into the night.\n\nInstead, he attacked Trump, calling him a liar who was, among other things, “unfettered to the truth.”\n\nComey relished the role of martyr that he carved out for himself and bragged how Trump was “focused” on him. But, as he told CNN, Trump was “never able to get me.”\n\nNow Trump’s got him.\n\nComey next week will have his mug shot taken and be arraigned in federal court. He faces five years in prison if convicted.\n\nComey may prevail, but he is being punished already. His life is turned upside down. The legal process will be long, and his lawyers will drain him dry.\n\nHis daughter Maurene Comey was fired from her job as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and his son-in-law Troy Edwards, Jr. resigned from a similar job at the U.S. Attorney’ office in Virginia\n\nA quote ascribed to former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr described Comey this way: “He not only thinks he’s the smartest man in the room, but the holiest as well.”\n\nIt’s not easy being a martyr.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com","summary":"James Comey next week will have his mug shot taken and be arraigned in federal court.
