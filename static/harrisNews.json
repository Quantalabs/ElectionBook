Fineman did extensive research for the film that centers on teen Abby (Morelos), who enlists Fineman’s stripper character to help her become more sexually enlightened in order to win over her high school crush.\n\n In a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Fineman discusses her random encounter with a stripper who ended up working on the movie, how her preparation for the role led to Lindsay Lohan offering her a part in the Freaky Friday sequel and how she feels when SNL deals with controversy.\n\n What initially attracted you to Summer of 69?\n\n Immediately, it was just working with Jillian Bell. I’ve been such a fan of hers, and I haven’t done a movie with a female director. So it was that, and also a stripper. What’s not to love? (Laughs.)\n\n Were you familiar with the sex worker community much before this?\n\n Definitely. Now we have movies like Anora. When I moved to L.A. initially, I had a lot of friends who I would do stand-up with who were strippers and stand-up comics, which is a fun mix. There was a strip club in Silver Lake that a couple of my friends worked at. Honestly, I think [it’s] just, “We’re people,” and not to stigmatize it or comment on it too much, and that was definitely fun. Then it’s the delicate balance of teen-sex comedy, and it’s not like I’m going to show my tits. That will be the next movie. (Laughs.)\n\n Do you have favorite moments from the shoot?\n\n Definitely the big dance sequence was something I was like, “Oh, God.” I did train really hard for it, and we had poles installed in the high school we were shooting at, so there’s this sweaty gym that also has X-Pole stripper poles in there. But I was lucky my sister was visiting, so she was on set the whole time I was doing that, being my own Santa Monica and truly was like, “Yes, bitch!” which was really fun.\n\n What was your training like? \n\n I was in L.A., and it turns out, every street has a pole class for some reason. I was in Pasadena, which you normally think of as where they shot Father of the Bride, but randomly, there was this amazing class. I just loved this teacher, and I hung out after the class and was like, “Would you be my stripper coach?” We flew her to Syracuse, and she and I and the amazing Travis Wall, who’s from So You Think You Can Dance?, we all came up with this thing together, and it was just so fun.\n\n Were there notes from anyone about concerns with the subject matter?\n\n I don’t think so. There was a bigger explanation of [the dialogue exchange involving] “porn … -ography,” and that was the only one that I was really concerned about in terms of not wanting to be groom-y. We did shoot me in the other room while Abby’s watching porn [but didn’t use it]. All of us agreed, it either could really work — but also, I get moms in my comments already, all the time. God knows why. So I was like, “Let’s just avoid this.” \n\n Why are moms in your comments?\n\n It’s just always like, “Is this grooming? Yuck!” You just get trolls from SNL in general. I’m always thinking ahead of, “Can I avoid this?” Moms, aka Republicans — you know what I mean?\n\n Did you do any stunt driving?\n\n We had an amazing stunt coordinator. For the stunt where I’m leaving those creepy dudes, I was in the car the whole time, and [the driver] Meredith scared the shit out of me every time, and I was genuinely terrified in that car. Then when we go to hit a nun, that was Meredith on her own. [When I was] in the car with her because they needed to catch my shoulder, I was like, “Am I going to die?”\n\n It seems tough for sexy comedies to make it to theaters these days. What’s the landscape for comedy films right now?\n\n The fact that we were making it was a good sign. We had a fun screening in L.A. with a big audience, and a bunch of SNL people came out. Wanting to see these things in a theater is the next frontier, but the fact that they get made and people respond to this is such a gift. I had a bunch of comedy lady friends come to that screening, and all of us were like, “Man, I wish I had this when I was growing up.” \n\n You’ve been so busy lately, and it was exciting for me to see the Freakier Friday presentation at CinemaCon last month. What was it like to be part of that sequel?\n\n It was crazy. This is completely true: I was getting hair extensions to play the stripper — that’s unfortunately not my real hair — and they take a long time. I was at this salon in L.A. after-hours, and Lindsay Lohan waltzed in. So we were in those hair sinks, and I turned and was like, “Oh, hi!” And then we got to talking and became friends as we’re getting our hair done. We exchanged numbers, and she’s just the loveliest person and such a hero of mine. Truly out of the blue, while I was dressed as a stripper, she was like, “Do you want to be in Freakier Friday?” I was like, “Oh, my God.” And it’s all from getting hair extensions. \n\n Are you planning to stay on Saturday Night Live and continue to work on other projects, or what is the future looking like for you?\n\n Gosh, I don’t know! I’m curious as to how everything’s going to shake out. I do know that I’m having a lot of fun on the show, and we really are a really tight-knit group, and it’s cozy. I did a play with Fred Armisen in January, and he was like, “If you feel like it’s your last year, you stay one more year.” It’s a blast of a show, and the fact that [producer] Lorne [Michaels] even lets me leave for a day is so nice.\n\n Any favorite highlights from season 50 as it wraps up?\n\n I [recently] wrote this sketch that I’ve had this idea for three years, called “Forever 31.” I’ve never really pitched it. But a couple weeks ago, all my ideas were shot down, and then I finally just hit our head writers. I had basically a Notes app, and I was like, “OK, here’s 10 other ideas.” Of those ones I didn’t believe in, they were like, “Wait, this is great.” To see that go on, and [host] Quinta [Brunson] be so down to do it, and millennials like me respond to it, has been very lovely. Even the fact that we had Kamala Harris, it’s just been such a crazy year. Everyone’s really scored in their own way this season. We just went on a retreat [the weekend before Brunson’s episode,] and you’re like, “Man, this is a really special group.”\n\n Is that something that you do regularly?\n\n No, this has never happened before in the history of, ever. We all took buses up to Tarrytown and did karaoke all night.\n\n Wow! The whole cast?\n\n Yeah, to celebrate and acknowledge all the hard work we did this year. It’s really important to hang out not on a Saturday, when you’re not in your right state of mind. It’s just such a weird, emotional roller coaster, so the people you hang out with outside of the show, it’s like a totally different, special bond. Getting to all do that together was awesome.\n\n SNL still manages to generate headlines, including Aimee Lou Wood responding to being impersonated this season. Is it surprising to you when the show still creates controversy?\n\n Oh, gosh. We all are so sorry, and obviously, the whole show apologizes. It’s always about course-correcting, and we’ve hashed it out a lot. I’m obviously deeply sorry. I didn’t play Aimee Lou, so I don’t want to speak on Sarah [Sherman], and I get awkward when I have to talk about it, honestly, because I don’t like having to talk for my friends. But definitely internally, there’s a course-correct and a big apology, and we love her. Who’s the Republican lady who went to see that play and was vaping? \n\n Lauren Boebert?\n\n Right. I did her, and she gets so mad. You’re used to being like, “OK, shut up.” If it’s people you really admire, you learn to be a little bit more sensitive. It’s a fine line with celebrities and amazing actors. It just is. We did Nicole Kidman a couple years ago and an AMC thing, and just the tiniest thing we tweaked. You just have to tread lightly with our fellow actors. It’s a little bit different with the Lauren Boeberts of the world.","summary":"The performer tells The Hollywood Reporter about her extensive research for the Hulu film and why certain comments from 'Saturday Night Live' viewers make her wary about comedy involving sexual content.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/chloe-fineman-summer-of-69-snl-interview-1236211704/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/173772_0049_V1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:39:31","author":"Ryan Gajewski","authors":["Ryan Gajewski"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.321},{"id":321016446,"title":"Book claims Biden failed to recognize George Clooney at 2024 fundraiser","text":"Share this @internewscast.comFacebookXRedditPinterestFormer President Joe Biden did not recognize George Clooney when he arrived for a record-breaking June 2024 fundraiser that the movie star was co-hosting, according to a forthcoming book from CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson.\n\nBackstage before the fundraiser, Clooney greeted the president when he arrived after a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 conference. The president appeared “severely diminished, as if he’d aged a decade since Clooney last saw him in December 2022,” the authors write in an excerpt of the book published in the New Yorker on Tuesday:\n\n“You know George,” the assisting aide told the president, gently reminding him who was in front of him.\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” the president said to one of the most recognisable men in the world, the host of this lucrative fundraiser. “Thank you for being here.”\n\n“It seemed clear that the President had not recognised Clooney,” Tapper and Thompson write.\n\n President Joe Biden shakes hands with actor, director and producer George Clooney during the Kennedy Center honorees reception at the White House in Washington, Dec. 4, 2022. Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race. Clooney says in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee. (AP)\n\nThe excerpt was published from Tapper and Thompson’s new book, “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” which will be released on May 20. The book is based on more than 200 interviews, mostly with Democratic insiders, almost all of which occurred after the 2024 election.\n\nBiden’s apparent inability to recognize Clooney was one of the most striking indicators of his physical and mental decline in the final year of his presidency, which ultimately led to his decision to withdraw his re-election bid following a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June.\n\n“It wasn’t a straight line of decline; he had good days and bad. But until the last day of his presidency, Biden and those in his innermost circle refused to admit the reality that his energy, cognitive skills, and communication capacity had significantly faltered. Even worse, through various means, they tried to conceal it,” the authors write.\n\nThe Clooney fundraiser took place on June 15, less than two weeks before the debate. Clooney was “shaken to his core” by the interaction with a man he’d known for years, Tapper and Thompson report.\n\n“It was not okay,” recalled a Hollywood VIP who witnessed the interaction, according to the excerpt. “That thing, the moment where you recognise someone you knowâespecially a famous person who’s doing a f**king fundraiser for youâit was delayed. It was uncomfortable.”\n\nThe interaction helps explain the motivation for Clooney to release an op-ed less than a month later calling on Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nThe actor had been shocked by a letter Biden released on July 8 insisting he was staying in the race. He reached out to former President Barack Obama to tell him he was considering writing the op-ed, the authors write.\n\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden speaks at Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled conference in Chicago, Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (AP)\n\n“Obama advised that doing so would only make Biden dig in his heels deeper,” according to the excerpt.\n\nAfter Clooney wrote a draft, he shared it with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a major Democratic donor who organised the June fundraiser, and told Katzenberg to share it with Biden’s longtime aide, Steve Ricchetti, the authors write.\n\n“Ricchetti read it and was furious,” Tapper and Thompson report. “Internally, he threatened to shut Clooney down â some of his colleagues thought he sounded like a Mob boss.”\n\nAccording to the excerpt, Katzenberg told Clooney he did not agree with his assessment of Biden, because the president had been jet-lagged the night of the event. He told Clooney he was skeptical the op-ed would have its desired effect. Katzenberg wanted Clooney to cut the line about the befogged Biden at the fundraiser being “the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” He argued that what Clooney was saying was not fair.\n\n“You’re right, it’s not fair, Clooney agreed. Aging was awful. It really wasn’t fair,” the authors write. “But, Clooney said, what he had written was accurate.”\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill Biden, defended his performance as president in a joint interview on ABC’s “The View” earlier this month, pushing back on suggestions he experienced cognitive decline in his final year in office.\n\n“The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day,” Jill Biden said. “I mean, he’d get up, he put in a full day, and then at night he would, I’d be in bed, you know, reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop.”\n\nThe book excerpt includes details of other Democratic concerns raised about Biden’s health ahead of the June debate. The same night of the Clooney fundraiser, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was discussing his concerns about the debate at a wedding.\n\n“Another wedding guest, who sat at Schumer’s table, recalled him saying, ‘If things go south at the debate, me, Barack, Nancy, and Hakeem have a Plan B,’ though Schumer later would deny it,” the authors write.\n\n“We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” David Plouffe, a former top Obama campaign aide who helped run Kamala Harris’ campaign after Biden dropped out, told Tapper and Thompson.\n\n“And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe said. By deciding to run for reelection and then waiting more than three weeks after the debate to bow out, Plouffe added: “He totally f**ked us.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Joe Biden did not recognize George Clooney when he arrived&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Book claims Biden failed to recognize George Clooney at 2024 fundraiser first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/book-claims-biden-failed-to-recognize-george-clooney-at-2024-fundraiser/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biden-didn039t-recognise-George-Clooney-at-2024-fundraiser-new-book.au2Ffs2F58187d6e-e003-4342-add4-044c29cdb2f3.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 22:40:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":321015432,"title":"Biden ‘totally f***ed’ Kamala’s chances of winning the Presidency by waiting too long to drop out, top campaign aide says","text":"A top campaign aide during former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed 2024 presidential run has placed the blame for her loss solely at the feet of President Joe Biden, according to a new book. \n\nDavid Plouffe, who was drafted into Harris's campaign after Biden stepped away from the race last summer, didn't parse words, saying the then-president \"totally f***ed us\" by not dropping out of the race sooner. \n\nBefore working with Harris, Plouffe managed former President Barack Obama’s winning 2008 campaign and served as a senior adviser in his White House. \n\nHe gave his unfiltered opinions in Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, a new book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. \n\nPlouffe is quoted as calling Harris's 107-day campaign \"a f***ing nightmare,\" which he said was \"all Biden.\" \n\nIn the book, Plouffe says he received calls from several donors worried about what they saw as Biden's declining health and cognitive skills, and his ability to deliver speeches. He said he pushed the White House and the Democratic Party on whether or not they really felt hitching their electoral hopes to Biden again in 2024 was the best course of action. \n\nIn addition to Plouffe, authors Tapper and Thompson spoke to approximately 200 people, including members of Congress, the White House, and campaign insiders about the campaign. Plouffe wasn't the only one sounding the alarm about Biden, according to their reporting. \n\nA senior aide, who quit the White House because they did not believe Biden should be running, told the authors that \"we attempted to shield him from his own staff so many people didn't realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023.\" \n\nThe staffer said that they \"love Joe Biden,\" but also felt that it was \" a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”\n\nAnother prominent Democratic strategist accused Biden of \"stealing\" a 2024 victory from the American public. \n\n“It was an abomination. He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people,\" the strategist reportedly said. \n\nThe book also reveals that Biden's aides had discussed his potential use of a wheelchair if he were re-elected. \n\n“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” Tapper and Thompson write.\n\nAides at the time believed that putting Biden in a chair during the election would hurt his chances of beating Donald Trump. But Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, reportedly “privately said that if [Biden] had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery.”\n\nThe book further claims that Biden did not recognize actor George Clooney — who eventually called for the president to step away from the race, despite his admiration for him — during a 2024 fundraiser.\n\nWhile questions of Biden's apparent decline were circulating behind closed doors in the White House and Democratic movers and shakers, the public focus on his cognitive abilities came to a head following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June of 2024. \n\nAccording to the book, Senator Chuck Schumer confronted Biden after the debate at his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, and tried to convince him to step aside to preserve his legacy. He reportedly warned that if he continued and lost to Trump, half a century of \"amazing, beautiful work goes out the window.\" \n\n\"But it’s worse than that – you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures,\" Schumer reportedly said. \n\nBiden reportedly replied to Schumer by telling him he had \"bigger balls than anyone I've ever met.\" \n\nThe former president did eventually heed the calls to step aside, but many of the book's subjects argue it was too late to salvage an effective campaign.","summary":"One Democratic strategist called Biden’s decision to run in first place ‘an abomination’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-harris-campaign-aide-election-b2750441.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/08/18/BIDEN-HARRIS_77074.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a98vGseh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-13 22:22:13","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":321005880,"title":"Biden team brought in Spielberg to cover up ‘communication struggles’ ahead of State of the Union","text":"This is the latest news detailing efforts by Democrats who were frantic to conceal Biden’s mental decline. In the aftermath of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s devastating loss to President Donald Trump last November, many people have come forward to describe the lengths Biden’s closest allies went to in order to cover up his cognitive lapses and declining health. Some of the most startling details will be in Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again — a book by Tapper and Thompson set to be released later this month.\n\nSpielberg works ‘Hollywood magic’\n\nIn their book, Tapper and Thompson said Spielberg tinkered with lighting and microphones as well as crafted campaign videos for Biden to help offset “communication struggles” caused by a mental decline suspected by the public for years.\n\nHollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, a mega-Democratic donor and long-time Biden ally, reportedly recruited Spielberg to make Biden look better to voters. \n\n“As 2024 approached, [Katzenberg] saw Biden’s communication struggles and thought he could help fix them. He worked on providing better lighting for Biden and trying to find a microphone that would amplify Biden when he would break into a whisper for emphasis. Katzenberg also recruited his friend Steven Spielberg, who helped coach Biden for the State of the Union and his debates, even assisting with routine campaign videos. There was, however, only so much that Hollywood magic could do,” an excerpt from the New Yorker article says.\n\nPod Save America host and his wife call Biden ‘a complete disaster’\n\nIn another incident mentioned in the piece, Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, expressed shock at Biden’s mental state during a visit to the White House in 2024 and at a campaign event at a Los Angeles theater later that year.\n\nFavreau, now one of the hosts of the popular Democratic political podcast, Pod Save America, and his wife, Emily Black, visited Biden in the White House in April 2024. Favreau said Biden was “incoherent” and “seemed to have aged 50 years in sixteen months,” as well as told “meandering and confusing” stories.\n\nWhen Favreau pressed an aide about Biden’s behavior, his concerns were dismissed.\n\n“The president must have just been tired. It was nighttime at the end of a long week,” the staffer said, according to the article.\n\nA few months later, Favreau and Black went to see Biden’s campaign appearance at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles. Once again, they deemed the June event a “complete disaster,” with Black saying she “couldn’t believe how awful Biden seemed.”\n\n“I wanted to make everyone stay in this theatre and say, ‘No one is going anywhere until we have a plan, because this can’t be it,’” Black, a communications consultant, reportedly said.\n\nChuck Schumer says he and Obama have ‘Plan B’\n\nEven the Senate’s top Democrat was deeply concerned about Biden, according to Tapper and Thompson.\n\nIn June, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reportedly said “if things go south at the debate,” he, Obama, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) “have a Plan B.”\n\n“Sometimes the President would call [Schumer] and, after some chit chat, admit that he’d forgotten why he’d called. Sometimes he rambled. Sometimes he forgot names,” Tapper and Thompson said. “Biden talked sluggishly — his voice was not just slower but oddly quieter, reminding Schumer of his mother, who had Parkinson’s.”\n\n“Schumer was concerned about the President’s electability. He talked about it with his staff, but he felt that he had to keep a close circle. If he talked about his worries with Obama or Hakeem Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi and it got out that they were discussing whether Biden was too old to run, that would make it even harder for him to win,” they continued. \n\n These days, Schumer has gone mute.\n\n“We’re just looking forward,” he said this week when pressed on the new reports of Biden’s mental decline.\n\nBiden’s doctor urged him to use wheelchair\n\nBiden’s White House physician, Kevin O’Connor, suggested he use a wheelchair if conditions worsened, something Biden’s advisers believed would have been political suicide before the 2024 election, according to Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\n\nO’Connor made the suggestion because Biden struggled with an awkward gait due to his “significant spinal arthritis.” \n\nHowever, Biden’s aides lied about the reason for the president’s stumbling gait. Throughout the 2024 campaign, they said it was a result of Biden refusing to wear a walking boot past a certain point after he fractured his foot, according to the book. The claim contradicted O’Connor’s assessment in 2021 that “this injury has healed as expected.”\n\nHowever, even people in the White House were unaware of how badly Biden was doing, according to Tapper and Thompson, who said the former president’s closest allies worked tirelessly to conceal his decline from White House aides, the press, Cabinet members, donors, Congress, and staffers. \n\n“After the election, we found out all of these things. When you look at what was going on with President Biden at the time, it probably doesn’t surprise you the extent to which he was deteriorating,” Tapper said. “But now we have anecdotes and facts about what was really going on behind the scenes with details that Democrats wouldn’t share with us until after the election.” \n\nMost Democrats made nice with Biden and publicly defended his mental and physical capacities during his campaign. However, in the months since November 2024, many have thrown him to the wolves. \n\n“We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,” said David Plouffe, who helped run Harris’s campaign.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to take his place at the top of the Democratic ticket last July after he was pressured to drop out of the race due to his disastrous performance in his June presidential debate against Trump. \n\nBIDEN’S REFUSAL TO EXIT ISN’T WHAT COST DEMOCRATS THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nPlouffe called Harris a “great soldier,” but said her compressed 107-day race became “a fu***** nightmare.”\n\n“And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe said, adding that Biden’s decision to run for reelection only to drop out in July, “Totally f***** us.”","summary":"Former President Joe Biden’s allies reportedly brought in a renowned filmmaker to help cover up his deteriorating mental state during his 2024 reelection campaign.

And of course the economic impact is already underway with supply chain shortages.\n\nBessent’s other function is to go on television and try to spin it all as a win, though it’s been nothing but surrender after surrender for Trump on tariffs—and severe, lasting harm to the economy.\n\nDespite the continued uncertainty, Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager whom the Wall Street Journal noted was previously “little-known” if respected in the financial world, now has a desperate Wall Street clinging to him as the person who they hope will save them from Trump’s lunacy.\n\nHe’s using that platform—and Trump—to promote himself as somewhat of an oracle. Bessent helps drive the markets back up after they’ve plummeted, as investors buy on hope and rumor—which he supplies to them—even when both might be false. (Inevitably the markets drop again on actual economic news and solid data, as well on Trump’s threats.)\n\nBut Bessent isn’t, as the media’s portrayed him, an “adult in the room” who’s a sort of Democrat-turned-Republican, trying to do the “right thing.”\n\nJD Vance has been Bessent’s longtime friend, which should tell you enough about his character. The WSJ reported, in a piece last year, that Bessent supported Trump in 2016, and then, even after January 6th, “decided to go all-in [on Trump in 2024] when he saw that the legal cases against Trump were helping, not hurting, his approval rating. He told people the phenomenon reminded him of a stock that rises despite bad news, a bullish sign for some investors.”\n\nTrump, always taken in by flattery, decided that Bessent was an oracle when Bessent backed Trump over Nikki Haley, who much of Wall Street’s Republicans got behind in the primaries. Trump then invited the ambitious Bessent to a 2024 North Carolina rally to speak, and called Bessent, “One of the most brilliant men on Wall Street. Respected by everybody.”\n\nBut Bessent was previously “little-known” on Wall Street precisely because he’s not an oracle—or, apparently, that brilliant. One of his biggest predictions—which he made at that very rally in North Carolina—has in fact been turned on its head.\n\n“Kamala Harris will start with the Kamala crash in the stock market,” Bessent warned the crowd. “Then it will be the Kamala crash in the economy.”\n\nOf course, the “crash”—the largest market drop in years because of Trump’s trade war, which saw the Dow have its worst April since 1932—was the “Trump crash,” not the “Kamala crash.” If Harris were president, there would be no tariffs, and no chaos imposed by tariffs, in the markets or in the economy. That is simply a fact.\n\nThere’s been much made of Bessent having worked for George Soros more than a decade ago, as chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, as well as his having held a fundraiser for Al Gore in 2000. Hence the idea that he was a gay man who supported Democrats previously.\n\nBut in fact, as the WSJ, reports, he “didn’t agree” with a lot of the causes Soros’ foundation backed, and regarding one of them—proposing to restrict the fund from investing in companies doing business with Israel—Bessent threatened to resign. The idea subsequently “was dropped.”\n\nAnd the same year he the held the fundraiser for Gore, Bessent gave money to John McCain. He’s mostly backed Republicans in fact—to the tune of over $15 million—but gave money to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, which, as with Gore, seemed more like making sure he, as a business person, buttered both sides of the bread more than anything else. And Bessent has been on the Trump train since it began rolling down the tracks.\n\nIn 2016, Bessent told people they were underestimating Trump’s chances. After Trump won the election, Bessent scored a big win betting on a market rally and later gave $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.Bessent also has taken sides in the types of culture fights Trump picks. In 2020, he lobbied to get the headmaster reinstalled at his son’s former Manhattan school, St. Bernard’s, after concerns about the school turning too liberal.\n\nSo Bessent is more MAGA—and opportunistic—than the liberal-ish adult-in-the-room he’s been portrayed as in the press. And it’s pretty appalling for a gay man, working for a president stripping LGBTQ rights while the Supreme Court Trump created is routinely carving out exemptions to LGBTQ rights for “religious liberty” reasons.\n\nBessent has been married to a former New York City prosecutor, John Freeman, since 2011. They have two school-aged children, and they buy, upgrade and sell mansions in posh places, and have sold at least 20 homes. Until recently, they lived in what they called the Pink Palace in Charleston, South Carolina, which they sold for over 18 million dollars.\n\nBessent, according to an interview in the Yale Alumni Magazine in 2015, never imagined he’d be able to get married as a gay man, and have children via surrogacy. It’s a comment that is quite jarring considering that, a year later, he’d support Trump— and is now working him:\n\nIn a certain geographic region at a certain economic level, being gay is not an issue. What’s fantastic is now, people in the rest of America, whether blue collar or white collar, have access to everything. If you had told me in 1984 when we graduated and people were dying of Aids that 30 years later I’d be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn’t have believed you.\n\nBut who made it possible for Bessent to marry, and have children?\n\nNot the Republicans he was supporting—nor Trump. And not the current Supreme Court Trump created, which, if the issue came to them now for the first time, would never rule for marriage equality. And everything they’re doing now is in fact chipping away at the Obergefell ruling, allowing for discrimination against gay married couples in public accommodations.\n\nIt was gay and lesbian activists, putting their own bodies on the line, who fought for Bessent’s rights, and Democrats, who finally took up the mantle that got marriage equality legalized in the states and then eventually upheld by the courts. Marriage equality was opposed by the GOP—and still is opposed among most those Republicans in Congress, and among Trump’s powerful base Christian nationalist—and we’ve seen Trump stripping LGBTQ history from government websites, removing anything with the word “gay,” targeting queer people in atttacks on DEI and killing LGBTQ health initiatives.\n\nBessent, who once served on the board of God's Love We Deliver, an organization founded to deliver meals for homebound people with AIDS, is now part of an administration that is literally killing people with AIDS, having stopped lifesaving HIV drug treatments for millions through USAID. And Bessent is watching the abominable things this administration is doing to transgender people, destroying lives, denying they exist.\n\nBessent could have influence on Trump regarding LGBTQ rights if he wants. Curiously, we’ve not seen, for example, the Trump administration attacking Yale University the way it is attacking Harvard. Could that be because Bessent sits on the university council at Yale? In fact, he and his sister donated the Bessent Library to Yale, and Bessent has endowed three scholarships at Yale. Sounds like he might be protecting his alma mater from Trump. But he couldn’t care less about helping his own people under attack.\n\nBessent got his—his money, his marriage, his children, his homes—and now, opportunistically, he’s making a name for himself helping the very president who is harming LGBTQ people and so many other minorities every day, in addition to endangering democracy and sending the economy in a spiral downward, causing hardship for millions of Americans. There aren’t enough words to describe this kind of immorality.","summary":"Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has been front and center in the Trump administration’s trade wars.\n\nHis main function has been to puff Trump up, and then carry out Trump’s various cave-ins—most recently his folding to China.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed House Republicans over their proposal to slash Medicaid as a part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,”\n\nHouse Republicans unveiled legislation on Sunday that that included at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks provided in Trump’s bill. Ocasio-Cortez railed against the cuts to Medicaid during a House hearing on Tuesday, noting that these cuts would hurt those living in Republican districts.\n\n“If you live in a rural community, you’re going to be hurt too. In NY-23, 25% of people are on Medicaid in this area of upstate New York,” Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to GOP Rep. Nick Langworthy’s district.\n\nTrump won New York’s 23rd Congressional District with 60% of the vote in the 2024 presidential election, while former Vice President Kamala Harris clinched 39% of the vote. \n\nOcasio-Cortez continued to list rural districts with a large share of residents on Medicaid, including California’s 23rd Congressional District that GOP Rep. Jay Obernolte represents. She said 46% of those people in Obernolte’s district are on Medicaid. \n\nSimilarly to Langworthy’s district, Trump secured victory in Obernolte’s district with 57% of the vote, while Harris received 40%.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also said that Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, represented by GOP Rep. Gabe Evans, has 24% of residents on Medicaid. Trump narrowly clinched Colorado’s 8th Congressional District with 49.56% of the vote, while Harris secured 47.73%.\n\nShe also said that Republicans want to cut 13.7 million Americans from their healthcare with their new bill. She said that the bill’s math is “not adding up.”\n\nThe Democrat explained that the bill could even hurt those with private insurance. \n\n“This bill bans the people that they kick off of Medicaid from even buying their own insurance from the Affordable Health Care Act exchange. So once you are kicked off Medicaid, you then can’t even buy your own health insurance. It increases costs for people who they deem eligible and who are low income, and forces them to pay even more,” she said.\n\n“And if you have a private insurer, don’t worry, you’re getting screwed over, too, because your health care premiums are going to skyrocket, from the disaster that is happening from this bill,” she added.\n\nTallying hundreds of pages, the legislation revealed late Sunday is touching off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried but failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump’s first term in 2017. \n\nWhile Republicans insist they are simply rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. \n\n“Savings like these allow us to use this bill to renew the Trump tax cuts and keep Republicans’ promise to hardworking middle-class families,” said Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles health care spending.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The fire, which started on Sunday, has destroyed more than 40 structures and led dozens of people to evacuate. There were 80 people working to respond to the incident, and several road closures implemented.\n\nThe “fire has been very active the last two days, with the burning period going into the night,” the Minnesota Incident Command System wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\n\nIn the nearby Superior National Forest, the Jenkins Creek Fire had spread over 6,800 acres, quadrupling in size after erupting Monday morning. \n\n“The fire moved quickly, driven by strong southerly winds,” according to officials. \n\nSouthwest of the two wildfires, the Munger Shaw fire tore over more than 1,400 acres, according to the wildfire-tracking app Watch Duty. More evacuations were reported in that area, according to the national forest. \n\nThe causes of all of the fires remain under investigation. Not one of the fires is contained. \n\nOn Monday, Democratic Governor Tim Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate, said he had authorized the National Guard to assist in the response.\n\n\"Wildfires in northern Minnesota have forced families to evacuate and caused severe damage to and loss of property. My thoughts are with those Minnesotans who are being impacted by this dangerous and unpredictable fire,\" said Walz. \n\nAs the fight continues, an air quality alert issued due to the spread of wildfire smoke has been extended through Wednesday.\n\n“Air quality is expected to reach the orange AQI level, which is unhealthy for sensitive groups,” the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency warned. \n\nSimilar alerts were issued at around the same time last year due to wildfire smoke coming from Canada.\n\nWalz and the state’s forestry officials told residents to be extra careful about anything that could cause heat or sparks. Burn restrictions were in place.\n\nRed flag warnings have been issued for 65 counties, and any wildfire that starts in this weather is expected to explode. Climate change is making wildfire-prone conditions more frequent. \n\nThe governor said that while Minnesota typically sees more than 1,100 wildfires a year, 970 have already occurred this year. Of those, 40 were on Sunday and Monday, according to WCCO News.\n\n\"I've worked for DNR (Department of Natural Resources) Forestry for nearly 30 years, and the weather the last few days is just really unprecedented,\" Patty Thielen, director of forestry for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told the station. \"Really low humidity, high winds have allowed fires to spread really quickly.\"","summary":"Dozens of residents were evacuated from their homes as three wildfires quickly spread amid red flag conditions","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/minnesota-wildfires-national-guard-b2750315.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/13/20/49/FIRE.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Z39F5ShE-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-13 20:50:19","author":"Julia Musto","authors":["Julia Musto"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":320989840,"title":"Biden’s refusal to exit isn’t what cost Democrats the White House","text":"And in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book on the cover-up of Biden’s mental decline, Democratic strategist David Plouffe echoed Clooney, saying, “It’s all Biden. He totally f****** us.”\n\nAccording to this theory of the case, Democrats would have held on to the White House if Biden hadn’t lost his mental acuity or if former Vice President Kamala Harris had had longer to campaign against President Donald Trump. But neither claim holds up to scrutiny. Both are indicative of an elite political class that still hasn’t figured out what happened in November — and probably never will. \n\nTo be sure, Biden’s steep mental decline, which was apparent to anyone outside the Washington, D.C., media bubble even before his 2020 campaign, did not help his party’s prospects in 2024. But it wasn’t the decisive factor some make it out to be. Trump’s victory was the result of Democratic policies, which wrecked the economy and flooded the nation with 10 million undocumented immigrations, and of cultural progressivism’s toxicity in the woke era.\n\nThere wasn’t a pitchman alive who could have convinced a majority of Americans to reinforce this agenda. From open borders to progressive indoctrination in schools to a foreign policy that saw armed conflict break out worldwide, the Democratic brand became synonymous with failure and decay. Sure, Biden’s obvious cognitive deficits made matters worse and raised startling questions about who was actually running the country. But Americans pined for Trump regardless. They saw him as a bulwark against the moral degradations and governing missteps perpetrated by Democrats. \n\nThey also rightly saw that Trump was unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, a transgression (or a “broken norm,” if you will) that they were unwilling to let go unpunished.\n\nA healthy, quick-witted Biden wouldn’t have changed any of this. \n\nThere’s even reason to suspect that a healthy Biden would have made matters worse. It’s likely the case that his staff would have done a better job running the country than he would have, and that he would have torpedoed his own reelection campaign if given the chance. Biden was never very popular to begin with. Far from a sharp tactician, his capacity for gaffes was the stuff of legend. Take it from Biden’s old boss, who famously warned allies to “never underestimate Joe’s ability to f*** things up.”\n\nThe idea that Harris could have won with more time on the trail is equally ridiculous. Her only real momentum came early in the race, and it seeped away with every shallow and off-putting utterance. There’s a reason her handlers wouldn’t allow her to do an interview for the first month of the campaign — they knew what would happen if she were allowed to speak. \n\nAnd they were right. The early polling bump she experienced upon taking over the top of the ticket — she led by nearly four points nationally in August, according to FiveThirtyEight — evaporated steadily until Election Day. Her cringeworthy appearances in the final weeks of her campaign, including an interview on The View during which she was stumped by a softball question from co-host Sunny Hostin about how she differentiated from Biden, as well as a CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper during which she couldn’t name a single weakness, showed a candidate who was cratering, not ascending. \n\nMore time on the campaign trail would have meant an even bigger electoral wipeout. Democratic media is making it seem as though Harris was steadily gaining on front-runner Trump, but couldn’t quite reach him before running through the tape. It’s pure fiction.\n\nHarris’s 2020 bid for the Democratic nomination followed the same trajectory: burst out of the gate, limp to the finish line. \n\nThe media circus surrounding the Biden cover-up must make Trump giggle himself to sleep at night. Who has ever been blessed with such pitiful opponents? \n\nThe false spin Democratic elites are attempting to convince themselves of — that Biden’s decline was the real reason they lost, not their ideas — means they aren’t serious about fixing the problems in their party, which Trump has gleefully exploited for a decade. \n\nBy scapegoating Biden, Democrats continue to miss the memo. Their real problem is the fake news media that propped him up all those years.","summary":"There’s a preposterous idea circulating the elite political class: former President Joe Biden&#8216;s stubborn refusal to step down cost his party the presidency.  “Democrats deceived the country about Biden’s abilities and that’s how Trump won,” George Clooney is quoted as saying in a recent New Yorker article.

There are times I follow that process and decided to run. And there are times I followed that process and decided not to run.

During Biden's 2024 presidential campaign -- and later, Vice President Kamala Harris' own campaign after Biden left the race -- Buttigieg served as a key campaign surrogate and was floated as a potential running mate for Harris, who ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nNow Buttigieg is set to speak in Iowa -- a state where its caucus often serves as the earliest indication of how America's voters will choose their primary candidates.\n\nMajor General Paul Eaton, chairman of VoteVets Action Fund, is expected to introduce Buttigieg as \"a fellow veteran and someone who understands what is at stake for all Americans,\" according to remarks first shared with ABC News.\n\nEaton is expected to say that the reason the group has chosen to hold its town hall in Iowa is to reach those \"on the ground, in the heartland, in a so-called red state, talking not just about what has happened but what we can do in response and how we can continue to put pressure on Trump but also the members of Congress who refuse to do their jobs.\"\n\nIn March, Buttigieg ruled out running for a Senate seat or governor in Michigan, and a source familiar with his thinking told ABC News at the time that Buttigieg was strongly positioned to launch another White House bid.\n\nAnd in the first 100 days or so of President Donald Trump's administration, Buttigieg has taken his message far and wide. He has launched his own Substack, appeared on numerous podcasts and been a regular voice on cable news.\n\n\"Pete has always had a 'go everywhere and talk to everyone' mindset. This is an opportunity to hear from the men and women who served our country about challenges they're facing in the chaos of the current administration and what's needed for a more secure future, outside of the Washington media bubble and podcast studios,\" a Buttigieg spokesperson said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nBut now Buttigieg is taking his vision out on the open road. And according to a spokesperson, isn't stopping with Iowa.\n\n\"You can expect to see him continuing this conversation with Americans across the country,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAnd he subtly hinted at this expanded tour during the conclusion of his appearance on Sirius XM's Smartless podcast, hosted by actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, remarking: \"I'll be around. I'll be out there.\"\n\nThis trip comes as other Democrats whose names have circulated as potential presidential material are making public appearances in important voting states. Both Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Walz will be featured guests at the South Carolina's Democratic Party's statewide conference at the end of the month. Walz will also appear at the California Democrats' convention that same weekend.\n\nMoore and Walz have publicly denied plans for a 2028 presidential run.\n\nABC New's Justin Gomez contributed to this report.","summary":"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is heading to Iowa Tuesday, fueling speculation that he is mounting a bid for the White House in 2028.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/buttigieg-headline-iowa-town-hall-amid-2028-speculation/story?id=121762664","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9ce72745-7e81-4a75-b5c5-8b3d138e6191/pete-buttigieg-iowa-gty-jt-250513_1747159309053_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 20:26:09","author":"Brittany Shepherd","authors":["Brittany Shepherd"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.137},{"id":320983048,"title":"Scapegoating Joe Biden isn’t going to solve the Democratic Party’s problems","text":"Scapegoating Biden for all the left’s considerable political problems is an ugly hypocrisy. It is also self-delusional. There is a reason the Democratic Party’s polling is at historic lows right now and it’s not just Biden’s memory problems. \n\nLet’s recall that every congressional Democrat decided to shoehorn the “Inflation Reduction Act” into law even after most economists warned it would plunge the nation into price spikes. Biden wasn’t the only one leaning into the hysterics of “semi-fascism.” If anything, Biden had merely adopted the social science quackery on gender that so many Democrats champion.\n\nDid any elected Democrat speak out about the anarchy of illegal immigration? If so, I must have missed it. Yet, according to a pre-election Pew poll, 78 percent of Americans believed the border was a crisis or major problem.\n\nOne of the big criticisms of Biden is that he failed to make room for another candidate earlier. It is almost surely that Kamala Harris would have been the nominee regardless of when Biden dropped out. Does anyone really believe a hyper-ambitious politician ensconced in the White House was going to step aside or let some middling governor wrest the nomination from her? The only Democrat who consistently outperformed Kamala in most polls after Biden’s debate debacle was Michelle Obama. It was going to be Kamala.\n\nWhat makes anyone think that Harris would have experienced more success had she enjoyed more time? After an initial jolt up, the vice president’s popularity steadily declined. Harris needed less time, not more. The more Americans heard from her, the more they disliked her.\n\nHarris, like any other potential Democratic candidate, was compelled to run on the president’s record. And that record, championed by virtually every Democrat, was unpopular long before the media was compelled to acknowledge the president’s declining mental state.\n\nThe Democratic Party had blown it. Polls found that only 36 percent approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, 28 percent approve of his handling of immigration, 33 percent approve of his handling foreign policy, and 30 percent of voters approve of his handling of the Middle East.\n\nNow, even with those numbers, elections are a contest between two visions. A CBS News poll found that 65% of Americans remember the economy under Trump fondly, while only 38% said the same about Biden.\n\nDoes anyone really believe that Wes Moore, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear, or J.B. Pritzker possesses the kind of charismatic personality or compelling message to overcome that record? It’s exceptionally unlikely.\n\nPlouffe might have been one of the few Democrats who publicly questioned the wisdom of running a man whose mental acuity had slipped for years. Until the day of the first 2024 presidential debates, however, virtually the entirety of the party and media had been shielding Biden. If the president had refused to debate Trump, the left would have almost surely kept on concealing Biden’s condition. It had no choice but to turn on the president once he had been exposed.\n\nWe learn in the New Yorker that Biden didn’t recognize George Clooney at the infamous Hollywood fundraiser where Barack Obama had to lead the president off stage by hand. Recall that even at this point, the big media were still gaslighting the public about the president’s deteriorating acuity. Three days later, Tapper’s colleague wrote in CNN’s media newsletter that the claim had been a “fabrication.”\n\nTwo days before the debate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had told reporters the president was sharper than he’d been in years. “He’s fine. All this right-wing propaganda that his mental acuity has declined is wrong,” he said. \n\nIn the New Yorker piece we learn that Schumer would speak to Biden on the phone regularly, “and, after some chit chat” the president would “admit that he’d forgotten why he’d called. Sometimes he rambled. Sometimes he forgot names. Schumer wasn’t concerned about Biden’s acuity, but he was worried about the optics.”\n\nThe president is the most powerful man in the world, and the Senate leader was worried about optics. So, indeed, was the rest of his party.\n\nWhich is merely to say that Democrats screwed themselves.","summary":"“We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,” former Obama advisor David Plouffe is quoted saying in a New Yorker&#160;excerpt&#160;from Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book,&#160;Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.

Now He's Ordering Them for Prescription Drugs.","text":"This week, President Donald Trump issued an order he says will bring down Americans' prescription drug prices. The order will likely have little effect, but it's a perfect example of the government price controls that Trump and members of his administration once compared to socialism and fascism.\n\nOn Monday, Trump issued an executive order directing the secretary of health and human services within 30 days to \"communicate most-favored-nation price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.\" Most favored nation (MFN) status means a country is treated the same in a negotiation as whoever is getting the best deal. If enacted across the board, Trump's order would mean pharmaceutical companies must sell drugs to Americans at the lowest prices they were offering anybody else in the world.\n\n\"Trump does not in any way suggest those price targets would apply only to the prices the government pays for medicines,\" writes Michael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nThe order also directs agencies to take action against manufacturers that don't comply. \"If necessary, we'll investigate the drug companies, and we'll, in particular, investigate the countries that are doing this,\" Trump said on Monday.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social over the weekend, Trump said that as a result of the order, \"Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%.\" On Monday, he said it would bring down costs \"60, 70, 80, 90 percent, but actually more than that if you think about it…mathematically.\" The order complains that \"drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access foreign markets, and subsidize that decrease through enormously high prices in the United States.\"\n\nAmericans do pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, but the reasons for that are more complicated than Trump suggests.\n\n\"There are many good reasons why we should pay more for earlier access to new medications than our trading partners,\" wrote Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman of the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Institute for Public Policy & Government Service. \"As the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals, America finds itself in the unique position of accruing the lion's share of the benefits from new medicines. We often recoup these additional costs in the form of longer and healthier lives.\"\n\nPharmaceutical companies say the price imbalance is due to the cost of bringing a new drug to market in the U.S., which typically runs into billions of dollars.\n\nTrump's proposal \"falls short on several fronts,\" Lakdawalla and Goldman wrote. Drug companies could simply hike overseas prices but offer rebates, which many foreign laws require to be confidential. Otherwise, \"facing a choice between deep cuts in their U.S. pricing or the loss of weakly profitable overseas markets,\" the companies may simply exit foreign markets altogether, \"leaving U.S. consumers with the same prices, pharmaceutical manufacturers with lower profits, and future generations with less innovation.\"\n\nBesides, the order would impose the same sort of coercive government policies Trump and his allies once rightly decried as authoritarian.\n\nIn August 2024, then–Vice President Kamala Harris announced that as president, she would support a federal ban on grocery price gouging, which she blamed for inflation.\n\n\"Commies gonna commie. The only thing price controls deliver is shortages and famine,\" Stephen Miller, now a White House adviser, said at the time in a post on X. In a separate post, he called price controls \"a Marxist policy imposed by leftist regimes whose policies have triggered radical inflation. It leads to food and medicine shortages, bread lines, a worse inflation spiral, and the destruction of the currency.\"\n\n\"After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls,\" Trump told a campaign rally at the time. \"This is Communist; this is Marxist; this is fascist.\"\n\nBut Trump is now calling for price controls on prescription drugs, doing exactly what he warned would happen if Harris had won. Asked how the president's plan differed from Harris' proposal, a White House official told National Review's Audrey Fahlberg, \"What we're doing here is kind of fixing the market and just allowing market forces to operate in a way they're supposed to to deliver price relief for the American people.\"\n\nBut contrary to that official's claim, price controls are completely antithetical to \"allowing market forces to operate.\" In fact, introducing more \"market forces\" into the health care industry would be a welcome change. Medicare and Medicaid account for 45 percent of all health care spending in the United States.\n\nInstead, the president hopes to introduce even more government into health care.","summary":"The president hopes to introduce even more government intervention into health care.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/05/13/trump-called-price-controls-communist-now-hes-ordering-them-for-prescription-drugs/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/polspphotostwo275977-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 20:15:00","author":"Joe Lancaster,Marc Oestreich","authors":["Joe Lancaster","Marc Oestreich"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":320988034,"title":"‘Very Damning’: Brian Stelter Says Biden ‘Can’t Refute’ How His Deteriorating Health Hurt Dems In 2024 Election","text":"CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter said Tuesday that former President Joe Biden “can’t refute” how his deteriorating health helped hand the 2024 election to President Donald Trump.\n\nNew details surrounding Biden’s poor physical and mental health emerged Tuesday in “Original Sin,” a book written by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, which detailed how Democrats and White House aides covered up Biden’s evident decline. Stelter said that these “damning” details are a firm confirmation that Biden’s health was waning.\n\n“Biden being back on the public stage reminds people of what went wrong and it doesn’t negate what is in this explosive book,” Stelter said. “When you launch a book in the way Tapper and Thompson are doing next week, you come out with a first excerpt. So that first excerpt up on the New Yorker website right now, also available on CNN.com, it is very damning on what went wrong in 2023 and 2024. So to Jamaal’s point, I think there’s an emerging conventional wisdom, an emerging narrative that President Biden at the midterms in 2022 was a different person in the summer and fall of 2024. That his decline had escalated, that it had gotten worse in that period of time.” (RELATED: Jake Tapper Says White House, Dems Were ‘Lying’ All Along About Biden’s Health Until Election Ended)\n\nStelter further noted that Biden’s attempt to reemerge in the public eye is a reminder to Democrats on why they lost the 2024 election. David Plouffe, who helped run former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, told Tapper and Thompson that Biden “totally f***ed” the Democrat Party ahead of the election.\n\n“Biden can’t refute the basic facts of what happened,” Stelter continued. “I think it is really interesting how Tapper and Thompson have given an answer to all the liberals, all the Trump opponents who are saying ‘why are you focusing on Biden? Why are you reporting out what went wrong with Biden? Why are you looking back in time when Trump is doing so much in the present day to remake America?’ Well, the answer is right here in these first excerpts that are coming out. The authors say that ‘Democrats deceived the country about Biden’s abilities’ and in the words of George Clooney, ‘that’s how Trump won.'”\n\n“You know, ultimately, that’s how all of this conversation abut Biden and what happened goes to what is happening today with Trump,” Stelter said. “And I don’t think Biden has an answer to that fundamental issue, no matter what kind of press story he tries to launch.”\n\nBiden appeared on “The View” Thursday where he blamed sexism for Harris’ loss to Trump. He also rambled as co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asked him about his cognitive ability, leading former first lady Jill Biden to jump in and answer for him.\n\nBefore the election, Stelter jumped to Biden’s defense by denying reports of the then-president’s decline. In June, Stelter attempted to discredit a lengthy Wall Street Journal report detailing Biden’s mental decline by stating that the media became obsessed over Biden’s age.\n\n“They didn’t do any original reporting,” Stelter told former MSNBC host Joy Reid. “They didn’t follow up, they didn’t do any work, they didn’t do any of their own work at all. They just ate it up, and then they regurgitated what the Wall Street Journal said. That’s the worst form of so-called journalism out there. It’s not really news at all, and that’s my biggest complaint about this … They said ‘this could be an election decider,’ Joe Biden’s age. That’s true if the media obsesses over it and ignores Trump’s flaws.”\n\nThe CNN analyst echoed former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre’s use of the term “cheap fakes” to describe clips of Biden appearing to be confused and out of touch. He told CNN’s Abby Phillip in June 2024 that Americans may think Biden is falling apart mentally because they are viewing those snippets.\n\nDuring an August 2020 segment of his canceled show “Reliable Sources,” Stelter argued that concerns about Biden’s health were a right-wing narrative.\n\n“What the heck is going on on these programs? Look at what Fox News saw on Saturday out of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. There’s Joe Biden out there on a vigorous bike ride. Not wearing a helmet but definitely wearing a mask, by the way. Fox’s narrative and talk radio’s narrative for months has been that Joe Biden is falling apart. You just heard Ben Shapiro say it, falling apart. And there he is riding a bike, out for a bike ride and Fox of all networks is the one who showed it happen.”\n\nDespite writing a book about Biden’s decline, Tapper also previously discredited reports about the former president’s deterioration ahead of the 2024 election. On June 27, Tapper accused Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara, of mocking Biden’s stutter as she suggested that he was suffering from “cognitive decline.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The “paper of record,” the New York Times, didn’t exactly cover itself in glory over the last five years, continuously downplaying the effects of Biden’s age. Even after the release of the infamous Hur report, which showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the former president was woefully unfit for office, the New York Times’s Michelle Goldberg insisted that Biden’s decline was simply a “campaign issue.”\n\nPerhaps the most aggressive and embarrassing regime bootlicking came courtesy of MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. A month after the release of the Hur report, the cable host and former Republican congressman took on both Biden’s detractors and reality itself.\n\n“I’ve said it for years now, he’s cogent,” Scarborough said during a March 2024 broadcast. “But I undersold it when I said he was cogent, he’s far beyond cogent. In fact, I think he’s better than he’s ever been, intellectually, analytically, because he’s been around for 50 years. Start your tape right now because I’m about to tell you the truth. And eff you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever.”\n\nTo anyone with a semi-functional prefrontal cortex, these defenses of the former president sounded insane for several years running, but even the journalists with a superhuman ability to avoid feeling shame couldn’t keep up the act following the June 2024 presidential debate that saw the 46th president end his political career in real time. However, there was no mea culpa, no journalists were fired, and the press pivoted seamlessly from protecting Biden to throwing him under the bus in a foolhardy attempt to hoodwink the electorate into a Kamala Harris presidency.\n\nFormer White House chief propagandist Jen Psaki is now an anchor on MSNBC, Tapper is selling a book that would make the late O.J. Simpson blush, and judging by their fawning coverage of Democrats and unhinged frothing at the mouth over every aspect of President Donald Trump’s second term, it is crystal clear that the journalists have learned absolutely nothing.\n\nI’ll leave you with the words of author and podcaster Michael Malice: “The battle is won when the average American regards a corporate journalist exactly as they regard a tobacco executive.”\n\nBrady Leonard (@bradyleonard) is a musician, political strategist, and host of The No Gimmicks Podcast.","summary":"Corporate journalists doubt your intelligence.

If passed, this could have implications for the 80 million Americans on Medicaid if states don't increase funding.Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, said protecting against these cuts would be a priority if he is elected governor later this year. He is facing several other candidates in the June 10 Democratic primary, with no candidate having a major polling lead four weeks out. Election forecasters consider the general election in November competitive.What To KnowIn a phone interview with Newsweek on Tuesday, Fulop cast himself as the strongest candidate to reform the state government and oppose the policies of President Donald Trump and national Republicans.He said his message on the campaign trail that differentiates him from other candidates includes his plan to use the state's $6.3 billion budget surplus to address these potential Medicaid cuts.\"I speak about drawing down on the state's surplus to offset some of the cuts that would be coming to Medicaid and to the Department of Education,\" he said. \"That way we can make sure that we can get through a crisis situation by using that state surplus different from anybody else.\"Medicaid cuts have drawn criticism from other Democrats running for governor in New Jersey. Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer have opposed GOP budget proposals over concerns about Medicaid cuts. In a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter), Sherrill described the plan as \"devastating for New Jersey families.\"Fulop said his top priorities for New Jersey would also include improving the state of its transit, restructuring the tax code to address affordability and implementing government reforms such as ranked choice voting and reinstating the Open Public Records Act.He predicted that a more \"institutional\" Democrat would be at risk of losing to a Republican in the November general election.\"The talking point from Republicans is going to be 'Four more years of Phil Murphy,'\" he said. \"So I think that we're unique in a situation that we're coming from a place where we're saying, 'Yeah, the Democratic Party in New Jersey has been broken, and we need to rebuild the Democratic Party.'\"Polls suggest that many voters are still undecided about who they'll support in next month's primary. Sherrill has held a consistent yet narrow lead in recent surveys.New Jersey, once a safely Democratic state, shifted toward Republicans in last year's election. Former Vice President Kamala Harris carried it by only about six points, a much closer margin than former President Joe Biden's 16-point win in the state four years earlier.What People Are SayingDan Cassino, professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, previously told Newsweek: \"The Democratic race is a toss-up. It's been very tight between Sherrill, Fulop and Baraka throughout, and it's still tight.\"New Jersey Representative Mikie Sherrill wrote in a February press release: \"Washington Republicans may tell you they are not cutting Medicaid — but don't be fooled. They are cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. And let me be clear about what that actually means: there are nearly two million New Jerseyans — including 800,000 children — who rely on Medicaid for health care coverage. With these cuts, New Jerseyans won't be able to go to the doctor when they are sick, hospitals will close their doors, seniors will lose nursing home care, and Community Health Centers will no longer be able to serve our most vulnerable communities.\"Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also running for governor, posted on X in March: \"We are at a defining moment in this nation.

But as breathtaking as Fall has been in the northeast, Nature is out of balance.\n\n\"People are losing their homes to wildfires, Glacial melting and heavy rains have combined to cause flooding all over the world from Pakistan to the American south watching homes slip off their foundations and float down the river are staples on the evening news.\"\n\nShe added: \"Rising oceans are displacing millions as shorelines erode. The warming oceans temperatures are killing off coral reefs once fish breeding grounds, fishermen can't find fish.\"\n\nThe model also urged her followers to vote \"for candidates who take climate change and our children's future seriously.\"Brinkley has shown her firm stance against Trump in recent years, but their beef goes way back – in 2018, she even alleged he flirted with her while married to his first wife, Ivana.\n\nShe also referred to him as \"swarmy\" and said he was just someone who enjoyed \"chasing skirts.\"","summary":"Christie Brinkley is hitting back at Donald Trump over a recent Executive Order, after slamming his climate policies following the November election.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/christie-brinkley-war-donald-trump-oceans-climate-policies/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/TjFsik3iA/0x0/christie-brinkley-war-donald-trump-oceans-climate-policies-1747157858310.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 19:10:00","author":"Juliane Pettorossi","authors":["Juliane Pettorossi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.113},{"id":320977220,"title":"Joe Biden Didn't Recognize George Clooney at a 2024 Democratic Fundraiser, Book Claims: 'Clooney Was Shaken to His Core'","text":"Did a startling moment at a fundraising event inspire George Clooney to urge Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential election?\n\n That’s one claim made by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson in their upcoming book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, which is based on more than 200 interviews with Democratic insiders.\n\n In an excerpt of the book obtained by the The New Yorker, the authors detail how a star-studded Democratic fundraiser in June 2024 seemingly brought Biden’s mental acuity into serious doubt.\n\n At the exclusive Hollywood event — which was hosted by Clooney and Julia Roberts — “It was obvious to many standing there that the president did not know who George Clooney was,” the excerpt reads, noting that an aide seemed to jog Biden's memory by saying, \"You know George.\"\n\n “Clooney was shaken to his core,\" the excerpt continues. \"The president hadn’t recognized him. A man he had known for years.”\n\n The book, which is set to release on May 20, also includes a reaction from someone who witnessed Biden's apparent memory lapse.\n\n “It was not okay,” the Hollywood VIP told the book's authors. “That thing, the moment where you recognize someone you know — especially a famous person who’s doing a f------ fundraiser for you — it was delayed. It was uncomfortable.”\n\n A month after drumming up support for Biden at the summer fundraiser, Clooney penned an op-ed for The New York Times titled, “I Love Joe Biden, But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\n \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals,” Clooney wrote on July 10, 2024. “In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced.”\n\n However, the two-time Oscar winner noted that \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,” referencing Biden's age, which was a top concern to voters — particularly following his disastrous debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump. \n\n Clooney even referred to the fundraiser as being an eye-opening event, pleading with the then-president to “save democracy” by stepping aside and allowing another candidate to run. \n\n \"It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" Clooney said. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\n Despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ failed bid for the White House in Biden’s place, Clooney has continued to praise the former president for doing “the most selfless thing that anybody has done since George Washington”: stepping aside.\n\n In a statement shared with PEOPLE on May 13, a Biden spokesperson commented on Tapper and Thompson's new allegations in Original Sin about the 2024 Democratic fundraiser, saying, “We have not reviewed the book, and the authors did not fact check the book with us, despite it being a common practice to do so. So we are not going to respond to every bit of this book they choose to release via select leaks in the reporters' efforts to make a profit.\"\n\n The spokesperson added: \"We continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president.”\n\n Clooney's spokesperson declined to comment on the excerpt.\n\n In April, Clooney, 64, sat down with Tapper for an interview on The Lead, in which he opened up about writing the essay.\n\n \"I don't know if it was brave,\" the actor and director admitted. \"It was a civic duty because I found that people on my side of the street — I'm a Democrat, I was a Democrat in Kentucky so I get it.

That's the deal.\"\n\n The Wolfs star added, \"You have to take a stand. If you believe in it, take a stand. Stand for it. Then deal with the consequences.

At least Democrats would have been honest","text":"An avalanche of revelations about just how bad former President Joe Biden’s condition really was in office is upon us, and an early contender for most shocking revelation is that his handlers actually considered putting Grandpa Joe in a wheelchair for his public appearances. This titillating tidbit comes to us from a soon-to-be-released book, \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\" by CNN’s Jake Tapper, who for years nodded along like a bobble head doll to claims Biden was fine and Axios’ Alex Thompson who is celebrated for doing the bare minimum to address concerns over Biden’s fitness. Not exactly Woodward and Bernstein, over here. Still, this morsel of news does raise an interesting question about how Democrats and their media allies approached the 2024 race. Maybe they would have been better off pulling a reverse FDR, putting Biden in a wheelchair, and saying, \"this is still better than Trump.\" BIDEN AIDES ALLEGEDLY FRETTED THEN-PRESIDENT WOULD NEED WHEELCHAIR IF RE-ELECTED, NEW BOOK REVEALS We all understand why the Biden campaign decided to lie about him saying he all but jumps rope in the Oval Office while translating passages from Ovid when in fact they weren’t sure he should even be walking. Frailty is not something most people look for in a commander-in-chief. However, what the Democrats and the media failed to appreciate is that honesty will always play better with voters than obvious lies. The voters I talked to across the country before and after Biden dropped out of the race in July knew full well he was in decline. Even among Democrats, it was an open secret; everyone knew. Nobody bought the idiotic nonsense about verified video footage being cheap fakes, and I mean nobody, at least in the real world, if journalists who credulously reported it really do believe it then that’s even worse. For the 40% of voters who hate Donald Trump like suede hates rain, the lie made no difference at all, they would have voted for the mummified body of President Woodrow Wilson over Trump. BIDEN'S TEAM HID THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS HEALTH ALL ALONG: WH PRESS SEC But many accepted the lie, or claimed to for reasons similar to those stated by the old man in Shakespeare’s Sonnet 138. Speaking of his much younger lover, he wrote: Therefore, I lie with her and she with me, And in our faults by lies we flatter’d be. The problem for Biden and the Democrats in 2024 was the independent voters, who would not just go along with the lie that Biden was fine, but even so were open to the idea he was a better option than Trump. Behind all the winks and nods and bike rides and tales of feats of strength the real argument that Democrats were making, and it was still basically true when Vice President Kamala \"I don’t do interviews\" Harris took over, was that the Party has a team. And that team is better than Trump. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This option was on the table as early as February 2024 when Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov wrote in these pages, \"There’s no need to pretend otherwise: Biden’s old. Just concede it. But there’s a huge education gap when it comes to what he’s actually delivered for the American people and having that knowledge will help us close the chasm being created by fears over his competency.\" Now, there is a wide range of opinion as to just what exactly Joe Biden \"delivered for the American people,\" but Tarlov is right, this is at least an argument that the Biden administration is preferable to Trump that doesn’t require blatant and transparent lying. The only thing worse than being lied to is knowing you are being lied to and that is exactly the position that Biden’s team put Democratic and independent voters in until he exited the race in disgrace. The good news, with regard to both the Democrats and the liberal media, is that this time around we are seeing consequences for obvious lies. A price is being paid, which is the only way anything ever changes. The Democrats’ 2024 loss was humiliating and complete because they didn’t just lose on the issues, they also got caught in the lie. So too, the liberal media can cry all the fake mea culpas they want, but their ratings and relevance are still crumbling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maybe the saddest victim of this lie is Joe Biden himself, who was not allowed to end his long tenure in public service with dignity, but rather was tied to marionette strings making him dance as if he’d found the fountain of youth. Sometimes it takes a while, but as Shakespeare also said, \"in the end the truth will [win] out,\" maybe next time the Democrats will learn this lesson.

Nobody is above the law, they say. Elections have consequences, they insist. Authoritarianism and fascism vis-à-vis President Donald Trump and his administration must be stopped. \n\nBut the party has a funny way of matching its pious rhetoric with action. In 2016, the Democratic National Committee, which is supposed to be neutral in the primary process, decided to do the exact opposite by anointing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and smearing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). \n\nWe know this because of the WikiLeaks email dumps showing then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other DNC leaders lambasting Sanders at every turn. And when those emails went public, the evidence of favoritism was so egregious that Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign during the Democratic National Convention, ironically enough. \n\nFast forward to 2024: President Joe Biden, after a disastrous debate performance on June 27 in which he was lost and confused, faced overwhelming pressure to step down. After he was finally forced out by everyone from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to George Clooney, the party had two choices: \n\n1) Hold a lightning primary and allow voters to decide on the nominee.\n\n2) Simply install then-Vice President Kamala Harris without one vote from the public. The reason? She had $350 million of nontransferable campaign funds at her disposal while others would need to start from scratch. \n\nOption 1 was the pro-democracy route. Option 2 was bought and paid for — and easier to pull off. Democratic leadership chose Option 2, only to run a campaign on “saving democracy.”\n\nAh, the irony. \n\nAnd now, just three months after the DNC chose David Hogg to be its vice chairman, primarily due to his provocative social media posts, he is on his way out. \n\nThe DNC laughably says Hogg is being ousted because of “parliamentary procedures.” Uh-huh. Funny how it took months for the DNC to decide the vote wasn’t carried out properly. \n\nBut of course, anyone sane and sober knows this is all an excuse to get rid of Hogg after he vowed to use millions to primary older incumbent members of Congress from his own party in an effort to bring in “new blood.” \n\n“He is a contemptible little twerp,” former Clinton strategist James Carville declared in April after Hogg’s plan was released. \n\n“The most insane thing I ever heard is that the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee is spending $20 million running against other Democrats. Aren’t we supposed to run against Republicans?” he added rhetorically. \n\nHe wasn’t wrong. And let’s be clear: Hogg was a profoundly horrible choice to begin with. He has called for defunding the police and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He has said that Americans “have no right to own a gun.” He also believes in universal healthcare and “legalizing all drugs.” \n\nThis is not the guy a party sends out to win over centrist Democrats and independents, especially in swing states. But instead of simply showing some spine and asking Hogg to resign, the DNC tried to make this look like a procedural matter more than 90 days after the vote. \n\nThanks to daily national interviews, Hogg had become one of the leading faces of the party along with socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), the aforementioned Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), who mocked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) as “Governor Hot Wheels” and once called for Elon Musk to be “taken out.” \n\nBut the final blow appears to have occurred when Hogg joined Bill Maher on his HBO program Real Time to lay out what the party needs to do to win back young men fleeing the Blue Team. \n\n“Ultimately, what we have to do here is figure out how to bring people back in and work towards the bigger goal of advancing the future of this country,” Hogg said. “Young people should be able to focus on what young people should be focused on, which is how to get laid and how to go and have fun.”\n\nFor the DNC, this apparently was enough. Suddenly, “parliamentary procedure” was broached, and Hogg was effectively shown the door. He’ll stay in his position until a formal vote can be held to determine his replacement, but he’ll be largely neutered. \n\nOr will he? Hogg appears unable to resist attention (hence his unofficial nickname, “Attention Hogg”), and cable news and podcasts will continue to book him as he morphs into the role of martyr-meets-rebel. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been on an absolute roll this past week in terms of action. First came his trade deal with the United Kingdom, and then he surprised the pundits with a negotiated trade deal with China. \n\nThen there were major ceasefires achieved with the Iranian-backed Houthis and one between nuclear powers India and Pakistan. \n\nThe last American hostage to be held in Gaza, Edan Alexander, was freed by Hamas. \n\nDuring the president’s trip to Saudi Arabia, the kingdom announced it would invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States. \n\nAnd the president signed an executive order to cut drug prices drastically, something Democrats have promised to do for years. \n\nAs a result, Trump has seen an 11-point swing upward in polling, according to Rasmussen, in just two weeks. \n\nOn April 28, the president clocked in with 47% approval and 52% disapproval. But on Monday, with markets stabilizing and inflation reaching a four-year low, Trump was at 52% approval and 46% disapproval. \n\nIt’s quite the juxtaposition from the Democratic Party, which remains leaderless and appears to be in complete disarray. \n\nIt’s safe to say that the party can no longer declare with a straight face that it cares about democracy or has any real interest in preserving it. \n\nWe saw it in 2016. We saw it in 2020 when the runway was cleared for Biden to be the nominee despite his already-apparent cognitive decline. And we saw it in 2024 and 2025, when Biden was tossed aside, Harris was installed, and Hogg was essentially removed from the DNC for the audacity of not towing the party line while its approval sits in the 20s. \n\nBIDEN’S COMEBACK TOUR ISN’T HELPING THE DEMOCRATS\n\nThe Washington Post says, “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” \n\nBut let’s face it, the only deaths to democracy we’re seeing are happening in broad daylight.","summary":"&#8220;Democracy is at stake!&#8221;&#160; &#8220;Democracy is on the line!&#8221;&#160; Oh, you&#8217;ve heard this all before from Democrats and their friends in the media: The only thing stopping democracy from dying in darkness are members of the Democratic Party here to protect it.

CRITICS PILE ON BIDEN FOLLOWING ABC INTERVIEW, BLAST HIS REFUSAL TO COMMIT TO COGNITIVE TEST: 'DISQUALIFYING' Plouffe is far from the only one who believes that Biden undercut his own party running again in 2024 as his faculties began to decline.

But a former senior Post editor suggested to Malone that the world’s second wealthiest man is probably not making any big moves without consulting his socialite girlfriend.\n\n“I think Lauren is very influential,” the former senior editor said. “Maybe not in the hands-on decisions throughout the Post, but certainly in the orientation of it.”\n\nIt’s not clear what Sanchez’s politics are, but the former Los Angeles-based entertainment reporter seems to like being at the nexus of attention and power — usually while wearing tops and gowns that showcase her famous décolletage. For this and other reasons, including her much-maligned Blue Origin space ride in April with Katy Perry and Gayle King, the Daily Beast has dubbed her America’s “Marie Antoinette.”\n\nSanchez began an affair with Bezos while she was still married to Patrick Whitesell, a top Hollywood talent agent, and Bezos was still married to Mackenzie Scott, a Princeton-educated novelist and the mother of his four children. The National Enquirer learned about the affair and forced Sanchez and Bezos to go public with their relationship in 2019.\n\nSanchez clearly likes to surround herself with rich and famous friends. Besides such A-List friends as Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry and Eva Longoria. She also has been known to socialize with such prominent MAGA world figures as Ivanka Trump and Bettina Anderson, Donald Trump Jr.’s new socialite girlfriend, according to the New Yorker.\n\nHer connection to Ivanka Trump possibly deepened after she and Bezos purchased their third property on Indian Creek Island, the coveted South Florida gated community that’s known as Billionaire Bunker, where Ivanka lives with her husband Jared Kushner. Sanchez was also with Bezos at the Mar-a-Lago dinner before Christmas when Melania Trump spoke about a documentary she was developing about her own life; two weeks later, Bezos’s Amazon licensed the first lady’s documentary for $40 million, with as much as $28 million going directly to her.\n\nSanchez clearly liked standing with Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech billionaires — the so-called “oligarchs” — at Trump’s inauguration, near Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and other Trump family members. Sanchez also notoriously wore what appeared to be a lacy, white peek-a-boo bra or bustier top — and nothing else — beneath her designer jacket.\n\nThe New Yorker article quotes people who interpret Bezos’s attempts to curry favor with the Trump administration as those of a businessman looking to protect his financial interests during uncertain political times. It also notes that the Post has been struggling financially for the past few years, while top staffers have been “leaving in droves” over frustration about the paper’s seeming lack of direction and the leadership Bezos has put in charge.\n\nMeanwhile, the article also described Bezos as choosing to accompany Sanchez to glitzy events or on luxury European vacations, rather than to be present for the chaos that some of his decisions have unleashed at the Washington Post. During the tumultuous summer before the 2024 election, he and Sanchez island hopped around the Mediterranean aboard his $500 million superyacht, whose prow is graced with a sculpture of a winged goddess thought to resemble Sanchez. \n\nIt’s well known that Bezos and Sanchez flew off to Europe to celebrate Katy Perry’s 40th birthday on the same weekend that the Post was plunged into an existential crisis and had to deal with employee anger and subscriber backlash over his decision to censor the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nIn March, Bezos and Sanchez attended the Vanity Fair Oscars party instead of a gala at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. to celebrate the screening of a new documentary that celebrates Katherine Graham, Bezos’s predecessor at the Post, according to the New Yorker. During Graham’s legendary career as publisher, she oversaw the Post’s coverage of Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal, which helped define the newspaper’s golden era of holding the nation’s most powerful officials to account.\n\nMeanwhile, days before the Kennedy Center screening, Bezos announced another major shift at the paper that was seen as capitulating to Trump and as pursuing a “relationship with a new and potentially dangerous administration,” as Bezos’s media mogul friend Barry Diller acknowledged to the New Yorker.\n\nThe Post’s Opinions section would henceforth feature pieces “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” and “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos said.\n\nThe evening that Bezos announced this new direction, he had dinner with Trump, according to the New Yorker. It’s not known if Sanchez also attended the dinner, as she has in the past. But Trump offered praise for what Bezos is doing at the Post, saying, “Jeff Bezos is trying to do a real job with the Washington Post, and that wasn’t happening before.”\n\nBezos, of course, made himself an enemy of Trump during his first administration because of his ownership of the Post. Among other things, the Post broke the story of Trump’s lewd comment to “Access Hollywood’s” host Billy Bush about grabbing women’s genitals weeks before the 2016 election. Soon after Trump’s first inauguration, the Post débuted its new motto, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” while Trump subsequently became “obsessed” with Amazon and considered using his presidential power to bring an antitrust lawsuit against the company, the New Yorker said, citing a report in Axios.\n\nDuring the early years of Trump’s first administration, Bezos was still married to Scott. He also purchased the largest private home in Washington D.C. for $23 million with the idea that he and Scott would revive “the legacy of Kay Graham and her great socializing — bringing smart, smart, interesting people together in a social context,” the Washingtonian magazine reported.\n\nBut by the time the house “made its debut” in January 2020, Bezos had a new muscle-bound physique and a new life partner, as the New Yorker reported. His co-host for the black-tie party that night wasn’t Scott but Sanchez, and the guests included Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and other notable figures from Trump’s first administration, such as White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.\n\nWith the start of Trump’s second administration, it remains to be seen whether Bezos and Sanchez will start up a new tradition of hosting gatherings at their D.C. mansion, with guests including a new cohort of Trump administration officials. Of course, Bezos and Sanchez are probably busy right now gearing up for their lavish Italian wedding in June. If you believe British tabloids like the Daily Mail and The Sun, Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are on the guest list.","summary":"Sanchez's famous friends include celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry and MAGA figures like Ivanka Trump and Bettina Anderson.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/13/lauren-sanchez-very-influential-bezos-washington-post-report/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LaurenSanchez.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 17:10:40","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.456},{"id":320913318,"title":"New Jersey Governor Race Update: What Polls Say Four Weeks Ahead of Primary","text":"New Jersey voters are four weeks away from making their pick in the state's gubernatorial primary election on June 10, 2025. Polls suggest that while one Republican candidate may have a lead, Democrats appear more divided about who they are supporting.Newsweek reached out to each campaign for comment.Why It MattersNew Jersey's governor race in November will be important for both major political parties. For Republicans, the race will be an early test of President Donald Trump's popularity ahead of the 2026 midterms, when they could find themselves on defense in key Congressional elections.For Democrats, the race may reveal whether they are winning back key voter groups that shifted toward Republicans in the 2024 election. Trump made inroads with young voters and Hispanic voters, culminating in a rightward shift in the Garden State. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the state by fewer than 6 percentage points, compared to former President Joe Biden's nearly 16 point victory there four years earlier.What To KnowOn the Democratic side, Representative Mikie Sherrill has held the lead in polls, but it is narrow in a race with a large number of undecided voters as other candidates move in hopes of breaking through in the final stretch of the campaign.The latest independent poll of the race, conducted by Rutgers University, found that 17 percent of voters were leaning toward Sherrill. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop placed second, with 12 percent, while former Montclair Mayor and President of the New Jersey Education Association Sean Spiller placed third with 10 percent.Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who last week was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly trespassing at a detention center, and Representative Josh Gottheimer each had the backing of 9 percent of respondents. Former New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney had the support of 7 percent. Thirty-two percent of respondents said they were unsure who they planned to cast their ballot for.The poll surveyed 966 registered from April 1 to April 10, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.The New Jersey Globe on Tuesday reported that a Baraka internal poll showed him trailing Sherrill by 4 points. While 20.7 percent said they were leaning toward Sherrill, 16.5 percent were supporting Baraka and 12.9 percent planned to back Fulop. That MDW Communications poll surveyed 1,100 New Jersey residents from May 11 to May 13. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.When reached by Newsweek, Gottheimer's campaign pointed to an internal poll that showed him as the second-highest candidate, following Sherrill's 19 percent support with 15 percent support. The Global Strategy Group poll surveyed 900 likely voters from April 1 to April 3 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.On the Republican side, former State Representative Jack Ciattarelli has carved out a lead. The Rutgers poll showed him leading other Republicans with 42 percent of the vote, while conservative talk radio host Bill Spadea placed second with 12 percent.\nAn Emerson College poll, which surveyed 334 Republicans from January 18 to January 21, 2025, showed 26 percent of Republicans leaning toward Ciattarelli and 13 percent planning to back Spadea. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.Ciattarelli was the party's gubernatorial nominee in 2021, when he lost by about three points to Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli's campaign on Monday, writing in a Truth Social post he is \"the Republican Candidate who is best positioned to STAND TALL against the Radical Left Democrats and, most importantly, ensure a Big Victory in this Very Important Gubernatorial Election.\"What People Are SayingSweeney's Press Secretary Kerry Lyons told Newsweek: \"No candidate in this race understands New Jersey like Steve Sweeney, and he is putting forward plans that address the issues that matter most to seniors, working- and middle-class New Jerseyan families, and students and educators. Steve is well positioned to win, and the polls aren't capturing what we are seeing on the ground. We have a robust VBM operation, we're working closely with our labor partners to organize, and Steve is meeting voters all across the state every single day — and he's not taking a single voter for granted.\"Ashley Koning, director of the Rutgers poll, wrote in a press release: \"All of the candidates have made some progress since the fall in terms of voters knowing who they are, but they haven't made noticeable gains in favorability. Though not necessarily unusual at this stage in the game, candidates on both sides of the aisle still lack name recognition from a notable number of voters, and no candidate on either side of the aisle is viewed favorably by more than one in five voters.\"Fulop wrote in a Facebook post in April: \"Some advice - disregard internal polls (including mine) as there always is a discussion and an agenda when released (that's the truth). Here is what is 100% also true - per below this campaign will change meaningfully in the next 8 weeks ways that nobody can predict. It is tight.\"What Happens NextAfter the June 10 primary, voters will head to the polls for the general election on November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report currently classifies the race as leaning Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive\" but Democrats have an \"advantage.\"","summary":"New Jersey voters will cast their votes in the June 10 primary ahead of the competitive November election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/new-jersey-governor-race-polls-primary-2071612","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2643589/new-jersey-governor-race-polls.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 16:11:09","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":320942316,"title":"‘Really Stupid’: James Carville Runs Through List Of Words Dems Need To Ditch","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville on Tuesday urged Democrats to stop using a slew of left-wing words and phrases he said are ineffective, confusing or alienating to voters.\n\nCarville, on an April episode of his “Politics War Room” podcast, condemned the phrases “communities of color” and “people of color,” arguing they were “racist” because they suggest all minorities are identical rather than unique. In a Tuesday Politicon video, Carville did not mention these phrases, but rattled off several more terms he believes Democrats should avoid using in political messaging, explaining why they are problematic. (RELATED: Democrats Spiral Into Civil War Over How To Resist Trump, Lashing Out At Their Own Voters)\n\n“Don’t use ‘generational change,’ because there’s a lot of people that are older — me being one. Why do you want to limit the appeal of your message to younger people? … Don’t use words like ‘structural,’ okay? Because we’re not going to attack the structural issues in the world right now,” Carville said. “We’re trying to, like, stay alive to the next day. Don’t use the word ‘equity.’ Use ‘equality’ to your little heart’s desire. People basically don’t know what it means, and if they do know what it means, it looks like you tried to force an outcome.”\n\nThen-vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris received backlash on Twitter after posting a Nov. 1, 2020, video making the case for “equity,” meaning equality of results, rather than ensuring that everyone has equality of opportunity. Twitter users suggested the video seemed to promote communism.\n\nCarville also took aim at the term “oligarch,” which has risen to prominence since independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in February, often featuring Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n“This is another really stupid word: ‘oligarch.’ Who in the fuck knows what an oligarch is, okay? As opposed to a very acceptable word I’ve talked about before is ‘fat cats,'” the Democratic strategist said. “[Everybody] knows what a fat cat is. Everybody talks about what a fat cat is.”\n\nMoreover, Carville suggested not saying “community.”\n\n“Nothing wrong with the word ‘community’ [and] nothing wrong with being in a community. But it’s just such a Democratic word. And really, the community we all live in is the community of humankind,” he said. “And it’s not a terrible word. I wouldn’t even use the ‘LBGQT+’ or whatever it is. I just call people gay, the lesbian or trans … Just use the word that is most commonly used among people as they talk to each other.”\n\nCarville said people don’t understand the acronym and that the use of it indicates people are “trying to signal that there’s something wrong with the term or you’re just trying to show people how smart you are.”\n\n“So don’t use words like that. Don’t use words like ‘intersectionality,'” he said.\n\nCarville recounted listening to an NPR panel discuss the term during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I literally thought they would kind of go overboard in ecstasy on the radio … No one uses the term ‘intersectionality’ except for NPR,” he said.\n\n“We’re going to have limited time to make our case. When we have whatever limited time we have, and we’re fighting back at all this, I think we should be very careful … So when you hear your elected representatives and you hear Democrats or you hear sane people using words that are not the right word, let them know that that kind of language is not helpful,” Carville added. “It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person — it’s just not helpful.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Josh Shapiro when he raised concerns about the state of her husband’s re-election campaign, according to a bombshell new book about the attempt to cover up former President Joe Biden’s decline while in office.\n\nThe Bidens met with Shapiro for a private conversation in Harrisburg on July 7, 2024, days after the incumbent’s catastrophic debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the account in “Original Sin,” co-authored by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper.\n\nAt one point, Biden asked Shapiro “How do you think it’s going out there?” in reference to the campaign. In response, Thompson and Tapper wrote, the governor “decided to give it to him straight.”\n\n“I’ll be honest, Mr. President, I have some concerns,” Shapiro said, pointing to polling that showed “a rapid erosion of support for the president in must-win Pennsylvania within the previous few days.\n\n“He didn’t think the campaign sufficiently acknowledged the pain inflation was causing,” Thompson and Tapper wrote. “And while the president needed to prove the debate had been an aberration, for some reason he hadn’t yet done so.”\n\nAccording to Shapiro, the president tried to address some of the governor’s concerns. But before he could do so in full, Jill Biden gave what the authors called “a clear signal that the conversation was over.”\n\n“Alright,” the first lady said, standing up. “We gotta go.”\n\nAs the first couple pulled away, Shapiro told the authors that he thought the Bidens “didn’t want to hear the facts on the ground.”\n\nExactly two weeks later, Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

However, “Bezos felt a sense of betrayal” after the Biden administration sued Bezos’ cash cow Amazon in 2023 for illegally maintaining monopoly power. \n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 election and in the first months of the second Trump administration, Bezos made a number of moves at the paper that raised the ire of Post staffers and its readers, who took the outlet’s “Democracy Dies in Darkness” motto to heart. \n\nNotoriously, the owner’s last-minute decision to block the editorial board’s endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president led to hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions and the resignations of several board members. Bezos’ mandate that the opinion section only concentrate on free market principles and personal liberties left staffers outraged and prompted the opinion editor to quit. Meanwhile, there has been a steady exodus of talent over the past few months, many of whom have jumped ship to The Atlantic.\n\nThough Bezos and Lewis have implemented these changes while insisting the staff “needs to be disciplined,” both leaders of the paper have largely been missing in action despite calls from employees for meetings. Lewis’ leadership, or lack thereof, has been cited as a key reason why many reporters and editors have left.\n\n“In exit interviews, meanwhile, staff members have attributed their departures to Lewis’s lack of a discernible plan for the paper,” Malone pointed out.\n\n“The idea that the newsroom is the reason for the Post’s struggles is unfair,” a former editor told the New Yorker. “The newsroom is not always its own best friend, but Will somehow convinced Jeff that it is the problem, when really there is no business strategy.”\n\nLewis has also apparently had a falling out with the paper’s executive editor Matt Murray, the former Wall Street Journal editor who was initially supposed to just temporarily replace Sally Buzbee but was permanently given the role when no other candidates took the offer. Much of his anger with Murray, according to Malone, is due to the paper’s coverage of Lewis’ scandal-plagued tenures at both the Post and the British tabloids.\n\n“I know Will [Lewis] was very upset with Matt [Murray] for the Post’s coverage and for some period of time wouldn‘t talk to Matt,” a former senior editor said. Both Murray and Lewis denied this to Malone, but in the end, Murray did institute a policy discouraging reporters from covering the paper itself.\n\n“Since last June, Lewis has gone into what a number of Post staffers described as a state of hiding,” Malone added. “Rumors began circulating about Lewis drinking heavily in social settings. ‘One thing that has damaged him internally is that his drinking is widely known in the newsroom,’ the former senior editor said. ‘It’s literally something his employees joke about.’ (Lewis declined multiple requests to speak with reporters.)”\n\nThe New Yorker additionally noted that during his time at the Telegraph, Lewis had a “a clique of mannish guys” and a “reputation for hard drinking.” While the Guardian reported at the time that “no one has ever seen him drunk” or late for work, he picked up the nickname “Thirsty” Will Lewis.\n\n “A person who has known Lewis for decades described him to me as a ‘wide boy’—British slang for someone who survives by his wits, often on the wrong side of right,” an associate of Lewis’ told Malone.\n\nLewis’ absence at a number of staff-wide events has been notable, such as the recent Pulitzer Prize celebrations for the paper and a screening party for a documentary on the Post’s legendary publisher Katharine Graham. Murray and Bezos also skipped the documentary screening.\n\nIn fact, Bezos has been incredibly hard to reach for the Post’s leadership team. When the opinion editors attempted to set up an opportunity to talk with the billionaire in August, Lewis told them that “Bezos's schedule was full until late September.” Despite other requests from staff, and Bezos’ edicts demanding change in coverage, the owner hasn’t visited the paper since before the election.\n\nA Post spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"‘Since last June, Lewis has gone into what a number of Post staffers described as a state of hiding,’ the New Yorker reported this week, adding that Will Lewis appears to have also had a falling out with his executive editor","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/washington-post-ceo-will-lewis-drinking-b2750183.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/21/14/Media-Washington_Post-Publisher_57132.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 15:53:13","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":320958348,"title":"How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump","text":"His pollsters told us that no such polls existed. There was no credible data, they said, to support the notion that he would have won. All unspun information suggested it would have been a loss, likely a spectacular one, far worse than that suffered by his replacement as the Democratic nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris.\nThe disconnect between Biden’s optimism and the unhappy reality of poll results was a constant throughout his Administration. Many insiders sensed that his inner circle shielded him from bad news. It’s also true that, for Biden to absorb those poll results, he would have had to face the biggest issue driving them: the public had concluded—long before most Democratic officials, media, and other “élites” had—that he was far too old to do the job.\n“We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,” David Plouffe, who helped run the Harris campaign, told us. Plouffe had served as Senator Barack Obama’s Presidential campaign manager in 2008 and as a senior adviser to President Obama before largely retiring from politics in 2013. After Biden dropped out of the race, on July 21, 2024, Plouffe was drafted to help Harris in what he saw as a “rescue mission.” Harris, he said, was a “great soldier,” but the compressed hundred-and-seven-day race was “a fucking nightmare.”\n“And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe said. By deciding to run for reëlection and then waiting more than three weeks after the debate to bow out, Plouffe added, “He totally fucked us.”\nThe real issue wasn’t his age, per se. It was the clear limitations of his abilities, which got worse throughout his Presidency. What the public saw of his functioning was concerning. What was going on in private was worse. While Biden on a day-in, day-out basis could certainly make decisions and assert wisdom and act as President, there were several significant issues that complicated his Presidency: a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function and an increasing number of moments when he seemed to freeze up, lose his train of thought, forget the names of top aides, or momentarily not remember friends he’d known for decades. Not to mention impairments to his ability to communicate—ones unrelated to his lifelong stutter.\nIt wasn’t a straight line of decline; he had good days and bad. But, until the last day of his Presidency, Biden and those closest to him refused to admit the reality that his energy, cognitive skills, and communication capacity had faltered considerably. Even worse, through various means, they tried to hide it. And then came the June 27th debate against Trump, when Biden’s decline was laid bare before the world. As a result, Democrats stumbled into the fall of 2024 with an untested nominee and growing public mistrust of a White House that had been gaslighting the American people.\n“It was an abomination,” one prominent Democratic strategist—who publicly defended Biden—told us. “He stole an election from the Democratic Party. He stole it from the American people.” Biden had framed his entire Presidency as a pitched battle to prevent Trump from returning to the Oval Office. By not relinquishing power and refusing to be honest with himself and the country about his decline, he guaranteed it.\nFresh off winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Syriana,” in 2006, Clooney began reading reports that government-aligned forces under Sudan’s President, Omar al-Bashir, were killing innocent civilians in the Darfur region of the country. It felt like a calling. He sought to travel there with a national TV network, but conditions grew so dangerous that the journalists dropped out. George and his father, Nick, a former TV anchorman who was then seventy-two, flew to southern Sudan in April, 2006, and sneaked into Darfur with a camera crew. After battling nine days of brutal heat, zero security, and rough nights in mud huts, the Clooneys returned to the U.S. in time for a rally organized by the Save Darfur Coalition on the National Mall, where other speakers included then Senator Barack Obama. A few months later, Clooney testified before the U.N. Security Council, and the next year the Clooneys released their documentary, “A Journey to Darfur.” He skipped the Oscars in 2009 to meet with President Obama and Vice-President Biden, delivering two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand signed Save Darfur postcards to them and pushing for a full-time envoy to the region.\nBy the time the 2024 Presidential race had begun, the actor had known Biden for decades and had known him well for fifteen years. He had last seen Biden on December 4, 2022, when Clooney was in D.C. with his wife, Amal, to be celebrated at the Kennedy Center Honors. Biden looked older, sure, but in the East Room of the White House, at the reception for the honorees, the President was playful and seemed cogent enough.\n“We see Amal Clooney’s husband,” the President said, to laughter.\nYes, he was reading from prepared remarks, but far be it from an actor to take issue with someone reciting lines.\n“Mentors—he mentors these—those historic kids from Parkland on their march and their lives—against gun violence,” Biden said, stumbling a bit. “I met with every one of those kids, and they really appreciate what you did, George. Not a joke.”\nIn February, 2024, Clooney had thought the special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which called Biden an “elderly man with a poor memory,” mean-spirited. And, when Biden gave a rousing State of the Union address in March, Clooney thought, Way to go, Mr. President. He had helped him get elected in 2020 and was happy to do so again.\nKatzenberg had known Biden since the late nineteen-eighties and was on board with his Presidential run as early as October, 2018, when he hosted a meet and greet for the former Vice-President at his Wilshire office, after which the two men dined at Madeo, in West Hollywood. Katzenberg told him that he would support Biden’s campaign, that he thought him best positioned to beat Trump. I don’t want anything from you, he told Biden. I might be the only one who doesn’t. I just want you to win.\nBiden did, in 2020, and in the process Katzenberg became more than a donor. As 2024 approached, he saw Biden’s communication struggles and thought he could help fix them. He worked on providing better lighting for Biden and trying to find a microphone that would amplify Biden when he would break into a whisper for emphasis. Katzenberg also recruited his friend Steven Spielberg, who helped coach Biden for the State of the Union and his debates, even assisting with routine campaign videos. There was, however, only so much that Hollywood magic could do.\nWhen it came time for the reëlection campaign, Katzenberg worked on a spectacularly successful March fund-raiser, held at Radio City Music Hall, featuring Obama, Biden, and Bill Clinton. It raised twenty-six million dollars—according to the campaign, the most ever raised at a single event for a Democratic Presidential candidate. In the spring, he and top campaign aides discussed when they could bring Biden out to California. Katzenberg told the campaign that he wanted to try to hit another record number.\nKatzenberg and Clooney were pals, and they had a long, successful track record of doing these events: they had broken records for Obama with a nearly fifteen-million-dollar event at Clooney’s Studio City home, in May, 2012; organized two events for Hillary Clinton, in 2016; and raked in more than seven million dollars with a July, 2020, Zoom fund-raiser in which Obama stumped for Biden.\nOn a rainy Easter at his home in the South of France, on the last day of March in 2024, Clooney heard from Katzenberg, who made his ask—a fund-raiser in June. Katzenberg had learned over the years that there was a cadence in terms of how many times a campaign could ask people for money. He thought that the Biden team could get another bite at the apple in the summer and then one last one on the other side of Labor Day. But Clooney was going to be in London and Tuscany in June, working with the filmmaker Noah Baumbach on “Jay Kelly,” a coming-of-age film that Baumbach had co-written with Emily Mortimer. It was a big project for Netflix, involving Clooney, Adam Sandler, and Laura Dern.\nClooney looked at his calendar. There was one possible window: Saturday, June 15th. It would be brutal, though. He’d need to fly into Los Angeles from Tuscany, do the event, and leave that same night for Rome, before the fund-raiser was even over.\n“I can do one night,” Clooney told Katzenberg.\n“Great,” Katzenberg said.\n“Let’s call Julia and see if she’ll do it with me,” Clooney said, referring to Julia Roberts.\nHe texted her immediately. Katzenberg had headed Disney when Roberts was cast in the role that made her a superstar, in “Pretty Woman.” He reached out to her, too.\nCoördinating it all was wildly complicated. Roberts was starting production on a film—“After the Hunt,” with Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, and Chloë Sevigny—and also needed to get on a plane before the fund-raiser ended.\nNot to mention the President’s schedule. From June 13th to 14th, Biden was going to be in Italy for the G-7, right after honoring Allied veterans in France for the eightieth anniversary of D Day, in between which he’d be at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, while his son Hunter faced prosecution for a gun charge. They looked at six different ways to move things around, but everyone ultimately agreed on June 15th. Jimmy Kimmel would interview Biden and Barack Obama onstage. All Clooney and Roberts needed to do was pose for photos with the big donors before the event, then open the show. Afterward, they could fly to their sets, and, God willing, another fund-raising record would be set.\nBefore Kimmel, Obama, and Biden hit the stage to toss bons mots back and forth in a cozy Q. & A., there was a series of private receptions, called clutches, plus photo lines and free-flowing booze and hors d’œuvres. Clooney and Roberts were doing the work of charming the attendees and posing for pictures when they heard the crowd starting to murmur. Clooney looked to the side and saw Obama walking in, grayer but still spry and electric. A few minutes later, Secret Service agents entered the room and announced that President Biden had arrived.\nBiden hobbled out from around the corner. Clooney knew that the President had just arrived from the G-7 leaders’ summit in Apulia, Italy, that morning and might be tired, but, holy shit, he wasn’t expecting this.\nThe President appeared severely diminished, as if he’d aged a decade since Clooney last saw him, in December, 2022. He was taking tiny steps, and an aide seemed to be guiding him by the arm.\n“It was like watching someone who was not alive,” a Hollywood V.I.P. recalled. “It was startling. And we all looked at each other. It was so awful.”\n“Thank you for being here,” the President said to guests as he shuffled past them. “Thank you for being here.” Clooney felt a knot form in his stomach as the President approached him. Biden looked at him. “Thank you for being here,” he said. “Thank you for being here.”\n“You know George,” the assisting aide told the President, gently reminding him who was in front of him. “Yeah, yeah,” the President said to one of the most recognizable men in the world, the host of this lucrative fund-raiser. “Thank you for being here.”\n“Hi, Mr. President,” Clooney said.\n“How are ya?” the President replied.\n“How was your trip?” Clooney asked.\n“It was fine,” the President said.\nIt seemed clear that the President had not recognized Clooney.\n“It was not O.K.,” recalled the Hollywood V.I.P. who had witnessed this moment. “That thing, the moment where you recognize someone you know—especially a famous person who’s doing a fucking fund-raiser for you—it was delayed. It was uncomfortable.”\n“George Clooney,” the aide clarified for the President.\n“Oh, yeah!” Biden said. “Hi, George!”\nClooney was shaken to his core. The President hadn’t recognized him, a man he had known for years. Clooney had expressed concern about Biden’s health before—a White House aide had told him a few months before that they were working on getting the President to take longer steps when he walked—but obviously the problem went far beyond his gait. This was much graver.\nThis was the President of the United States?\nClooney was certainly not the only one concerned. Other high-dollar attendees who posed for photographs with Obama and Biden described Biden as slow and almost catatonic. Though they saw pockets of clarity while watching him on television, and onstage later that night, there were obvious brain freezes and clear signs of a mental slide. It was, to some of them, terrifying.\nObama didn’t know what to make of how his former running mate was acting. At one point, in a small group of a few dozen top donors, Biden began speaking—barely audibly—and trailed off incoherently. Obama had to jump in and preside. At other moments, during photos, Obama would hop in and finish sentences for him.\nThe former President decided that the fault lay with Biden’s busy schedule. The man was eighty-one, and he had gone from France, to Delaware, then Italy, and then to California in just ten days. The time zones were difficult enough, but this was a rough itinerary. Obama put it down to a bad scheduling decision by Biden and his staff.\nHow Biden handled his time was a consistent theme in Obama’s conversations with him; he was a bit protective of his former running mate. “Why are you doing ten hours of a photo line at the holiday party?” Obama would ask him.\nBut Obama would come to realize that scheduling was not the fundamental problem.\nThe first was on November 30, 2022, when he, Emily, their son Charlie, and Emily’s parents, Marnie and Tim Black, visited the White House. Favreau, now one of the hosts of the political podcast “Pod Save America,” first had to record an interview with Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, and when he joined his family in his old office, he was delighted to find Biden there charming them all. Stunningly, Biden had recognized Marnie from an event in California several years before and said so as he regaled them with stories infused by his garrulous Irish pol demeanor. The President invited everyone up to the Oval Office, where he was as sharp as ever. To Emily’s dad, a federal judge, he offered a detailed recounting of the failed confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. Favreau was a bit disturbed by Biden’s staff’s willingness to indulge his windbaggy nature in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon. They seemed a little too eager to let him waste time in the midst of a crisis: a major railway strike.\nThe second encounter came a year and a half later, on Friday night, April 26, 2024, the evening before the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Favreau was among the “influencers” invited to visit with the President at the White House, as were two of his co-hosts, Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett.\nThat night, to Favreau, Biden seemed to have aged fifty years in sixteen months. He was incoherent. His stories were meandering and confusing. Something about Iraq? What, exactly, was the point of this? He told one story twice. After the President left the group, Favreau asked a staffer about his demeanor. Oh, no big deal, the staffer said. The President must have just been tired. It was nighttime at the end of a long week.\nBiden seemed O.K. the next night at the dinner, capably reading from a teleprompter and projecting as aged but present. But Lovett, Pfeiffer, Favreau, and Emily left the White House that weekend deeply disturbed. And now here they were at the biggest fund-raiser in the history of the Democratic Party. Yes, Biden would be helped by the presence of the younger, more charismatic Obama and Kimmel onstage with him. But they could only hide so much.\nThe Favreaus weren’t ponying up five hundred thousand dollars for the meet and greet at the Peacock Theatre; they would just sit in the audience and watch the show. And hope. And pray.\nSome attendees later expressed concern about how Biden seemed onstage. The event was just half an hour or so, and the questions were friendly. Many in the audience were surprised by the President’s apparent diminishment, his quiet and frail presentation, his inability to develop a strong, convincing sales pitch. Some of his answers were downright confusing.\nWhen the event ended, the three men stood. Obama began to walk offstage, but Biden walked to the edge and, after waving and giving a thumbs up, stopped and stared blankly into the crowd. Obama turned back and grabbed Biden’s arm, then guided him backstage. He later explained that he just wanted to get the hell out of there, but he didn’t want to leave Biden alone up on the stage. Biden folks insisted that the President was just basking in the glow of a supportive audience, and they called clips of the moment “cheap fakes,” a term for video content that has been deceptively edited or taken out of context. But even some supporters present in the arena wondered what was going on.\nHe doesn’t look like he knows where he’s supposed to go, thought the New Hampshire Democratic congresswoman Annie Kuster, sitting in the audience with the California congresswoman Julia Brownley. They’d seen him in the photo line, and Kuster could tell it was a struggle for the President to engage. It reminded her of being with an aging grandparent, worryingly thinking, Oh, my gosh, what’s going to happen next?\nIn the audience, Emily Favreau couldn’t believe how awful Biden seemed. “I wanted to make everyone stay in this theatre and say, ‘No one is going anywhere until we have a plan, because this can’t be it,’ ” Emily, a longtime communications consultant, said. To her, it had been a complete disaster. And she hadn’t even seen what happened backstage.\nKuster had already reached the conclusion that there was no scenario in which Biden would be reëlected. She turned to Brownley. “We can’t go out there and campaign for ‘four more years,’ ” she said. “That’s just not tenable.”\nSometimes the President would call him and, after some chit chat, admit that he’d forgotten why he’d called. Sometimes he rambled. Sometimes he forgot names. Schumer wasn’t concerned about Biden’s acuity, but he was worried about the optics. Biden talked sluggishly—his voice was not just slower but oddly quieter, reminding Schumer of his mother, who had Parkinson’s. His gait was slower. Schumer was concerned about the President’s electability. He talked about it with his staff, but he felt that he had to keep a close circle. If he talked about his worries with Obama or Hakeem Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi and it got out that they were discussing whether Biden was too old to run, that would make it even harder for him to win.\nAt the wedding, Schumer was discussing his concerns and the fact that the debate was so early—just twelve days away. “If things go south at the debate, it might change things,” Schumer later recalled having said. The early date gave Democrats some time.\nAnother wedding guest, who sat at Schumer’s table, recalled him saying, “If things go south at the debate, me, Barack, Nancy, and Hakeem have a Plan B,” though Schumer would later deny it.\nBut then the debate confirmed all the fears that he’d shoved aside. Biden struggled to find the words he needed to communicate. He made guttural sounds. His slack-jawed expressions suggested that he wasn’t even aware that he was on camera for the entire ninety minutes. “Look,” he said at one point, and then trailed off, before concluding, “We finally beat Medicare.”\nSo many governors, senators, members of Congress, fund-raisers, and activists were now reaching out to Clooney—it was all anyone could talk about. What a disaster! Biden needed to take himself off the ticket.\nSenator Joe Manchin reached Clooney through a mutual acquaintance. He felt that Biden, his friend of decades, had lost the will to fight. He told Clooney that a number of Democratic senators he’d spoken to were planning to confront Biden, to try to convince him to step aside. Manchin personally hoped that they wouldn’t until after the NATO summit that month—“No need to show our ass to the world,” he said. For whatever reason, no such meeting happened. Clooney held out hope that Democratic governors would address the matter with Biden instead. But the readout he got on a White House meeting with the governors suggested that no one had stepped up and told the President the truth. Then, on July 8th, Biden released a letter as a last-ditch effort to end the crusade to push him out.\nThe letter shocked Clooney. Despite the herculean efforts that the Democratic machine had made to shut down any sort of real contest, Biden cast his position as that of a true exercise in democracy, having “received over 14 million votes, 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process.”\n“This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run,” he wrote, which was not really true. “Only three people chose to challenge me.” Of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Biden wrote that he “fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent.” Of Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, the President said that he “attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.”\nThis was too much for Clooney. He reached out to Obama to tell him that he was considering writing an op-ed to call for Biden to drop out. Obama advised that doing so would only make Biden dig in deeper.\nIn his home office in the South of France, Clooney sat down at his laptop. “I love Joe Biden,” Clooney wrote. “As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced.”\nBut, Clooney added, “the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.”\nClooney got down to the point: “We are not going to win in November with this president. . . . This is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.”\nHe wanted some sort of process for a new nominee. “Let’s hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let’s agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.” He attempted to end the op-ed with a note that was both empathetic and firm: “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.”\nClooney sent a copy to Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him to show one of Biden’s closest advisers, Steve Ricchetti.\nRicchetti read it and was furious. Internally, he threatened to shut Clooney down—some of his colleagues thought he sounded like a Mob boss.\nWord came back that Ricchetti suggested it would be better if Clooney held it a week.\nKatzenberg did not agree with Clooney’s assessment. Biden had been jet-lagged, and Katzenberg had been told that the President didn’t sleep well on flights, even in the bedroom aboard Air Force One. So the President had got only four or five hours of sleep. Biden was one of those people who needed the full eight hours every night. Even just seven hours wouldn’t cut it.\nYes, Biden had gone into that disconcerting whisper mode among that one clutch. Katzenberg still didn’t understand why he had done that. But what he had said was perfectly fine. Yes, it paled in comparison with Obama’s eloquence and elegance—but that had always been the case.\nKatzenberg told Clooney that he was skeptical the op-ed would achieve its desired effect. He also thought it was kicking a good man when he was clearly down. He felt the op-ed was harsh and premature.\n“I was there for the fund-raiser,” Katzenberg told his friend. “You left early. You never saw him onstage.”\n“Yeah, but I saw him in the clutch,” Clooney said, “and I was stunned by what I saw.”\nKatzenberg knew how difficult it is for a person of some achievement—Rupert Murdoch, Michael Eisner—to step down. He’d seen it close up. Hell, it had happened to him with the sale of DreamWorks Animation, in 2016.\nYour process is not the correct one to get the end that you desire, he told Clooney. He really wanted Clooney to cut the line about the befogged Biden at the fund-raiser being “the same man we all witnessed at the debate.”\nIt’s not fair, what you’re saying, Katzenberg said.\nYou’re right, it’s not fair, Clooney agreed. Aging is awful. It really isn’t fair.\nBut, Clooney said, what he had written was accurate.\nClooney’s op-ed—“I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee”—was published by the New York Times on July 10th. The line Katzenberg had objected to stayed in. It sent shock waves throughout the political world.\nThe play focusses on Murrow’s reporting on the campaign by the Republican senator Joseph McCarthy, of Wisconsin, to smear various Americans with charges of Communism and disloyalty. Despite the obvious resonance with current headlines, the drama remains firmly planted in the nineteen-fifties, except for one moment at the very end. Clooney delivers some of Murrow’s famed 1958 speech “Wires and Lights in a Box,” warning that television “can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and even it can inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends.”\nWhat follows is a montage of television clips suggesting the medium’s evolution—or devolution—since Murrow gave that speech, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, to the carnival of humanity of “The Jerry Springer Show,” to recent ignominious moments from cable TV, including conservatives spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and Democrats vouching for President Biden’s acuity.\nAsked about the fund-raiser and what followed, a Biden spokesperson said, “No one has been able to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite—he was a very effective president. Evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.” But at the Winter Garden Theatre one breezy April afternoon, Clooney said it was important to him and his team to include what he saw as misleading testimonials about Biden. “We had to do it,” he said, to underline the importance of speaking truth to power no matter which party currently rules.\nAlso, he acknowledged, lies serve as an important reminder for anyone in the audience upset about the current state of affairs. Democrats deceived the country about Biden’s abilities and, Clooney said, “that’s how Trump won.” ♦\nThis is drawn from “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.”","summary":"At a fateful event last summer, Barack Obama, George Clooney, and others were stunned by Biden’s weakness and confusion.

Crockett appeared on The Chuck ToddCast with ex-NBC News host Chuck Todd, who asked the Democratic lawmaker if Black male voters were hesitant to vote for a woman. Harris served as a district attorney for San Francisco as well as California Attorney General before launching a bid for the Senate and ultimately serving as vice president. The former VP faced criticism from both sides of the political aisle over her prosecution record. \"I definitely think that there was misogyny in this across the board no matter what color male you're talking about. I just think that you'd be in error to not like know that there was misogyny that existed,\" she said. \"The very first polling briefing that we had, with a pollster that I trust a lot, he briefed the Black caucus, and he said that one of the issues that he was running into with Black and Brown communities was that she had been a prosecutor.\" BLACK GROUP FIRES BACK AT OBAMA FOR ‘INSULTING’ HARRIS PITCH: 'WORST KIND OF IDENTITY POLITICS' \"There was definitely some resume stuff that disallowed her from being able to build the type of rapport of trust within these marginalized communities that historically have been targeted,\" she said. Crockett told Todd that she was given guidance to lean into Harris' background as a prosecutor, which she believed was not going to be helpful. \"When I did it, I did a bit of a swing on it, right, as a criminal defense attorney, and I explained like this is the kind of prosecutor we all would have wanted, right?

They lead in different roles and realms (World)","text":"The motto of one newly elected American world leader: \" Fight! \" The other introduced himself to the world with his first public word as pope: “ Peace.\"\n\nThe contrast between President Donald Trump and Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV couldn't be more stark — politically, personally or in their world views. They lead in different roles and realms.\n\nBut Leo's historic election last week to lead the world's 1.4 billion Catholics as the first U.S.-born pope means that the two most powerful people on the planet are Americans. That raises questions about American influence at a time when Trump's tariff wars and “one way or the other” threats have upended eight decades of global order and sparked distrust among allies toward the United States.\n\nThe prospect of too much American power in geopolitics is widely considered one reason that the Catholic Church had not elected an American to the papacy across the country's nearly 250-year history. Until, that is, the former Cardinal Robert F. Prevost of Chicago — Pope Leo XIV — was chosen last week to be the 267th pontiff.\n\n“The irony of Leo’s election is that many in the rest of the world will view it as a sign of hope — as an American who can speak for them rather than act against them,” said David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.\n\nPope Leo is another kind of American on the world stage\n\nThe shock and delight of the not-well-known cardinal's election soon shifted into robust discussion about how the top of the global pecking order could be populated by two Americans.\n\nTrump is known to not enjoy sharing attention or primacy, as his “America first” foreign policy approach makes clear. American Catholics chose Trump over his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nIn one apparent appeal to them, Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself dressed as a pope during the days of mourning for Pope Francis, who died April 21. The move was not appreciated by some Catholics and Italians. Trump denied posting the image himself and said anyone who was offended “can't take a joke.” He insisted that “the Catholics loved it.”\n\nEven so, Trump wished Leo well and called it a “great honor” that the new pope was American.\n\nPope Leo, meanwhile, is in some senses a politician as well, with a calm manner and the approach of talking to his fellow cardinals in small groups before the conclave, they said. Though he was born in Chicago, Leo — then Prevost — spent two decades as a missionary in Peru before being appointed by Pope Francis in 2023 to lead the Vatican's powerful office that vets bishops around the world.\n\nHe wouldn't be the first pope to wade into world politics. Pope John Paul II, for example, is rightly credited with helping bring down communism. But Leo enters the papacy having already criticized Vice President JD Vance, the highest-profile Catholic in American politics, on social media. Leo is at odds with the administration on such policy issues as immigration — Trump's signature issue — and the environment.\n\nLike Trump, Leo has turned his attention to the media. On Monday in Vatican City, he called for the release of imprisoned journalists and affirmed the calling for “all of us to safeguard the precious gift of free speech and of the press.” In contrast, Trump's approach to journalists has been combative, from the White House to the courts.\n\nTrump and Pope Leo are in ‘different lanes’ as leaders\n\nIn early February, Leo — then still Prevost — shared an article from a Catholic publication with the headline, “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”\n\nIt came days after Vance — a convert to Catholicism — discussed immigration in a Fox News interview by referencing a Christian tenet “that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritize the rest of the world.”\n\nLeo, speaking Italian to thousands gathered in St. Peter's Square, described a different vision for the Church and human relations: “We have to be a church that works together to build bridges and to keep our arms open, like this very piazza, welcoming.”\n\nVance suggested the papacy is “bigger” than politics and social media. “It's very hard to fit a 2,000-year-old institution into the politics of 2025 America,” he said during an interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, adding that “it’s better for all of us if we allow the church to be about the saving of souls.”\n\nIn the rise of Trump at the same time as Leo, “the gospel meets the culture,” said Steven Millies, director of The Bernardin Center at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Religion and politics, he added, are misaligned because they are “oriented toward different purposes.\"\n\n“What both Francis and then Cardinal Prevost were doing was being bishops — teaching the Gospel, and reminding us the Gospel always is on the side of the poor, the afflicted, the suffering,” Millies said in an email. “That’s not Trump’s lane as a president, a reality TV star or a businessman.”\n\nHow American is Pope Leo's world view, anyway?\n\nLeo's decades in Peru — he is a citizen of both countries — can give him a broader view of humanity and power, and religion and politics, scholars say.\n\nBeyond the obvious personality differences with Trump, Leo is expected to wield power differently — to the neediest people first, for example, whereas Trump cut off American aid. Leo did not mention his American roots during his first speech, nor did he speak in English — a sign, some Vatican watchers said, of his global priorities.\n\n“Even though it is factually true that Leo is the first U.S.-born pope, it makes more sense to think about him as the second pope of the Americas. This challenges ‘America first’ approaches and imagines the region more holistically, as Pope Francis did first, with its center of gravity in the global south,” said Raul Zegarra, assistant professor of Roman Catholic theological studies at Harvard Divinity School.\n\n“All of this points to a pope that understands global leadership through dialogue instead of isolation; who understands power through service, instead of domination,\" he said. \"It is hard to imagine a sharper contrast with the current administration in the U.S.”\n\nTo hear some of the American cardinals tell it, Leo actually is not all that American in style or outlook, and his U.S. heritage played little if any part in his selection as pope. But Trump hovered over the proceedings.\n\nSix American cardinals who had participated in the conclave took the stage at a press conference as \"Born in the USA” and “American Pie” blared from speakers. Then, one after another downplayed Leo's American roots. One quoted a phrase that was going around, that Leo is “the least American of the American” cardinals. Several said they expected Leo to be a “bridge-builder” with the Trump administration — the meaning of the Latin word “pontiff.\"\n\nAsked whether the cardinals elected Leo to offset Trump, several said no.\n\n“I don’t think at all my brother cardinals would have thought of him as a counterweight to any one person,” said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York.\n\n“Obviously the cardinals were quite aware of things that have occurred in the United States, statements that have been made, political actions that have been taken,” said Wilton Gregory, archbishop emeritus of Washington. But the conclave's goal, he said, was choosing “who among us” could strengthen the faith.\n\nSaid Millies: “It’s not that the world should fear a U.S.-born pope. Quite the reverse: As ‘the least American of the Americans,’ he is untainted by our recent politics and may seem safer even as, still, he is an American intimately familiar with this nation’s better angels.”","summary":"The motto of one newly elected American world leader: &amp;quot; Fight! &amp;quot; The other introduced himself to the world with his first public word as pope: ' Peace.&amp;quot; The contrast between President Donald Trump and Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV couldn't be more stark - politically, personally or in the...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/550110/Trump-and-Pope-Leo-are-now-Earth-s-most-powerful-Americans-They-lead-in-different-roles-and-realms","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/5/3bc315986510c7fed68b884525feaa107c01af8d1106e8c890f599b9efb03842_p4198121.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 14:21:00","author":"Laurie Kellman,The Canadian Press","authors":["Laurie Kellman","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.209},{"id":320888448,"title":"Former President Joe Biden, 82, issues concerning health update — all we know","text":"Former President of the United States Joe Biden's team issued a statement the morning of May 13 concerning an irregularity found during a recent physical examination.\n\nThe politician, 82, underwent a routine medical check-up when a nodule was found on his prostate.

The very early moves in the next White House race by potential presidential contenders are clearly underway. The latest comes from 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who later served as Transportation secretary in former President Joe Biden's administration. He is headlining a town hall with veterans on Tuesday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars until the Democratic National Committee (DNC) demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule. TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS SLIDE, BUT DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S POLLS HIT ALL-TIME LOWS Another potential contender, two-term Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, late last month, gave the keynote address at a major state party fundraising gala in New Hampshire, the state that for a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House. Even though he says he is not laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore later this month will headline a major state party fundraising dinner in South Carolina, which the DNC anointed last cycle as their lead-off contest on the primary calendar. Also making noise is two-term Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who said recently he would consider running for president if he felt he could successfully unite the country. WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAID IN A FOX NEWS DIGITAL INTERVIEW Additionally, progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York grabbed plenty of attention the past couple of months, co-headlining a slew of large rallies across the country with longtime progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which sparked plenty of 2028 speculation. The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's election setbacks, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. Republicans additionally made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base. Since Trump's return to power, an increasingly angry and energized base of Democrats has been pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. Democrats are not only looking ahead to next year's midterms, when they hope to make ballot box gains, but also to the next presidential race. \"There was a sense of hopelessness earlier this year among Democrats, as Trump came in with his wrecking ball, and it seemed like there was nothing but futile opposition to him,\" longtime Democratic strategist and communication Chris Moyer told Fox News. \"So thinking about a presidential race with potential candidates is a way to get some hope back and look towards a future that doesn't include Trump.\" Moyer, a veteran of a handful of Democratic presidential campaigns, said the race is \"wide open, and it won’t be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates.\" The results of the 2026 midterm elections will have a major impact on the shape of the next White House race, too. For now, however, here is an early look at Democrats considered to be potential 2028 presidential contenders. Kamala Harris After lying low as the Biden administration came to a close, former Vice President Kamala Harris has picked up the political pace of late, including headlining a major DNC fundraiser last week in New York City. Among her campaign options that she is weighing is a 2026 run for the open governor's seat in her home state of California and another bid in 2028 for the White House. A source in the former vice president's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital two months ago that Harris had told allies she would decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a 2026 gubernatorial campaign. Harris served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and represented the Golden State in the U.S. Senate before joining Biden's 2020 ticket and winning election as vice president. Additionally, Harris would be considered the clear frontrunner for governor in heavily blue California in the race to succeed term-limited Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, early polling in the 2028 Democratic nomination race indicates that Harris would be the frontrunner, thanks in part to her name recognition within her party. While there are plenty of voices within the party who would like to move on from the Biden/Harris era following Trump's sweeping victory, and there is little history of Democrats yearning for past defeated presidential nominees, Trump has re-written the rules when it comes to defeated White House contenders making another run. Potential buyers' remorse of a second Trump administration could boost the 60-year-old Harris in the years to come. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York The progressive \"rock star\" and best-known lawmaker among the so-called \"Squad\" of diverse House Democrats in October turned 35, the minimum age to run for president. Some Democrats argue that a riveting messenger with star power is needed as the party's next nominee, and Ocasio-Cortez is guaranteed to grab plenty of attention if she ultimately decides to run. There is also speculation the four-term federal lawmaker from New York City may primary challenge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York when he is up for re-election in 2028. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California California Gov. Gavin Newsom was a top surrogate for Biden during the president's re-election bid. With the blessing of the White House, the two-term California governor debated then-Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last year on Fox News. Newsom's travels on behalf of Biden brought him to New Hampshire and South Carolina, two crucial early voting states on the Democratic Party's nominating calendar. After Harris, his friend and fellow Californian, replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, the governor continued — after a pause — his efforts to keep Trump from returning to the White House. While Newsom and California's Democrat-dominated legislature took action to \"Trump-proof\" the Golden State, the governor has also worked with Trump on key matters, including January's wildfires that devastated parts of metropolitan Los Angeles. Newsom also appears to have moderated on some issues and invited well-known Trump allies Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his weekly podcast. The 57-year-old Newsom, who is term-limited, completes his duties in Sacramento at the end of next year, right around the time the 2028 presidential election will start to heat up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has become a leading voice in the Democrats' opposition to Trump and has taken steps to Trump-proof his solidly blue state. \"You come for my people, you come through me,\" Pritzker told reporters of his efforts to protect Illinois. Pritzker was also a high-profile surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris during the 2024 cycle. Those efforts brought Pritzker to Nevada, a general election battleground state and an early-voting Democratic presidential primary state, and New Hampshire. Additionally, the governor's recent trip to New Hampshire sparked more 2028 buzz. However, before he makes any decision about 2028, the 60-year-old governor must decide whether he will run in 2026 for a third term steering Illinois. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan Two-term Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer grabbed plenty of attention and became a Democratic Party rising star in 2020 when she feuded with Trump over COVID-19 federal assistance and survived a foiled kidnapping attempt. Trump, at the time, called her \"that woman from Michigan.\" Along with Newsom and Pritzker, Whitmer's name was floated as a possible replacement for Biden following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June, before the president endorsed Harris and the party instantly coalesced around the vice president. Whitmer was a leading surrogate for Biden and then for Harris and made a big impression on Democratic activists during a stop this summer in New Hampshire on behalf of Harris. However, Whitmer was criticized by some in her party for appearing to cozy up to Trump during a White House visit earlier this spring. The 53-year-old governor is term-limited and will leave office after the end of next year. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the 51-year-old first-term governor of Pennsylvania, was on Harris' short-list for vice presidential nominee. Even though the vice president named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Shapiro remained a top surrogate on behalf of his party's 2024 national ticket. However, his two-day swing in New Hampshire during the final full week ahead of Election Day did raise some eyebrows and 2028 speculation. After Harris lost battleground Pennsylvania to Trump, there was plenty of talk within the party that Harris had made the wrong choice for her running mate. Shapiro, who has a track record of taking on the first Trump administration as Pennsylvania attorney general, is expected to play a similar role with Trump back in the White House. The governor will be up for re-election in 2026. Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is considered by many to be another Democratic Party rising star. The 46-year-old Army veteran, Rhodes Scholar and CEO of the charitable organization the Robin Hood Foundation during the coronavirus pandemic was elected two years ago. Even though Moore said in a recent interview on \"The View\" that he's \"not running\" in 2028, speculation persists, fueled in part because of his upcoming stop in South Carolina. Moore will be up for re-election in 2026. Pete Buttigieg Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who surpassed expectations during his 2020 Democratic presidential nomination run, was a very active surrogate on behalf of Biden and later Harris, during the 2024 cycle. He helped raise a lot of money for the Democratic Party ticket, including heading a top-dollar fundraiser in New Hampshire. The 43-year-old former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and former naval officer who served in the war in Afghanistan, is considered one of the party's biggest and brightest stars. He was known as a top communicator for the administration, including making frequent appearances on Fox News. Fueling buzz about a potential 2028 presidential run, Buttigieg passed on a 2026 Senate bid in his adopted home state of Michigan and made a high-profile stop in Iowa on Tuesday. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, 47, who was elected governor in 2019 and then re-elected in 2023 in red-state Kentucky, was also on Harris' longer list for potential running mates. Beshear made plenty of new friends and contacts as he ventured to New Hampshire last month to headline the state Democratic Party's annual fall fundraising gala. He served as Kentucky's attorney general before running for governor. Beshear said last week in an interview with local state WDRB that \"if you'd asked me a couple years ago if this is something I'd consider, I probably wouldn't have. But I don't want to leave a broken country to my kids. And so, if I'm somebody that can bring this nation together, hopefully find some common ground, it's something I'll consider.\" Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, 55, is a major player in Washington as the Democratic minority in the Senate fights back against the second Trump administration. Warnock, who won Senate elections in 2020 and 2022 in battleground Georgia, served as senior pastor at the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. He is up for re-election in the Senate in 2028. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is considered one of the party's most talented orators. Thanks to his 2020 run, Booker made plenty of friends and allies in such early states as New Hampshire and South Carolina. Booker made headlines six weeks ago by delivering a record-breaking 25-hour and 5-minute marathon speech from the floor of the Senate. The speech protested the sweeping and controversial moves so far by Trump during his second administration, as well as the operations of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The 56-year-old senator is up for re-election in 2026. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut Since the November election, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been very vocal about the steps Democrats need to take to win back working-class voters. First elected to the House in 2006 and later to the Senate in 2012, the 51-year-old Murphy cruised to re-election this year by nearly 20 points, which means he would not have to decide between a re-election bid and a White House run in 2028. Rep. Ro Khanna of California Rep. Ro Khanna, 48, was a tireless surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris. He has been a regular visitor to New Hampshire in the past couple of years, including a high-profile debate last year against then-GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Khanna has grabbed plenty of attention so far this year as he has held town halls in Republican-controlled congressional districts and targeted Vice President JD Vance with events in the vice president's home state of Ohio and at Yale Law School, where both politicians earned their legal degrees. Stephen A. Smith The 57-year-old sports TV personality, sports radio host, sports journalist, and actor has grabbed a ton of attention this year as he has mulled a White House run and has even grabbed Trump's attention. Mark Cuban Another potential contender with plenty of star power is Mark Cuban. The billionaire business mogul and part-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks’ was a high-profile surrogate for Harris during her presidential election campaign. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, 67, who at the beginning of the year finished up his eighth and final year as governor, took his name out of the Harris running mate speculation early in the process last summer. Cooper served 16 years as North Carolina's attorney general before winning election as governor. The former governor is being heavily recruited by Democrats to try and flip a GOP-held Senate seat in North Carolina in next year's midterms. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, 65, is halfway through her second term steering New Mexico. The governor, a former member of Congress, was a high-profile and busy surrogate on behalf of Harris during the final weeks of the 2024 campaign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz The 61-year-old Minnesota governor, who served as Harris' running mate, has two years remaining in his second term in office. While the vice presidential nominee's energy and enthusiasm on the campaign trail this year impressed plenty of Democratic strategists, the final results of the election will make any potential future national run for Tim Walz difficult. Walz has said he is not thinking of 2028, but he has been very busy so far this year heading events across the country, and an upcoming stop in South Carolina is fueling more White House buzz. Three other names keep coming up — Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey and former Chicago mayor, former congressman, former White House chief of staff and former ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, and Sen. Ruben Gallego of battleground Arizona.","summary":"Here is a very early look at the Democratic Party politicians considered to be potential 2028 presidential contenders in the next race for the White House.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/less-than-four-months-trumps-second-term-dems-already-eyeing-2028-race","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/931/523/buttigieg.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 14:00:58","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.195},{"id":320869934,"title":"Biden’s aides discussed wheelchair use if he was re-elected, new book claims","text":"Aides to then-President Joe Biden discussed the use of a wheelchair if he was re-elected, a new book on his doomed re-election bid claims. \n\nThe private discussions took place amid Biden’s physical deterioration in 2023 and 2024, Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios write in Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. \n\nThe conversations addressed the degeneration of his spine amid his declining health as he worked to get a second term at the age of 81. \n\nThe discussions also suggest that the Biden White House was determined to hide the extent of his condition during the re-election fight against President Donald Trump before Biden dropped out of the race following his disastrous debate performance in late June. \n\nThe book by Tapper and Thompson is based on more than 200 interviews, primarily with Democratic insiders, almost all of which occurred after the 2024 election. \n\n“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” Tapper and Thompson write. \n\nAides to the then-president thought it wasn’t politically viable to have Biden in a wheelchair during the campaign. \n\nBecause of Biden’s age, his doctor, Kevin O’Connor, “privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery.”\n\nAides to the president grew increasingly concerned about Biden having another fall after he tripped over a sandbag in June 2023 during an event at the Air Force Academy. More precautions were taken to avoid another fall before the 2024 election in November. \n\nThey worked to organise shorter walking paths and demanded the use of handrails as he got up on stages during appearances. Biden aides also made sure he wore sneakers more often, changed his briefings ahead of events to make sure he was aware of every step he was to take, and put in place more extensive guidance for his movements. \n\nO’Connor had expressed concerns for quite some time about the effects of the presidency on Biden’s health, arguing with his political officials that he needed more rest time. The doctor, at times, joked that his staff was trying to kill Biden, while the physician was trying to keep the president alive. \n\nBiden’s aides told reporters through 2024 that the president’s halting walk was partly due to a foot fracture from November 2020 and then refusing to wear his walking boot consistently, however, that went against what O’Connor had said publicly. Biden wore a walking boot for 10 weeks in late 2020 and early 2021, after which O’Connor noted that both minor fractures in his foot had “completely healed.”\n\n“This injury has healed as expected,” O’Connor said at the time. \n\nIn public health summaries, O’Connor said Biden experienced “mild post--fracture foot arthritis.” However, he put more emphasis on Biden’s \"significant spinal arthritis\" to explain why Biden’s gait had changed. \n\nTapper and Thompson write that Biden, his family, and top administration officials went ahead with the re-election campaign in the face of signs of physical and mental decline during his time in office. \n\nBut following Biden’s debate performance against Trump in June last year, Democratic leaders started pushing for his removal from the top of the ticket. It took three weeks, but Biden eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, effectively ending the prospect of an open primary. \n\nA spokesperson for Biden told Axios that the former president’s “medical exam made clear that he had a stiffened gait caused, in part, by wear and tear to his spine — but that no special treatment was necessary and that it had not worsened.”\n\n“He was transparent about this, and it was far from 'severe,’” the spokesperson added. “Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.\"\n\n“And so far, we are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline,” the spokesperson argued. “In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president.\"\n\nThis comes as a “small nodule” was located in Biden's prostate during a regular medical exam. Biden spent last Friday at a Philadelphia hospital after the nodule was found and needed “further evaluation,” a spokesperson told The New York Times. It’s common for men in their 80s to experience issues with their prostate. \n\nBiden, 82, left office as the oldest president to ever serve in the role; however, Trump is the oldest person ever elected to the office. \n\nConcerns about his health and age followed Biden through his presidency, eventually prompting his departure from his re-election campaign. \n\nBiden was declared “fit to serve” by his doctor in February last year following a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nThe former president appeared on The View last week, rejecting reports that he declined during his last year as president. \n\n“They are wrong,” said Biden. “There’s nothing to sustain that.”","summary":"Aides to the then-president thought it wasn’t politically viable to have Biden in wheelchair until after 2024 election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-wheelchair-reelection-book-b2750046.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/13/13/00/SEI250274766.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a98vGseh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-13 13:38:13","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.482},{"id":320866796,"title":"Biden aides allegedly fretted then-president would need wheelchair if re-elected, new book reveals","text":"Former President Joe Biden's aides privately discussed the possibility of the president needing to use a wheelchair if he were re-elected in the 2024 race, as his physical deterioration spiraled in 2023 and 2024, a new book claims. \"Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,\" an upcoming book called \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\" states. CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson authored the upcoming book, which is set to be released Tuesday and is just the latest in a series of recent political books detailing the unprecedented 2024 presidential election, where calls mounted for Biden's exit due to concerns over his mental acuity and age. \"Given Biden's age, (his physician Kevin O'Connor) also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,\" the authors wrote.

Biden's mental acuity had been under conservatives' microscope since before the 2020 election, with concerns heightening in February 2024 when special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS Concern over his mental acuity hit a fever pitch in June 2024, when Biden took the debate stage to face off against then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Biden's debate performance was seen as a failure, with traditional allies soon joining conservatives in their concern over the president's health in the context of encouraging Biden to pass the mantle to a younger generation of U.S. leaders. Biden dropped out at the end of July 2024, giving his successor for the nomination, former Vice President Kamala Harris, just over 100 days to rally support. Trump and Vice President JD Vance secured the election win after locking down support in the top seven battleground states. EX-BIDEN AIDE SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT WAS 'FATIGUED, BEFUDDLED, AND DISENGAGED' PRIOR TO JUNE DEBATE: BOOK A Biden spokesperson told Axios when asked about the claims in the upcoming book that, \"Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.\" The spokesperson defended that Biden's \"stiffened gait\" seen while he was in office was due \"in part, by wear and tear to his spine — but that no special treatment was necessary and that it had not worsened.\" \"We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president,\" the unidentified spokesperson told Fox Digital.

They vote on the economy,” said Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who ran for the U.S. Senate last year in New Jersey and is now advising U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, one of the Democrats running for governor in next month’s primary. \n\nLiberal strategists, organizers and some politicians are urging Democrats to focus on the economy in this year's elections rather than on immigration. Some argue a broad economic message would be more effective with the wide range of nationalities and experiences in the Latino community rather than customized efforts based on perceived cultural or political interests. \n\nLast year, Trump, a Republican, made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of eastern Pennsylvania and turned South Texas’ Rio Grande Valley while improving his numbers along Florida’s Interstate 4 corridor. His message to Latinos focused heavily on the economy and border security.\n\n“Latino operatives have been saying, ‘Don’t treat us all as a monolith,’” said Tory Gavito, who co-founded Way to Win, a progressive group formed after Trump’s 2016 win that recently conducted focus groups with Latinos who skipped the 2024 election. “They were pretty monolithic.”\n\nInflation was top of mind for nearly half of Latinos who voted last fall, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate. About three-quarters of Latino Trump voters were very concerned about housing costs in their community, compared with about 6 in 10 white Trump voters.\n\n“Where we fell short was failing to fully appreciate the bread-and-butter economic issues that were driving them,” said Tom Perez, a former Democratic National Committee chair who served as adviser to President Joe Biden. “Many folks felt like we were too focused on identity politics and not focused enough on the cost of eggs, the cost of gas, the cost of living.”\n\nAlex Berrios, co-founder of the organizing group Mi Vecino, which mobilizes Latino voters in Florida, Arizona and Maine, said Democrats focused too much on using buzzwords and trying to micro-target specific nationalities. The result, he argues, left voters feeling as though the party's message was staged.\n\n“It’s like they were saying, ‘Let me get my Venezuelan script out,’” Berrios said. “No. The first thing is just be relatable.”\n\nChuck Rocha is a Democratic strategist who mobilized Latinos for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential bid in 2020 and for U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego last year and started a super political action committee, or PAC, to reach out to Latinos in key races. He argued that Democrats “mess up by bringing a policy book to a boxing match.”\n\n“It’s about three things: affordability, affordability, affordability,” he said. “Affordability is the only thing that they care about because that’s what’s hitting them in the face every day.”\n\nNew Jersey's primary for governor is an early test of the different Democratic points of view. Last year, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns that he had lost by more than 30 and 50 percentage points in 2016. Democrat Kamala Harris won a traditionally blue state by just 6 percentage points, the closest presidential contest there since 2004.\n\nSherrill, who flipped a longtime Republican district in winning her House seat in 2018, has focused on her biography and her military service while also arguing she will stand up to Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk. One of her ads promises she will “drive down costs from health care to housing.”\n\nHer campaign manager, Alex Ball, outlined during the weekend in a memo that one of its goals is meeting in person Hispanic voters from two suburban counties who have voted in three of the four past Democratic primaries. \n\n“There is a real risk of a Republican winning in November, but Mikie is the candidate who can win just like she has won tough elections before, even driving out a long-time Republican incumbent in a Trump district — something no one thought was possible,” Ball wrote. \n\nMeanwhile, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has frequently campaigned against U.S. immigration authorities' plans to open a detention facility in his city. The mayor was arrested by immigration authorities on Friday while demonstrating outside, with video of his detention and release spreading widely and leading to his competitors in the Democratic primary rallying to his side. \n\nA May AP-NORC poll found that 38% of Hispanic adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, which is roughly in line with U.S. adults overall. \n\nBut there’s growing unease as Trump’s plans to revive manufacturing and reshape the global economy have been rolled out with constant changes, creating uncertainty and sparking concerns of prices rising and products disappearing from shelves. From January through March, the economy shrank for the first time in three years as businesses were disrupted by Trump's trade wars. Trump fired thousands of federal workers, with impacts felt outside of Washington.\n\nThe Libre Initiative, a Koch Network-affiliated conservative group, is running ads targeting Latinos in support of tax breaks approved during Trump’s first term that may expire at year’s end.\n\nDaniel Garza, president of the group, acknowledged “nervousness” among Latino voters, with some wondering if maybe Trump took on too much and too fast. But Garza said that it’s too soon to make a fair assessment of his second term, which began in January. \n\nHe argues voters should wait and see how Trump negotiates trade and whether the Republican Party can pass his “big, beautiful bill” with both tax breaks and spending cuts and promises he made such as exempting tips, overtime and Social Security from taxation.\n\n“My sense is that Latinos are a very patient lot,” he said. “Aguantamos mucho.\"\n\nThat is Spanish for “We put up with a lot.”\n\nAssociated Press Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"Democrats have long focused on immigration when courting Latino voters in states like Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey and Florida, where generations of Latin American immigrants have settled and gained permanent legal status","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/reach-latinos-democrats-pivot-talk-economy-immigration-121743580","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/94031f46-82b7-4ea4-ab15-a2b05b27e3fb/wirestory_933707d43741a0c3f97242b33f4ad8e6_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 11:56:21","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon Associated Press","authors":["Adriana Gomez Licon Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":320813870,"title":"Top Adviser Claims Biden’s Delay in Exiting Race Hurts Kamala Harris’ 2024 Presidential Hopes","text":"Former President Joe Biden “completely messed up” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential 2024 presidential run by opting not to exit the race earlier, a campaign aide claimed.\n\nDavid Plouffe, who was an influential adviser for Harris’ campaign, placed the blame for her electoral defeat firmly on the ex-president, as noted in a new book co-authored by CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nPlouffe — who served as a senior adviser during Obama’s administration — described Harris’ 107-day campaign against Donald Trump as a “complete disaster,” according to an excerpt acquired by The Guardian.\n\n“And it’s all Biden,” he told the authors. “He totally f–ked us.”\n\nPlouffe said he flagged concerns about Biden’s mental and physical ability after receiving a flurry of calls from worried donors in the wake of his catastrophic first debate performance against Trump.\n\nBut he said he was repeatedly told the prez could still win another election.\n\nThe White House, at the time, also publicly insisted Biden was in good health.\n\nDespite clinging on for three more weeks, Biden ended up dropping out of the race — a move others aides, too, agreed upended Harris’ chances.\n\n“I love Joe Biden.

Serbia refuses to recognise Kosovo's independence.The parliamentary stand-off has delayed the ratification of agreements under the European Union's Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, depriving the country of access to 882.6 million euros ($981.5 million) in loans and grants.\"If ratification does not occur by June it could end into delays in fund disbursement and potentially a redistribution of funds,\" to other countries, warned Besar Gergi, from the Group for Legal and Political Studies, a Pristina-based think-tank.Even if parties agree to new elections, the current legislature must still vote to ratify the Growth Plan agreement, added Blerina Istrefi, a researcher at the same think-tank.The parliamentary session that began on April 15 can only be concluded with the election of a president, three vice-presidents and the formation of parliamentary groups.However, the Constitution does not specify a strict deadline for this process, meaning it could, in theory, continue indefinitely.\"The parties have locked themselves into their camps... the political schizophrenia continues,\" said Maloku.As for Kurti, asked by a journalist about a possible solution to the crisis, he replied: \"I am the prime minister, let's move on.\"","summary":"Lawmakers in Kosovo on Tuesday again failed to elect a new parliamentary speaker, after 14 previous unsuccessful attempts that have plunged Europe's youngest state into unprecedented political deadlock.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/stand-off-leaves-kosovo-unable-again-elect-speaker-3773366","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4600502/prime-minister-albin-kurtis-party-failed-secure-majority-kosovos-parliament-form-government.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 11:15:10","author":"Ismet Hajdari","authors":["Ismet Hajdari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":320848430,"title":"Jamie Lee Curtis makes plea to Mark Zuckerberg to take down unsettling AI video","text":"Jamie Lee Curtis has publicly asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to take down an AI video using her likeness after she became the latest celebrity to have her identity appropriated online. \n\nThe 66-year-old actor, known for her performances in True Lies and Everything Everywhere All at Once, wrote to the Meta CEO, 40, via Facebook on Monday (12 May) after struggling to contact his team. \n\n“I have gone through every proper channel to ask you and your team to take down this totally AI fake commercial for some bulls*** that I didn't authorise, agree to or endorse,” Curtis wrote on her official page. \n\nThe Freaky Friday star continued: “If I have a brand besides being an actor and author it is that I am known for telling the truth and saying it like it is and for having integrity.” \n\nCurtis explained that snippets of an interview she had given to US TV host Stephanie Ruhle in the wake of the Los Angeles fires in January had been edited and repackaged to sell products. \n\n“Fake words put in my mouth diminishes my opportunities to actually speak my truth,” she said. “I've been told that if I ask you directly, maybe you will encourage your team to police it and remove it. I long ago deleted Twitter, so this is the only way I can think of reaching you.” \n\nJust two hours after Curtis shared the post, the video was removed from all Meta sites. A spokesman from the corporation confirmed that the adverts the star referred to had indeed violated their policies.\n\n “It worked! Yay Internet! Shame has its value!” Curtis wrote. \n\nPrior to reaching out to Zuckerberg via Facebook, the actor revealed that even her lawyers and social media teams had been unable to get the adverts taken down by Meta. \n\n“How is this possible?” she asked. “Just think about the threat of this, forgetting my ‘career’ but politicians or public servants saying things that they aren’t saying. It’s like the wild wild West.” \n\nCurtis is the latest of many high profile celebrities to have had their likenesses stolen in recent months. \n\nTaylor Swift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the US presidential election last September after AI-generated content shared by Donald Trump suggested she had endorsed him instead. \n\nLast May, Scarlett Johansson complained after Chat GPT used an alarmingly similar voice to her own to speak to users after she declined to voice a project for them the year before. \n\n“I was shocked, angered and in disbelief,” the actor said. OpenAI has repeatedly denied that the voice was intended to imitate Johansson. \n\nIn February, Johansson’s likeness was stolen for a second time when an AI video was released, featuring her, Adam Sandler, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black and Jake Gyllenhaal, all condemning antisemitic comments made by the rapper Kanye West. \n\n“I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it,” she said.\n\n“I have unfortunately been a very public victim of AI, but the truth is that the threat of AI affects each and every one of us.” \n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has backed legislation to protect Hollywood actors and creatives from unauthorised use of AI. However, Trump’s return to the White House for a second term triggered concerns that US legislation on AI-generated images could regress.","summary":"‘Fake words put in my mouth diminishes my opportunity to speak the truth,’ actor said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jamie-lee-curtis-mark-zuckerberg-ai-video-facebook-b2749935.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/13/10/26/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Zuckerberg.png?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vnBWAKHL-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-13 11:03:22","author":"Lydia Spencer-Elliott","authors":["Lydia Spencer-Elliott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":320820862,"title":"Biden ‘totally f–ked’ Kamala Harris’ 2024 election chances by refusing to drop out sooner: top adviser","text":"Former President Joe Biden “totally f–ked” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 bid for the White House by refusing to drop out of the race earlier, a campaign aide said.\n\nDavid Plouffe, who was a key adviser for the Harris campaign, blamed the then-veep’s election loss squarely on the ex-commander in chief, according to a new book CNN’s Jake Tapper co-authored.\n\nPlouffe — a senior adviser in Obama’s White House — was quoted ripping Harris’ 107-day campaign against Donald Trump as a “f–king nightmare,” according to an excerpt obtained by The Guardian.\n\n“And it’s all Biden,” he told the authors. “He totally f–ked us.”\n\nPlouffe said he flagged concerns about Biden’s mental and physical ability after receiving a flurry of calls from worried donors in the wake of his catastrophic first debate performance against Trump.\n\nBut he said he was repeatedly told the prez could still win another election.\n\nThe White House, at the time, also publicly insisted Biden was in good health.\n\nDespite clinging on for three more weeks, Biden ended up dropping out of the race — a move others aides, too, agreed upended Harris’ chances.\n\n“I love Joe Biden.

Here is Part One. \n\nTo this day, four months after inauguration, World Liberty Financial, a purportedly private enterprise, unabashedly touts as its central asset the president of the United States, whose bigger-than-life visage peers from its website, touting a “financial revolution” that will “dismantle the stranglehold of traditional financial institutions.”\n\nLeveraging business with power was the plan. It was, after all, just two months before the 2024 election when Donald Trump, his sons Don Jr. and Eric, and a handful of partners stood up WLF, their crypto enterprise. At the time, the presidency was tantalizingly close to Trump’s grasp. So was the potential to reap billions of dollars. It is no accident that the longtime New York real estate tycoon, now worth over $5.4 billion according to Forbes, has doubled his fortune by plunging into crypto and his other tenuous cyber venture, the Trump Media and Technology Group.\n\nHence the problem: Chief executive of the nation and chief advocate for a family-run crypto concern are different jobs with inevitably conflicting priorities. The American presidency is not a golf course in Scotland. It’s not just another asset on the corporate ledger.\n\nBecoming the ‘Crypto President’\n\nIn some ways, the elder Trump’s path to becoming the “crypto president” is unlikely. As the New York Times detailed in the blockbuster April 29 report we discussed in the first column in this series, Trump was a crypto naysayer until a strange concatenation of circumstances brought him around. Trump is a real estate guy. He’s never been a big stock fan, either. His instinct is that value lies in what he can touch and readily leverage. Until about a year ago, his take on cryptocurrency echoed many traditional conservative economists: a “scam” — the illusion of value with no tangible there there, mainly fit to “facilitate unlawful behavior, including the drug trade[.]”\n\nWhat changed his mind so drastically? Two of his core attributes.\n\nFirst, tirelessly projecting mirages of unquantifiable wealth and success is his core competency. As we’ll see, convincing potential investors that cryptocurrency is a value proposition is the essence of its being one — to the debatable extent that it is one.\n\nSecond, vengeance is Trump’s brand, particularly in politics. Trump’s enemies, especially the progressives who ran the Biden administration, were near rabid in their determination to regulate crypto. As night follows day, Trump is now crypto’s biggest cheerleader, bent on nullifying Biden’s crusade.\n\nAs we discussed in the first column, regulating crypto is not as easy as it sounds. The partisan divide in Congress is too deep for consensus on regulatory frameworks for digital currencies and the trading of digital assets. Consequently, it has been left to executive agencies to try to corral crypto into the antiquated legal regimens for securities and commodities — regulatory schemes created decades before the technology that created crypto existed. To make this work, the executive branch has regulated by prosecution (much as it did in stepping up the policing of securities fraud in the 1980s). That was the Biden approach.\n\nThis, needless to say, is a horrible way to legislate. It is a bedrock principle that laws imposing liability, especially penal provisions, must be sufficiently clear that a person of average intelligence can understand what is prohibited. In regulation by prosecution, to the contrary, the law is stretched by creative DOJ prosecutors and agency bureaucrats. These novel theories are then legitimized by progressive and populist judges and administrators, who are likeminded about the imperative to manage markets and business — even if the proposed standards for doing so are neither strictly prescribed by the text of regulations nor established by prior government enforcement practices.\n\nIn Trump’s mind, that is exactly what was done to him in the lawfare campaign by the Biden Justice Department and other Democratic prosecutors, such as Alvin Bragg and Letitia James in New York. He is convinced that Democrats stretched statutes to the breaking point — and beyond — to try to convict him, ruin him financially, and end his political career.\n\nHe’s only partially right about that (but he did win, so his minions at the Justice Department are busy rewriting the history). The New York criminal and civil cases did indeed feature absurd distortions of enforcement statutes by elected progressive prosecutors with the goal of crushing their political nemesis. (Trump is currently showing James that what goes around comes around.) With respect to the federal cases, however, it would be more accurate to say that Trump was saved by the Supreme Court’s robust immunity ruling and the delay attendant to it, which meant the Biden DOJ prosecutor, Jack Smith, ran out of time before Trump was elected in November 2024. (Under the longstanding DOJ interpretation of the Constitution, a sitting president may not be prosecuted.) Smith did stretch statutes, too; but it can’t honestly be maintained that Trump’s appalling actions following the 2020 election — over which he was impeached, though not convicted — were unworthy of investigation; and if Smith’s “J6” case had played out, some of the charges might well have survived the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. And Smith didn’t get the Mar-a-Lago documents case to trial mainly because he overcharged it (and because he and Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland were too headstrong to address an easily curable constitutional flaw in Smith’s appointment as special counsel), not because prosecutable misconduct was lacking.\n\nTrump, of course, doesn’t see it that way. In his telling, he was totally vindicated because all the cases against him were partisan and bogus. This predisposition matters a lot in the crypto saga. For starters, Trump is convinced he has immunity for anything he does as president (which is not what the Court said). Just as important, because Trump sees the Biden enforcement approach to crypto and its proponents as indistinguishable from the Biden enforcement approach to Trump himself, the president’s vengeful streak has him portraying crypto as an unqualified good and its proponents as his allies, even if — or, perhaps, especially if — they’ve been prosecuted by the Biden-era enforcement agencies.\n\nOf course, in bringing Trump around, it didn’t hurt that crypto’s entrepreneurs poured millions of dollars into Trump’s 2024 campaign.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Currency?\n\nWhen it began operations a few weeks before the 2024 election, the asset that WLF rolled out was a new cryptocurrency: $WLF. Ironically, the dollar sign before initials or a catchy nickname is an industry convention, even though it is emblematic of the U.S. dollar — the reserve currency backing the quaint global financial order that the crypto bros dream of superseding.\n\nWhat is a cryptocurrency? I’ll pause here to observe that it’s an unfortunate term.\n\nFirst, what we’re talking about is not currency in the familiar sense (more on that in a second). Second, cryptocurrency must be distinguished from cryptology and the evolution of blockchain. These technological advances, as George Gilder compellingly writes, hold great promise for a decentralized world of smart contracts and autonomy over one’s personal data. Cryptocurrency is a closely related development. It is opaque, has an insider vernacular, and is often linked to illicit activities. Because of these things, and because people naturally recoil from what they don’t understand, there is a tendency to conflate the “currency” with the technology from which it sprang. They are not the same.\n\nAs for cryptocurrency, it is not like gold, a tangible, inherently useful — even desirable — metal. Gold is still an ideal we associate with currency, even though it ceased to anchor the dollar in 1971, because it is a reliable store of value and an efficient medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency is intangible. It’s an inchoate idea: a belief that its financial backers will prove to be solid and that its units will maintain and increase their value over time — that there will be a market for it, with someone willing to pay for it.\n\nBelief is everything with crypto because it does not otherwise exemplify currency’s core attributes. A reliable store of value? That depends on how rigorous and enduring your notion of reliable is. Historically, though it has had periods of stability and growth, crypto has also nearly collapsed a number of times. As our intrepid friend and colleague David Bahnsen has quipped, the most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, “routinely trades with more volatility than a [dotcom] stock on margin in a third-world country during a terrorist attack.”\n\nAs for efficient medium of exchange, crypto simply isn’t one. That’s why it is nearly unseen in everyday transactions. In 2023, only 1 percent of Americans used cryptocurrency to pay for something. That’s not just because few merchants accept crypto due to its volatility, high transaction fees, long processing times, and fears about regulation and legality. It’s also because only 7 percent of Americans have even held cryptocurrency for investment purposes. For the foreseeable future, the vast majority of transactions will continue to be executed in traditional money, at least in the United States and other countries with established currencies backed by their governments and tax bases. (To be clear, that is not an endorsement of our government’s debasement of the dollar; it’s just an observation of reality.)\n\nThe Power of the Presidency\n\nWith all beliefs, there must be a reason to keep believing. Without one, the belief dies. I have a hard time perceiving any reason to believe in $WLF other than Donald Trump’s presidency. That’s bad because neither the presidency nor private industry is supposed to work that way.\n\nThe record bears this out. When $WLF was established, World Liberty Financial hopefully announced that it expected to raise $300 million in investment to back it as a desirable asset (if not a true currency). At the time, Trump was in a very tight race with Kamala Harris, and though she was a historically awful candidate, there was a very good chance he’d lose. By late October, even as his prospects improved, the New York Times reports that just $2.7 million had been raised for $WLF.\n\nIn the end, Trump won — not by the “millions and millions” of votes he habitually claims, but by a little over 2 million votes out of about 155 million cast, enough to nose out Harris by 1.5 percent (and a comfortable 312–226 Electoral College margin), even though his 49.8 percent haul meant slightly more Americans voted against than for him.\n\nA win is a win: That plurality of the vote was enough to take 100 percent of the world’s most powerful office. And, mirabile dictu, immediately after the election, the value of $WLF surged. This week, after nearly four months during which the president continued prioritizing his “chief crypto advocate” aspiration, the capitalization of $WLF stood at $367 million, and the company claims to have reeled in a jaw-dropping $550 million through its offerings. As Rich Lowry and I discussed last week on our NR podcast, that’s significantly more than its optimistic backers had hoped for.\n\nIn the next column, we’ll look at other operations by which President Trump and his WLF partners have generated staggering amounts of revenue since he won the 2024 election.","summary":"Trump was a crypto naysayer — until he wasn’t.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-trump-and-crypto/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trump-bitcoin-nashville-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 10:30:18","author":"Andrew C.
