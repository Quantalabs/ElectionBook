It has been taken down,” a White House official told AFP.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Obamas.\n\nFormer vice-president Kamala Harris, who has long condemned Mr Trump’s divisive racial rhetoric, called out the White House’s backpedaling in a post on X on Feb 6.\n\n“No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended this post,” she wrote. “We are all clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is and what he believes.” AFP","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-he-didnt-see-racist-obama-monkey-video-clip-posted-on-his-account","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7657de571536e989e0dccffc4af4d0941269a6de195486cef1a8ce716133250e","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:41:00","author":"Sph Media Limited","authors":["Sph Media Limited"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.599},{"id":400224436,"title":"Former U.S. VP Harris slams ‘cover up’ after Trump deletes racist post","text":"Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris slammed what she called a “cover up” at the White House on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump shared a racist video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama and later deleted it.\n\nTrump shared a social media post with a video depicting the Obamas as monkeys, a racist trope that caused outrage across the U.S. political spectrum.\n\nThe White House initially rejected “fake outrage” over the video shared on Trump’s Truth Social account late Thursday night, only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member.\n\nHarris rejected that explanation.\n\n“No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended the post.

However, Xerias, the AI meme creator of the video, has doubled down, releasing a new version that intensifies the same inflammatory content.\n\nIn the original video, Trump is depicted as the \"Lion King,\" with several Democrats, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Nancy Pelosi, portrayed as jungle animals. However, the clip that drew the most ire was the one where the Obama weres transformed into apes. The use of apes to represent Black figures has long been a racially charged trope, leading to condemnation from both political and civil rights groups.\n\nTrump Deletes the Video: A Brief Pause in the Controversy\n\nThe White House verified the video, but following the public outcry, Trump swiftly deleted the video from his Truth Social account.\n\nRather than backing down in the face of criticism, Xerias doubled down on the controversial content, releasing an updated version of the same video. The new video not only includes the Obama ape imagery but also intensifies the political caricatures of other Democratic figures. In this version, Xerias pushes the boundaries further, using more aggressive satire while still portraying figures like Biden and Harris as jungle animals, and Trump as the powerful jungle king.\n\n\"Meme them until they cry.\nThen make memes about them crying 😁,\" Xerias wrote in the new post.\n\nXerias defended the new video, claiming it was intended as satirical political commentary, a reflection of the absurdity of American politics.

It's the racism","text":"The president of the United States posted a racist video Thursday night depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. On Friday, the White House dismissed criticism - but the president deleted the post. Was this episode disappointing? Yes. Surprising? Not anymore.\n\nLast spring, after Pope Francis had died, Donald Trump posted an AI image of himself as the pope just days before cardinals convened to elect a successor.\n\nSo, no - it is not surprising that the president would choose to post virulent anti-Black imagery during Black History Month.\n\nBut it is disappointing here in 2026 that an occupant of the Oval Office is still thinking like that.\n\nBack in 1971, the president of the United States laughed when the governor of California referred to the African delegates at the United Nations as monkeys. Less than 10 years later, that governor became the president of the United States. And here we are, half a century later, and yet another president has amplified that racist trope.\n\nMeaning white supremacy is still on the ballot.\n\nThat Nixon-Reagan-Trump throughline isn't tightly wound around policy or principle, but simply that shared worldview. After all, Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and Reagan offered amnesty to immigrants - highly un-Trump-like moves. No, their commonality is best revealed in the delight each man took in an old racist attack against Black people.\n\nFor Americans who are 50 and older - roughly a third of the nation - this worldview has been the architect responsible for White House policy for most of our lives. And yet, when Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election, the forensic investigation focused on grocery prices and her absence from Joe Rogan's podcast. Some - in trying to explain why Harris lost - mischaracterized her role at the border or inflated her influence on the war in Gaza.\n\nFor some reason, race did not seem to receive the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThis factor was slighted despite decades of data, such as the wave of white nationalists endorsing Harris' opponent and the birther movement questioning President Obama's citizenship. The trio of presidents who are on the record as enjoying depictions of Black people as monkeys - Nixon, Reagan and Trump - all used racist dog whistles in their combined 10 presidential campaigns. Their administrations have tended to be more anti-civil-rights movement than post-civil-rights movement.\n\nOur nation's attempts at understanding ourselves are continuously undercut by the denial that for some single-issue voters, race is their single issue. Not the price of bacon or their religious convictions. Not Gaza. Just the promise of having a safe space for prejudice. And when the president of the United States entertains racist jokes as Nixon did in the 1970s or shares racist videos as Trump continues to do, undoubtedly there is a sense among the electorate that such prejudice has a home in the White House.\n\nBefore Trump used social media to push yesteryear's ugliness, earlier in the week Harris relaunched her 2024 social media campaign account, calling it a place where Gen Z can \"meet and revisit with some of our great courageous leaders, be they elected leaders, community leaders, civic leaders, faith leaders, young leaders.\" She exhorted: \"Stay engaged. I'll see you out there.\"\n\nWhether she plans to run again in 2028 is unclear. What we do know is she would not have posted an AI picture of herself as the new pope while Catholics were mourning Francis (or any other time). We know she would not have advocated for immigration officers to racially profile Black and brown Americans or disregard the 14th Amendment to detain children. We do not know how many of her policy proposals she would have been able to get across the finish line in Congress, but we do know her record of public service to the American people, in contrast with the current president who is suing the American people for $10 billion.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with revisiting Harris' missteps on the campaign trail or debating her electability as she reemerges in the public spotlight. But now that Trump has resorted to posting monkey jokes about Black people, perhaps updated forensics will consider our well established history of racism among the factors in the 2024 election.\n\nIt is not a shock that a president of the United States thinks poorly of Black people. Not when you know that more than 25% of those who have held the office were themselves enslavers. But it is disappointing that 250 years into our nation's story, some of us still deny the role that racism plays in shaping our politics and thus all of our lives.\n\nYouTube: @LZGrandersonShow\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nTribune Regional CA\n\nThis story was originally published February 6, 2026 at 2:34 PM.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314608674.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 22:34:26","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":400224016,"title":"Ex-Democrat Strategist Explains Why Potential 2028 Rivals In Party Not ‘Attacking’ Harris","text":"Former Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine said on Friday that possible 2028 presidential contenders in former Vice President Kamala Harris’ party were refraining from criticizing her because they believe her failure is inevitable.\n\nDemocrats who are not potential contenders told The Daily Caller on Thursday that they were not completely sold on Harris’ rebrand after she and her team announced that her 2024 campaign X account, previously called “KamalaHQ,” would be called “Headquarters” and focus on being a “new Gen-Z led progressive content hub.” Turrentine asserted on Newsmax’s “American Agenda” that targeting Harris could backfire and repel black female voters when it was wiser to let the former vice president “implode.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Floats ‘Honest’ Reality Check Of Trump Economy, Seemingly Forgetting Biden Admin’s Affordability Crisis)\n\n“She looks at the crowds on this book tour where she’s packing auditoriums, she looks at book sales, which — I’ll give her credit — she sold a lot of books,” Turrentine said. “And she sees these polls and thinks, ‘Why not me?'”\n\n“Here’s the irony of this: Democrats aren’t attacking her because they think that she’ll implode for the third time. Remember in ’19, she never even made it to Iowa,” he added. “She just deflated … And then obviously what happened in ’24, I think the best thing she had was it was a short campaign. The longer it went, people think the worse she would have done. So, people say, ‘Why should I bother wasting breath attacking her and alienating black women when she’s going to do it for herself?'”\n\nIn addition to ending her 2020 presidential campaign before the Iowa Caucuses, she secured the 2024 nomination without primary voter approval and lost all seven swing states, along with the popular vote, against President Donald Trump.\n\n“[I] didn’t think she was going to make some presidential announcement this early, but it was telling how ominous it felt,” a former Biden-Harris White House aide told the Caller on Thursday. “Everyone kind of felt nervous. It’s easier when she’s on the book tour. That’s predictable.”\n\nMost major donors in 2025 denied the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) request to hold a fundraiser in the San Francisco, California region featuring Harris as a headliner, several individuals familiar with the discussion told The Wall Street Journal in October.\n\nThe Harris campaign and the Democratic Party reportedly spent almost $1.5 billion in 2024 despite her presidential bid only being 107 days, resulting in debt.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Harris said, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”\n\nIn this moment, analysts said, Harris had tied herself inextricably with the economic hardships voters faced during the Biden administration and its other failings. Harris lost the election and returned to the show a year later to say, “I realise now that I didn’t fully appreciate how much of an issue it was.” In her book 107 Days, Harris likened her statement to pulling the pin on a hand grenade.\n\nWhile Harris’s appearance may not have helped her electoral prospects, Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, did not appear on The View before the 2024 election or in his previous two elections.\n\nDaytime and late-night shows are usually required by a United States Communications Act rule that political candidates be given equal access to airtime, but The View may possibly have been an exemption because it could be seen as a “bona fide news show”, and those are exempt from that requirement.\n\nBut in the last year, The View, Saturday Night Live, Jimmy Kimmel Live and other shows have been in the Federal Communications Commission’s eye for not providing equal access and possibly providing partisan coverage. But critics say the FCC’s attempts to rein in such shows could amount to curtailing of speech. That, along with increasing corporate consolidation of media ownership, could make it vulnerable to regulatory intervention and a backsliding in media freedom, as has been seen in countries such as Hungary and Russia.\n\nThe FCC put out a public notice in late January saying concerns had been raised that the interview portions of all daytime and late-night shows were exempt from the equal opportunities requirement. “This is not the case,” the FCC’s notice said, encouraging stations “to obtain formal assurance” that they are exempt from giving equal access.\n\nBut such processes could be “a tool for harassment and intimidation”, said Harold Field, senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the notice and the petitioning process hanging, broadcasters may rethink “which perspectives to air and which ones not to”, said Seth Stern, chief of advocacy at the Freedom of Press Foundation.\n\nGigi Sohn, a lawyer who has previously worked in the FCC, said, “I like the spirit of the notice,” referring to the principle of providing lesser-known candidates equal access to airtime, “but the impact could be censorship. I am concerned about how it will be applied.”\n\n‘It costs money to stand up for principle’\n\nThe FCC notice stems from the Communications Act of 1934, which said, since the three broadcasters were being provided public airwaves, if a station provides space to one political candidate, it would have to provide equal opportunity to all other candidates for that office. Broadcasters would have to keep a public file on any free time given to a candidate so that other candidates could review this and claim their equal free time, too.\n\nWhen John Kennedy appeared on the Tonight Show in 1959, the FCC had ruled that equal time was to be given to other candidates. In 2006, by the time Arnold Schwarznegger appeared on the Tonight Show while running for California governor, more talk shows had filled the airwaves and blurred the line between news and entertainment. The FCC had ruled that The Tonight Show was exempt from the equal time rule as a bona fide news interview.\n\nThe FCC notice from January said that the industry has taken this to mean that all daytime and late-night shows are exempt because they are bona fide news shows, but they are not.\n\n“To state the obvious, Jimmy Kimmel Live is not Meet The Press. Not by a long shot. Not even close,” Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, a right-leaning think tank based in Chicago, wrote in a blog post for the Yale Regulatory Journal.\n\nFCC chair Brendan Carr had also tweeted that such shows had claimed exemptions “even when motivated by partisan political purposes”. Right-wing analysts quoted a study saying The View had only two conservative guests in 2025, while it had 128 liberal guests. A media representative of The View did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nBut others worry that the notice is part of a broader effort to curtail satire, comedy and comment.\n\n“This, to me, is the most shocking element of what this administration has been able to do, is to say that views, satire and humour are censored,” said Margot Susca, assistant professor of journalism at American University in Washington, DC.\n\nPutting out such notices could push the broadcasters’ parent organisations to limit their content, analysts say, citing instances of how the Paramount Skydance merger was approved only after it settled a lawsuit over Harris’s interview on 60 Minutes.\n\n“For-profit corporations are not known for their bravery,” said Public Knowledge’s Field. “They may keep their heads down and views in check.”\n\nBerkeley’s Davis said that “it costs money to stand up for principle,” and that the administration’s “understanding of the financial needs of media corporations is unprecedented.”\n\nLarge corporations often have mergers pending or licence issues, said Sohn, “so departments can extract a pound of flesh when there isn’t even an issue.”\n\nThe notice may also be “intended to drive a wedge between broadcasters and affiliates”, argued Sohn. “It could be that Disney asks Kimmel not to have political candidates, or the affiliate may preempt the show since the burden also falls on stations.”\n\nSohn had been nominated by Biden for the FCC, but withdrew her nomination after a protracted and fraught confirmation process.\n\nLast fall, when Kimmel made comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer, FCC commissioner Carr said affiliates could preempt, or drop the show, which Nextstar and Sinclair, the two biggest owners of television stations, did. Even after a public outrage reinstated Kimmel’s show, the two did not bring back Kimmel’s show for days.\n\n“Public outrage is the best tonic,” Sohn said, referring to the outcry that led ABC to bring back Kimmel. “But there are so many outrages.”\n\n‘Control the narrative’\n\nWhile broadcasters’ licences for free airwaves come with a public service responsibility, the FCC notice said daytime and late-night shows have been partisan.\n\nBut others, such as Berkeley’s Davis, say notices like this serve to “control the narrative, not inform the public”.\n\n“The executive branch getting so powerful and increasing concentration of media ownership in corporate hands have created two forms of power that have colluded in ways that undermine media independence,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt is a pattern American University’s Susca said she saw in other countries with sliding democratic standards and has written about in her forthcoming book Media Plutocracy, to be published by the University of Massachusetts Press.\n\n“Hungary was the most glaring example where media ownership was concentrated in the hands of wealthy people who were aligned with President Orban,” she said. “This led to media restrictions and has meant that media independence was gone and any accountability on journalism disappeared in 15 years of Orban.”\n\nStern of the Freedom of Press Foundation said that, while there are comparisons with developments in Russia and Hungary, where media acquisitions have been steered towards favourable owners leading to a slide in media independence, these aren’t the only such cases.\n\n“There are many precedents. Some of what we are seeing is old, and some new, but the value of these comparisons is limited because Trump is a unique figure in a unique time”.\n\nMore conservative analysts have accused the media of having a liberal bias that they have battled to correct. For instance, when Harris appeared in a 90-second Saturday Night Live last year and made jokes such as the US public “wants to end the dramala”, Suhr’s Center for American Rights filed a complaint for equal time. NBC then filed a public file offering equal time to Trump, who made a 90-second speech asking voters to vote for him.\n\nThe Center for American Rights did not respond to a request for comment by Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile these battles are being fought over broadcasters’ right to air, Berkeley’s Davis pointed out that “this is a time for convergence. I watch Kimmel on YouTube,” where viewers could see the show, even when Nextstar and Sinclair did not air it, and the Communication Act rules do not apply.\n\nViewers, of all political views, are increasingly turning to social media for their news, opinions and humour, data shows.\n\n“I like more speech, not less. Limiting it could be a concerning impact of this,” Sohn said.","summary":"Critics say such actions and increasing corporate ownership of media is causing a backsliding in US media freedom.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/6/us-fcc-notice-to-broadcasters-prompts-concerns-on-curtailing-free-speech?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24282559377967-1770407498.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 21:02:57","author":"Apps Support,Saumya Roy","authors":["Apps Support","Saumya Roy"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.2},{"id":400195606,"title":"Celebrities for Illegal Immigration","text":"When the behaviour of celebrities becomes a matter for the rest of us, however, is when they take it upon themselves to pontificate on politics, as politics is in the public, not the private, arena.

Although, after Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, you would have thought they might have learned the lesson that when the rich and famous lecture ordinary people, it tends to end very badly for them. Not only do celeb endorsements not work, but they can also have a repelling effect. Beyoncé and Bruce ‘The Boss’ Springsteen sure helped cook Kamala’s goose.

Then Lewis Hamilton, arriving at the same hotel about an hour later. And by the next morning, anyone who reads the paper or scrolls past Deuxmoi likely saw the rumor that the Skims mogul and Formula 1 driver enjoyed a romantic getaway in the English countryside.\nAnd for those familiar with the region, their bolt-hole of choice was no surprise: Estelle Manor in Oxfordshire.\nHotel is a simplified term to describe Estelle Manor. It, yes, has 108 guest rooms tucked away in its neo-Jacobean, Grade II listed landmark house that one can book for around $1,500 a night on the weekends. (It’s a little less in the winter, and a little more in the summer.) And yes, it's by hospitality Ennismore (who also own the buzzy Gleneagles Townhouse in Edinburgh.) But it’s also a private club, where members have access to the 85-acre estate, its restaurants, spa, fitness center, and lounge. Many members own homes in the area, while others are social-loving young urbanites who belong to Maison Estelle—its sister club in London’s Mayfair. Just some of the famous faces spotted off its Grafton Street entrance? Angelina Jolie, Kate Moss, and Princess Beatrice.\nMaison Estelle opened in 2021, making it a relatively new addition to London’s competitive private-club scene, which also includes the currently white-hot Roof Gardens and the young-aristo favorite 5 Hertford Street in London. Then there are technically public spaces with doors so tight that they’re essentially private, like The Fat Badger in Notting Hill. To remain “cool,” each club must have an edge.\nMaison Estelle’s sharpness comes from its Cotswolds outpost. “Estelle Manor—a place where attractive, tartan-clad couples frolic around a magnificently manicured Jacobean mansion,” a frequent Estelle Manor guest joked to Vanity Fair. “The only place I’ve been where falconry and padel are listed next to each other on the activities menu.”\nFor starters, it’s designed by Roman and Williams, an interiors firm run by Robin Standefer and Stephen Alesch. Even if you don’t know their names, you know their work. It’s a staple in the pages of Architectural Digest and World of Interiors; clients include David Zwirner and Gwyneth Paltrow. (They designed the Goop founder’s Montecito home and at-home spa.) And those are just private residential homes. In the public space, they redecorated the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s British Galleries and are busy renovating the Hearst Building in San Francisco into an Auberge hotel.\n\"We designed Estelle Manor to take the rules of the country-house hotel and break them—it’s not stiff or precious; it’s cinematic and alive. You come for the beauty, but you stay for the energy,” Robin Standefer, co-founder of Roman and Williams, says of their work for Estelle Manor.\nAfter entering through a stone gate by architect Charles Barry—who rebuilt the Palace of Westminster in the mid-19th-century—guests step into the manor’s grand hall. Inspired by the watercolor paintings of J.M.W. Turner as well as 17th- and 18th-century Orientalist paintings, it’s rooms are dotted with rich ochre velvet floral furniture, fringed ottomans, black lacquered side tables. Antique vases sit on the surfaces, contemporary paintings hang on the walls.\nThen there’s the Eynsham Baths: a palatial spa, inspired by Roman ruins, that houses a tepidarium, caldarium, and hammam, all more than 32,000 square feet.

(Photo: AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nFebruary 6, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Trump sparks fury with video depicting Obamas as monkeys \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States — US President Donald Trump triggered outrage Friday after he posted a video depicting Barack Obama, the first Black president in American history, and his wife Michelle as monkeys.\n\nTop Democrats condemned the post as “racist,” even as the White House rejected what it called “fake outrage” and said the video posted late Thursday on Trump’s Truth Social account was from an “internet meme.”\n\nNear the end of the one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Republican Trump’s 2020 election loss, the Obamas are shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.\n\nThe song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background when the Obamas appear.\n\nThe video repeats false allegations that ballot-counting company Dominion Voting Systems helped steal the 2020 election from Trump and hand victory to Joe Biden, who was Obama’s vice president at the time.\n\n“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to AFP.\n\n“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” added Leavitt.\n\nAs of early Friday morning, the video had been liked several thousand times on the president’s social media platform.\n\nThe office of California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and a prominent Trump critic, slammed the post.\n\n“Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now,” Newsom’s press office account posted on X.\n\nBen Rhodes, a former top national security advisor and close confidant to Barack Obama, also condemned the imagery.\n\n“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” he wrote on X.\n\n– ‘Birther’ conspiracy –\n\nObama is the only Black president in American history and backed Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBillionaire Trump launched his own political career by pushing the racist and false “birther” conspiracy theory that his Democratic predecessor was lying about being born in the United States.\n\nTrump has long had a bitter rivalry with Obama, who was president from 2009 to 2017, taking particular umbrage at the Democrat’s popularity and the fact that he won the Nobel peace prize.\n\nIn the first year of his second term in the White House, Trump has ramped up his use of hyper-realistic but fabricated AI visuals on Truth Social and other platforms, often glorifying himself while lampooning his critics.\n\nHe has used the provocative posts to rally his conservative base.\n\nLast year, Trump posted a video generated by artificial intelligence showing Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office and appearing behind bars in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nLater, he posted an AI clip of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — who is Black — wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero.\n\nJeffries called the image racist.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has drawn criticism from his opponents for leading a crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\n\nOne of Trump’s first acts was to terminate all federal government DEI programs, including related policies in the military.\n\nThe drive to rid the armed forces of what Trump has derided as “woke” initiatives has also seen the removal from some military academy bookshelves of scores of books that cover the US history of racial discrimination.\n\nUS federal anti-discrimination programs were born of the 1960s civil rights struggle, mainly led by Black Americans, for equality and justice after hundreds of years of slavery, whose abolition in 1865 saw other institutional forms of racism enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Silvera’s manslaughter plea accepted amid lack of evidence on shooting circumstances — ODPP \n\n\n …Prosecution outlines facts in Silvera case \n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) says it had no evidence capable of establishing what occurred inside the ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\", \"breaking-news\":\"Push Notifications\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market downturn hits Mayberry Jamaican Equities in 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Mayberry Jamaican Equities Limited reported a sharp reversal in performance in 2025 as a broad downturn on the Jamaica Stock Excha... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth woman charged after allegedly assaulting student \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — Police in St Elizabeth have charged a 45-year-old woman in connection with an alleged assault on a student in the parish.

Trump was in the clip as the lion, portraying himself as the ‘King of the Jungle.’ \n\nDemocrats and Republicans called on the President to remove the video, deeming it racist for its depiction of the Obamas as apes. “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.

The post also arrives ahead of a major test for the president in November's midterm elections. Republicans lost 42 House seats in 2018, and contests across the country will be seen as a referendum on his presidency.\n\nThroughout Trump's second term, and as recently as last week at an event with rap star Nicki Minaj, his administration has touted electoral gains made with Black voters in his 2024 election win over then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nKaroline Leavitt: 'Report on something that actually matters'\n\nSome members of Trump's own party decried the post, from the Senate's only Black Republican, Tim Scott, to Rep.

I had to explain that this was a sleight of hand, and that ultimately the restructured carbon tax would be just as harmful, but with the cost hidden from Canadian consumers, “which is why Mark Carney likes it.”That particular trick was very much in mind when Mr. Carney announced, at an auto parts manufacturing plant in Vaughan, Ontario, on February 5, what many media reports called his plan to “scrap the EV mandate.”Had he simply done that, we at Canadians for Affordable Energy would have applauded. I have been a firm opponent of the mandate for years. Banning Internal Combustion Engine vehicles and forcing Canadians to buy Electric Vehicles (EVs) is perverse. It isn’t what we want or need.But instead, the Prime Minister announced that he was replacing the EV mandate with a 75% tailpipe emissions reduction target by 2035 and an aspirational 90% reduction by 2040.Now, this might sound much better initially. “Wow, instead of banning the sale of gas cars, Mark Carney is going to reduce their carbon footprint!”Except a policy target for emissions reductions doesn’t equate to emissions reductions — that takes technological change, fleet changes, time, and money. Which really means that in 2035 — less than 10 years from today — when the only vehicles which conform to this standard are EVs, then, well, that’s all you will be able to buy..Much the same happened in the United States under the Biden Administration’s EPA, which tried to enact extremely strict tailpipe regulations as part of an attempted stealth EV mandate. The Republicans called Biden and Kamala Harris out on it, which was effective enough that Harris was forced to loudly proclaim that there was no EV mandate. Voters disagreed and sent the Republicans back to the White House to change course, which they have done, returning to Americans the freedom to buy the cars that meet their needs.The kicker? Biden’s original backdoor EV mandate regs stipulated a 50% cut in tailpipe emissions, well short of Carney’s 75% cut.Let me be blunt: Regulations that demand a 75% emissions cut on cars sold in Canada are the same thing as an EV mandate. There is essentially no difference.But Carney is making it even worse — proposing spending a massive amount of public money on subsidizing the EV industry in several ways.First, he is reinstating the federal EV purchase rebate — effectively a subsidy for the wealthy, as they are the people who can afford the luxury of an EV. This means thousands of taxpayer dollars per vehicle. Second, he wants to spend $1.5 billion of our tax dollars to build up the EV charging network, on top of the $1.2 billion the government has allocated to building charging stations over the past ten years. For the record, money spent to date has bought us roughly 36,000 stations, well short of the 450,000 Natural Resources Canada estimates that we would need to service an all-EV fleet by 2035..Third, he announced a further $3 billion, “to help the auto industry adapt, grow, and diversify to new markets.\" Translation — to give car companies money to help them keep their plants open in Canada while they figure out how to get out of the corner we’ve painted them into.This is becoming a characteristic play for Mr. Carney. The public starts to notice that one of his policies is making our lives harder, and he responds by rearranging the deck chairs, in the hopes that we will forget, for a little while at least, that his ship is steaming towards an iceberg.As with the carbon tax, he heard our complaints, and he did whatever he could to keep the old policy in place while making it harder to see it. “Sure, your cost of living is way up, but it can’t be the consumer carbon tax, because I cancelled it!” “Sure, there are no gasoline powered cars which can legally be sold in Canada, but the moment someone invents one, we’ll consider letting you buy it!”It’s a cynical move. Make sure you don’t fall for it.Dan McTeague is President of Canadians for Affordable Energy.","summary":"Nearly a year ago now, when Mark Carney enacted his carbon tax ploy, cutting the consumer tax while increasing the portion which targets industry and business, I found myself having frequent arguments with people about the move.

The White House initially defended the post before attributing it to staff error.The video, which Trump posted late Thursday at 11:44 pm, remained on his account for approximately 12 hours before being deleted. A White House official said that 'a White House staffer erroneously made the post' and confirmed it had been taken down. A source familiar with the matter later claimed Trump 'had not seen that video before it was posted', and ordered its removal upon discovering it.Republicans Break Ranks to Condemn PostThe deletion came after Senator Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate and chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, issued a sharp rebuke of the content. 'Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,' Scott wrote on X. 'The President should remove it.' His statement marked a rare public criticism from one of Trump's typically loyal defenders.Representative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican facing a competitive re-election, joined Scott's call for removal. 'The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,' Lawler stated.White House Initially Defends VideoBefore the video's removal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had dismissed the backlash in a statement to media outlets. 'This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,' Leavitt said. 'Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.'The roughly minute-long video primarily focused on false claims about voting machine irregularities during the 2020 presidential election. However, at approximately 58 seconds into the clip, it abruptly cut to a two-second segment showing the Obamas' faces superimposed onto the bodies of animated apes as 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' by The Tokens played in the background.Leavitt had referenced a longer video posted in October by the X user @xerias_x, which depicted Trump as a lion whilst various Democratic figures appeared as different animals, including Hillary Clinton as a warthog and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a donkey. However, the clip Trump shared only featured the Obamas' racist depiction.Democrats and Civil Rights Groups Condemn ImageryDemocratic leaders responded with forceful condemnation. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the post as evidence of Trump's character. 'President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans. They represent the best of this country,' Jeffries wrote. 'Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder.'California Governor Gavin Newsom's office called the video 'disgusting behaviour by the President' and demanded that 'every single Republican must denounce this'. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer simply labelled Trump's post 'racist', whilst former Obama advisor Ben Rhodes stated the video would 'haunt Trump and his racist followers'.The NAACP released a statement noting that 'Trump posting this video—especially during Black History Month—is a stark reminder of how Trump and his followers truly view people'. \nRepresentatives for the Obamas did not immediately respond to media requests for comment.Historical Context of Racist ImageryThe depiction of Black individuals as apes represents a long-standing racist trope historically used to dehumanise Black people and justify slavery. The incident occurred during Black History Month, which honours the accomplishments and contributions of African Americans throughout United States history.Trump has previously promoted racist content regarding the Obamas, including spending years amplifying the false 'birther' conspiracy theory claiming Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to serve as president. During the 2024 campaign, Trump also falsely claimed that former Vice President Kamala Harris 'turned Black'.The incident recalls a 2018 controversy when comedian Roseanne Barr was fired from her ABC sitcom after referring to Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, using 'Planet of the Apes' language. At that time, then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that 'no one is defending' Barr's comments, marking a contrast to Leavitt's initial defence of Trump's post.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-deletes-video-showing-obamas-apes-after-white-house-blames-erroneous-staffer-post-1777005","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1788926/trump-obama-apes.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b946995442d4c67041a5be85997fa36e","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 19:25:26","author":"Bernadette B.

What’s more, Wambsganss had 10 times as much money as Rehmet, including large checks from heavyweights like Texans for Lawsuit Reform and right-wing megadonor Tim Dunn’s PAC. \n\nBut Brian Mayes, a longtime Republican strategist, saw this coming. \n\nAfter last May, when a dozen local candidates endorsed by the Tarrant County GOP lost their elections, Mayes figured the party was heading toward more defeat. “It’s like when a football team loses, you can either go back and figure out why you lost and make hard decisions, or you don’t,” Mayes told the Texas Observer, and “you keep doing the same thing over and over.”\n\nWambganss has helped lead the school board culture wars that have dominated Tarrant County politics for much of the last five years, and as Mayes sees it, voters were ready for something different. It helped that Rehmet, a Machinists union leader, was a strong candidate whose focus on public education clearly resonated across party lines. \n\nKendall Scudder, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, put it bluntly. “We had a really good candidate, and they had a really bad candidate,” he told the Observer. \n\nWhile political observers have stopped short of saying this is the first break of an all-out anti-MAGA wave, voter data indicates that Republicans are more vulnerable than the party may realize—especially in Tarrant County, which is currently the largest red county in the nation and a key battleground in the 2026 elections. (With the Texas Legislature currently out of session, Rehmet is unlikely to cast a vote in the state Senate before he and Wambsganss rematch in the November general election for the seat’s full term.) \n\nRoss Hunt, a Republican data analyst who has been dissecting the numbers and sharing takeaways on his X feed, said the GOP lost the seat “because of the failure to persuade swing Republicans and right-leaning independents.”\n\nHunt wrote on X: “Republicans’ handpicked candidate for this working-and middle-class, 51% Fort Worth district was a socially conservative political operative from a wealthy suburb that makes up 4% of the District.” \n\nMeanwhile, Wambsganss’ opponent offered a stark contrast: He was “Mr. Tarrant County,” as Scudder put it. “He’s a union leader, veteran, very disciplined on his messaging and very hyper-focused on the working class and making life better for people,” Scudder said. “Leigh is a zealot who spends all of her time denigrating public school teachers and trying to dismantle public school institutions.”\n\nBut candidate quality alone, Scudder argues, can’t explain what he called a “perfect storm.” He credited an unusually coordinated Democratic effort that began months before the runoff. Specifically, the Texas Democratic Party (TDP) helped the Rehmet campaign make 1.5 million phone calls, knock on 20,000 doors and send 300,000 text messages. Nearly $150,000, about half of Rehmet’s campaign funds, came via the Texas Majority PAC, which is running a joint political operation with the TDP. \n\n“For the first time in a very long time, Democrats were operating as a team, moving in the same direction with the same goal, and that’s to win an election,” Scudder said.\n\nIn a statement to the Observer, Rehmet said broadening his tent was a central part of his strategy. “In the final days of the race, I spoke with voters from across the political spectrum, including many Republicans, and I was grateful for their honesty and openness,” Rehmet said. “We didn’t agree on everything but what consistently stood out was a shared respect and a willingness to listen to one another. At the end of the day, those conversations reminded me that most of us want the same things like safe communities, strong schools and a government that is effective.​​”\n\nThe Wambsganss campaign did not respond to a request for comment. On social media, Allen Blakemore, Wambsganss’ political consultant, blamed low turnout among Republicans for the surprise result. Just under 95,000 votes were cast, marking a 15 percent turnout rate for the runoff. \n\nBut Democratic party operatives have dismissed the notion that low turnout was the sole reason for Rehmet’s upset. He not only succeeded in peeling away GOP and independent voters, but was also able to mobilize Latino voters. Latinos make up slightly more than one in five eligible voters in Senate District 9, and in some largely Hispanic areas of Fort Worth, Rehmet outperformed Kamala Harris by 50 points. \n\nJason Villalba, a former Republican legislator who now runs a think tank focused on Latino voters, said at least some of that shift can be attributed to the Trump administration’s approach to immigration. “I think that trend is that Hispanics are not moving towards the GOP like they were in 2024,” Villalba said. “I think they are going back to their historic support for Democrats as they were in 2012 and 2016.”\n\nBut Tarrant County is also unique because of the prevalence of far-right Christian nationalists. For several years, a church called Mercy Culture has been amassing political influence on the local and national stage. (State Representative Nate Schatzline, a Mercy Culture pastor, recently joined President Trump’s faith advisory board.) The church effectively runs For Liberty & Justice, an organization that teaches conservative Christians how to run for office. The organization endorsed Wambsganns. \n\nAfter the Rehmet win, many Republican heavyweights gathered at an event hosted by For Liberty & Justice. Ken Paxton was there, as was Tarrant County Judge Tim O’Hare. “This is the time to stand up and fight, and this is the time that God calls us to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem, and that wall is Tarrant County,” O’Hare told attendees. \n\nMeanwhile, Allison Campolo, chair of the local Democratic Party, said Tarrant County Republicans have now cornered themselves by developing such close ties with groups like Mercy Culture. “All of our top Republicans are intimately tied with Mercy Culture,” Campolo said. “They either have to own that shit, which will lose them a lot of votes, or they have to separate themselves from it, which will also lose them a lot of votes.”\n\nIn other words, Campolo says the local Republican brand is in crisis: “You don’t get an over 30-point swing in Fort Worth, Texas, if your brand is okay.”","summary":"After Democrat Taylor Rehmet beat the GOP’s Leigh Wambsganss in the January 31 special runoff election for state Senate District 9 , Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick called the loss “a wake-up call for Republicans across Texas.” It’s been a common sentiment in the Republican Party in recent days, especially since a Democrat hasn’t won that [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post Does Taylor Rehmet’s Victory Foreshadow an Anti-MAGA Wave? appeared first on The Texas Observer.","url":"https://www.texasobserver.org/taylor-rehmet-special-election-upset-anti-maga-wave/","image":"https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rr2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 19:22:22","author":"Tyler Hicks","authors":["Tyler Hicks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.521},{"id":400159012,"title":"US to fund free speech activists in Europe – FT","text":"The US State Department will fund “MAGA-aligned think-tanks and charities” in Europe as Washington steps up its fight against censorship in the EU and UK, the Financial Times reported on Friday. State Department official Sarah Rogers discussed the plan with members of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party during a visit to London last year, three anonymous sources told the newspaper. Rogers, a vocal critic of European “hate speech” legislation, is spearheading the operation and will focus on supporting MAGA-friendly organizations in London, Paris, Berlin, and Brussels, one source said. Rogers has been in contact with “free speech” activists in the EU and UK, and is targeting the UK’s Online Safety Act and the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), they added. Republicans in Washington have accused Brussels of using the DSA to stifle free speech and censor American social media users. The plan mirrors decades-long initiatives by the US to fund liberal political, media, and civil society organizations in Europe. Many of these initiatives were shut down when US President Donald Trump cut almost all funding for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) last year.\n\nA State Department spokesperson described the latest funding plan as “a transparent, lawful use of resources to advance US interests and values abroad.” However, the Financial Times noted that it is “likely to cause consternation” among center-left governments in Europe, who fear that the US may actively work to undermine their power. The inverse of this scenario played out in 2024, when Britain’s center-left Labour government sent activists to the US to campaign against Trump for then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump’s most senior officials have repeatedly criticized the EU and UK over censorship laws such as the Online Safety Act and DSA. Speaking at last year’s Munich Security Conference, Vice President J.D. Vance warned that future US support for Europe would depend on whether governments actually uphold freedom of speech. The Trump administration’s national security strategy went further, warning that mass immigration, censorship, and single-minded commitment to funding the Ukraine conflict have left the continent at risk of “civilizational erasure.” Accordingly, “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” is a key foreign policy goal of the Trump administration, it states.","summary":"The US State Department is reportedly building a network to oppose censorship laws in the EU and UK \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/632133-us-funding-censorship-europe/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2026.02/article/69863572203027167078e3d5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 19:01:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":400159734,"title":"Ben Shapiro Is Waging Battle Inside the MAGA Movement","text":"Listen and subscribe: Apple | Spotify | Wherever You Listen\nSign up for our daily newsletter to get the best of The New Yorker in your inbox.\n\nEarlier this week, I spoke with Shapiro for The New Yorker Radio Hour, mainly about the battles within the MAGA movement in which he is currently engaged. Recently, Shapiro has gone into attack mode against some of his fellow MAGA media stars, including Tucker Carlson, for their indulgence, if not outright support, of antisemites like Nick Fuentes. It is a drama that has implications not only for the Trump era but for what might follow. J. D. Vance, for one, has refused to join Shapiro in rebuking Carlson. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nYou worked at Breitbart, which was an ur-publication of the MAGA movement. You were acquainted with Steve Bannon and all kinds of people. When you look back on your Breitbart days, what do you think was positive about that time, and what do you look back on with some regret?\nI had worked at Talk Radio Network, which was the syndicator for Michael Savage and Laura Ingraham, and then I ended up being hired by Andrew. I’d known Andrew since I was at U.C.L.A.—\nAndrew Breitbart, the founder of the publication. Who died in his forties.\nYeah, he was very young. I’d known Andrew for about ten years. He came to me and said, “Will you come on board and join Breitbart?” It was the middle of the 2012 election cycle, and he died three, four weeks after I’d signed on. Suddenly the leadership structure was completely upended, because Andrew had been sort of a one-man band. He was the person from whom all thoughts sort of sprang, in terms of the direction of the site. The leadership structure changed pretty dramatically. Steve Bannon—who’d been kind of hanging around on the fringes of the Breitbart universe; he’d been making a documentary about Andrew—was brought in by Larry Solov, who was Andrew’s [business] partner, to essentially be president of Breitbart.\nDid you have problems with Steve Bannon and the like, and their treatment of rhetoric and truth or non-truth and conspiracy theory, when you first encountered it?\nIt was never, sort of, a bed of roses with Steve Bannon. There are a lot of people in the Breitbart infrastructure who are not fond of Steve, or the way that he was running things, making editorial decisions and the like. I think that there were some wonderful things—\nBut how did you assess what Steve Bannon wanted in this world? He wasn’t just a conservative. He was and remains a kind of MAGA warrior who’s willing to say and do what is necessary to push that battle forward. And I’m being gentle about this.\nYeah, I mean, if you look at Breitbart’s coverage circa, say, 2012 or 2013, those were fairly mainstream conservative talking points. It was certainly a mainstream conservative website at that time. I think by the time we hit 2015, 2016, things had started to evolve, especially because of the rise of President Trump. I was not a supporter of President Trump in the 2015-2016 election cycle. I was much more supportive of Ted Cruz in the primaries, and then, in the general election, I actually didn’t vote, because I was unhappy with both candidates.\nObviously, after that, President Trump did many things that, as a conservative, I like. He’s certainly a non-ideological figure, which is why so many people try to sort of claim that MAGA is a part of their movement. You have Reagan conservatives who will say that MAGA is Reagan conservatism. You’ll have national populists who say that it’s national populist. Trump is none of those things. Trump is Trump, and he has instincts—\nWhich means what to you, Ben? “Trump is Trump” means what?\nHis instincts are sort of naturally those of a 1975 conservative. That means that he likes a strong America on the world stage, but tempered by a sort of hard-nosed realism about non-interventionism. When it comes to domestic policy, he has a weird mix of not liking the government to be involved in everything, but also wanting to use the government in ways that I don’t particularly approve of. He seems to be more about: What is the solution at hand? Will I try it? And then, if it doesn’t work, then he pulls out of it. People have termed that “TACO”—“Trump Always Chickens Out.” I don’t think that’s right. I think that President Trump is a person who is willing to try different things and then will shift on a dime if he thinks those things aren’t working.\nDo you think Trump is honest?\nIn some ways yes and in some ways no.\nThere was an article in the Wall Street Journal just a couple of days ago describing the fishy investments from Abu Dhabi into the Trump family. Our reporter, David Kirkpatrick, who’s extremely conservative in his calculations, has said that the Trump family has enriched itself to the tune of four billion dollars since taking office again in 2024. Does this concern you at all?\nOf course. I’ve been calling this out since, I think, before pretty much anybody else. I mean, early on in the Trump Administration, when World Liberty Financial was pretty clearly making a fair bit of money over in the Middle East, I raised red flags on my show, consistently, about how I thought this was wrong. If the name were Biden instead of Trump, people would be screaming bloody murder. And this was not beneficial to President Trump’s agenda, either. So, sure, that concerns me.\nNot beneficial to his agenda, or corrupt?\nI mean—both, obviously. I do think that if you are taking what I perceive to be digital assets that are not particularly worthwhile, and then you have people who are politically interested in investing massive amounts of money into those things, that is not a good thing.\nYou voted for him the second time?\nI voted for him in 2020, and then I campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nBecause it was now a binary choice between Trump and Kamala Harris, and I liked a lot of what he did during his first Administration. I felt the guardrails would largely hold, which I believe they have, with regard to President Trump. I know many on the left believe they’ve not, but what I would say is that—\nYou believe the guardrails have held this time?\nYes. I’m hard-pressed to see—\nHelp me on that, Ben.\nThe Trump Administration has not bucked the judiciary by saying that if an appellate court or the Supreme Court rules in a particular way, it will still go ahead and do whatever it is it wants to do. The President does cite legal authority for the things that he’s doing—\nSo, you’re confident that the Justice Department will pursue corruption charges against the Trump family?\nNo, I’m confident that the President will likely pardon himself and his children in the same way that Joe Biden did on his way out. [Laughs.]\nYou’re laughing, but that’s radically corrupt, is it not?\nI think that it was radically corrupt when the D.O.J. did not pursue, with alacrity, a lot of the issues surrounding the Biden family, too. So the answer is yes, and it applies to all parties. What I hear from the left is a constant drumbeat of accusations about President Trump, to which I acquiesce, in part, but I find them utterly unconcerned with the same sorts of issues arising on their side of the aisle. They see President Trump as the person who’s constantly violating the standard, the person who’s constantly setting the new standard, the person who is responsible for the death of American politics, or the decay of American politics.\nAnd, as I’ve said publicly before, I think President Trump stumbled on the prone body of American politics and said, “This is a dead body.” I see him much more as a coroner than as the murderer. Now, that doesn’t mean that there’s not some of both, meaning that I think things can get worse under President Trump than they were heretofore, and I’m not going to deny that he’s done things that I think are bad and wrong. I was very critical of his rhetoric, for example, between the election of 2020 and January 6th. But I do think that—\nBut do you not see any of these things as disqualifying, in a moral-political sense? January 6th, for example.\nI don’t know what disqualifying means, in the sense that I did not support him in the primaries—\nThat he would lose your faith and vote and support forever.\nWell, I mean, the only way to lose my faith and support and vote forever would be for there to be an alternative that I find superior to him. This is the problem when you’re making voting decisions. Would I want Donald Trump marrying into my family? Probably not. The problem is that once you say that the candidate is “disqualified,” then you either have to sit out the election—which I did in 2016. And then whatever damage President Trump had, I thought, done by being elected in 2016, he did a bunch of things I liked between 2016 and 2020, and then I did not like what he did with regard to the election of 2020, and the falsehoods that he told about winning that election. And then I didn’t support him in the primaries, and then he ended up winning the nomination. He was running against Kamala Harris. So I can either sit out the election again, which doesn’t really achieve the—\nSo what you’re saying is that the potential of Kamala Harris, in your view, politically, outweighs the support for what, in essence, was an insurrection on Capitol Hill? That’s hard for me, to say the least.\nI think that that’s a pretty poor way of putting it. That’s not the way that we assess candidates in the real world. The way that we assess candidates in the real world is: Who is more likely to perform the agenda that I see as important versus who is more likely to inhibit that agenda. And so I can fully disapprove of what happened on January 6th and think it was quite terrible, and still acknowledge that Donald Trump as President, from 2017 to 2021, did a better job than Joe Biden did.\nThere are many people in the Republican Party who consider themselves Never Trumpers. Not a decisive number, certainly, but there are a number of people who see his moral transgressions as so serious that they make a very different calculation than you do, electorally.\nI mean, sure. And they’re entitled to that calculation. The question to me is always one of iteration. Voting is one decision, but just because you vote for someone doesn’t mean that you support everything that they do.\nBen, what initially attracted you to conservatism?\nI grew up in a household with two Reagan Republicans—my parents are pretty conservative. The basic idea that lies behind a good conservatism, I think, is personal responsibility, duty, a requirement that you do the right thing, a basic moral stance about how individuals should act in a free country. And I think that’s still largely what drives my conservatism today.\nA kind of personal rectitude.\n\nDo you find that that’s antithetical to liberalism?\nIt doesn’t have to be, but I think that liberalism very often is a way of shielding people from the consequences of their own decisions, or an attempt to shift individual responsibility onto systems in a way that is frequently unjustified.\nThe difference between right and left—in my definition of it—is that the right acknowledges that when people fail, because human nature is fallible, very often that is your own responsibility. And the best way to actually treat that problem is to self-correct. And the left, because they have, I think, a rosier view of what human nature is, tends to attribute to systems that which I think more properly lies in responsibility with the individual.\nHow much did religion influence your becoming a conservative? You were raised an Orthodox Jew—I think you’re still a practicing Orthodox Jew, am I correct?\nYes, that’s right. We became Orthodox when I was eleven. So I remember eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken. But I was fairly young when we became Orthodox. My mom and dad started going to a synagogue down in Venice Beach, actually, and they were very taken with the rabbi, and I think that they got more and more interested in that. They decided that they wanted to send me to a Jewish day school. And so I’d go to the Jewish day school—it was an Orthodox school—and I’d come home and say, “Mom and Dad, I don’t understand why we’re doing X, Y, and Z, when at school they’re teaching me that this is what we’re supposed to be doing.” And my parents were, I think, smart enough to see the inherent conflict, and, instead of saying, “Your school is doing it wrong,” or “You’re doing it wrong,” or “They’re teaching the wrong thing,” they said “Well, we’re probably doing it wrong,” and so probably we need to actually rectify that breach.\nLet’s talk about the debate that you’re having inside MAGA. You’re at the center of a fight—a feud—that’s developing in the conservative movement, and it has to do with antisemitism and conspiracy theories related to antisemitism. Not long after Charlie Kirk died, you spoke at the Turning Point USA Conference, America Fest, and you called out Candace Owens and attendees like Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson—these are very influential figures now on the right, and the media, of the MAGA movement. Talk to me a little bit about this divide, how it’s developed, and what it’s done to your relationships inside the MAGA movement.\nFirst of all, as people may suspect, I’m not particularly interested in my personal relationships with others in the political sphere. I have a family that’s very tight-knit. I have four children, going on five. I have a dog. I have plenty of things going on in my social calendar, and I don’t see it as particularly important to hang out with people who are in sort of the same career milieu.\nThere were two speeches that I gave back to back. One was a speech that I gave at the Heritage Foundation the night before, and one was the T.P.U.S.A. speech that I gave that night. The Heritage Foundation speech was specifically directed at Tucker Carlson, because I believe that Tucker Carlson is not a conservative in any real marked way that I can identify, and I was pointing that out at the Heritage Foundation.\nHow would you describe his politics?\nConspiratorial populism would probably be a fair descriptor of his politics.\nOur colleague Jason Zengerle knew him as a young wise-guy reporter who leaned, maybe, center right. What happened to Tucker Carlson?\nI try not to speculate about people’s motivations because I don’t have a window into their head. All I can say is that the stuff that he has been promoting for the past several years is very much in line with the philosophies of people like Alexander Dugin.\nThe Russian nationalist philosopher, said to be close to the thinking of Vladimir Putin.\nYes. Carlson’s view of America in the world is a view that is actually closer to Howard Zinn than to that of traditional conservatives. This idea that America is a nefarious and terrible force in the world that has committed myriad sins and must withdraw from the world, both for its own good and for the good of the world. His belief that a conspiratorial coterie of people is manipulating American policy. Those people very often happen to have crossover with Jews, according to his guests whom he routinely launders onto the air.\nSo, when it came to T.P.U.S.A., in the aftermath of Charlie [Kirk]’s death, Candace Owens, in particular, had started speculating, openly, that people at T.P.U.S.A.—up to and including, in my interpretation, Erika Kirk, Charlie’s wife—had been complicit in his murder or at least complicit in a coverup of his murder. Her bizarre conspiratorial rantings had been treated as legitimate and worthwhile by people ranging from Tucker Carlson to Megyn Kelly. And so I felt that it was necessary to make a speech about the gap that has emerged on the right between a conspiratorial view of politics—that sort of conspiratorialism has taken over large parts of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\nCandace Owens is, I believe, somebody that you worked with at the Daily Wire?\nYeah, we hired her in 2021—\nWhat did you see in her then?\n—and then we fired her in 2023. In 2021, what we saw was a fairly mainstream conservative who said inflammatory things, and who had been telling us that she—\nInflammatory things that you liked?\nMost of them I liked, some of them not as much. And so, as people who hired her, we thought that she was going to develop in intellectual directions. She had said that she was learning with Shelby Steele, for example, and reading the works of Thomas Sowell, and this kind of thing. But, by 2022, it was apparent that she was moving in another direction, and then it took until 2023 for that direction to come to full fruition—\nAnd what was the direction in 2023?\nBy 2023, she was spouting antisemitic conspiracy theories, among other conspiracy theories, including the idea that Emmanuel Macron’s wife is actually a man, and this sort of stuff.\nSo that was your limit with her?\nWell, to be fair, I am not an officer of my company. The people who made that decision were Jeremy Boreing and Caleb Robinson, the co-C.E.O.s of the company.\nYou specifically criticized Tucker Carlson for a really soft interview he did with a guy named Nick Fuentes, who is, I think it’s fair to say, a Nazi apologist. You said, “If you have that person on your show and you proceed to glaze him, you ought to own it.” You point out how outrageous he is. But isn’t that exactly what Carlson wants in his guest? Attention?\nI mean, I think that the attention doesn’t hurt, but, at the same time, I think there is probably some ideological overlap between some of the things that he believes about America and some of the stuff that Nick Fuentes believes. Tucker has a habit of bringing on guests who spout the most conspiratorial form of a theory, and then he sort of buys it back about five per cent. And then he allows those views to be predominant in the public discourse while talking about what wonderful people these folks are.\nI get that, and I can’t help but agree with that. But then you have Donald Trump, who had dinner with Nick Fuentes. How does that affect your feeling about Donald Trump?\nI mean, I condemned that at the time. When it comes to his dinner with Fuentes, and I believe it was Kanye West—\nA good combination.\nYeah, pretty awful combination. People say that I grade on a curve, but I think I grade realistically here: I’m not surprised by what President Trump does. He likes being with famous people. He very often does not know who they are. He will say bad things about them five minutes later. He is as inconstant as the changing wind when it comes to his feelings about people. He will like Steve Bannon until he calls him “Sloppy Steven” and fires him, whereupon he will welcome him back into his orbit and like him again. And so these sort of—\nBut you’re taking this too casually. He’s having dinner with a Nazi apologist.\nI didn’t take that casually.\nAnd then doesn’t go off and blast him. He just kind of says, “Oh, I kind of didn’t know who it was, and Kanye brought him along.” First of all, that’s bad staff work, to say the least—\nTerrible staff work.\nAnd it’s bad behavior on the part of the President of the United States, no?\nI agree that it’s bad behavior on the part of the President of the United States. I’m not sure what else to say about that.\nAt America Fest, Vice-President Vance said this: “President Trump didn’t build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless self-defeating purity tests. I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or de-platform, and I don’t really care if some people out there, I’m sure, will have the fake-news media denounce me after this speech.” He was attacking you, wasn’t he?\nI mean, I assume that he was disagreeing with the thing that I had said, sure. And I will point out that I don’t think the Vice-President is being very accurate about his own approach to various conservatives and other people online. He’s quite fond of attacking people online from time to time.\nI remember when a bunch of young Republican leaders had their Signal chat exposed and they were making all kinds of antisemitic remarks. The Vice-President didn’t denounce that either. In fact, he just thought it was, you know, kids being kids.\nAnd again, I highly disagree with this as both a matter of morality and as a matter of tactics. I think tactically it’s foolish. I think it’s immoral.\nThen what’s going on? This is so prevalent and excused at the top end of—at least part of—the conservative media sphere and the White House.\nI mean, I think it’s a mirror image of what’s going on on the left. I think to pretend that antisemitism is not rising on both the right and the left is to be whistling past the graveyard. And one of the things—\nFair enough. But stick to the right, and anatomize that.\nBut the reason that I’m pointing this out—\nBecause they’re in office—\nI understand, but Democrats would like to be in office. And so to go back to the original point with regard to President Trump and voting for him and not voting for him—if the question is binary choice, then you’re going to have to make a decision between one of these parties. These are the two major parties. And so that’s why I think it’s important to bring into perspective what’s happening in both parties.\nBut Ben, do you see antisemitism in the mouths of leading Democratic contenders for the Presidency?\nI see antisemitism in the Democratic Party apparatus’s willingness to not only humor but to promote everybody ranging from New York mayor Zohran Mamdani to Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman from Michigan, to Ilhan Omar, the congresswoman from Minnesota, to the bizarre attempt to mirror all of the excesses of the anti-Israel movement. And I don’t just mean anti-Netanyahu—I mean anti-Israel.\nListen, I asked Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, about this. I was on Gavin’s podcast, and he acknowledged that this sort of stuff has become quite prevalent in Democratic circles. So the reason that I’m pointing this out is, No. 1, because I think it’s important, just as a matter of description, to be realistic about the rise of antisemitism in the United States, period. And then I’m happy to discuss the problems on my own side of the political aisle—which I have, repeatedly.\nDid the degree of antisemitism on the right take you by surprise?\nYes. The rise of it over the course of the last couple of years has certainly taken me by surprise. The willingness to aid and abet and promote antisemitic conspiracy theories has been shocking.\nTo understand what’s happening, I think we first have to understand what antisemitism actually is, because when people mischaracterize the definition, that allows their particular side to escape. So people tend to define antisemitism in a way that excuses their side, and that throws all of the blame on the other side. What they will say is “Well, I’m just anti-Israel, I’m not antisemitic,” or “I’m not personally antisemitic, I’m just against Jewish control of the media.”\nThe definition of antisemitism—antisemitism at its root—is a conspiracy theory about the power of Jews as a group in the world. And that can be channelled into an anti-Zionism that says that Israel is controlling American foreign policy, and that Israel has befuddled the world, and it’s all about the Benjamins—which is the kind of thing that Ilhan Omar says—or it can be channelled into: Jews in America are too powerful in the media and they’re cliquish and they are controlling the circumstances of my life.\nAnd yet, Ben, as somebody who’s written from Israel and Palestine for years and years—the reaction to some of the things I write is that I’m an antisemite, which is, I’ve got to say, news to me. And so I worry that that term, which is highly potent, is slung around in a very dangerous way sometimes.\nSo this is why I’m trying to be more precise about the definition. Being critical of Israeli policy is not the same thing as saying, for example, that Israel’s government designed and implemented a genocide, which is a lie, and that is a lie that can be chalked up to a nefarious view of what Jews are doing in the world, because it is also part and parcel of a broader lie, which is that the Jews have then sold the idea that they’re capable of doing whatever they want under the guise of America’s banner, and they’ve done so because of their inordinate power. It’s part of a broader conspiracy theory.\nThis is why I’m trying to be particularistic in my definition about what antisemitism is. I think the broad definition of antisemitism as sort of a subset of racism is wrong. I think that that definition is both overbroad and under-inclusive. What you end up with is the emptying out of antisemitism as a worthwhile category that actually bears weight in American life. Much the same way that the right said, for a long time, “You keep calling everybody racist, therefore nobody’s a racist,” which is untrue, right? There are actual racists out there.\n\nBut the idea is that if you over-apply a category, then it starts losing its power and its effectiveness, and that actually opens the door to the thing. I think the same thing has happened with antisemitism. And so what I’ve said before is: instead of talking in categories of antisemitism, or Jew hatred, or the rest of it, why don’t we talk about what’s true and what’s false and what’s moral and what’s not moral, because that’s easier for people to get their head around.\nLet me ask you about another extremely potent issue, not just in the Republican Party, and that’s the Epstein files. What do you think they prove or don’t prove, other than the absolute hideous nature of the subject himself?\nLet’s put it this way: The virality of the narrative around the Epstein files says something different from what the evidence shows. What the evidence shows in the Epstein files is that you have a number of very high-profile people who were in close contact with Jeffrey Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender with minors. The indictments against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell suggest that the trafficking of minors was about Jeffrey Epstein. There’s no one else who’s been indicted in terms of trafficking of minors except for Jeffrey Epstein. And, according to the F.B.I. under President Trump, there is no one who’s going to be, because they do not have sufficient evidence that he was trafficking young girls to other people.\nThe narrative that has been drawn from the Epstein story—because, presumably, people don’t know where his money comes from, although there was a deep dive, I believe, in the New York Times Magazine, looking into where his money came from—the narrative is a broader one that goes back to the conspiracy theorizing that has taken over large swaths of both parties, but it is very, very potent on the right. And that is that there is a cadre of people who are preying upon children, who manipulate everything in your life, who may be doing so because they have been honey-potted or because they’re being manipulated by a foreign intelligence service. On the far right, this is treated as Mossad, even though there is zero evidence that that is the case. Ehud Barak’s name is brought up in this context. As you might imagine, I’m not a fan of Ehud Barak, but there is no evidence that, on behalf of Mossad, he was running Jeffrey Epstein as a sex-trafficking agent. By the way, it’d be pretty terrible statecraft, considering that Epstein was already a convicted sex offender.\nBut I think that the broader theory here, which goes well beyond the evidence and the virality of that theory, speaks to people’s belief that they’re not in control of their own lives. I think this gets back to some of my original politics, that individual responsibility is the lodestar of a successful society. And when you have conspiratorialism take over, as Karl Popper suggested, it’s a massive problem.\nAre Donald Trump and the MAGA movement healthy for this country? Do you see promise in the people that have been put forward as successors to Donald Trump, J. D. Vance among them?\nI have differential opinions on a wide variety of these people. If the Vice-President were in a primary with Marco Rubio, I would be likely to support Marco Rubio in that primary over J. D. Vance. Are there options that I like better than others? Sure. Are there things about the Trump movement that I think have been good and salutatory? Sure. Is he my ideal? If I could construct in my head the ideal Republican candidate or President, would it look exactly like Donald Trump? No, but I’m not sure that he’s claiming to be that, nor do I have that magical power, try as I might, to manifest that in real life.\nWhat do you think Donald Trump cares about?\nI try not to get into motivations because I’m not a psychiatrist, but here’s the nice thing about President Trump. When you asked if he was honest—whatever is in his head is going to come out of his mouth in the next two-point-seven seconds. There is no brain-mouth barrier for President Trump.\nThat’s not so much honesty as impulsivity, no?\nWell, I mean, it’s honesty in the sense that you are getting his honest take on what he thinks in that moment. It may be an impulsive approach to honesty, but there is a definition of honesty by which it serves.\nIt’s revealing, I’ll give you that.\nIt is revealing. It is authentic—if you want to call it authentic, it’s authentic. But as far as “What is the core of his political belief?” Again, I think he has an instinct that he wants America to be great and powerful in the world. He likes the symbolism of America being great and powerful in the world. America is strong, America is virile. These are things that clearly he does believe. And so the way that manifests, in policy, may be grabbing Nicolás Maduro and taking him back to New York for trial, or it may be an industrial policy that is more reminiscent of a 1937 F.D.R. policy than it is of a traditional sort of Reagan Republican policy.\nOr finding more to be sympathetic about with Vladimir Putin than with Volodymyr Zelensky. It’s a pretty slippery slope.\nYeah. So when it comes to Putin and Zelensky, again, that one I cannot explain from a sort of America-great perspective. I think that the President—\nCan’t you explain it? I mean, can’t you explain it in terms of: he is impressed by, taken with, the kind of authoritarian impulses and behavior of Putin? Same with Xi Jinping.\nI think that he is attracted by powerful people, for sure. But he has sort of varied, fairly widely, actually, over the course of the last year and a half in terms of the things that he’s been saying on Russia-Ukraine. I’ve been very consistent that I think that we ought to be supporting Ukraine sufficiently enough to deter the Russian threat, and to force Putin to the table.\nI want to ask you about Minneapolis. From a free-speech point of view, from a First Amendment point of view, should somebody like Don Lemon be prosecuted?\nI mean, if what he was doing was performing an act of journalism, then the answer is no. The question is going to be whether they can prove in court that he was actually a conspirator in violation of the FACE Act.\nAre you worried about Donald Trump’s regard for journalists? He’s obviously infatuated with them—he loves to talk to them. But he refers to them as enemies of the people. And, you know, as a student of history, that’s a phrase that comes from Robespierre, it comes from Stalin, and it has consequences.\nI mean, he’s been doing that for ten years, and you seem to have a robust audience and the ability to speak freely every day. I don’t think that you’re sitting in your studio right now waiting for the F.B.I. to break down your door.\nYou think he’s just kidding around? The F.B.I. had no problem breaking down the door of a Washington Post reporter and taking all her devices recently.\nAnd, if you go back to the Obama Administration, James Rosen was treated quite similarly when he was working for Fox News. And then the Associated Press, I think, had some situations with the Obama Administration, as well. This is why I go back to: Is Trump breaking new ground here or is he using tools that were left over from other Administrations in ways that people don’t like? I don’t like it, either. I mean, him suing various outlets, I think, is wrong and bad. Do I think that we are now facing a grave threat that the First Amendment has ended in the United States because Don Lemon was picked up by the D.O.J.? I don’t.\nBut Ben, sooner or later, he’s not going to like what you say, and your turn is going to come and you’re going to be deposed, and you’re going to be sued. Will that change your view of this?\nNot particularly. Again, I think that it’s wrong for him to do the suing of these outlets. So I’m not sure what would change about my opinion, given that I’ve said already that I think that it’s wrong. It might hurt more, if he did it to me.\nLet me get a little insight about—\nYou’ve noticed that I’m not excusing any of the things that I think he’s doing that are wrong.\n\nAnd this is why, one of the things that I think that if people on the opposite side of the aisle actually wanted to be shooting for a better future here, which is, I think, what we would all like, it is not enough to simply rail against Trump and say this is not normal. It is why I think the people on the left should do some of the same with their own side. Much of what we’ve talked about here is me criticizing my own side. I’d say ninety per cent of what we’ve talked about is me criticizing my own side. But I find an extraordinary dearth of that, unfortunately, on the left. And I think people do react by supporting the right. And this is one of the things that I think is a huge mistake on the part of the media, is to sort of play this game where Trump does a thing, therefore it is a bad thing. People on the left do the same thing; they are opposing Trump, therefore it’s a good thing. And that seems to me completely problematic. I’m perfectly willing to, on each of these specific problems, say: if the evidence shows that Donald Trump is targeting Don Lemon—\nBen, there is no question that every President, and I’ll just say it unequivocally, every President, sooner or later, lies. Every President, sooner or later, misbehaves. We’re talking, though, about a radical difference in degree, are we not?\nI mean, I really do not think so.\nThat’s where we disagree. A lot.\nWe definitely disagree on this. I think that the left routinely underestimates what’s done by the left, whereas I think I’m being pretty accurate in that I think both sides are routinely violating the rules and that’s why we are in sort of a political death spiral.\nWhen you look at immigration policy, I think we can agree that there was no immigration policy—certainly no effective immigration policy when it came to the southern border—for far too long. And we can argue about the reasons for that, and what bill didn’t get passed, and so on. How do you feel about the way it’s being done, as dramatized by ICE in Minneapolis and elsewhere, and mass deportations, and people being shipped off to El Salvador, and the rest?\nSo these are two separate questions. Trump’s border policy is incredibly popular because the border was sealed on Day One, and it turns out that you didn’t need a piece of legislation to do that. Joe Biden could always have done that. In fact, even in the last couple of months while he was President, he sort of started to do that.\nAs far as internal policing of illegal immigration, I think that the approach taken by Tom Homan, the border czar, has been significantly better than the approach taken by the D.H.S. secretary or Stephen Miller, the President’s top adviser on these issues, which is: home in on the criminal illegal immigrants, many of whom are in the system. I think that Democrats are actually making a major mistake by not having local law enforcement coöperate with ICE in taking people who are in jail and deporting those people, or reporting them to ICE for deportation. I think that’s a huge mistake by Democrats politically, and just in terms of policy—\nWell, as we’re constantly reminded, Obama deported many, many people, rightly or wrongly. It’s not as if this is some unique thing.\nThat’s true. I mean, you’re right, that’s been a consistent policy in the United States for a while, to deport criminal illegal immigrants. Ramping that up, I think, is both smart policy and good policy. I think that the Trump Administration’s reaction, which has been to set up quotas, or radically ramp up going after noncriminal illegal immigrants—by which I mean people who have not committed an additional crime other than crossing the border illegally—is a political mistake, and has been redounding not to the benefit of the Trump Administration. There are better ways to do it. But I think that Democrats are playing with fire in a lot of the stuff that they’ve been doing in places like Minneapolis. I think the idea that ICE agents are state-sponsored terrorism—I confronted the California governor about that, and he backed off of that.\nRhetorically.\nYes. When people suggest that ICE is Gestapo, when people are likening this to the Holocaust, I think it’s a massive . . . not only mistake, but—\nSeparate out the rhetoric from the behavior. What do you think of the behavior of ICE in Minneapolis? When people in the highest levels of government refer to people like Alex Pretti as a “terrorist”—you’ve heard this.\nYes. I literally came out that day and I said that that was a complete misapprehension of the situation, so far as I could tell on the tape. And I said the same thing about the characterization of Renee Good as somebody who was trying to mow down immigration officers by the bushel. I mean, it was stated by Gregory Bovino, I believe, that Alex Pretti wanted to kill as many ICE agents as possible, or border patrol as possible. And I said that that’s not true and I think that that’s wrong, which is why I’m very happy that Tom Homan, who seems to be more of an adult, has been put in charge of implementation of border policy in Minnesota.\nBen, there are a million things we could talk about and probably disagree about, but I do want to focus on one thing. You said—and I think quite rightly—earlier that the left and the right keep digging their trenches deeper and deeper and deeper. Who do you see in the conservative world who’s a potential leader who would not have these tremendous moral failings that you’ve described, who would do without the kind of rhetorical ugliness that you have denounced? Who would cast out the kind of characters that Tucker Carlson and company are encouraging?\nI think there are a number of them. Glenn Youngkin, the former governor of Virginia; Brian Kemp, the former governor of Georgia. I think Governor [Ron] DeSantis in Florida has done an excellent job. I think that Senator Ted Cruz has spoken out very clearly against people like, for example, Tucker Carlson and his predations. I think Secretary of State Rubio would be really good. I’d like to see Vice-President Vance change tack on a lot of this; I hope that he will.\nThis is a systemic problem on both the left and the right: the primary system is very, very difficult for people who are not deliberately inflammatory to navigate. Because primary voters tend to be the most passionate voters, and that means that the people who tend to elevate are the people who are sometimes the most provocative.\nThe American system is built for gridlock. It’s meant to force us to generate large-scale approval in order to get major things done. You shouldn’t be able to do things with fifty-one per cent—you should have to have seventy per cent to do it. That’s why the system was built the way it is with all of the gridlock between the branches, and between the states and the federal government. And I think that the way that both the political parties—as vehicles for political victory—and also the commentariat in search of clicks and giggles have mobilized is in opposition to that. So people are getting more and more frustrated—\nMy concern is with the sustenance of democracy and democratic institutions. And I wonder if we share, or we don’t share, a concern that the period that we’re in now potentially lays waste to those institutions.\nI’m worried about it, for sure, but I think that we may be worried about it from different angles. One of the things that I notice about democracies that sort of fall into crisis is, No. 1, lack of institutional trust. But if you believe that if the other side wins, it’s literally the end of the democracy—that is incredibly dangerous. That really is a problem. Because that suggests that if the other side wins, you’re never going to get to vote again, tyranny is upon you, and perhaps the only solution is a solution that breaks the system.\nBut Ben, when the President of the United States tries to threaten officials in Georgia to give him some votes, or he starts to talk about “nationalizing” the elections, all these things, whether it’s January 6th—aren’t these legitimate concerns? Is the worrier the problem, or the actual situation the problem?\nWell, I mean, no. I think in some situations the worrier is the problem. It depends on the conclusion you’re drawing. I think the worry about January 6th was justified, because I think that the behavior of the President between the election and January 6th was morally wrong and also legally wrong. But I also think that the guardrails held. And the notion that Democrats are sitting around worrying that there will never be another clean election—that’s not true. And when Republicans say the same thing, Democrats are right to pounce on that. President Trump will say: if we don’t win this election, it was stolen. But then I’ll hear Democrats turn around and say very much the same thing about Republicans. And once both sides believe that if the other side wins, the election was stolen, then how are we supposed to ever share a polity together? That is a massive problem.\nNow, I think that the founders built an incredible system. I think that the guardrails are incredibly strong. The reality is that our system is very much still functional. And, last I checked, Democrats are slated to win the House and possibly the Senate, so they don’t feel like this is the end of the road. ♦","summary":"The conservative commentator on the antisemitism in MAGA media and why he condemns President Trump as corrupt yet sticks with him.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/ben-shapiro-is-waging-battle-inside-the-maga-movement","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6984fe4273833508528e31b8/16:9/w_3840,h_2160,c_limit/RADIO_HOUR_Ben_Shapiro_FINAL_2026_02_04.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 19:00:04","author":"David Remnick","authors":["David Remnick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.249},{"id":400153394,"title":"Lara Loomer defends Donald Trump's racist Obama video, says Republicans also shown as animals in AI clip","text":"Lara Loomer defended US President Donald Trump after he received backlash over Barack and Michelle Obama video depicted as apes.

The announcement sparked discussion about the best ways for Democrats to use social media to reach voters. Notably, Harris is viewed as a likely 2028 presidential candidate after foregoing a gubernatorial run in California this year. Such an account may boost her profile over the coming years. It's early, but polls currently show her as a top contender in the Democratic primary. What To Know The rebrand comes as Democrats continued to debate the best way forward following losses in 2024. Democrats have united in opposition to Trump, but disagreement over the most effective communications and tactics to win persists. Stefanie Feldman, who has served in numerous campaign and official roles with Biden for more than a decade, raised questions about Democrats' social media strategy in remarks posted to X. She asked how those leading the new Headquarters project would measure whether it is persuading and mobilizing voters. “I've yet to see digi folks measure success beyond views/likes. I've even seen them hype a post as ‘effective’ bc it had a huge # of impressions, when that post was ratio'd with neg content,” she wrote. She asked whether there is evidence that “s***posting” helps Democrats, adding that if there is, it’s something Democrats should embrace. She also shared a post she rejected from Biden’s 2020 campaign. “Here's my fav example of something the Biden 2020 digi team wanted to tweet out from the Biden campaign account. I vetoed it bc it is such an outrageously unserious reaction to a serious moment and not Biden brand. Lots of digi ppl were upset w me!” she wrote. The post included a meme of a rabbit holding a sign that read “JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD.“ Floyd was a 46-year-old Black man who died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinned him to the ground with his knee for more than 9 minutes in Minneapolis in 2020. His death set off the Black Lives Matter protests that year and sparked calls for changes to policing. The post was from 2020, and Feldman did not name the individual who suggested the post. She told Newsweek she believes Democrats “needs to figure out better ways to measure whether social media is helping Democrats win.” “I’ve seen some situations where the incentives for digital teams is just to rack up likes or impressions, and I think that spurs production of content like the piece I shared. I was asking whether anyone has figured out how to better measure the impact of digital work, because I certainly don’t know the practices of every single digital shop,” she said. Feldman added that she is “hopeful there are smart digital strategies people working on the solution right now.” “Maybe those people are even the people behind the new HQ account,” she said. Feldman’s post was viewed 1.7 million times, drawing mixed reactions. Former President Joe Biden speaks during a press conference in Washington, D.C. on October 4, 2024. “This is the kind of thing that you’d imagine a white supremacist might post to ironically mock George Floyd’s tragic death. Truly unbelievable. Reflects well on @StefFeldman that she wisely vetoed it,” posted commentator Anthony LaMesa. Social media consultant Rachel Karten wrote on X that there are “so many bad posts that end up on the cutting room floor when you work in social media” and said people “shouldn’t fear that your coworker is going to screenshot them.” Journalist Heidi Moore defended the decision to make the post public. “I see this very differently. It's not attributed to any particular person and it is illustrative of her point. It was also many years ago. It's absolutely fine to use case studies to make a point about business. Social media is a business function; it's not a creative art. And in business, case studies are a common way to teach and learn,” she wrote. What People Are Saying Lauren Kapp, who ran former Vice President Kamala Harris’ TikTok account during the 2024 race, previously told Newsweek: “This specifically just shows the Vice President's commitment to Gen. Z. This really is an investment into Gen. Z and people who are trying to reach young people. But this account is more than any one candidate or campaign.” Democratic strategist Andrew Mamo responded to Feldman's post: “Be normal. Be yourself. Be real. If you wouldn't post it with your own two thumbs, don't let your team do it!” Democratic strategist Matt Royer responded to Harris’ announcement on X: “So in keeping with the same trend of Youth Engagement within Progressive and Democratic politics, we have made yet another Gen Z oriented organization that needs funding to work parallel to all of the other orgs that already exist and pull from the same funders? Be serious.“ What Happens Next Democrats are hopeful their media efforts may bolster their chances in the midterms. Kalshi betting odds give Democrats a 78 percent chance of victory in the House of Representatives but a 36 percent chance of controlling the Senate.

This week, the newspaper eliminated it in its entirety, while also laying off a third of its staff. \n\nSuch grim news was announced days before the start of the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl, America’s greatest annual sporting spectacle, as if irony itself no longer merited notice.\n\nThey had sway. Names like Feinstein and Boswell established their authority because they valued their work as much as Woodward and Bernstein. It wasn’t just boys and their toys; they understood power and consequence and the need for trust.\n\nYes, we know. These are the big words journalists like to attach to journalism. Even still, at the heart of it, we’re all participants in the same quiet contract. You want to feel informed and occasionally challenged. You look for people who care about the thing you care about, at least as much as you do.\n\nThe Post had a one-two combination that made it feel necessary. Their dogged investigative work helped hasten the end of the Daniel Snyder era, the once-disastrous owner of Washington’s NFL team. His awful reign reflected wider problems: how a billionaire’s ego can send what was once a remarkably valuable franchise into a spiral.\n\nAfter the reporting came the reckoning. Along came the late, great John Feinstein with his searing column calling for Snyder “to kick him to the curb, which is where he belongs.” \n\nJeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the newspaper, appears to hold the same attitude toward his colleagues.\n\nThe Amazon founder first purchased the paper in 2013 with grand promises to invest in journalism. With the onset of a second Trump term, something shifted. Ambition curdled into appeasement. A tidal wave of subscriber cancellations followed the decision to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. \n\nAfter reporting nearly $100 million in losses in 2024, the response was that of the Flanders parenting philosophy: “We’ve tried nothing and are all out of ideas.” \n\nBezos has been recently busy promoting the Melania documentary, an Amazon-MGM Studios film that has received scathing reviews on these shores.\n\nWill Lewis, the publisher appointed by Bezos, was too busy to attend the virtual meeting announcing the cuts. He was, however, able to walk the red carpet at the NFL Honours awards in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl. Rest assured: for that cohort, this week would not be spoiled.\n\nAll this comes during a period of great flux for the industry and as another battle in the endless culture wars. Predictably, the news was like blood in the water. Sharks constantly circle.\n\nThis is how it goes. The back-and-forth wails into the void and nothing comes of it. There are those glad to see another limb severed from the lamestream media. Others retreat into hazardous nostalgia for great work from better days. “Flood the zone” is no longer even a strategy; the churn happens naturally now.\n\nWatching the game week media before Sunday’s decider between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is another reminder. \n\nThere is a need to learn about how Patriots quarterback Drake Maye went from attending a Super Bowl with his dad ten years ago to being on the verge of becoming the youngest starting QB to ever win football’s biggest game. \n\nThere is also a need to question NFL commissioner Roger Goodell about New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and his association with Jeffrey Epstein after his name showed up more than 400 times in files released by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThere is, of course, a legitimate conversation about reinvention: about how journalism must find new ways to survive in the current climate. There is also the blindingly obvious truth that giving up entirely will never achieve that.\n\nDeputy sports editor Matt Rennie spelled this out in a note to colleagues, later carried in The Atlantic.\n\n “The people making these decisions have failed in their responsibility to our readers, whom they never took the time to know, and have undermined—likely irreparably—the ideals of an institution they never bothered to try to understand.” \n\nThe industry will continue to fracture and splinter. New outlets will emerge. The ground is shifting beneath our feet. What risks being lost in that movement should not be mistaken for acceptable collateral. Powerful people are invariably better off without the sort of work the Post once did.\n\nThere was power in that work. It will not be redistributed now. It simply pools at the top. The class that made this decision is insulated from its consequences. An institution is weakened, readers lose out, sport certainly doesn’t benefit.\n\nNone of them win. And that, in the end, is the point.","summary":"The Washington Post sports section existed with a seriousness of purpose.

Toward the end of the video was a roughly two-second clip that shows the Obamas' heads edited onto the bodies of primates, with the song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" playing.Mr. Trump shared the video to his Truth Social account at 11:44 p.m. Thursday. A link to the video now shows the page as \"not found.\"Obama was the nation's first Black president and Michelle Obama was the first Black first lady. Mr. Trump has a history of sharing disparaging and racist memes about the Obamas. The president also amplified for years a conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to serve as president. Amid pressure to disavow the so-called \"birther\" claim, Mr. Trump finally said during the 2016 presidential campaign that \"President Obama was born in the United States. Period.\"There has been no reaction from the Obamas, and for now they are not commenting, a spokeswoman said. The original video that Leavitt referenced was shared on X last October by the user @xerias_x, who declared, \"President Trump: King of the Jungle.\" The 55-second-long video appears to be generated by AI and opens with Obama and Michelle Obama's heads superimposed onto apes' bodies.The original video depicts numerous other Democrats as animals, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as a warthog, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a donkey and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as a zebra. Former President Joe Biden also appears as a primate, and former Vice President Kamala Harris is pictured as a turtle. Mr. Trump is portrayed in the video as a lion.The Obamas are the only Democrats in the clip that was shared by the president on Truth Social on Thursday. Lawmakers denounce Trump's postThe footage shared by Mr. Trump was swiftly condemned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Numerous Republicans urged the president to remove the video featuring the Obamas and apologize.\"Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,\" Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said in a social media post. \"The President should remove it.\"Scott is the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history and chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York echoed Scott's call for Mr. Trump to delete the Truth Social post.\"The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,\" Lawler said in a post on X.GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi said the video was \"totally unacceptable,\" and fellow Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska wrote that a \"reasonable person sees the racist context\" to the depictions.\"The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologize,\" Ricketts said on X.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Republicans should denounce what he called the president's \"disgusting bigotry.\"\"President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans. They represent the best of this country. Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder,\" Jeffries wrote on X. \"Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual?\"Gov. Gavin Newsom, a California Democrat who frequently spars with the president, denounced the video shared by Mr. Trump late Thursday.\"Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now,\" his press office wrote on social media.Trump's claims about the 2020 presidential electionThe president has continued to claim, despite extensive evidence to the contrary, that the 2020 presidential election was rife with fraud and that he, not Biden, was the winner. But dozens of lawsuits filed by his campaign and Republican allies seeking to overturn the results in key battleground states were dismissed by federal judges. Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during Mr. Trump's first term, said the Justice Department did not uncover evidence of widespread fraud that would've changed the outcome of the 2020 election.The video shared by Mr. Trump makes unfounded allegations about voting machines from Dominion Voting Systems, a voting technology company. The claims were raised by some of the president's allies in the wake of the 2020 election and led to defamation lawsuits by the company.Dominion argued in suits against Fox News and Newsmax that the networks defamed it by broadcasting unfounded allegations that Dominion had rigged the election against Mr. Trump and its software manipulated vote counts. The voting company also sued Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, for repeatedly peddling false claims about the 2020 election in interviews.Fox News agreed in 2023 to pay Dominion $787.5 million as part of a settlement to resolve the defamation case and Newsmax agreed to pay the voting company $67 million last August. Giuliani and Dominion reached a settlement last September, though the terms are confidential.Former special counsel Jack Smith told House investigators in December that Giuliani \"disavowed a number of the claims\" he made publicly about the integrity of the 2020 election in an interview with his team. Smith oversaw the prosecution of Mr. Trump related to his alleged effort to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. The president had denied wrongdoing and the case was dropped after he won a second term in November 2024.","summary":"The footage is included in a video that promotes false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against Mr. Trump.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-shares-racist-video-depicting-obamas-as-apes/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/02/06/06b3c68e-ca3a-4052-938f-97d7a085336c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8a8cae6162c00589c668887d91582b31/gettyimages-2258843976.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 18:24:00","author":"Melissa Quinn","authors":["Melissa Quinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":400187370,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Team Quickly Changes Name Of ‘Headquarters’ After Posting ‘Cringe’","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ team seemingly quickly changed the name of its rebranded “Headquarters” X handle following widespread online mockery.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris announced in a video statement posted to X that “Kamala HQ” — the former social media operation for her failed 2024 presidential campaign — would now be dubbed “Headquarters.” The newly rebranded X account had the handle “@headquarters_67” Thursday — seemingly in reference to the popular “6-7\" meme — but changed it to “headquarters68_” shortly after, following the original handle being widely panned on social media.

There’s nothing strong about needing to put another person down, to feel bigger and stronger. They learn soon that no one will respect them, so the next best thing is to instill fear.\n\nAt the same time, all bullying is rooted in jealousy. In Trump’s case, it also comes with a whopping dose of self-victimization and the need to assert power over anyone who might expose him as the spineless coward he is.\n\n As kids, we’re taught to stand up to bullies, even if they’re bigger. “Don’t let them push you around like that!” my father barked at me when I was bullied in sixth grade. Imagine if Trump had been a truck driver in New Jersey in the 1970s and '80s — that’s my dad. He bullied me for getting bullied, so I learned how to stand up and push back. That included pushing back at him. Instead of letting my abuser continue to abuse me, I cut him out of my life.\n\n That’s not as easy to do with Trump, but it’s a problem that never should have existed. When he descended that gold escalator to launch his first bid for president in 2015, I knew exactly what he was: a smarmy, slimy, chauvinistic playboy who thought he was better looking and more powerful than he actually was. \n\n Groomed first by Roy Cohn, then by Vladimir Putin, Donny Daddy Issues got all the attention and ego-boosting he thirsted for. The false bravado grew as he created his own legend. He famously pushed back against any woman who interviewed him — like Barbara Walters and Lesley Stahl.\n\n When he hit the campaign trail, his attacks on the media surged. Even the most professional of journalists were taken aback by his attacks — but few were able to prevail over the tactics he learned from Daddy Vladdy: deny, deflect, and distract.\n\n Trump was astute enough to understand how to play to his few strengths. E. Jean Carroll can attest to how he used his physicality to intimidate women, and we’ve all seen him steamroll anyone who asks questions he doesn’t like. \n\nGuess who else asked him questions he didn’t like?\n\n Me, that’s who. \n\n I’m 5ft tall and weigh maybe a buck-five, so I love knowing that huge homunculus of an adjudicated rapist is scared of me. \n\nSuch a fearless leader, huh? Yell louder, Tiny. I can’t hear you because you’ve never unblocked me.\n\nMAGA loves the “loudest person is always right” approach, because then they don’t have to hear anything that makes them feel bad. They’ve all taken on Trump’s persona in their pursuit of “owning the Libs,” a goal apparently more important than making sure they can feed their families or afford health care. And that whole Epstein files thing? Just a “Democrat hoax” pushed by the “fake news media.”\n\n I’ve already written about Trump’s favorite way to scapegoat the media and any others who dare challenge him. But that certainly wasn’t the first time I tried to get their attention. \n\n Trump’s abusiveness left the mainstream media (MSM for short) incapable of covering Joe Biden accurately. While he and VP Kamala Harris were undoing the damage of the first illegitimate Trump regime, the MSM was all, “Will Trump run again?”\n\n When Biden pulled us out of Trump’s pandemic depression and lifted all other global economies with us, the MSM breathlessly covered Trump’s FOUR DIFFERENT ARRESTS, simply watching as MAGA turned his mugshot into a badge of honor instead of yet another Hall of Shame moment.\n\n “The MSM has PTSD from TFG,” I wrote in October 2023. Remember when Biden called Trump “The Former Guy”? Dark Brandon should’ve been the media’s darling, not the convicted felon rapist who fomented an insurrection and stole classified documents from the White House. It’s still true. Ironically, I submitted that as an op-ed to the Washington Post, which has now fully capitulated to Putin’s puppet. Its new masthead should read “Trumpism Over Journalism,” as it helps our democracy die, drowned in Dark Money.\n\n But if I can stand up to the bully, so can Kaitlan Collins and anyone else he targets. Trump will continue to abuse anyone who asks him about Epstein, but that can’t mean no one asks him about Epstein. \n\n My advice comes from my GenX experiences and every '80s movie where the bullies finally lose, after a montage where the nerds build a clubhouse or something, all set to “New Song” by Howard Jones.\n\nJust ask Trump why he’s never released the full and unredacted Epstein files, to exonerate himself. When Trump goes after that person — and he will — the next person should ask the same question. And the next. Use your voices together. Be louder than him. Say it’s your job to get the truth to the people. He won’t know what to do with a united front like that, and you’ll be exposing his weakness live on camera.\n\nGive it a try. It’s only our democracy at stake. Use the truth as a shield instead of letting him hurt us with his lies.\n\nTara Dublin is a political writer/commentator based in Portland, OR, who has been blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter since August 2015 and can occasionally be heard as a fill-in host on SiriusXM Progress.

That clip comes from a longer video that a meme account posted in October. \n\nMother Jones asked the White House a list of questions, including how Trump found the video, if he was aware that the 2020 election video contained that imagery when he posted it, and if the video depicting the Obamas was playing on the president’s device. The press office did not respond to specific questions but instead sent over a statement from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. \n\n“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,” Leavitt said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”\n\nThe video clip posted by the president just before midnight on the East Coast drew immense backlash, including from some Republicans. \n\nSen.

The user’s bio reads “God First | Trump ‘Fighter Jet Poop’ Guy.” In the full version of the video that Trump posted on Thursday, prominent Democrats are depicted as various animals, and President Trump’s head is on a lion with the caption “King of the Jungle.” The Obamas are not the only Democrats included in this video. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, former President Joe Biden, and former Vice President Kamala Harris all appear, among others. \n\nThe president’s post is the latest in a decades-long history of sharing or amplifying racist claims, from taking out a full-page ad in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the young Black and brown Central Park Five to boosting the Obama birtherism conspiracy theory for years. He has also not restricted this behavior to social media; during both of his terms, he has enacted policies that uniquely target Black people, such as a comprehensive attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the federal government and private sector that began with an executive order on his first day in office.\n\nIt’s unclear how the video came across the president’s screen, but the original creator is celebrating.

Karen Attiah, the former global opinion editor at the Post, was hired soon after Bezos’s arrival. She recounts how the arrival of a billionaire backer initially revitalized the paper with resources and creative freedom, before souring over the next decade. “We thought [he] shared the same values that we had,” says Attiah, who was fired from the Post last fall over comments she made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “Journalism deserves better than a billionaire owner who decides that partying in Europe is more important than people’s lives.”\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We’re going to stay on the media right now. In what’s been described a “bloodbath,” The Washington Post has laid off more than 300 journalists, about 30% of all its employees, dismantling its sports, local news and international coverage, including all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. The Post’s Ukraine reporter Lizzie Johnson wrote on X, quote, “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a war zone,” she wrote from Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, fired workers rallied outside The Washington Post office. This is the reporter Ben Brasch, who was fired Tuesday.\n\nBEN BRASCH: These layoffs are shameful!\n\nFIRED WORKERS: Shame!\n\nBEN BRASCH: The fourth-richest person in the world, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post. He can run it at a loss for the rest of time, and yet he refuses! And instead, he’s spending tens of millions of dollars buying a documentary for Melania Trump to curry favor with the president of the United States. When people show you who they are, believe them. Billionaires only get rich by stealing from us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013. [In 2024], the paper lost over 250,000 digital subscribers after the paper announced it would not make an endorsement in the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Bezos’s Amazon later donated a million dollars to Trump’s inaugural fund.\n\nWe’re joined right now by two guests. Karen Attiah, former global opinion editor for The Washington Post, was fired last year over social media posts made after the killing of far-right activist Charlie Kirk. Nilo Tabrizy is an investigative reporter who closely covers Iran. She was just laid off from The Washington Post yesterday.\n\nNilo, let’s start with you, what’s being termed a “bloodbath,” 300 employees of The Washington Post, a third of The Washington Post. You write about Iran. Talk about what happened in Iran. Talk about what happened with the Middle East coverage, overall, and what’s happened with all of your colleagues.\n\nNILO TABRIZY: Yeah. Thank you. I’m glad to be here to discuss what happened at the Post.\n\nSo, our entire Middle East staff was laid off. Most of the international desk was dismantled, as well. And this is something that we heard was coming down in the newsroom a few weeks ago. And we also heard that when this plan was presented to Peter Finn, who is the head of the international desk and mentor to many at the Post, he said to them he would rather be laid off than deal with this horrible gutting and reconstruction, as it was, you know, phrased.\n\nSo, it’s been incredibly depressing. Everybody is grieving. And it’s a loss for our readers. It’s a loss for everyone. And the way the company is framing, you know, that we want to focus more on national security, well, international reporters and national security, I mean, these two desks collaborate so much with each other. And so, it’s a deeply grim moment.\n\nAnd, you know, as a member of the Post Guild, in the union at The Washington Post, we’re lucky to have the guild fight for us, but international staff, they’re not members of the guild. And even worse, there are so many local workers that we work with at the Post. We have local drivers, translators, reporters that collaborate with our bureau chiefs and with our correspondents. Those people are not protected in the same way that I am. And so, it’s incredibly awful. There’s no words to describe the dismantling that’s happening at the Post.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Nilo, I wanted to ask you, especially this whole issue of the international reporting, with so few U.S. media companies still having even a skeleton staff of reporters reporting on affairs outside the United States: What does that turn The Washington Post into? And also, what does that say about the ability of the media in the U.S. to let people know in this country what’s going on in the rest of the world?\n\nNILO TABRIZY: Right. I mean, it’s a complete disservice. I mean, we do this job because we want to be in service to the public. This is the main intention for so many of us. And taking the ability away to do this type of reporting to communicate what’s important, I mean, it’s a disservice to our readership and to anyone who wants to engage in these issues. I mean, my last story that I did for the Post, which published on Monday, the day before I got laid off, was about the buildup that we’re seeing of vessels, of U.S. military equipment in the Persian Gulf, and potentially there might be some type of strike. And now the Post is not well placed to cover that. And it’s incredibly heartbreaking.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I’d like to bring Karen Attiah into the conversation, as well. Karen, your response to these layoffs? And Jeff Bezos was — while they were happening, was actually in Paris at a Haute Couture Week?\n\nKAREN ATTIAH: Yeah, I mean, I joined the Post, and specifically the opinion section, right after Bezos bought the paper, so in about 2014. And I was, you know, there when we were kind of riding high, basically. We had not only Bezos cash — right? — but we had the permission, in a lot of ways, to be able to be creative, in order to be able to be swashbuckling, provocative. And for most of my time, a good chunk of my time in the opinion section, I was the global opinions editor, and we had a direct mandate, basically, from Bezos, saying that he wanted The Washington Post to be a global newspaper, that he wanted us to be the English-speaking newspaper that the rest of the world turned to. So, that’s why, you know, I got to work recruiting writers and building up that section of global writers, including Jamal Khashoggi, who was very brutally murdered in 2018. Jeff Bezos, we thought, shared the same values that we had, particularly when it came to international coverage and for standing up for journalists who weren’t able to speak freely in their areas of the world.\n\nAnd now to see him butchering the Post, or at least, at the very least, partying in Paris and in Europe while so many of my colleagues are being unceremoniously kicked out of their job, at a time when America desperately needs to know what’s going on in its own neighborhood and in the world, it’s just — it’s unconscionable, frankly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Karen Attiah, you were the former global opinion editor for The Washington Post. You platformed many courageous voices, including Jamal Khashoggi, who would be murdered in the embassy in Turkey. And all the intelligence reports from the agencies of the United States government pointed the finger at a dear ally of President Trump, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Your thoughts on your ousting? Yeah, it was the time of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, but what you represented at the Post?\n\nKAREN ATTIAH: You know, so much about this is — breaks my heart still to this day. What breaks my heart is, yes, having the ability to give writers a home in times where they couldn’t, and now when they ask, “Well, where can we be heard? Where can our voices go?” and I can’t, in good conscience, say that they have a safe place in The Washington Post anymore.\n\nYou know, I think, for me, you know, I was illegally, I will say, fired for posting very — you know, posting the facts about gun violence in this country, about race in this country, and basically, you know, fired for doing my job. But the signs were all there, the censoring of the opinion page. When Bezos said that opinions that were outside of his scope of free markets and personal liberties, that was a red flashing sign that censorship and purging was going to come for The Washington Post. I tried to hold on for as long as I could and do the work that I was, you know, paid to do for as long as I could, until I couldn’t. I mean, I’m still continuing to fight that termination, as well. So, I think, if anything, showing that we need to stand up to this purging is even more important. So, I’m definitely fighting back, with the assistance — and not just the assistance, but the guild has my back, so I’m grateful for that.\n\nBut this is a bigger moment. There’s a reason why this is an international news story. I think The Washington Post stands for a lot more than just a media company. It stands for a lot more than even just journalism, I would say. For a lot of people around the world, they’re looking at The Washington Post as a proxy and a bellwether for what’s happening to America and democracy, right?\n\nAnd when we are not able to even be able to freely cover our own neighborhoods, be able to freely cover the world, be able to, you know, under — D.C. being under military occupation, basically, with the National Guard, we can’t even retain a diverse set of journalists in a city that is very much immigrants, people of color. There are probably, at this point, less than maybe 30 Black journalists left. I was the last Black columnist left at The Washington Post, full-time staff opinions columnist left at The Washington Post. So, the brazenness with which the destruction of the line of defense of journalism against oppression is just — it’s as shameless on their end as it is cruel. And D.C. deserves better. This entire region deserves better. Journalism deserves better than a billionaire owner who decides that, you know, partying in Europe is more important than people’s lives. The Washington Post deserves a better owner than this.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask Nilo Tabrizy about this, this enormous change in direction that Bezos has gone in with The Washington Post versus how he started, then his muzzling of the editorial page and then his fawning after Trump with the financing of the Melania film. What is your sense of the enormity of this change? It’s almost like a 180-degree turn on his part from where he started.\n\nNILO TABRIZY: Absolutely. I mean, I can’t say it better myself. It’s a complete departure from the mission of the Post and “Democracy dies in darkness.” Well, now it’s completely dark. And what do we have left?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s the motto of The Washington Post, adopted in 2017.\n\nNILO TABRIZY: Yes, that’s the motto of The Washington Post, exactly. And it’s really — yeah, it’s indescribable. And I really feel for my Post colleagues who now have to show up and work in a carcass of what this incredible institution was. The Post was such a special culture. It was different from any other newsroom I’ve worked in, where it’s deeply collaborative. Desks were not competing for each other. Everyone was there for the same mission, which was to put out the best report. And they’ve completely dismantled that. And again, it’s a deep disservice to any of our readers, to our public.\n\nAnd it shows the fragility of these institutions and how important it is to protect them, because with one fell swoop, in a horrific layoff, you know, 30-minute robotic meeting, in which our publisher was not even present — we saw that our publisher, Will Lewis, was at some Super Bowl-related event — they didn’t have the dignity to look us in the eye. You know, people got these mass emails: “Your job is eliminated.”\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And you were told not to come to work yesterday.\n\nNILO TABRIZY: We were all told not to come to work. We had an 8:30 a.m. Zoom, which, in itself, is unconscionable. And then, after that, employees who even had, you know, 27-plus years of service were told they lost their job in a one-line email, where our publisher, again, was not present. This, again, really shows the lack of leadership at the Post.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we’re going to continue to cover this story and continue to cover the corporate media and remind people Democracy Now! is independent. Nilo Tabrizy, just laid off from The Washington Post, will stay with us as we talk about Iran next.

Last year’s Super Bowl halftime show by Kendrick Lamar set a record, drawing more than 130 million viewers.\n\n“My biggest feeling is being grateful,” the artist, wearing an unusual beanie hat with bunny ears, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n“I feel more excited about the people than even me, about my family, about my friends, people that I know that always believed in me and they’re happy because of this moment and the culture.”\n\nHe emphasized unity and celebration as his main goals for the 13-minute performance and was candid about how his deeply personal album exceeded his expectations.\n\nBad Bunny’s selection as halftime headliner has drawn criticism from some traditionalists, including President Donald Trump, who called it “absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nThe artist has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump’s deportation policies and openly supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nUpon accepting one of his three Grammy awards last week, he declared “ICE out” from the stage, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nREAD: Bad Bunny says ‘ICE out’ during Grammy awards acceptance speech\n\nHe notably skipped touring the continental U.S., citing fears that immigration agents would arrest his fans.\n\nAfter announcing his residency in Puerto Rico, he recalled thinking: “Oh, wow.

It’s gonna be my family, my friends, or all the Latino community around the world.”\n\nHe even joked with the ‘Kid Correspondent’ from the NFL Play 60 programme — one of three youngsters at the conference who were allowed to ask questions — who wanted to know how he keeps his body healthy for such demanding performances.\n\n“Eating smash burgers and thinking about the Super Bowl halftime show at 4 a.m.”\n\nHe added he’s been working out and eating healthy, though he’s had to make sacrifices: “I’m not even playing that much dominoes and that’s just killing me, bro.”\n\nAlthough this isn’t his first rodeo, six years ago he joined Jennifer Lopez and Shakira on stage for Super Bowl LIV, yet he insists the return wasn’t part of some master plan.\n\n“My biggest achievement, my biggest pleasure is just create, have fun doing it, and connect with the people,” he added.\n\nWhat should fans expect Sunday? “As I said, I just want people to have fun.

Hochul's campaign spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki told Newsweek that New Yorkers are “seeing the results this governor is delivering for them, on public safety, bringing down costs, and standing up to [President Donald] Trump.” “It’s always a good day to be on Team Hochul. Less so for Team Blakeman, who have to contend with their boss quadrupling down on his support for Trump’s ICE and their abuses of power, tariffs making everything expensive, and excusing every single thing Donald Trump does,” he said. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, running against Hochul as a Republican, told Newsweek on Friday that New Yorkers are not “winning under Kathy Hochul with the highest taxes in the nation, soaring energy bills, and an affordability crisis that is pushing families and businesses out of New York every day.” He added: “If that’s winning, there’s something seriously wrong with the scoreboard.” Newsweek also reached out to the campaign of Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado who is challenging her in the primary for comment via email. Why It Matters New York is a historically solidly Democratic state, but Republicans have made inroads with key voter groups such as Latino, Asian American and young voters. This year’s gubernatorial race will be a key test as to whether Democrats are able to win back those voters who shifted toward Republicans in recent years. Hochul became governor after then-Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned in 2021 over a report from Attorney General Letitia James' office alleging he sexually harassed multiple female employees and created a toxic work environment. She faced a closer-than-expected reelection in 2022, winning by just over six points against Republican Lee Zeldin. That marked the weakest Democratic performance in years. What To Know Despite Hochul’s underperformance in 2022, and expectations that this year could again be competitive, the Democratic governor seems favored in recent polls to comfortably win reelection as the party has rallied behind her candidacy. Her polling position has improved since last year. The latest poll from Siena College showed Hochul with 54 percent of the vote compared to Blakeman’s 28 percent support. In the primary, 64 percent of Democrats said they would back Hochul compared to just 11 percent of Democrats who planned to cast their ballot for Delgado. That poll surveyed 802 registered voters from January 26-28, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. A John Zogby Strategies poll earlier in January similarly showed the governor with a comfortable lead of 14 points (53 to 39 percent) over Blakeman and a 52-point lead over Delgado (64 to 12 percent). It surveyed 844 likely voters from January 6-8 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Most polls released in 2025 showed Hochul with a lead, but with less than 50 percent in the general election. One poll from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning group, showed GOP Representative Elise Stefanik lead Hochul by one point (43 to 42 percent). It surveyed 900 voters from October 22-26, 2025. Stefanik, viewed as a potentially formidable challenger, has since dropped out. Blakeman, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, is less known across the state, according to a Siena College poll from December. However, he does have a history of winning elections in competitive Nassau County. New York Governor Kathy Hochul speaks at the 40th annual Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in New York City on January 19. Boris Heersink, professor of political science at Fordham University, told Newsweek that Hochul “is a lot more confident in her role as governor” and has been “proactive in claiming credit for popular policy achievements.” She is also benefiting from the fact that 2026 is likely to be a better year for Democrats, he said. Democrats believe this year may be a “blue wave,” compared to 2022, when Republicans had a better year, due to Trump’s diminishing approval ratings. “Democrats are fired up, many independents are unhappy with Trump, and we’ve been seeing Latino voters in races in New Jersey and Texas move back to the Democratic side at a very high rate. Given that New York was already still a majority Democratic state anyway, all this places her in a very comfortable position,” Heersink said. Harvey Schantz, a professor of political science at the State University of New York, Plattsburgh, told Newsweek Hochul has been able to get “the progressive and moderate factions of the Democratic Party behind her.” “In 2025-2026 Hochul has successfully punched away at Donald Trump in order to raise her own reelection chances. New York State registered voters gave Donald Trump only 34% approval in the latest Siena Poll, allowing Hochul to successfully use Trump as a foil. Building on Trump’s unpopularity, she has deftly tied prospective Republican challengers, including Bruce Blakeman, to Trump,” he said. Hochul and other New York Democrats will come into the election with “decided advantages in party enrollment, the national political tide, and with a prospective Republican challenger who is not well known across the state,” Schantz said. Still, he noted there is a “long way to go before Election Day.” Hochul Secures Key Endorsements Hochul secured the endorsement of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. His endorsement could give Hochul, who is viewed as more of a mainstream Democrat, a boost among progressive voters in the state. “New Yorkers deserve leaders who believe in transformation. Leaders who understand that hope is inspired by a vision, and sustained by change. Governor Kathy Hochul has earned my endorsement because she has chosen to govern in that spirit. And in this moment, that choice matters,” Mamdani wrote in an opinion article for The Nation. Mamdani’s endorsement may prevent “major intra-party conflict over the nomination,” Heersink said. “Nobody else of name is challenging Hochul – and having Mamdani on her side may prevent any of the more left-leaning parts of the party from trying (including by running as an independent). It also signals to Democratic voters in New York City – who often feel neglected by Albany but whose votes are crucial to state-wide victories – that Hochul is more open to helping the city than governors have been in the past,” he said. Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that she is poised to receive the endorsement from New York’s entire Congressional delegation over Delgado. Those endorsements would cross the ideological spectrum as well as the state’s regional divides. The publication noted that her future was “slightly precarious” at the same point in 2022 as she faced primaries from Representative Tom Suozzi, a centrist, and Jumaane Williams, a progressive who serves as New York City’s public advocate. She did, however, lose support over her lieutenant governor pick. Hochul Leads Betting Odds for New York Governor Race Hochul also leads betting odds in the New York gubernatorial race. Kalshi gave her a 92 percent chance of victory on Friday—up from 85 percent in January 2025. Polymarket similarly gave her a 91 percent chance of winning in November. The 2022 midterms represented a challenge for New York Democrats amid concerns about crime. Democrats in all statewide races faced diminished margins, but no race was as close as that of Hochul. Since then, she has increased her name recognition across the state and has seen her approval rating increase. The latest Siena poll found that 49 percent of New Yorkers view Hochul favorably, which it said was her “best ever” favorability in their polling. New York has not elected a Republican governor since George Pataki’s reelection in 2002. But there have been signs that Democrats’ grip on the state has slipped. Former Vice President Kamala Harris received less than 56 percent of the vote in New York during the 2024 presidential election, the weakest performance for a Democrat in decades. Democrats will be working to win back voters who drifted toward Republicans and Trump in this year's elections. Delgado has mounted a progressive challenge to Hochul but has trailed her in the polls. Meanwhile, Mamdani endorsing Hochul over Delgado has drawn some criticism from progressives. “Even with good intentions, this endorsement is a bad deal: a one-off child care promise pulled from reserves, no plan to tax the rich, and donors put first. We should tax the ultra-wealthy and corporations and fund universal child care in the budget. Not with couch-cushion money,” India Walton, Delgado’s running mate, wrote to X. What People Are Saying Boris Heersink, professor of political science at Fordham University, also told Newsweek: “It is always possible that we might end up being surprised, but it seems like this should be a very straightforward win for Hochul. The big question might be how big her margin of victory will end up being. But her approval ratings have improved greatly, many of the issues that hurt her in 2022 (the aftereffects of school closings) aren’t as salient anymore, Latino voters are angry about Trump’s ICE policies and are returning to the Democratic Party, and Democrats in general are expecting a strong midterm turnout.“ Siena pollster Steven Greenberg wrote in the polling release: “As we start the second month of this much watched mid-term election year, Hochul has a commanding lead among registered voters over both Delgado, among Democrats, and Blakeman, with all voters. While a 49-40% favorability rating is not generally seen as something to gloat about, for Hochul it is a net seven point gain from December, but more noteworthy is the fact that it is the first time in four and a half years as governor that Hochul has had 49% of voters view her favorably in a Siena poll.” New York state Senator Jabari Brisport, a socialist and Democrat, posted to X on Thursday he's still not supporting Hochul: “Kathy Hochul is *by* billionaires, *for* billionaires. No politician will ever wield enough leverage to change that. Thankfully our movement is bigger than any one decision by any individual. Tax The Rich. Delgado 2026.” What Happens Next Forecasters give Hochul an advantage. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as being Safe Democratic, while Sabato’s Crystal Ball views it as Likely Democratic.","summary":"Hochul, who faced a closer-than-expected race in 2022, is leading polls and securing key endorsements in her reelection bid.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kathy-hochuls-second-term-prospects-look-brighter-than-ever-11479075","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257130776.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 17:17:37","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":400136618,"title":"Trump Account Deletes AI Video Showing Obamas as Apes; White House, After Defending It, Claims Staff Member Had ‘Erroneously’ Posted Clip","text":"After a strong backlash over a racist video of the Obamas that was posted to President Donald Trump‘s account on Truth Social, the video has been deleted.\n\n A White House official told Variety that a staffer had erroneously made the post and that it has been taken down.

Tom Malinowski and an estimated 6,000 ballots still to be counted.\n\nStill, Mejia’s late emergence into first place Thursday night set the stage for a potential upset for the activist who claimed the progressive lane in the crowded primary to fill Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s former House seat. The latest results showed Mejia with 28.75 percent of the vote to Malinowski’s 27.96 percent, a difference of 486 votes, with 91 percent of the votes in, according to The Associated Press. \n\nFormer Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way was in third place with 17.43 percent, followed by Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill with 14.22 percent.\n\n“I do think that we have emerged victorious, but I want to first make sure that every voter’s voice is heard,” Mejia told reporters Friday. “I’m already thinking about how do we consolidate so that we can tackle the bigger issue, which is how do we reclaim democracy in our nation and ensure that the voices of voters in New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District are actually heard.”\n\nMalinowski jumped to an early lead Thursday night after polls closed at 8 p.m. Eastern. But Mejia surged ahead around 10:15 p.m. as more returns came in. \n\nSome outlets had even called the race for Malinowski early Thursday night, leading Mejia to later share on social media the famous 1948 photo of President Harry Truman holding up a newspaper with the erroneous “Dewey defeats Truman” headline. \n\n“This race remains too close to call, with thousands of mail-in and provisional ballots still outstanding and yet to be counted,” Kaylie Haberstroh, Malinowski’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “Given the volume of votes still to be reported and the way mail-in ballots have broken throughout this race, we remain confident heading into the continued count.”\n\nThe winner will be favored in the April 16 special general election against Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, who was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Sherrill won a fourth term in 2024 by 15 points, while Kamala Harris carried the North Jersey district by 9 points the same year, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nProgressives who supported Mejia’s campaign over the past several weeks have been celebrating her performance even as the race remains uncalled. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held a rally in the district last month for Mejia, who worked on his 2020 presidential bid, as well as a virtual rally for her on the eve of the election. She also had the backing of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley, among other progressive members. \n\n“This is the second big congressional primary in two weeks where voters chose the more progressive candidate and made clear they want Democrats who will shake up a broken political and economic system — not just be anti-Trump,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement, also referring to Texas Democrat Christian Menefee’s victory in a Jan. 31 special election runoff. \n\nSeveral progressive outside groups, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC and Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s leadership PAC, made late investments to boost Mejia’s campaign, which Jayapal said was enough to move the needle against bigger spenders.\n\n“When there’s a real Organizer running, We don’t need to match $ for $ — we just need to be in the ring,” the former Congressional Progressive Caucus chair said on social media. \n\nMejia acknowledged that she entered the race with minimal name recognition, while Malinowski, who served two terms representing the neighboring 7th District, was more well-known from three past competitive races in the same media market. \n\nBut Malinowski, who was the top fundraiser in the race, faced $2.3 million in opposition spending from the United Democracy Project, the super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. While the group opposed Malinowski, who had reportedly said he was open to limits on funding for Israel, Mejia has been a sharper critic of the country’s government. \n\n“The outcome in NJ-11 was an anticipated possibility, and our focus remains on who will serve the next full term in Congress,” the United Democracy Project said in a Friday statement. “UDP will be closely monitoring dozens of primary races, including the June NJ-11 primary, to help ensure pro-Israel candidates are elected to Congress.”\n\nWhoever wins the nomination, and ultimately the seat, will need to quickly pivot to the June primary to win the nomination for a full term. Still, the outcome so far raised questions about AIPAC’s influence in other Democratic primary contests this year, with the war in Gaza emerging as a differentiator among Democratic candidates in several races. \n\nFurther tests could come next month in Illinois. Democrats running to succeed retiring Rep. Jan Schakowsky in the deep-blue 9th District include state Sen. Laura Fine and Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who are both Jewish. \n\nBiss has criticized Fine, including at a recent candidate forum, for receiving campaign contributions from donors who previously gave to Trump and AIPAC. Federal filings don’t show that UDP has made any independent expenditures in that race, but the group has reportedly sent fundraising appeals on Fine’s behalf. \n\n“Local residents know that Laura Fine’s campaign is being propped up by AIPAC and Republican megadonors, not grassroots support from the community she’s asking to represent,” Biss, who has Schakowsky’s endorsement, said in a statement.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/02/06/analilia-mejia-malinowski-new-jersey-election/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-1483339837.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 17:05:32","author":"Posted February 6, 2026 At 5:05pm","authors":["Posted February 6, 2026 At 5:05pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":400130202,"title":"Senate's lone Black Republican says Trump video \"most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\"","text":"Scott, who leads the Senate Republican campaign arm, posted Friday that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.

By 1870, approximately 400,000 settlers had made the trek west along major trails like the Oregon Trail.\n\nThe Homestead Act (1862) fueled a massive wave of farming settlement by providing 160 acres of free land to anyone willing to improve it. Between 1862 and 1900, the government transferred over 270 million acres to private citizens.\n\nEconomic dynamism and unprecedented mobility led to the most revolutionary cultural changes in history. Those changes included the decline and eventual destruction of several industries in America. Blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and other small-business and artisanal workers associated with the \"horse and buggy\" pre-industrial economy were not just \"workers\"; they were critical members and pillars of their communities. Their shops were often the physical and social center of a village.\n\nEven more importantly, the decline of these trades meant the collapse of the formal apprentice system, which for centuries had provided young people with a clear path to social mobility and financial freedom.\n\nThere was a social cost to these changes. Labor unrest, unemployment, and a sense of being unmoored from society all contributed to a pervasive fear and trepidation.\n\nBut those who were \"shifty\" and adaptable to the new realities thrived in this new America. One man's loss was another man's opportunity. Those who didn't recognize these opportunities floundered.\n\nSuch is capitalism. \n\nPerhaps that's why the left is melting down over the Washington Post's decline and eventual shuttering. Leftists don't understand capitalism. They don't recognize opportunity. And they're \"shifty\" in all the wrong ways.\n\nThis week, the Washington Post laid off about a third of its staff. They lost $100 million over the last year, which, even for a very wealthy man like Jeff Bezos, is a lot of money.\n\nThe executive editor of the Post, Matt Murray, gave the 100% correct reason for why the Post was forced to take the actions it did: the layoffs were part of a restructuring effort and a shift away from a model that is “too rooted in a different era.”\n\nIn what universe would it be unacceptable to make those cuts after losing $100 million? A left-wing universe, of course.\n\nThe liberal former editor of the paper, Marty Baron, said in a statement that the layoffs rank “among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”He criticized Mr. Bezos’ decision to kill the paper’s planned endorsement of Vice President Harris in the 2024 election, as well as the billionaire’s order that the editorial page publish columns dedicated to “personal liberties and free markets.”Those decisions, according to Mr. Baron, made the paper’s financial struggles “infinitely worse” as they led to “hundreds of thousands” of readers being “driven away.”\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the move by the Post was a conspiracy of some sort.\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos bought WaPo, he immediately took control of the opinions section. Now, he's laying off hundreds of journalists, including those covering Amazon.This isn’t a coincidence. It’s the result of billionaires with vested political agendas taking over our media.— Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@RepAOC) February 4, 2026\n\nAs opposed to leftists with a vested political agenda running the paper? Bezos is a businessman who read the tea leaves and saw moderating the Post's liberalism as a good, bottom-line move. He was probably wrong because he couldn't have imagined the outcry that resulted after his refusal to endorse Kamala Harris in 2024. The explosion of hysterical opposition from the left, no doubt, gave subscribers a false impression of what exactly Bezos was trying to do. \n\nIn effect, the liberals' over-the-top reaction to Bezos's moves in 2024 became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nDemocratic Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders said, “If Jeff Bezos could afford to spend $75 million on the Melania movie & $500 million for a yacht to sail off to his $55 million wedding to give his wife a $5 million ring, please don’t tell me he needed to fire one-third of the Washington Post staff. Democracy dies in oligarchy.”“Jeff Bezos just fired hundreds of reporters at the Washington Post — including the Amazon reporter holding his OWN company accountable. Reminder: Jeff Bezos’ net worth is nearly $250,000,000,000,” wrote far-left Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. A weekend host at the left-wing network MS NOW, Jonathan Capehart, said that with the layoffs, the Post is “complicit” in “killing” democracy.\n\nThis is the hubris of the journalism business. The death of newspapers will not usher in an age of dictatorship. Only 7% of U.S. adults say they \"often\" get their news from printed newspapers or magazines. Nearly 70% of U.S. adults prefer reading their news online rather than in print. That's not close to any definition of \"democratic\" I'm aware of.\n\nSince newspapers have yet to figure out a new online business model that can make money, they're stuck trying to make a go of it with a model that's been around for a thousand years.\n\nIt's not working. Newspapers will never be what they were 40 years ago. To \"journalists\" and other purveyors of what they consider to be \"truth\": Stop whining about the inevitability of change. Bari Weiss stopped whining about anything and is now a multi-millionaire. \n\nIt's good to be shifty in a new country.\n\nThe new year promises to be one of the most pivotal in recent history. Midterm elections will determine if we continue to move forward or slide back into lawfare, impeachments, and the toleration of fraud.\n\nPJ Media will give you all the information you need to understand the decisions that will be made this year.

Every single Republican must denounce this. Now,” Newsom’s press office account posted on X.\n\nBen Rhodes, a former top national security advisor and close confidant to Barack Obama, also condemned the imagery.\n\n“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” he wrote on X.\n\n– ‘Birther’ conspiracy –\n\nObama is the only Black president in American history and backed Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBillionaire Trump launched his own political career by pushing the racist and false “birther” conspiracy theory that his Democratic predecessor was lying about being born in the United States.\n\nTrump has long had a bitter rivalry with Obama, who was president from 2009 to 2017, taking particular umbrage at the Democrat’s popularity and the fact that he won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn the first year of his second term in the White House, Trump has ramped up his use of hyper-realistic but fabricated AI visuals on Truth Social and other platforms, often glorifying himself while lampooning his critics.\n\nHe has used the provocative posts to rally his conservative base.\n\nLast year, Trump posted a video generated by artificial intelligence showing Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office and appearing behind bars in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nLater, he posted an AI clip of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — who is Black — wearing a fake moustache and a sombrero.\n\nJeffries called the image racist.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has drawn criticism from his opponents for leading a crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.\n\nOne of Trump’s first acts was to terminate all federal government DEI programs, including related policies in the military.\n\nThe drive to rid the armed forces of what Trump has derided as “woke” initiatives has also seen the removal from some military academy bookshelves of scores of books that cover the US history of racial discrimination.\n\nUS federal anti-discrimination programs were born of the 1960s civil rights struggle, mainly led by Black Americans, for equality and justice after hundreds of years of slavery, whose abolition in 1865 saw other institutional forms of racism enforced.","url":"https://www.channelstv.com/2026/02/06/trump-sparks-fury-with-video-depicting-obamas-as-monkeys/","image":"https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Trump-Obama.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 16:29:20","author":"Tom Jones Usen","authors":["Tom Jones Usen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.136}]}
