Apparently I’m 40 seconds late,” Harris opened her only announced event of the day during a trip to Detroit — just 21 days before the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“Well, you are black,” the host joked about her tardiness — before launching into a question about why Harris “come[s] off as very scripted — they say you like to stick to your talking points.”\n\n“That would be called discipline,” Harris cooly replied — before proceeding to nimbly dodge a series of pointed questions from the host and guests.\n\n“There are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election. And so it requires repetition,” she insisted.\n\nMcKelvey pressed Harris hard on issues such as foreign aid to other countries, which former President Donald Trump, 78, has campaigned on restricting, on her past prosecuting marijuana offenders and her role as retiring President Biden’s point person on reducing illegal immigration, which instead surged.\n\nWhen a listener expressed concern that Trump, who is vowing to mass-deport illegal immigrants, might “put anyone that doesn’t look white in camps,” Harris brought up the border.\n\n“Yeah, so you’ve hit on a really important point and expressed it, I think so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect to make you scared,” Harris began, adding: “He prefers to run on a problem instead of fix a problem, and we got to call it out and see it for what it is.”\n\nThe host interjected: “But doesn’t the Biden administration have to take some blame for the border, though? A lot of the blame — because, I mean, the first three years y’all did get a lot of things wrong with the border.”\n\nHarris pivoted into a lengthy recitation of campaign talking points, saying that “the first thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system” — referring to legislation that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for nearly all illegal immigrants in the US, which Republicans said would prompt more to come without legal permission.\n\nBorder encounters hit record highs in each of the first three years of Harris’ role leading the federal efforts to reduce illegal immigration, before declining in recent months following a Biden order to restrict the processing of asylum claims.\n\nAsked by a listener, “What’s your stance on reparations?” Harris gave her longest answer of the interview — declining to take a firm stance before giving an exhaustive account of her various economic policies.\n\n“First of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There’s no question about that,” she said before pivoting to generally applicable policies.\n\n“You’re going to keep going?” McKelvey asked at one point\n\n“You caught that!” she said as she continued to do just that.\n\n“OK, filibuster ma’am!” he cracked.\n\nMoments later, Harris emphasized, “Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody.”\n\nThe interview featured a number of tense questions.\n\nMcKelvey at one point tore into Harris, who tweeted earlier in the day that black men should support her due to her support of marijuana legalization, over the fact that she oversaw the conviction of more than 1,900 people for pot as San Francisco district attorney between 2004 and 2011.\n\n“One of the biggest allegations against you is that you targeted and locked up thousands of black men in San Francisco for weeds. Some say you did it to boost your career. Some say you did it out of pure hate for black men. Please tell us the facts,” he said.\n\nHarris did not directly address the many pot convictions on her watch while maintaining “I was the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases and would not send people to jail for simple possession of weed.”\n\nIn another exchange, a listener asked: “Why are we sending money to other countries when we definitely need it in our own country, for homeless, housing, resources for whatever — that is my determining factor, if I vote for Kamala or not?”\n\nThe host noted to Harris, “That’s that’s one of the reasons [Trump’s] America first rhetoric resonates.”\n\n“We can do it all,” she maintained.\n\nCharlamagne tha God pressed, quoting Harris’ self-proclaimed favorite rapper Tupac as saying, “We got money for war, but can’t feed feed the poor.”\n\nHarris did get nailed down on some points.\n\nAsked why people “can’t we just say” the election is about “fascism” as manifested by Trump, she said: “Yes, we can say that.”\n\nAt another point, she addressed what McKelvey said was a “rumor that Janet Jackson is mad at you because you prosecuted her brother the late great Michael Jackson” — an apparent reference to the pop star incorrectly claiming that Harris, who is biracial, is not black and has a white father.\n\n“That’s just not true, on either count,” Harris said about. “I have not talked to her, but certainly it’s not true about her brother.”\n\nThe interview cut off mid-sentence as Harris spoke past the allotted time, saying that Trump, who recently trashed Detroit while in the Motor City “as a tendency to mention cities that either have historically black, majority population or —.”\n\nThe thought was eclipsed by dead air.","summary":"The popular radio host tried repeatedly — and with little success — to knock Harris off her talking points during the hourlong interview.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/us-news/charlamagne-tha-god-calls-out-harris-during-awkward-town-hall/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/charlamagne-tha-god-calls-out-kamala-harris-during-awkward-town-hall.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729020642&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zYn1e5Bf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:31:51","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":259835672,"title":"Georgia reports record turnout as early voting begins in US battleground state","text":"Voters in Georgia turned out in record numbers as the battleground state opened early voting for the November 5 US presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, state officials said on Tuesday.\nAt least 252,000 voters had cast ballots at early-voting sites as of 4pm, nearly double the 136,000 who participated in the first day of early voting in the 2020 election, said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s No 2 election official.\n“Spectacular turnout,” he wrote on social media.\nEarly voting, either in person or by mail, has become increasingly popular with US voters. Nearly one in seven voters cast their ballots ahead of Election Day in 2020, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab.\nHowever, many Republicans opposed the dramatic expansion of mail voting that year, saying it was less secure than in-person voting, and Trump cited false claims of mail ballot fraud as he sought unsuccessfully to overturn his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nSome Republicans continue to insist that voters should be able to cast their ballots only in person on Election Day, though party officials are encouraging supporters to vote ahead of time.\nNationwide, 5.5 million Americans have already voted this year, according to Election Lab.\nBy contrast, 27 million people had cast their ballots at this point in the 2020 election as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLike some other states, Georgia has tightened its mail-voting laws since then, requiring voters who want to cast an absentee ballot to provide proof of identity and limiting the number of places they can deposit their ballots.\nGeorgia is one of the seven competitive battleground states expected to play a decisive role in deciding the election.","summary":"More than 250,000 voters cast their ballots on the first day, nearly double the 2020 turnout.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3282519/georgia-reports-record-turnout-early-voting-begins-us-battleground-state","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/16/e4fabd39-d1e8-4710-9da1-c6165410159a_94f9a2d8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:25:16","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":259834676,"title":"Donald Trump Confronted with Own Age Amid Supreme Court Justices Remark","text":"Former President Donald Trump was reminded of his advanced age on Tuesday after arguing that \"only stupid people\" appoint older judges to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.Trump, 78, made the remarks while touting his three Supreme Court picks—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett—during an interview with Bloomberg Editor-In-Chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago.\"It's amazing, because I got three in four years,\" Trump said. \"Most people get none. Because, you know, you put them in, they're young. You tend to put them in young.\"\"Only stupid people put old,\" he continued. \"You know, you don't put old in, because they're there for two years or three years, right?\"Micklethwait then interjected by telling the former president, \"You're a 78-year-old man running for president.\"\"So, I got three,\" Trump responded, ignoring Micklethwait's remark. \"A lot of presidents get none, I got three. And, uh, I think they've been three great choices too, by the way.\"Trump then warned that the \"radical left\" would put \"up to 25\" left-wing justices on the Supreme Court if Vice President Kamala Harris defeats him in the presidential election, despite the court having a total of only nine justices.Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's communications director, told Newsweek the following via email when asked for comment on Micklethwait's age remark: \"Micklethwait was getting eviscerated throughout the interview for his blatant lies and he tried to say something stupid but was roundly booed by the crowd. That's what happens when you are fake news.\"As Supreme Court justices serve for life or until they decide to retire, all presidents tend to choose relatively young but experienced judges to fill the role. Trump's appointees were between 40 and 53 when they joined the court. President Joe Biden's appointee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was 51.The ex-president's allies frequently criticized Biden's age and cognitive state before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris on July 21. However, Trump is the oldest person to ever be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party and has increasingly faced questions about his own physical and mental fitness for office.A Marquette Law School poll released earlier this month found that 61 percent of registered voters agreed that Trump is \"too old to be president,\" while only 13 percent said the same of Harris.In an article published by The Atlantic in September, psychiatrist Richard Friedman claimed that Trump is showing signs of cognitive decline, pointing to the former president's behavior during his September 10 presidential debate with Harris.While Friedman did not diagnose Trump with any medical condition, he argued that Trump's vocabulary, his verbal and logical coherence, his ability to adapt to new topics and his facial expressions were all \"alarming\" and may indicate that he does not have \"a healthy brain.\"Trump's behavior at a town hall event in Pennsylvania on Monday, when the former president stopped taking questions from the audience and instead danced on stage and stood awkwardly as music played for 39 minutes, prompted his Democratic opponent to weigh in on social media.\"Hope he's okay,\" Harris wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in response to video clips of the Trump town hall.","summary":"Trump, 78, was reminded of his advanced age after he spoke against appointing \"old\" judges to the Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-confronted-age-amid-supreme-court-justices-remark-1969628","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2496200/donald-trump-reminded-age-scotus.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:17:50","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":259834636,"title":"Polls Close in Georgia After Record-Breaking Early Voting: What We Know","text":"Georgia has begun early voting and a record-breaking turnout is heating up an already tight race in the battleground state.All eyes were on the Peach State on Tuesday as voters started heading to the polls to cast early ballots ahead of the November 5 election. Georgia residents have 2 1/2 weeks—from October 15 to November 1—to vote in-person, including two Saturdays. Some counties also offer Sunday voting.\"It looks like this is going to be a record-breaking first day of early voting,\" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters Tuesday morning. \"But we don't make predictions, we let the voters decide, but it looks like we're going to have strong early voting today.\"By 2 p.m., Georgia had already broken the record set in 2020, with 187,973 votes. Four years ago, 136,000 votes were cast on the first day of early voting. By Tuesday's end, more than a quarter of a million votes were cast. Over 12,900 mail-in ballots have also been returned, according to the secretary of state's election data hub.With 16 electoral votes, Georgia will likely be a major step in the path to 270. The last time a presidential candidate won the White House without the Peach State was in 2004, when John Kerry carried Georgia but lost the presidency to George W. Bush. Donald Trump won the state by a margin of 5.1 percent in 2016, while Joe Biden carried Georgia by a much narrower margin of 0.23 percent, or 11,779 votes, in 2020.Polls also show a tight race. Former President Trump has a one-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, per FiveThirtyEight's tracker, while RealClearPolitics shows Trump with an even narrower advantage, just half a point ahead of Harris. Still, both predictions are within the margin of error.\"Both campaigns have been suggesting that people who need to vote absentee should do so, but they are pushing early voting significantly,\" Audrey Haynes, associate political science professor at the University of Georgia, told Newsweek.Was Tuesday Good for Trump or Harris?Going into the first day of early voting, there's been a \"good deal of ground game\" from the Democrats and less for Trump's campaign, Haynes said. But she pointed out that there have been major efforts from some of the state's top Republicans, like Governor Brian Kemp and former Senator Kelly Loeffler, to establish early voting infrastructure that \"certainly work[s] for Georgia Republicans and the ticket in general.\"Harris supporters were quick to declare Tuesday a win for the Democratic nominee, repeating that the early votes outnumber the margin by which Biden won the state four years ago.\"I'm going to take this is a good sign that 11,780 votes aren't going to be nearly enough this time around,\" one supporter wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Political commentator Tristan Snell echoed those comments, tweeting that Tuesday's numbers were far higher than the record set in 2020, an election that resulted in Biden beating Trump.\"Kamala Harris is on her way to winning by a LOT more,\" Snell concluded.While it is unknown which candidate the early votes favored, information on which counties cast ballots on Tuesday could offer signs. The secretary of state's office told Newsweek that Georgia's election data hub will update with the data after polls close at 5 p.m.\"The Atlanta area favors Harris but rural Georgia is Trump country,\" political analyst Steve Schier told Newsweek.Haynes agreed that early voting in Atlanta, plus turnout in Augusta, Macon, Columbus and Savannah, would be welcome news for Harris, but that everywhere else in Georgia could spell promising signs for Trump.Some experts warned against drawing too many conclusions from the first day of early voting. Dave Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, said on X that early voting data doesn't include which candidate Georgia residents chose, nor does it paint a picture of the final electorate. He added that the data can't be compared to the patterns observed in 2020 because voting has changed so much post-pandemic.\"Resist the temptation to draw inferences at all costs,\" Wasserman wrote.\"The campaigns are going to be working hard up to the last moment. The election is tight. And usually as we get closer to election day, it always tightens in the polls,\" Haynes said. \"But it will not be until election day (or perhaps the next one) that we will know what decision the country has made about who will govern in the White House or who will control the House or Senate or state legislatures.\"2024 Voters Are Excited\"We are seeing a significant burst of voting on the first day of in person early voting,\" Haynes said. \"The most motivated voters show up day one.\"Georgia's early voting numbers are part of a national trend that suggests Americans are highly motivated to vote in the 2024 election. A national NBC News poll conducted from October 4 to October 8 found that 5 percent of registered voters had already cast their ballots. Another 47 percent said they planned to vote early, while 3 percent were undecided on voting method, and 1 percent were not planning to vote, leaving only 44 percent planning to vote on Election Day.Early voting has become increasingly common in recent elections, especially in 2020 when election officials and political campaigns sought to expand voting access during the COVID-19 pandemic. In late October 2020, 68 percent of Americans said they planned to vote early.Democrats typically vote earlier and by mail more than Republicans, but a Harvard poll conducted from October 11 to October 13 found that Trump has a slight lead among early voters in battleground states at the moment. The survey, which included 3,145 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points, found Trump with 48 percent to Harris' 47 percent.","summary":"Georgia shattered its early voting record on Tuesday.

I know men like that.’ No, I know him,” Pelosi told The Guardian.\n\n“There’s one picture of me leaving the Roosevelt Room at the cabinet meeting.

The couple also donated some $90 million to pro-Trump groups in the 2020 rate. Adelson has remained a Republican megadonor following her husband’s death in 2021. She held off donating to Trump while former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was in the race, according to the Times, as the two were friends and have reportedly gathered for multiple meetings within the last year. Adelson’s donations to a pro-Trump group are crucial for the former president, as Harris’ campaign has raised $1 billion this year compared to the Trump campaign’s $853 million, the Times reported. However, the top 10 PACs supporting Trump have raised about $329.4 million since the start of the year compared to the $256.6 million raised by the top 10 Harris-supporting PACs, partially narrowing the gap between the two candidates.\n\n2.4 points. That’s Harris’ lead over Trump in national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight’s weighted polling average.

The all-women panelists discussed Trump's refusal to make public his medical records ahead of the November elections after his rival Kamala Harris came out healthy as a horse. But, it was his makeup that became the butt of jokes. \n\nPolitical strategist Ana Navarro came prepared with Trump's photos to support her argument, saying, \"It wasn't but a few weeks ago that Republicans in Congress were actually subpoenaing some of the top advisers of Joe Biden and Jill Biden, accusing them of covering up Joe Biden's health. Well, okay. Can we please look at this picture of Donald Trump and you tell me what kind of healthy this looks to you?\" pointing out Trump's photograph which showed a stark difference between his real skin and the makeup. \n\n\"Okay, so, I know it's pumpkin spice season,\" joked Navarro as the audience and her fellow panelists cracked up. She further quipped, \"But I want to show the Trump Campaign. This is a makeup sponge. You use it to blend because I think the biggest border crisis that Donald Trump is encountering at the moment is the border between his real skin and his bronze skin,\" as per Raw Story.\n\nThe image in question was shared by an X, formerly Twitter account @acnewsitics whose post opened the floodgates for trolls to mock Trump's makeup skills. An X user, @Gorilianaire, commented under the photograph and compared it with Harris, \"Trump wears more makeup than Harris.\" @MessicanDracula suggested a campaign ad idea for the Harris-Walz ticket, \"That should be in an ad.

She is reportedly considering a sit-down with Joe Rogan, whose podcast is one of the most popular programs in the country.\n\nHer appearance in Detroit was specifically targeted towards reaching Black voters at a time when some Democrats are concerned that her support is lagging among Black men compared with President Biden’s position at this time during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nAfter the radio personality opened the conversation by asking Harris to respond to critics who accuse her of being overly reliant on talking points, the vice president replied: “That’s called discipline.”\n\nShe also pointed out that “repetition” is important in politics because it ensures that people get the message she is trying to deliver. \n\n“At my rallies, I say the same thing when I go to Detroit as I do in Philly, as I do wherever I am, to make sure that people hear and receive what critical issues that are at stake in this election,” she said.\n\nHarris also expressed confidence that she would win the upcoming election, though she conceded that the race between her and Trump remains “a margin of error” contest with just 21 days remaining. \n\nPressed on criticisms she’s received about her record as a prosecutor — a record that’s been fodder for Republicans who claim she used her power and authority to gratuitously incarcerate Black men for minor marijuana violations, she pointed out that public defenders who worked with her have called her “the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases” because she “would not send people to jail for simple possession of weed.”\n\nShe pledged that as president, she’d continue the Biden administration’s work on decriminalizing marijuana because she knows “exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations, and specifically Black men.”\n\nAsked by a guest what Harris would specifically do for Black people if elected, the vice president said her work “from the beginning of my career through today” has been about helping the Black community, including by taking on issues such as Black maternal mortality as vice president.\n\n“The work that I've done that has been about focusing on my knowledge and my experience in my life, experience of knowing, the entrepreneurship that we have in the community, the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams, and then tapping into that so that not only has my work been about ensuring that we have some of the lowest black unemployment ever in our country, but that also knowing that that should be a baseline, that everybody has a job, and what we should be invested in is also building wealth in the community,” she said.\n\nBut Harris also went after Trump in stark terms when pressed on whether the military would be available to “fight” for American freedom if Trump were to foment another violent “insurrection” by a different guest.\n\nHarris pointed out that “those who worked the closest” with Trump — including “his chief of staff, two secretaries of defense, his national security advisor and his former vice president” — have declined to endorse his bid for another four-year term.\n\nShe also said the ex-president’s “way of trying to name-call and demean and divide” is actually a sign of weakness rather than the sign of strength his supporters view it as.\n\n“The man is really quite weak. He's weak. It's a sign of weakness that you want to please dictators and seek their flattery and favor. It's a sign of weakness that you would demean America's military and America's service members. It's a sign of weakness that you don't have the courage to stand up for the Constitution the United States and the principles upon which it stands,” she said. “This man is weak and he is unfit.”","summary":"‘This man is weak and he is unfit,’ Harris told the popular radio host","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-charlemagne-tha-god-trump-interview-facism-b2629886.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/22/SEI225740998.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fLCfEUm0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:58:26","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":259833450,"title":"Kamala Harris – who threatened criminal charges against oil companies in 2019 –  now praises domestic energy production  ","text":"Her flip-flops are like oil and water. \n\nVice President Kamala Harris threatened to bring criminal charges against Big Oil companies during her 2019 White House run but is now giving the industry high marks for its booming output. \n\nHer dramatic shift in support for domestic oil and gas production is one of several policy flip-flops that have been exposed since Harris replaced President Biden on the 2024 Democratic ticket. \n\n“You should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime,” Harris told a South Carolina town hall attendee back in November 2019, when asked whether she would investigate the role oil companies play in climate change. \n\nThe then-California Senator went on to accuse oil companies of engaging in a cover-up – likening them to cigarette manufacturers. \n\n“And, not unlike the tobacco companies, after years — ’cause they’d done the research — they knew the harm that their product was causing,” Harris said at the town hall, according to CNN. “They were making so much money that they kept that secret — same thing with these big oil companies.” \n\n“And they need to pay the price,” she added. “So yes is the answer.”\n\nCNN discovered more than a dozen mentions of “prosecuting Big Oil” on material from Harris’ 2020 campaign, with the threat of climate change being the impetus. \n\n“They had done the studies and they knew of the harm that their product was creating, but they still pushed their product ’cause they were making a ton of money. That’s the same thing with Big Oil,” Harris said at an Iowa campaign event in 2019, according to the outlet. \n\n“They’ve known for a long time what they’ve been doing – that is destroying this God-given planet,” she said, once again comparing Big Oil to Big Tobacco. \n\nDuring her first White House run, Harris also falsely touted having “sued” ExxonMobil – the largest domestic oil company in the US – as Attorney General of California. \n\nHarris launched an investigation into the oil giant, over allegations that it misled the public and shareholders about the threat of climate change, but she never filed a lawsuit. \n\nHarris’ tough-talk on oil played nicely with other far-left positions on energy that she trumped in 2019, including support for the Green New Deal, banning fracking and outlawing gasoline-powered cars. \n\nAll of the above are policies that she has disavowed in her latest presidential bid. \n\n“We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,” Harris said at a Philadelphia campaign event last month. \n\nHer campaign website also promotes the “record energy production” from the oil and gas industries under the Harris-Biden administration, describing it as “ensuring America’s energy security and independence.” \n\nHowever, the recent surge in US oil production has largely been attributed to better drilling technology and market forces rather than Harris-Biden administration policies. \n\nThere is no mention of prosecuting Big Oil companies on her website, but Harris does tout the “tens of millions in settlements” against the industry during her time as Claifornia AG and she vaguely vows to “ hold polluters accountable.” \n\nThe Post has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.","summary":"Her dramatic shift in support for domestic oil and gas production is one of several policy flip-flops that have been exposed since Harris replaced President Biden on the 2024 Democratic ticket. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/us-news/kamala-harris-who-threatened-criminal-charges-against-oil-companies-in-2019-now-praises-domestic-energy-production/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/kamala-harris-threatened-criminal-charges-91676775.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zYn1e5Bf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:56:22","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":259833604,"title":"Georgians Flock to Polling Locations as Early In-Person Voting Opens","text":"Early in-person voting is now underway in key swing state Georgia.\n\nAlso known as advance voting in the Peach State, the practice kicked off on Oct. 15, about a week after absentee ballots were sent out to voters who requested them. Advance voting lasts until 5 p.m. on Nov. 1, a few days before Election Day, Nov. 5.\n\nAt a press conference on the morning of Oct. 15, Georgia’s state elections director, Blake Evans, praised local elections officials for opening all early voting locations, including in counties affected by Hurricane Helene.\n\nEvans and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger suggested turnout could be high based on the large number of early check-ins before 10:30 a.m.—more than 71,000.\n\nBy 1 p.m., 154,505 advance votes had been cast according to a post on X from the secretary of state’s chief operating officer Gabriel Sterling.\n\nOutside an early voting location in Smyrna, Georgia, on Oct. 15, voter Geert Loeffen told The Epoch Times “It’s great to see so many people out, because if you’re not engaging in it, then you really shouldn’t be complaining about it.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 15, cars packed the parking lots ringing the Smyrna Community Center. It’s one of multiple early voting sites in Cobb County, a battleground county within the larger battleground state.\n\nLoeffen was one of multiple voters who spoke with The Epoch Times. He declined to share whether he supported former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that he is an independent.\n\nWhile he worries about ideological echo chambers, he thinks Smyrna has done well uniting locals at a time of heightened polarization.\n\n“They do so many things to bring the community together that [are] non-political,” Loeffen said.\n\nHe described the presidential race in his state as “tight.”\n\n“It’s the margins that make the difference,” he said.\n\nWhile some were hesitant to reveal their choices, Dolly Quigley and Beverly Miller, who were walking together through the parking lot after casting their ballots, were eager to share that they had not voted for Trump.\n\n“In my own personal family, there are five of us, and I have three family members who are voting for Trump. It’s just killing me,” Quigley said.\n\nMiller, who is African American, said she struggled to understand how some young black and Hispanic men could support Trump.\n\nThe two retirees both relocated to Georgia from elsewhere relatively recently—Quigley from Rhode Island and Miller from California.\n\nLawrence Freedman, a retired U.S. Customs regional director, voted at the community center in the morning. The Epoch Times caught him in the afternoon, when he was walking his dog, Oscar Bonner, along a trail near the community center.\n\n“I was happy to vote for Donald Trump. We were at peace. The economy was pretty good,” Freedman said.\n\n“I have voted for Democrats over the years, but they’re not the same Democrats that are running now.”\n\nThe former federal law enforcement officer spoke with authority on the state of the southern border.\n\n“The border has to be protected, and it’s not happening now,” Freedman said.\n\n“No election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance,” the judge wrote in his opinion.\n\nMcBurney held that election certification is “a purely ministerial task that gives its performer no discretion to exclude some votes while counting others.”\n\nEarly in-person voting began Oct. 9 in another battleground state, Arizona. It will start in the upcoming days and weeks in North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin.","summary":"As advance voting hits new highs, voters speak to The Epoch Times about their choices.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/georgians-flock-to-polling-locations-as-early-in-person-voting-opens-5741943","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/15/id5741944-Georgia-Voters-2_JF_10142024-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:50:19","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":259833146,"title":"GOP candidates follow Trump on transgender politics — and put Democrats on defense","text":"There used to be a time when Republican elected officials and candidates shied away from talking about trans issues. \n\nThey didn’t want to appear extreme or intolerant. Why bother wading in to a fraught cultural issue when there were so many other things to talk about? Deferring to “medical professionals” or “the experts” seemed the easy way out. \n\nNow, though, Republicans have emphatically found their voice.\n\nAcross the political landscape, GOP Senate candidates are hitting their Democratic opponents on their trans radicalism and have them on the run, while the Trump campaign is pounding Kamala Harris on the issue with perhaps the most prominent ad of this election cycle. \n\nThe chickens have come home to roost, and they are apparently all cis-gender. \n\nFor the longest time, Democrats have gone along with the steadily evolving trans orthodoxy as established by the cultural left.\n\nExisting in a bubble, they assumed that doubters could be isolated or embarrassed into going along, and didn’t realize just how wildly out of touch they’d become.\n\nIt’s one thing to say people should be tolerant of the choices of consenting adults; it’s another to say that minors must have access to life-altering so-called “gender-affirming” treatments.\n\nIt’s one thing to say everyone should live and let live; it’s another to say that biological males must participate in female sports, no matter how manifestly unfair it is to the girls and women. \n\nThere were plenty of flashing red lights for Democrats to heed.\n\nA Washington Post poll last year found that 57% of people say that gender is determined at birth. Roughly two-thirds of people said biological males shouldn’t compete in girls’ and women’s sports.\n\nAnd 68% opposed giving children ages 10 to 14 access to puberty-blocking medication, while 58% opposed teens age 15 to17 having access to hormonal treatments. \n\nIt’s only now, when they are getting punished on the issue, that Democrats are coming out and saying, in effect, they have favored the gender binary all along. \n\nFighting off a challenge from Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and his super PAC have targeted the congressman for his opposition to a bill called the Protecting Women and Girls Sports Act.\n\nIn a sign that the attack was working, Allard responded in his own ad, declaring, “I don’t want boys playing girls’ sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.” \n\nThis led to denunciations of Allred from the left.\n\nAccording to the LGBT publication The Advocate, Allred “embraced far-right language around gender identity in a new ad” — the offending words being “boys” and “girls.” \n\nSimilar ads have run wherever there is a competitive Senate race, many of them crafted and paid for by the Mitch McConnell campaign outfit, the Senate Leadership Fund. \n\nIn Ohio, embattled incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has also felt compelled to respond with his own ad calling the idea that he supports males competing against females in sports “a complete lie.” The ad points out that Ohio has already prohibited this practice.\n\nBut in an interview with the aforementioned Advocate last year, Brown harshly denounced such laws. \n\n“I think all this shows is that there’s still so much hate in this country,” he said, “and by extension hate in politics. Politicians who introduce and support these prohibitive bills should be ashamed of themselves, and it’s my hope that their constituents see through these ugly efforts and push back on them.”\n\nBrown wants us to believe that he has had a sudden — and surely instantly revocable, if he survives — conversion on the issue. \n\nFor his part, Donald Trump is airing an ad during football games highlighting how Kamala Harris said in 2019 she supported government-funded transition surgery for prisoners and detained illegal immigrants.\n\nAs the ad itself says, it’s hard to believe that anyone seriously seeking public office would advocate such a thing.\n\nNow, in the final weeks of an extremely tight election, she and her Democratic colleagues are being held to account for their ideological excesses.\n\nThey can cry foul all they like, but they brought it on themselves. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"GOP Senate candidates are hitting their Democratic opponents on their trans-radicalism and have them on the run.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/opinion/gop-candidates-transgender-slams-put-democrats-on-defense/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-lgrzkbzx8-1729030417162.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729016109&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:49:28","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":259833606,"title":"Biden, Harris, Walz, Vance Converge on Battleground Pennsylvania | Capitol Report","text":"Oct-15-2024\n\nTouting tariffs and vowing to take on China, former President Donald Trump details his economic plans as he campaigns in key swing states.

Such aid is contingent on compliance with international law and international humanitarian law, officials said. \n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a letter to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer on Monday, alerting them that the deliveries of humanitarian aid to Gaza have drastically decreased and giving them 30 days to implement “concrete measures” to improve the situation.\n\n“Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for US policy under NSM-20 and relevant US law,” Blinken and Austin wrote. NSM-20 is a memorandum issued by President Joe Biden in February 2023, which says that recipients of American weapons must provide “credible and reliable written assurances” that they would respect international law. \n\nThe private correspondence “made clear our concerns about the levels of humanitarian assistance that have been making it into Gaza,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nMiller added that a similar letter was sent in April. While aid deliveries to Gaza improved for a period of time, they have since “fallen by over 50%,” and the amount of aid entering the embattled Palestinian enclave in September was “the lowest of any month during the past year,” officials wrote. \n\nThe White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the letter was prompted by “a marked decrease in humanitarian assistance, which has us concerned.”\n\nWhile Kirby did not comment on the threat of limiting military aid, Miller also pointed to NSM-20, which put the humanitarian requirements in place.\n\n“There are provisions under US law that require us to make certain certifications. And to make those certifications, we have to see that Israel is not arbitrarily denying humanitarian assistance making it into Gaza,” Miller said.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, restrictions under NSM-20 do not apply to “defensive” equipment such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, recently sent to Israel to help counter another Iranian missile attack.\n\nIsraeli defense sources told the Jerusalem Post that prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have no choice but to comply with US demands, even if that means giving up the reported plan to besiege Hamas in northern Gaza.\n\nWashington has also publicly called on West Jerusalem to back away from a military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, in favor of diplomacy. \n\nThe 30-day deadline puts the eventual decision on withholding military aid to Israel well beyond the upcoming US presidential election, in which the incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris has struggled to mobilize Palestinian- and Arab-American voters in traditional strongholds of the Democrats, in part due to the current administration’s support for Israel.","summary":"Israel needs to take a series of steps to ensure humanitarian aid to Gaza or face cuts to military assistance, the US has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605770-us-warns-israel-arms-embargo/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/670eee5c20302768450025b9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:41:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":259833190,"title":"Mapping out paths to victory for Harris and Trump in Georgia","text":"Mapping out paths to victory for Harris and Trump in Georgia\n Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in Georgia.

The letter says that “thousands of young voters across Wisconsin” received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nThe text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison.\n\n“Don’t vote in a state where you’re not eligible,” the text said.\n\nWisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes.\n\nAt least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X.\n\nThe League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action “the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting.”\n\nStudents attending college in Wisconsin are able to register to vote either at their home address or their one at school.\n\n“But now many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party,” the letter said.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nWisconsin Justice Department spokesperson Gillian Drummond said that the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess “what if any follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law.”\n\nUniversities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it.\n\nRiley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can’t determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn’t received a formal complaint about it.\n\nHowever, he called the message “concerning” and said that it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message.\n\n“We understand that these third party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,” Vetterkind said. “We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.”\n\nThe text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide.\n\nStarting Oct. 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Former President Barack Obama plans to join current vice presidential nominee Tim Walz in Madison for a rally that day to encourage early voting.\n\nWisconsin is one of the “blue wall” states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to Vice President Kamala Harris’ strategy for defeating Republican Donald Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMADISON, Wis. – Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Groups advocating for voting rights call for an investigation into text messages in Wisconsin first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/groups-advocating-for-voting-rights-call-for-an-investigation-into-text-messages-in-wisconsin/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/U3XYYH6RMVEPLAWWDFYE5D3SQI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:19:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":259832824,"title":"WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden speaks at Philadelphia City Committee dinner","text":"He is scheduled to begin speaking at 6:45 p.m.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \n\nBiden has campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris in key swing states such as Pennsylvania in past weeks as the Democrats look to shore up support among groups more supportive of Biden than Harris.","summary":"President Joe Biden is delivering remarks at the Philadelphia City Committee dinner.

Johnson claimed that CBS did just that to his appearance on Sunday’s episode of ‘Face the Nation’.\n\n“I recently traveled to [North Carolina] and victims of Hurricane Helene told me nearly two weeks after landfall, the Biden-Harris Administration had STILL not provided them with all the resources they desperately needed,” Johnson wrote on X. “But CBS selectively edited OUT ENTIRELY this first-hand perspective.”\n\nHe then posted the segment as aired alongside the raw footage, which showed which parts CBS had chosen to omit.\n\n“So they’ve obligated some funds, but they’ve only distributed two percent…. The rescue and recovery effort is still going on, and then we address the rest of it,” CBS showed him as saying in the first segment.\n\nThe network omitted five other sentences in between, including that the people of North Carolina told Johnson they “had not been provided the resources, almost two weeks after the storm, that they desperately needed.”\n\nJohnson then shared another example of selective editing, in which CBS removed all references to the federal government trying to prevent a state from removing non-citizens from voter rolls.\n\n“Here’s the problem, there is a number of states that are not requiring proof of citizenship when illegals or non-citizens register to vote. We know that’s happening. Everybody should want the law to be followed,” was what CBS aired Johnson as saying.\n\nGone was any mention of the Biden administration suing Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin for cleaning up voter rolls to exclude non-citizens, or Johnson wondering why the White House would do something that “creates a lot of doubt and concerns in the minds of the American people.”\n\nIn the third exchange, CBS cut Johnson’s entire answer to the question about voting integrity, leaving only the opening sentence.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Johnson was so disgusted by what happened that he has vowed to never give a non-live interview with CBS again.\n\nThe network has already faced criticism for their ‘60 Minutes’ interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, in which te network aired two different answers to the same question in the preview and in the final broadcast.\n\nFormer US president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who will face Harris in the November 5 election, accused CBS of perpetrating “the greatest fraud in broadcast history” with the Harris interview and called for their broadcast license to be pulled.\n\nThe network has declined to release the raw footage to clear up the controversy.","summary":"House Speaker Mike Johnson has accused CBS of cutting important parts of his pre-recorded interview in violation of journalistic integrity \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605772-johnson-cbs-selective-editing/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/670ee4fb85f540719c0dc0bd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:12:34","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":259829792,"title":"Trump Gets Good News as Registered Democrats Drop 18% in Key Swing County","text":"The gap between registered Republican and Democrat voters in the bellwether Erie County in Pennsylvania narrowed between 2020 and 2024, potentially giving former President Donald Trump a boost.While there are more Democrat supporters (80,940) compared to Republicans (71,439), the number of those aligning with the Democratic Party had dropped 18 percent over four years. Nearly 99,000 were registered with the party in 2020.Erie, in the northwest of the battleground state, voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, but he only won by 1 percent.With fewer potential supporters this time around, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was in the county Monday night, may have a bigger job to do to secure victory.Earlier in the year, Erie was named one of the top seven swing counties in the election, meaning it could play a pivotal role in deciding the next president of the United States.\"Erie County has voted with the winner in 25 of the last 28 statewide elections, making it one of the 'swingiest' swing counties in the United States,\" Dr. Joe Morris, chair of the political science department at Mercyhurst University, told YourErie in August.The county was joined by others in swing states thought to be vital for victory, including Maricopa County in Arizona, Richmond County in Georgia, and Oakland County in Michigan.President Barack Obama took Erie in both 2008 and 2012, but it turned red for Trump in 2016, before the swing back to blue in 2020.While it only counts for 2 percent of Pennsylvania's population, its tendency to swing back and forth has captured the attention of political candidates and experts alike.When speaking Monday night, Harris went in hard on her opponent, branding him \"unstable\" and warning supporters that a second term for Trump would be dangerous for the country. Accompanied by video clips for the first time, Harris' speech was one of the strongest attacks on the Republican so far.Despite an apparent drop in registered voters, Erie County Democratic Chairperson Sam Talarico told NPR earlier in October that there had been a surge of enthusiasm since Harris became the party's nominee.\"There are a lot of people, I believe, especially younger people, that just weren't going to vote,\" he said. \"And they've been energized by Kamala Harris' entrance onto the stage.\"Trump visited the county two weeks ago, where he attacked Harris for her response to Hurricane Helene before saying he was in Erie to meet with \"the workers\", referring to the area's working-class roots. The former president reportedly still owes thousands of dollars to the area for costs related to his previous rallies.Pennsylvania's Team Trump Spokesman Kush Desai told Newsweek in a statement that the GOP's outreach in the state had been successful.\"Pennsylvanians in Erie County and everywhere else across the Commonwealth have firsthand experienced the peace, prosperity, and stability of the first Trump administration and the disaster, failure, and incompetence of the Harris-Biden administration – which Kamala Harris is running to extend by another four years,\" Desai said.\"That's why our grassroots voter outreach program has been so successful in cutting the Democrats' registered voter advantage by nearly half in Pennsylvania as we take our message of 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago' to voters wherever they are: at their doorstep, on the phone, and even on social media.\"Erie County figures showed a slight drop in Republican registrations, also, going from 74,620 four years ago to 71,439.Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes could be key for either candidate, and the race remains tight. Recent polling showed Harris with a 1-point lead over Trump, while other surveys showed a far narrower picture.\"Erie picks Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania will pick the president,\" Senator John Fetterman told CNN on Monday. \"People are discussing how Pennsylvania is a small version of the United States, and Erie is a smaller version of Pennsylvania.

Vance hints Elon Musk and Lina Khan could be in Trump admin: ‘I agree with them both on some issues’","text":"BUTLER, Pa. — Democratic billionaires can’t stand her. Republican members of Congress can’t stop investigating her. \n\nBut President Biden’s Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan may find herself some new and strange bedfellows in a Trump-Vance administration. The lower half of the ticket said so himself, floating a possible role for Khan working alongside an even more controversial figure: billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. \n\nSpeaking to The Post, vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance considered the possibility of the two policy lightning rods serving in the would-be Trump White House next year, working to crack down on Big Tech censorship. \n\nVance answered to the backdrop of opera filling the air at Donald Trump’s triumphant return to Butler, Pa. \n\n“I agree with them both on some issues. I disagree with them both on some issues,” he began, appearing amused by the question. \n\n“What unites the Republican ticket is a sense that we just got to get back to common sense, and it’s okay to disagree with each other,” Vance continued, mentioning Trump supporters with a variety of worldviews: ex-Democrats Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard along with Republicans nsuch as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n“You can have strong disagreements on issues. We want to facilitate that disagreement because we believe the best idea will rise to the top.”\n\nBut what hasn’t united Republicans historically is an affinity for antitrust, which sets Vance apart.\n\nIn recent days, several Republican committee chairs in the House have accused Khan of overstepping her antitrust powers, wasting taxpayer dollars and campaigning with Democrats.\n\nThe GOP has long been the party of business, but Vance is leading a new conservative vanguard aiming to check corporate power, especially Big Tech. \n\nThese “Khan-servatives,” who include Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, support the FTC chair’s work to challenge monopolies and expand the scope of US antitrust powers. They want to go beyond keeping prices low for consumers — they also see the FTC’s mission as promoting competition and innovation. \n\nWith election integrity top of mind for some Republican voters, Vance wants to crack down on Big Tech censorship he believes silences conservatives — and Khan could be his secret weapon to do just that. \n\n“I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,” Vance said in February at an antitrust conference.\n\nBuilding on Trump-era antitrust probes into Big Tech, Khan’s FTC has sued Amazon for squeezing sellers and favoring its own services on its marketplace and Meta for buying up would-be social media competitors Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nVance, formerly a venture capitalist, shares Khan’s vision to break up behemoth tech companies he says stifle smaller rivals.\n\n“She’s justifiably worried about some of the big technology companies and the concentration of power,” Vance said this summer before lauding Khan for not using the agency to advance a woke agenda. \n\nVance’s views are music to the ears of some “little tech” companies and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, especially his former employer billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who helped bankroll the Ohio senator’s political rise\n\nVance repeated calls to break up Google in August when he urged Thiel, co-founder of online-payments system PayPal and data-analytics group Palantir, to “get off the sidelines” and donate to the Trump campaign.\n\nVance, a conservative, also wants antitrust power to crack down on Big Tech censorship. \n\n“Long overdue, but it’s time to break Google up,” Vance tweeted in February, “This matters far more than any other election integrity issue. The monopolistic control of information in our society resides with an explicitly progressive technology company.”\n\nVance has also criticized Section 230, part of a statute he says protects social media companies from lawsuits if they remove third-party posts “for having the wrong political views.”\n\nThat’s where Elon Musk comes in. He lauded Trump’s pick of Vance, promised to commit $45 million to the Trump-supporting America PAC and stumped for the former president for the first time this month in Butler. \n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don’t know what’s going on, if they don’t know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy,” Musk said to tens of thousands in Butler.\n\nThough Musk reinstated Trump’s Twitter account, he has suspended the accounts of journalists and throttled links to media competitors. Khan rebuffed a meeting with Musk as the FTC investigates Twitter’s data practices.\n\nStill, the billionaire’s avowed free-speech absolutism aligns him with the third of conservatives who say their First Amendment rights are “not at all” secure.\n\nIn August, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to Congress the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor COVID content, saying he regretted suppressing The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story, which exposed the president’s son using his father to rake in business deals.\n\nVance notes the vice president is on board with that kind of behavior.\n\n“Kamala Harris is really into censorship because she fundamentally doesn’t believe in the right of Americans to speak their mind and to say what they believe,” he told The Post. “The biggest threat to democracy in 2024 is Kamala Harris’ weird obsession with censorship.”\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is under some pressure to back off Big Tech.\n\nLast week, Harris surrogate and billionaire investor Mark Cuban said she should leave Khan out of a future Democratic administration, just as Biden’s Department of Justice considers breaking up Google’s search-engine monopoly.\n\n“By trying to break up the biggest tech companies, you risk our ability to be the best in artificial intelligence,” Cuban told Semafor.\n\nTwo Democratic billionaire donors previously pushed Harris to sack Khan, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who sits on Microsoft’s board.\n\nKhan’s FTC is investigating Microsoft’s AI deals and $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT bot. The probe is part of the federal government’s strategy to preserve competition in the emerging technology field that could transform American society.\n\nDespite her disfavor with the donor class, Khan still has some supporters.\n\nA number of tech executives backed Khan at a recent “Little Tech for Harris” fundraiser in San Francisco with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as the headliner. \n\nProgressive lawmakers have also come to the antitrust chief’s defense. \n\n“Anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl,” tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) last week. \n\nBut if anyone does come for Khan, she might find a home in the most unlikeliest of places: a Trump-Vance White House.","summary":"BUTLER, Pa. — Democratic billionaires can&#8217;t stand her.

He noted that the former president has received some credit for saying that there’s effectively a cold war with China.\n\nThe Bloomberg editor went on to note that the US won the Cold War with the Soviet Union “because it rallied allies to it” but that Trump is suggesting “slamming allies with 20 percent, 30 percent tariffs.”\n\nMicklethwait asked how it would help the US take on China if it turned its allies against itself.\n\n“China thinks we’re a stupid country, a very stupid country,” Trump said. “They can’t believe that somebody finally got wise to them. Not one president, Bush, Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him? Think of it. Not one president charged China anything.”\n\nTrump has long used Obama’s middle name in an attempt to make him appear un-American.\n\nAmid Obama’s rise, many on the right, including Trump, pushed the baseless “birther” conspiracy theory that he was a Muslim born in Kenya, and thus ineligible to be commander-in-chief.\n\nEarlier in the conversation about tariffs, Trump said: “I was the only president in 82 years that kept you out of a war, except I defeated ISIS, but I inherited that war.” \n\nThe former president explained his veering from subject to subject by returning to the concept of “the weave.”\n\n“You have the weave, as long as you end up in the right location at the end,” he said. “We have never been so close to World War III as we are right now with what's going on in Ukraine and Russia and the Middle East.”\n\n“I had no wars in the whole world ... I talked plenty of countries out of wars ... And I knocked out ISIS in a matter of weeks. It was supposed to take four to five years. I did it in a matter of weeks,” he added. “We actually have a great military but we don't know how to use it.”\n\nObama slammed Trump and some of his supporters as he hit the trail for Vice President Kamala Harris last week. \n\n“I’m sorry, gentlemen, I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think some of Trump’s behavior — the bullying and the putting people down — is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you – That is not what real strength is. It never has been,” Obama said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \n\n“Real strength is about working hard. And carrying a heavy load without complaining. Real strength is about taking responsibility for your actions and telling the truth even when it’s inconvenient,” Obama added. “Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves. That is what we should want for our daughters and our sons, and that is what I want to see in a president of the United States of America.”","summary":"Amid Obama’s rise, many on the right, including Trump, pushed the baseless ‘birther’ conspiracy theory that he was secretly a Muslim born in Kenya","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-barack-hussein-obama-tariffs-b2629831.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/20/SEI225726391.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LpoEPkNp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:04:28","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":259833786,"title":"The Secret of Trump’s Economic Message","text":"When Donald Trump speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child. China gives us billions of dollars via tariffs. American auto workers take imported cars out of a box and stick the pieces together. These are very light paraphrases of statements he made today at the Economic Club of Chicago, in a sometimes combative interview with the Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait.\n\nYet voters consistently say they trust Trump more to handle the economy than they do Kamala Harris. Why? Perhaps because, when Trump speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child. Yes, he has a reputation as a businessman, and voters consistently trust Republicans more on the issue (even though the economy fares better under Democrats). But Trump’s reductionism may be the real source of his appeal when it comes to the economy and other policy areas. (“Build the wall”; “make NATO pay their fair share.”) By restricting his discussion to the bluntest, broadest, and vaguest of terms, he sells an appealing illusion.\n\n“We’re all about growth,” he pronounced at the start of the interview, as though this were a bold, contrarian stance. A moment later, he added, “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.”\n\nPoor Micklethwait was no match for this. The former editor of The Economist put up a valiant effort, but he was bringing facts to a rhetoric fight. Micklethwait asked Trump about the cost of tariffs to the American economy, and Trump responded with a long “sir” story about a supposed friend named John who builds car factories. (“I will not give his last name, because he might not like it.”) Micklethwait asked about how a trade war would affect the 40 million American jobs that rely on trade, and Trump told stories about John Deere and a conversation he had with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. None of these answered the question, and it didn’t matter.\n\n“You keep bringing up these individual examples, but the overall effect is going to be dramatic,” a frustrated Micklethwait said.\n\n“I agree it will have a massive effect, positive,” Trump shot back.\n\nWhen the interviewer asked whether a trade war would endanger relationships with allies, Trump rejected the premise of alliances. “Our allies have taken advantage of us, more so than our enemies,” he said. He praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and all but confirmed reporting by Bob Woodward that the men have remained in touch since he left office (“If I did, it’s a smart thing”), and deemed the poor pariah nation North Korea “a very serious power.”\n\nTrying another tack, Micklethwait warned that a trade war could endanger the use of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, thus weakening American economic power. “If I’m elected, the dollar is so secure,” Trump said. “Your reserve currency is the strongest it’ll ever be.” He gave no explanation for what this could mean or why it might be true. But it sure sounds nice, doesn’t it?\n\nThe impulse to bluff comes from Trump’s many decades of business experience. For Trump the businessman, confidence and bombast have always been more important than facts and reason. This has generally worked out for Trump, who is, after all, a billionaire. But at times, it has been disastrous, as his four corporate bankruptcies demonstrate.\n\nTrump’s record as president is similarly mixed. He imposed some tariffs on China, but a deal he struck to encourage Chinese imports of American goods flopped. His trade war disproportionately disadvantaged his own supporters. He did not deliver on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. His main success was a broad tax cut. During the last year of his term, Trump saw the American economy collapse because of COVID, though he cannot take all of the blame for that.\n\nConsidering the former president’s checkered history, Micklethwait’s desire to probe him on the facts is understandable, but it’s also futile. Trump is selling a fantasy, not a white paper. As he repeatedly danced around the questions today, he joked about his oratorical approach: “I call it the weave. As long as you end up at the right location in the end.” Trump believes that the right location for him is the White House. The weave just might get him there again.","summary":"When he speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child—which might be the source of his appeal.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-economic-message-secret/680264/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/k4ppnWEFO8DD7MgrOncuq3QRfc8=/0x57:2696x1461/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/10/2024_10_15T181949Z_78051342_RC20LAAPC4IZ_RTRMADP_3_USA_ELECTION_TRUMP-1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:03:00","author":"David A.

It was Harris’ 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and Trump’s Monday town hall in suburban Philadelphia came after visits last week to Scranton and Reading.\n\nHarris is highlighting what she says are examples of Trump’s increasingly “unstable and unhinged” behavior. It’s part of her effort to win over a small universe of undecided voters and tear away even a small slice of traditionally Republican voters in the fight for Pennsylvania and six other closely contested states that are expected to determine who wins next month’s election.\n\nShe argued that Trump’s comments in a Fox News “Sunday Morning Futures” interview are the latest example of threatening rhetoric from the former president that should concern Americans about what a potential second Trump term could look like.\n\nTrump made the comment in response to a question about “outside agitators” potentially disrupting Election Day, pivoting to what he said is a foe closer to home.\n\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump said. He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big – and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, defended Trump’s comments during a campaign stop in Minneapolis earlier Monday.\n\n“Is it a justifiable use of those assets if they’re rioting and looting and burning cities down to the ground? Of course it is. Right?” Vance told reporters. “I think the question is, is it a justifiable use of assets, depends on what’s actually happening.”\n\nHarris and Trump have thrown themselves fully into the race for Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016. But Joe Biden, a Scranton native, beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.\n\nBoth sides believe the race for Pennsylvania could be even closer this time.\n\nTrump spoke at a town hall Monday in suburban Oaks. Responding to a man who said his dream of homeownership feels out of reach, Trump said regulations make it too expensive to build in some places. He repeated his pledge to increase U.S. oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs, though domestic production is already at record highs.\n\n“We’re going to drill baby drill, we’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down,” Trump said.\n\nHe also claimed that government data from crime statistics to jobless numbers is “fake,” alleging the numbers are manipulated to help the incumbent Democrats.\n\nTrump cut short his remarks after twice being interrupted by medical emergencies, turning the town hall into a concert instead. After the second incident, Trump spoke for a few more minutes and then called for music. He then stood onstage — at times swaying along — as music played.\n\nHarris’ campaign called Erie a “pivot” area, a Democratic-majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.\n\nHarris also talked up early voting during her rally. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race.\n\n“If you have already received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait,” Harris urged her supporters. “Fill it out and return it today or tomorrow. But please get it out.”\n\nBeforehand, she stopped by a newly opened coffee shop and record store in Erie as she continues to press her case for Black men’s support.\n\nThe visit to LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, came after her campaign unveiled a plan earlier Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances. The campaign is trying to step up outreach to Black men, a key voting bloc that has some Democrats concerned about a possible lack of enthusiasm.\n\nPennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events.\n\nMichigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nDemocrats have won three straight elections for Pennsylvania governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s Legislature is closely divided.\n\nTrump rallygoer Tom Bonanno said he believed there was greater enthusiasm for Trump this year than in the former president’s two previous campaigns.\n\n”I’m feeling a shift because the economy affects everyone,” Bonanno said. “It’s not just going to be on, you’re feeling joy or happiness or whatever they’re running on. It’s about the economy once again.”\n\nLuther Manus, 97, a World War II and Vietnam veteran, walked from Harris’ Monday night rally impressed with the candidate but was circumspect about how much she’ll be able to accomplish in a polarized Washington if she wins.\n\n“I think she’s superb,” Manus said as the arena was emptying out. But he added: “If they give her a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, she’ll be able to do much of what she said. Without that, she’s going to have a problem, just like Obama and Biden.”","summary":"Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been become fixtures in the country's largest 2024 battleground state.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/15/harris-slams-trump-for-suggesting-military-handle-enemy-from-within-as-they-vie-for-pennsylvania/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/10/Election_2024_Harris_30559_a9b740.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:52:01","author":"ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON,Adriana Gomez Licon, Will Weissert And Mark Scolforo,WILL WEISSERT and MARK SCOLFORO - Associated Press","authors":["ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON","Adriana Gomez Licon, Will Weissert And Mark Scolforo","WILL WEISSERT and MARK SCOLFORO - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":259828424,"title":"SAS heroes require protection from legal scrutiny, yet the MoD fails to support them","text":"A NEW book about the Iranian Embassy siege of 1980 makes -compelling reading.\n\nSix terrorists raided the central London building and held 26 staff members captive for nearly a week until the then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, authorized the SAS to intervene.\n\nDuring the operation, there was widespread chaos as smoke and CS gas filled the air, forcing the elite soldiers to quickly distinguish between hostages and terrorists.\n\n“British!” shouted the embassy’s -maintenance man Ron Morris.\n\n“Diplomat,” cried Dr Ali Afrouz, the Iranian charge d’affaires, before pointing out that two others claiming to be -“students” were in fact gunmen.\n\nThe SAS took a cautious approach by restraining everyone facedown on the lawn before sorting out the embassy workers from the terrorists who sought independence for Khuzestan, a region in southern Iran.\n\nHer cheek pressed to the ground, embassy secretary Nooshin -Hash- emenian sobbed: “That was fantastic.

The tit-for-tat strikes and uncertainty about whether Israel might strike strategically important energy and nuclear sites in Iran have raised fears about escalation into an all-out regional war.\n\nIsrael’s offensive against Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza has expanded into a ground invasion of Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy that has been firing into Israel since the conflict in Gaza started a year ago in solidarity with Hamas.\n\nBiden has said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program and urged Israel to consider alternatives to hitting Iran’s oil sector. Such a strike could affect the global oil market and boost pump prices just ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThere is already a deep divide among Democrats over the war, with Vice President Kamala Harris failing to get the usual Democratic endorsement of a political action group of Arab American leaders over the weekend.

Microsoft concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make money.\n\nIn another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from Russia.\n\nFor nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, which has its own ties to hacking groups, teaming up with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues for profit and the promise of government protection.\n\n“We’re seeing in each of these countries this trend towards combining nation-state and cybercriminal activities,” said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust.\n\nSo far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China or Iran are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber “mercenaries” shows how far America's adversaries will go to weaponize the internet.\n\nMicrosoft's report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June 2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations are using hacking, spear phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a target's system. The company says its customers face more than 600 million such incidents every day. \n\nRussia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to gain entry into military and government systems and spreading disinformation designed to undermine support for the war among its allies. \n\nUkraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline.\n\nNetworks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is working to oppose former President Donald Trump.\n\nIran has also hacked into Trump's campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nRussia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue to target Taiwan and other countries in the region.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless and accused the U.S. of spreading its own “disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.\"\n\nIn a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that “our position is consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms.\"\n\nRussia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they're using cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives of those three nations and North Korea were not immediately returned on Monday. \n\nEfforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response.\n\nFederal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures. But investigators at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be replaced.\n\nWithin one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The space, with wood floors and exposed pipes, featured small prints set up on easels. Larger landscape photographs were displayed on the walls.\n\nHarris singled out Lindo, who has starred in films and CBS' “The Good Fight,” saying to the gathered crowd: “Delroy has been supporting me for years and years and years,” and adding that the two were both on the debate team at her alma mater, Howard University.\n\nHarris reminded the group that early voting starts in Michigan in four days. Trump, meanwhile, focused on reaching women. He planned to tape a Fox News Channel town hall featuring an all-female audience and moderated by host Harris Faulkner.\n\nHarris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, unveiled his ticket’s plan to improve the lives of rural Americans. It was yet another sign that in a razor-tight race, each side is trying to cut into the other’s margin of support with different voting blocs while shoring up traditional areas of strength.\n\nHarris, too, will appear at a town hall-style event in Detroit hosted by the morning radio program “The Breakfast Club,\" featuring Charlamagne Tha God, who is especially popular with Black males.\n\nThe push comes a day after she announced a series of new proposals dubbed the “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.” The ideas are meant to offer the demographic more economic advantages, including providing forgivable business loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs and creating more apprenticeships. The plan would also support the study of sickle cell and other diseases more common in Black men.\n\nThe focus on Black men sharpened last week when former President Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and said he wanted to speak “some truths” to Black male voters, suggesting some \" just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nThe vice president’s campaign says it doesn’t believe Black men will flip in large numbers to supporting Trump, especially after strongly backing Democrat Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, in 2020. They are more concerned about a measurable percentage of Black males opting not to vote at all.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, the first Black senator elected from the state of Georgia, issued a stark warning in Atlanta to other Black men that voting for Trump will be “literally dangerous” for them, as the former president heads there for a rally.\n\n“He will be dangerous every time you get in the car and you deal with the issue of driving while Black,” Warnock said.\n\nHe argued that Democrats’ job is to reach Black men who are deciding whether to vote at all. “The issue is folks have got to understand that if you do not vote, it’s a vote for Donald Trump,” Warnock said.\n\nHarris’ campaign has also placed special emphasis on other male voters, including creating “ Hombres con Harris,” or “Men with Harris,” a group that is using celebrities and key elected officials to organize events on her behalf meant to appeal to Hispanic men.\n\nAs she campaigns in Detroit, Harris faces other potential challenges in Michigan, including Arab activists angered by the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. Dearborn, outside Detroit, is the largest Arab-majority city in the U.S.\n\nStill, the vice president's campaign expects to see strong support on Election Day from white, college-educated voters in Michigan at rates that might exceed Biden's in 2020, and she hopes to expand the margin by which Trump lost many of the state's key suburbs four years ago.\n\nShe's also seized on insults Trump made about Detroit last week while campaigning there. He said if Harris wins, “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit.\" He added, \"You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nTrump has maligned cities hosting him before, but Harris said it was proof he was “unfit to be president.” Her campaign also released an ad voiced by actor Courtney B. Vance, a Detroit native, that declares: “What Donald Trump doesn’t understand, or care to learn, is that when he said, ‘Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.’ That he should be so ... lucky.”\n\nTrump is scheduled to return to Detroit later this week for a rally.\n\nThe former president figures to do well with rural voters, but team Harris hopes to at least keep things closer. And while Harris’ support among women is strong, Trump aims to keep her from running up the score.\n\nTrump has seen his support among women, especially in the suburbs of many key swing states, soften since his term in the White House. A September AP-NORC poll found more than half of registered voters who are women have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, while only about one-third have a favorable view of Trump.\n\nTo reverse the trend, Trump has sought to cast himself as being able to personally shield women from various threats, as when he suggested at a rally in Pennsylvania last month that women in America, “will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger.”\n\n“You will be protected, and I will be your protector,\" Trump said then. He's also suggested that, should he win, women will no longer have a reason to think about abortion, after three Supreme Court judges that he appointed helped in 2022 to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed a woman's right to the procedure.\n\nIn Chicago before members of the Economic Club, Trump defended his support for high tariffs as an economic cure-all.\n\n“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff,’” Trump told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, who interviewed him at the event.

The pivot to music happened after the event was briefly halted twice so people in the crowd could be tended to for medical emergencies.\n\nIf you were burning with curiosity for what songs Trump decided to entertain the crowd to wonder no longer – the playlist was just dropped. For a complete list of all the songs Trump played at his town hall, keep reading:\n\nEvery Song at the Town Hall:\n\n“God Bless America”\n\n“Ave Maria”\n\n“Time to Say Goodbye”\n\n“Hallelujah”\n\n“Nothing Compares 2 U”\n\n“An American Trilogy”\n\n“Rich Men North of Richmond”\n\n“November Rain”\n\nArtists included in this odd town hall choice are already calling him out and demanding he strike their music from his events. Rufus Wainwright posted a statement on Instagram condemning the use of his cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.”\n\n“Numerous songs were played. Among the songs was singer songwriter Rufus Wainwright’s version of Leonard Cohen’s seminal ‘Hallelujah.’ Wainwright, who is supporting Kamala Harris, was horrified upon learning of this and today issues this statement,” the musician’s statement began.\n\nIt continued: ““The song ‘Hallelujah’ by Leonard Cohen has become an anthem dedicated to peace, love and acceptance of the truth. I’ve been supremely honored over the years to be connected with this ode to tolerance. Of course, I in no way condone this and was mortified, but the good in me hopes that perhaps in inhabiting and really listening to the lyrics of Cohen’s masterpiece, Donald Trump just might experience a hint of remorse over what he’s caused. I’m not holding my breath.’”\n\nNo word yet from The Village People or “Ave Maria” composer Franz Schubert.","summary":"Trump's town hall playlist just dropped\n\n\nThe post All the Songs That Trump Played While He Stood Quietly for 30 Minutes at His Rally appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-town-hall-all-songs-list/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Donald-Trump-dancing-town-hall-rally.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:36:15","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.334},{"id":259827308,"title":"Donald Trump's Got the Momentum. Can It Hold?","text":"Former President Donald Trump appears to have captured the momentum from Vice President Kamala Harris just three weeks before Election Day.With a polling advantage that Harris received following her September 10 debate performance having all but evaporated, the former president has recently received a string of favorable swing state poll results, although most suggest that the contest remains a dead heat.Averages of polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight show that in recent weeks, Trump has expanded his small lead in Arizona, overtaken Harris in North Carolina and pulled to even in Nevada. The ex-president has also narrowed small leads for Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Craig Agranoff, professor of political marketing at Florida Atlantic University, told Newsweek via text message that \"Trump's momentum in recent polls reflects his ability to tap into core voter concerns like the economy and national security, which tend to dominate in uncertain times.\"Agranoff added, however, that the former president's ability to seize on the opportunity and win on November 5 was anything but certain, with Harris retaining the ability to turn the tables and recapture the momentum.\"Sustaining this momentum until Election Day will require maintaining discipline in his messaging and avoiding controversies that could alienate undecided or moderate voters,\" Agranoff said.\"Harris, on the other hand, still has a pathway to regain ground, but it will depend on a strong, issue-based campaign that focuses on energizing key demographics and presenting a clear contrast to Trump on issues like healthcare and economic equality,\" he added.While Harris has continued to hold an advantage over Trump in national polling since shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on July 21, her lead has slipped slightly despite a recent media blitz.As of Tuesday, the vice president was leading Trump by 2.4 percentage points in the national FiveThirtyEight average, down from a 3.3 point lead on September 18.University of Kentucky political science professor D. Stephen Voss said that polling was \"going to bounce up and down a bit between now and Election Day\" in an email to Newsweek, while warning against drawing too many conclusions from polls.\"The temptation will be to try to attach interpretations to every swing up or down in a candidate's polling, but most of the time, short-term fluctuations in polling are not meaningful,\" Voss said. \"Poll respondents do not make their decisions in exactly the same way voters ultimately do.\"\"Poll respondents are more likely to go with their guts, expressing however they're feeling about the most-recent campaign events or messages, but by the time voters settle on an actual choice, they're usually reaching down deeper into their political leanings,\" he continued.Voss went on to express doubts regarding the Trump campaign's strategy of winning the election with \"very high levels of support from men who have voted for Democrats in the past,\" saying that it \"isn't impossible, but it's a lot to ask from a campaign strategy.\"But there have been some other recent indications that the former president is gaining ground. Trump's odds from online betting platforms, which are based on wagers made on candidates rather than polling data, have improved significantly over the past two weeks.Polymarket, which was funded in part by early Trump backer Peter Thiel, gave the ex-president a 58 percent chance of winning back the White House as of Tuesday afternoon. Harris and Trump were tied on the platform as recently as October 4.","summary":"Trump appears to have seized the momentum from Vice President Kamala Harris three weeks before Election Day.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-got-momentum-can-it-hold-1969565","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495711/donald-trumps-got-momentum-can-it-hold.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:35:46","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":259828098,"title":"RFK Jr. hints at involvement in agriculture and health policy under Trump’s presidency","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is suggesting he will have significant influence on American agriculture policy if Donald Trump is elected president, the latest in a series of roles he has envisioned for himself in a second Trump administration.\n\nKennedy, an anti-vaccine activist and environmentalist who ran for president as an independent before endorsing Trump, on Monday posted a video on social media that he filmed outside the U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters in Washington.\n\n“Corporate interests have hijacked the USDA dietary guidelines to make natural unprocessed foods merely an afterthought. That’s one reason why 70% of the American diet now consists of ultraprocessed food. We’re going to change that,” Kennedy said, before listing off a series of policy ideas that would seem to run counter to much of what Trump’s Agriculture Department did in his first administration.\n\n“When Donald Trump gets me inside the building I’m standing outside of right now, it won’t be this way anymore. American agriculture will come roaring back, and so will American health.”\n\nThe Trump campaign has said in a statement that formal discussions of who would serve in a second Trump administration are “premature.” But the former president himself has said at recent rallies that RFK Jr. is someone who could help his administration if he wins.\n\n“We will make America healthy again. You know who’s going to do that? RFK Jr. He’s got some good ideas,” Trump said at a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe prospect of Kennedy’s influencing a wide array of federal policy has raised alarm bells among advocates of sound science. Public health experts have pointed to Kennedy’s pivotal role in spreading false information and sowing fear around the world about vaccines, as well as conspiracy theories about technology like 5G. While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.\n\nTrump, who is locked in a tight contest for the presidency with Democrat Kamala Harris, embraced Kennedy’s endorsement in August after the scion of the famous Democratic political family suspended his third-party bid. He had built an unusually strong base for an independent candidate, propelled by anti-establishment voters and vaccine skeptics who have followed his anti-vaccine work since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough public polls didn’t provide a clear indication that he is having an outsized impact on support for either major-party candidate, there was some evidence that Kennedy’s staying in the race would hurt Trump more than Harris. In an AP-NORC survey conducted in July, about half of Republicans had a favorable view of Kennedy, compared to about 3 in 10 Democrats and a similar share of independents.\n\nWhen endorsing Trump, Kennedy suggested that Trump had offered him a job if the former president returns to the White House, but neither he nor Trump offered details. Before the endorsement, the Kennedy campaign told the HBO show “Last Week Tonight” in August that the two had discussed “the possibility of a Cabinet position — HHS,” referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, among other agencies.\n\nKennedy has made a series of videos this month in which he says that he plans to exercise his influence over a wide range of policies if Trump wins.\n\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department — which Kennedy posted about Monday, the day of his mother, Ethel Kennedy’s, funeral — is the primary agency in charge of support for farmers, animal and plant health and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs. It oversees federal nutrition programs that provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children and school lunches.\n\nKennedy’s background as an environmental lawyer isn’t likely to be broadly popular in agriculture, however. He has challenged the widespread use of herbicides like Roundup and the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry because they are the most efficient way to raise crops and animals. Bayer, which makes the Roundup weedkiller, has been hit with tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging it causes cancer, an accusation the company denies.\n\n“If I were Trump, I’d try to get him to shut up as quick as possible. You really think RFK would sell very well in farm country?” said John Hansen, the longtime president of the Nebraska Farmers Union.\n\nMany of the policies pursued by Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary during Trump’s first term, favored the massive farms and livestock operations that Kennedy rails against.\n\nOn Oct. 1, Kennedy posted a video filmed in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, where he said he planned to work on issues of health and the environment. Four days later, he posted that he was partnering with Trump “to transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine.”\n\n“Our big priority will be to clean up the public health agencies like CDC, NIH, FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Those agencies have become sock puppets for the industries that they’re supposed to regulate,” Kennedy said.\n\nLast week, he targeted the Food and Drug Administration in a video filmed outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“I want to get on the inside of FDA to make America healthy again,” he said, ending the video with the line: “Get Donald Trump in the White House in November, and me over at FDA.”\n\nA Kennedy spokesperson did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nBrian Hughes, senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said it was too early to say who would serve in a Trump administration, but that a Trump-Vance transition leadership group was preparing for “what comes after the election.”\n\nMike Haag, a Trump supporter who farms about 2,000 acres and raises about 6,000 pigs a year near the small town of Emington, Illinois, said he doesn’t think Kennedy would be a good pick for the Agriculture Department, but he’s not going to worry about it too much at this stage.\n\n“I can’t imagine it would be good, but until Trump actually says he’s going to do that, I probably wouldn’t actually let it hold much water either,” Haag said.\n\nKennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

The agency regularly sends staff to counties around the U.S. to monitor compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act and other civil rights statutes related to elections and voting.\n\n“Voters in Portage County have raised concerns about intimidation resulting from the surveillance and the collection of personal information regarding voters, as well as threats concerning the electoral process,” the Justice Department said in a news release. \n\nThe agency did not elaborate.\n\nPortage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski, a Republican running for reelection, came under fire for a social media post last month in which he said people with Kamala Harris yard signs should have their addresses written down so that immigrants can be sent to live with them if the Democrat wins the presidency.

The Trump campaign has spent more than $19 million on two television ads that have aired nearly 55,000 times since Oct. 1, according to data from AdImpact. Make America Great Again Inc., the leading super political action committee supporting Trump, has spent more than $1.1 million during the same time period on a similar ad that has aired more than 6,000 times. The campaign's ads are playing in all battleground states and airing during NFL and college football games, a Trump campaign official said. The ads focus on taxpayer-funded gender transitions for people in prison and immigrant detainees. They use Vice President Kamala Harris' comments from 2019 in which she said she supported transgender inmates having access to gender-affirming surgery. She made similar comments in an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire in 2019, saying she supported \"medically necessary care\" for federal inmates and detained migrants. \"Kamala is for they/them,\" one ad says. \"Trump is for you.\" The answer in the questionnaire \"is not what she's proposing, it's not what she's running on,\" Harris' communications director, Michael Tyler, told Fox News in September. Only 38% of voters said transgender rights are extremely or very important to their vote choice in November, according to a recent Gallup poll. A 2023 poll from Gallup showed a growing majority of Americans believed transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that matched their gender at birth. Only 26% believed transgender athletes should be able to play on teams that match their gender identity. Voters have said their top concerns are issues like the economy, abortion and immigration. The Trump campaign is betting that with time dwindling until Nov. 5, the issue of transgender rights will sway voters more than the economy or immigration. \"It's the last thing on Earth they want to talk about,\" co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita told NBC News. \"So we'll talk about it for them.\" Trump has underscored that on the campaign trail, often repeating a line about \"keeping men out of women's sports\" â it often gets the most applause at his rallies. Trump is not the only candidate using the issue to criticize his Democratic rival. The debate over transgender girls in sports and locker rooms is featured in Republican ads in key Senate races.Cameron Shelton, a political economy professor at Claremont McKenna College, said political ads typically don't persuade voters but rather confirm preexisting feelings that could fuel turnout.\"[Republicans] are trying to find an issue on which the majority is on their side,\" said Shelton, who has researched the impacts of campaign ads in previous election cycles. \"What they're trying to say is, 'Hey, look, forget about these other things that we disagree on. If I can remind you that you agree with me on transgender rightsâ¦' Then maybe that'll spill over.\" In a memo earlier this month, the Human Rights Campaign highlighted the lack of success that anti-transgender ads had in previous elections, including in Senate and gubernatorial races and on ballot measures. \"Anti-trans attacks don't work,\" Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Brandon Wolf said. \"Time and time again this kind of fear mongering has been a political loser, and the American people will see through it again in November.\"","summary":"The campaign has spent more than $19 million on the ads in battleground states this month.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-anti-trans-ads-spending/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/15/5fbd5bc2-9f89-41d3-b1fa-fab8da18dc50/thumbnail/1200x630/decad3d2a07f84724e8eefb80d4fb157/gettyimages-2178578510.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42effd073","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3267260_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:28:34","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.069},{"id":259827302,"title":"Trump Media's stock is halted after sudden plunge in DJT shares","text":"Trump Media & Technology Group, whose stock trades under the ticker DJT — the same as former President Donald Trump's initials — was briefly halted on Wall Street Tuesday after the stock suddenly plunged. The pause occurred at 2:42 p.m. Eastern Time, with trading resuming about five minutes later, according to the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was temporarily suspended after a mechanism was triggered when stocks exhibit unusual volatility. DJT shares had climbed earlier on Tuesday, reaching an intraday high of $33.85 a share, representing a 13% gain. But the stock plummeted in the afternoon, triggering the halt. Trump Media's stock price continued to sink after the pause was lifted closed at $27.06, down $2.89, or 9.6%, on the day.The downdraft erases some of the recent gains that had helped lift Trump Media from a September 24 low. The shares have been seen as a proxy for Trump's chances of winning the November 5 presidential election, with DJT swinging upwards when his odds appear to improve. In recent days, two prediction markets have switched to favoring Trump after previously giving Vice President Kamala Harris a better chance of winning.While the polls haven't changed much, one of Trump's business ventures got off to a rough start on Tuesday, according to CNBC. The Trump family's new cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, suffered outages for much of the day, limiting the number of sales, the media outlet report.It's unclear if that could cause DJT's stock to falter, given that Trump Media's shareholders largely consist of small investors who are also Trump supporters, rather than investors who are seeking profits, dividends or other traditional measures of financial health.The volume of trading in DJT stock was also elevated on Tuesday, with about 97 million shares trading hands, according to financial data firm FactSet. The average daily trading volume for the prior 30 days has been about 20 million shares, FactSet shows. On Tuesday, Trump Media investors took to Truth Social to question the stock's halt and price decline, with some blaming short sellers, a frequent target of both DJT shareholders and its management. \"None of us long-term DJT holders are fooled one bit by what happened today,\" one member of the DJT investing group wrote Tuesday on Truth Social. \"Shorts were losing control, quickly and they called in their chips at the SEC\" to halt trading.The Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't control trading halts, which are activated by stock exchanges.Earlier this year, Trump Media complained to Nasdaq, the stock exchange where the company is listed, that it was the victim of \"potential market manipulation\" due to short-selling activity.","summary":"Trading in Trump Media, owner of Truth Social, was halted briefly on Tuesday after the stock suddenly plunged.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/djt-stock-trump-media-nyse-halt-plunge/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/11/81de80b8-650b-4a00-983f-f32f7b989cbf/thumbnail/1200x630/d62b7105c6dcf6cf8f73c69c073b08d9/gettyimages-2177081722.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42effd073","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:26:07","author":"Aimee Picchi","authors":["Aimee Picchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.286}]}
