His remarks, as well as support for tariffs on Canadian imports, have strained relations with Washington's neighbor to the north.What to KnowMay, who leads the Canadian Green Party, suggested at a press conference in January that those three states could become Canadian provinces, rather than Canada becoming part of the U.S. She said the three states, all of which are viewed as safely Democratic, would receive universal health care and stricter gun laws.\"Hey, Donald, have we got a deal for you? You think we want to be the 51st state huh? But maybe California would like to be the 11th province. How about it? California? Oregon? Washington?\" she said.Although such a change would be highly unlikely to actually happen, the proposal would have the support of 35 percent of Canadians, according to a new poll from YouGov, which surveyed 1,030 Canadian adults from January 22 to January 28 but was published on Friday.Residents of British Columbia, the province located directly north of Washington, were more likely than not to support the proposal—43 percent said they'd support letting the three states join, compared to 41 percent who opposed the idea.Quebec residents were the least likely to support the proposal, with only 25 percent backing it.Americans, including residents of those states, were less likely to back the proposal. Twenty-three percent of Americans said they'd support those three states joining Canada, compared to 29 percent of people who live in the three states.Among Americans, the idea wasn't polarized on partisan lines. Twenty-seven percent of those who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris supported it, while 26 percent of Trump voters said they'd support those three states joining Canada.What People Are SayingCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during a press conference on Wednesday: \"Let's be very clear. Conversations around the 51st state are a nonstarter. It's never going to happen. But we have to take seriously what the president is saying and fold that into our thinking as we continue to stand up for Canada.\"Trump, during a press conference on Thursday: \"Canada, their taxes would come down greatly. Their security would go up greatly. Amazing things happened to Canada. Why would we pay $200 billion a year in subsidies to Canada when they're not a state? You do that for a state, but you don't do that for somebody else's country.\"What Happens NextWhile most experts cast doubt that borders will change between the countries either way during the foreseeable future, relations between the two countries are likely to remain chilled amid tariff threats.Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel last weekend, though the 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian imports went on a 30-day pause starting February 3.","summary":"Americans were less supportive of the three states joining Canada, according to the YouGov poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/canadian-accepting-three-states-poll-2031663","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589157/35-percent-canadians-support-3-states-joining.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:44:19","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":290660938,"title":"Sheryl Crow Waves Goodbye to Her Tesla, Pledges Money to NPR","text":"Sheryl Crow has had enough of Elon Musk. The singer shared a new Instagram post on Friday waving goodbye to her Tesla, confirming that she sold her car following Musk and President Donald Trump‘s efforts to gut government programs through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with,” Crow wrote in her post, accompanied by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman’s “Time to Say Goodbye.” She added, “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with.

Photo of 'No Tip' Option Resurfaces","text":"Restaurants across the United States frequently add automatic gratuities to bills, particularly for large parties. While some diners appreciate the convenience, others question whether they are legally required to pay these charges. The practice of tipping is deeply ingrained in American dining culture, but its application varies significantly from other parts of the world, where service charges often replace tips entirely.This topic recently gained attention due to a viral Reddit post featuring a photo of a sticker placed over the \"no tip\" option on a digital payment terminal. Using TinEye, a reverse image search, Newsweek traced the image back to May 2024. Even so, the viral post hints at some customers' feelings of frustration that tipping has gotten out of control.Why It MattersTipping is a controversial issue in the U.S., with some customers feeling pressured to pay mandatory service charges while others argue that tipping should remain voluntary. With inflation and \"tipping fatigue\" becoming more prevalent, consumers are increasingly scrutinizing the practice of automatic gratuity.While some believe tipping should be purely voluntary, many service industry workers depend on gratuities as their primary source of income. The debate over tipping resurfaced during the 2024 election campaign when both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris promised \"no taxes on tips,\" bringing renewed attention to the role of gratuity in workers' livelihoods.What To KnowThere is no federal law requiring customers to tip, but automatic service charges added by a restaurant are legally enforceable in many states.\"No, they can't force you to tip if you make it optional,\" Bruce McAdams told Newsweek. McAdams is an associate professor for the School of Hospitality, Food and Tourism Management at the University of Guelph.\"But if you state there is a service charge and add it to the bill, it is legal and the customer is required to pay. Adding a 'service charge' has been common in the industry since the early 2000s for larger parties, usually six or more.\"Service charges are not classified as tips but rather as revenue for the restaurant, meaning the business is not necessarily obligated to pass them on to employees, according to Reader's Digest.The IRS defines a tip as a voluntary payment that the customer decides to give and determine its amount. A mandatory service charge does not meet these criteria and is instead considered a wage that can be taxed accordingly, according to Salon.Automatic gratuity is typically applied to large parties, often six or more guests, as McAdams said, and is usually around 18 percent to 20 percent of the bill. Restaurants must disclose these charges clearly to customers, either on the menu or verbally before the meal is ordered.What People Are SayingMcAdams also told Newsweek: \"In Canada and the USA there is currently no legislation about what companies can ask for tips, and for how much. Additionally, there is no law about placing an automatic 'service charge' on a bill. With an increase in more businesses (non-traditional) asking for tips, and with digital payment machines being set higher, there is a growing sense of fatigue from consumers in regards to tipping. We are now seeing the majority of consumers in Canada wanting to move away from tipping.\"Ryan McCall, principal attorney with McCall Sweeney & Silva, told Newsweek: \"Mandatory tipping is a relative gray area from the standpoint of the federal government. Barring individual state laws saying otherwise, restaurants are well within their power to charge automatic gratuities (which from a consumer perspective is often treated as a tip) for large parties or even solo diners, and this is somewhat common in the United States. With that being said, most states have guidelines that require restaurants to disclose mandatory gratuities as well as service charges prior to someone dining at their establishment.\"Ben Farrow, LegalShield Provider attorney, told Newsweek: \"While it might seem like they are \"forcing\" a tip, the legality is a bit nuanced. There's no law requiring customers to leave a tip. A true tip is defined by the IRS as something optional and determined solely by the customer. What restaurants often do is add a mandatory service charge, sometimes called a \"gratuity,\" to the bill. This is perfectly legal. It's not technically a \"mandatory tip\" because it's not considered a tip at all; it's considered revenue for the restaurant.\"What's NextThe debate over tipping and service charges is likely to continue as more businesses experiment with alternative models, such as increasing base wages and eliminating tips altogether. Some restaurants have tested \"service-included\" pricing, where gratuity is factored into menu prices, but this model has not gained widespread acceptance.","summary":"While legal experts agree that restaurants cannot \"force tips,\" customers may still see automatic gratuity on their bill.

Vice President JD Vance will meet with Zelenskyy later on for talks about how to negotiate a settlement to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Court order pauses any mass layoffs and data deletion at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n\nThe Trump administration agreed to halt any plans for mass layoffs, deletion of data or removal of funding from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe agreement was ordered by a judge after the employees’ union filed a lawsuit to prevent the agency’s dismantling. Their lawyers argued Friday that fast action was needed to prevent large-scale firings and deletion of its data.\n\nThe order will stay in place at least until March 3, when U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will hear arguments in the case.\n\nThe administration has already ordered the CFPB to stop nearly all its work and closed its building.\n\nThe agency was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal.\n\n ‘None of this has been done thoughtfully or carefully’ \n\nNicholas Detter had been working in Kansas as a natural resource specialist, helping farmers reduce soil and water erosion, until he was fired by email late Thursday night.\n\nThat’s despite Detter, who had been employed by the Agriculture Department’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, agreeing to the administration’s deferred resignation program, under which he was supposed to be paid until Sept. 30 if he agreed to quit.\n\nDetter responded to the letter accepting the deferred resignation, according to documents shared with The Associated Press. While his response was acknowledged, he never received the official agreement.\n\nHe said when the Trump administration first announced the deferred resignation program, he understood that it was part of an effort to improve the efficiency of the federal government, but he said “that’s not what this has been.”\n\n“None of this has been done thoughtfully or carefully,” he said\n\nDetter said laying off workers like him will create backlogs in the program that was created in the wake of the 1930s Dust Bowl to try keep America’s farmland healthy and productive.\n\n ‘In order to help veterans, you just fired a veteran’ \n\nAmong those impacted by the federal layoffs is Andrew Lennox, a 10-year Marine veteran who was working as a probationary employee at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nHe received an email Thursday evening “out of the blue” informing him that he was being terminated.\n\n“In order to help veterans, you just fired a veteran,” said Lennox, 35, a former USMC infantryman who was deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nLennox had been working as an administrative officer at the VA since mid-December and said he “would love nothing more” than to continue the work.\n\n“This is my family, and I would like to do this forever,” he said.\n\nIn a post on its website, the VA announced the dismissal of more than 1,000 employees, saying the personnel moves “will save the department more than $98 million per year” and be better equipped to help vets.\n\n“I was like: ‘What about this one,’” Lennox said.\n\n Anger, chaos and confusion take hold as federal workers face mass layoffs \n\nFederal workers were responding with anger and confusion Friday as they grappled with the Trump administration’s latest effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce by ordering agencies to lay off probationary employees who have yet to qualify for civil service protections.\n\nAs layoff notices began to go out agency by agency this week, federal employees from Michigan to Florida were left reeling from being told that their services were no longer needed.\n\nMany of those impacted say they had already accepted the administration’s deferred resignation offer, under which they were supposed to be paid until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. That left some wondering how many others who signed will nonetheless be fired.\n\nThe White House and Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government, declined to say Friday how many probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, have so far been dismissed.\n\n▶ Read more about the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the government workforce\n\n Victoria Canal to perform as scheduled at Kennedy Center after others canceled \n\nSinger-songwriter Victoria Canal has decided to perform as scheduled at the Kennedy Center on Saturday, but she will donate all of her proceeds to Trans Equality Now.\n\nSince Trump fired the board of directors and was elected board chair of the center, numerous officials and performers have quit or canceled appearances, including the actor Issa Rae.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday through her manager, Canal noted she had been recognized at the Kennedy Center during the Obama administration as a Presidential Scholar in the Arts, a “memory I still cherish.”\n\n“After learning about the changes in leadership at the Kennedy Center, including Trump becoming self-appointed Chairman, I was debating whether or not to perform,” she said.\n\n“I am a proud queer, Latina, disabled woman and ally to the unprotected and vulnerable trans community in the United States,” she added. “I figured if the new guys want to eliminate DEI, I’ll let them decide to cancel the show if they want to — otherwise, see you February 15th.”\n\n North Carolin a State University freezes hiring over ‘uncertain’ federal budget \n\nNCSU is the state’s largest public university by population, with more than 38,400 students as of Fall 2024.\n\n“Given the uncertain impacts of the presidential administration’s Executive Orders and guidance, the potential shut down of the federal government on March 14, and financial challenges that the state government is dealing with, leadership is becoming increasingly concerned with our budgets over the next year or two,” Warwick Arden, the university’s executive vice chancellor, said in a memo to the university’s college deans and vice provosts.\n\nStudent workers, including graduate student appointments, and part-time employees are not a part of the hiring freeze, Arden said.\n\n“I also encourage you to be conservative in the use of all your funds given the challenging financial climate we currently find ourselves in,” Arden added.\n\n Trump and Musk will jointly appear with Sean Hannity \n\nThe president and the billionaire will sit with the Fox News host next week, the network announced on Friday.\n\nIt’s their first televised sit-down together and comes as Musk leads Trump’s effort to slash the size and scope of the government, with efforts to freeze spending and fire federal workers proceeding in earnest.\n\n New VA secretary plans 1,000-plus layoffs, promises no harm to veteran care or benefits \n\nTop Republicans say they trust Doug Collins.

And it isn’t clear what money is at risk.\n\nCandidate Trump often said he would “not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate,” but this order applies only to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAll states require schoolchildren to be vaccinated against certain diseases including measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.

I know that they didn’t feel that it was much of a case,” Trump said.\n\n“It looked to me to be very political,” he added, and questioned why the prosecutors didn’t complain weeks earlier, though the prosecutors began raising objections this week when instructed to drop the case.\n\n▶ Read more on Trump and the mayor’s corruption case\n\n Another prosecutor resigns with Justice Department in turmoil over NYC mayor’s case \n\nProsecutor Hagan Scotten is at least the seventh to resign rather than follow Trump administration orders in the corruption case.\n\nScotten told acting deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday it would take a “fool” or a “coward” to meet his demand to drop the charges.\n\nBove told prosecutors that Mayor Eric Adams is needed to support the administration’s immigration enforcement and that the charges could be reinstated after this year’s mayoral election.\n\nA Special Forces troop commander in Iraq who graduated at the top of his Harvard Law class and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, Scotton wrote Bove: “No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.”\n\n▶ Read more from Scotten’s letter\n\n The art of the deal?

Others see DOGE stoking outrage without targeting the biggest spending: defense spending and programs with bipartisan support like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe DOGE website claims at least $5.6 billion in savings so far — a tiny fraction of Musk’s initial goal of $2 trillion.\n\n“This thing has paid for itself many times over now,” said Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Relief.\n\nBut Manhattan Institute senior fellow Jessica Riedl said: “So far, DOGE seems more about looking for symbolic culture war savings than truly reducing the budget deficit in any meaningful way.”\n\n▶ Read more about how budget hawks view DOGE’s progress\n\n New Ag secretary promises layoffs at her agency \n\n“Clearly it’s a new day,” new Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters outside the White House.\n\nShe said Trump’s winning back the presidency shows the American people “believe that government was too big.”\n\nRollins said Elon Musk’s government efficiency team was working at her agency and that it had already canceled some contracts and nearly 1,000 employee trainings related to diversity, equality and inclusion.\n\nRollins also said she’d welcome input from the Department of Government Efficiency on the nation’s food stamp program.\n\n Trump’s government layoffs could affect economic numbers \n\nTrump’s mass layoffs of federal workers and spending freezes could come back to bite him in the economic data.\n\nThe monthly jobs reports could start to show a slowdown in hiring, if not go negative at some point after the February numbers are released. The last time the economy lost jobs during a month was in December 2020, when the United States was still muscling its way out of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Overall, it doesn’t seem that DOGE has managed to actually cut spending substantively yet — instead they’ve just created chaos,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. She noted that employers that rely on government grants and contracts would also show declines in hiring, if not worse.\n\n“Given everything that is happening in the federal government, it is very plausible that job growth could turn negative at some point,” Gimbel said. “But it may take a few more reports for the impact to show up.”\n\n Trump’s new tariffs are being felt on Broadway \n\nThe Golden Theatre marquee for the new musical “Operation Mincemeat” is dark because special light bulbs ordered to spell out the show’s title are stuck in China, said Rick Miramontez, president of DKC/O&M and a spokesman for the show.\n\nThousands of the ceramic yellow LED bulbs by Satco were meant to arrive in early February, in time to install them for Saturday’s first preview. Now the show on the Great White Way, named after Broadway’s famous theater lights, will have to welcome theatergoers with a blank space.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Trump announced a 10% tariff on imports from China, which led the country to quickly implement retaliatory tariffs on select American imports.\n\nThe bulbs have apparently been caught in the contest. The ad agency in charge of the marquee was told March would be the earliest they’d arrive.\n\n Ukraine wants ‘security guarantees’ as Trump seeks to end Ukraine-Russia war, Zelenskyy says \n\nZelenskyy made his remarks Friday during a meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The two met at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nMany observers, particularly in Europe, are hoping Vance will shed at least some light on U.S. President Donald Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.\n\n European ministers hit back against Vance’s complaints about the state of their democracies \n\nGerman defense minister Boris Pistorius said U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s comparison of Europe to “ugly Soviet-era” authoritarianism was unacceptable.\n\nVance lectured European governments about free speech nine days before Germany’s election, accusing them of hostility to the idea that “somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election.”\n\nPistorius countered that Germany’s right-wing AfD party can campaign completely normally, and “democracy doesn’t mean that the loud minority is automatically right.”\n\n“Democracy must be able to defend itself against the extremists who want to destroy it,” Pistorius said.\n\n▶ Read more on European reaction to Vance’s lecture on democracy\n\n Democrats tell White House that firing USAID’s top watchdog was illegal \n\nTwo senior Senate Democrats are asking President Donald Trump to reinstate the top watchdog for the U.S. Agency for International Development, calling his firing illegal.\n\nSens. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the foreign affairs committee, and Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the homeland security committee, wrote Trump saying the firing of Inspector General Paul Martin without justification appeared to be an act of retaliation.\n\nMartin’s office had released a report the day before warning that dismantling USAID had all but eliminated proper oversight for billions of dollars in unspent humanitarian funds.\n\nShaheen and Peters say the law requires 30 days notice to Congress and a reason.\n\n Study: Excluding people in the US illegally from Census results wouldn’t impact party power \n\nRepublicans are trying again to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from the numbers used to portion out congressional seats among the states. But a new study suggests their inclusion has had little impact on presidential elections or control of Congress.\n\nIf residents lacking permanent legal status had been excluded from the apportionment process from 1980 to 2020, no more than two House seats and three Electoral College votes would have shifted between Democrats and Republicans, according to demographers from the University of Minnesota and the Center for Migration Studies of New York.\n\n“This would have had no bearing on party control of the House or the outcome of presidential elections,” they wrote.\n\n▶ Read more about the GOP push to change how Census numbers determine state representation\n\n Viktor Orbán predicts Trump will bring Russia back into Western fold after end of Ukraine war \n\nHungary’s nationalist prime minister said Trump’s administration will reconnect Russia with Europe’s economies and energy networks if the war in Ukraine ends.\n\n“The United States has initiated a change that puts the whole Western world’s system of arguments, value system, and way of thinking on a new track,” Orbán said on Hungary’s state radio. “This process is progressing much faster than many people thought.

'And if progressives don't organize their media, their think tanks, and all that, it's going to continue to happen. It's chaos.'\n\nIn response, Psaki argued that 'there is not a left ecosystem that matches the right ecosystem' as she brought up Von's appearance on The Joe Rogan Show, claiming that those on the right promote what each other and elected officials do.\n\nAfter Stewart disagreed, claiming that both comedians are 'promoting an ideological worldview' and aren't 'part of any machine', the 46-year-old political analyst doubled down. \n\n'No, I would consider them in more probably libertarian comedic complex, you know,' Stewart responded while chuckling. \n\n'If you watch or listen to their shows, a lot of times it's just pure goofing off.'\n\nPsaki then admitted to placing the comedy-pair loosely in the right-wing category. However, she still said that the duo are supportive of the Trump administration. \n\n'I think they are supportive, but they are not relentless in the Trump enterprise,' Stewart argued. 'They are not Charlie Kirk. They are not Ben Shapiro. They are very different animals.'\n\n'They are not invested in,' he added. 'But on balance, that's not what their shows are about.'\n\nRogan has recently been halted back into the spotlight for his politics after he endorsed President Donald Trump last minute.\n\nEarlier this week, the 57-year-old podcaster claimed that former President Joe Biden diverted Americans from noticing 'inappropriate spending,' and that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is cracking down.\n\nSince Donald Trump returned to the White House on January 20, Elon Musk, who he appointed as the head of DOGE, has been uncovering and dismantling projects that have been funded by billions of US taxpayers' dollars.\n\nRogan's comments came after he sat down with comedian Bridget Phetasy on Monday. During the episode, the pair discussed the 'beach balls' Biden 'tossed around' during his time in office.\n\n'It's not just the money being spent, it's what it's being spent for and what's going on, which is an enormous propaganda machine,' Rogan said. \n\n'This is why Trump won the election. People don't really believe in these things. The amount of people that think that transgender biological males should be competing against your daughter in sports is so f**king small, but yet, our own government was propping it up. \n\n'And why are they propping it up? Because it's a f**king beach ball at a concert, you keep tossing it up in the air and everybody gets distracted,' he explained, referring to social issues like gay marriage, abortion and transgender rights.\n\n'As long as you can keep a few things going. Here's the things you ought to keep going: Abortion, right? Overturning Roe V. Wade is so good for business because now it's like a battle, the battle grounds, and women's rights and their lives are at stake.\n\n'Gay marriage - that's a huge one. They're gonna take away gay marriage, oh my God, bounce that f**king beach ball,' Rogan continued as he raised his hands above his head, simulating a ball being thrown in the air.\n\nRogan also discussed with the comedian that for the past 'eight to 10 years,' the 'left-wing narrative' has been filled with 'propaganda funded by our own government.' \n\n'That's right!' Phetsay said as she laughed.\n\nHe went on to give an example of Biden 'tossing around beach balls every now and again,' in an effort to distract Americans while his administration was 'siphoning billions of dollars.'\n\n'Zelenskyy just said he's missing $100 billion out of the $177 billion that we supposedly sent there [Ukraine],' he said. \n\nVon, who has been a frequent guest on Rogan's podcast, has also become more outwardly political during the 2024 election.\n\nTrump was also a guest on the 44-year-old comedian's podcast ahead of the election, where the pair spoke about addiction battles with substances such as drugs and alcohol.\n\nVon was also seen at the inauguration at the US Capitol last month where he was seated next to 29-year-old Logan Paul.\n\nPaul captured and shared the moment when Von fell backward and broke his chair during the ceremony.\n\nIn the clip Paul shared to X, which was titled MAKE CHAIRS GREAT AGAIN - the Covington, Louisiana-born entertainer's chair buckled out from under him, as Trump could be heard in the background speaking.\n\nPeople nearby asked Von if he was OK after the startling incident, as Paul said he predicted someone's chair would fail earlier.\n\nOne person nearby wisecracked that Von had been sitting in 'one of Kamala's chairs,' in reference to ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, who opposed Trump in the presidential election.\n\nVon, who didn't appear to be injured in the incident, sat back down in a chair alongside Logan Paul and his sibling, Jake Paul.\n\nVon acknowledged the accident on X on Monday, writing in response to Paul's clip, 'Thought we were past the pranks boys.'\n\nSaid Von: 'Got a chance to go to the presidential inauguration today and i just cant believe i got to be at that.\n\n'Some countries don't even let you vote.'\n\nVon said he 'just felt really lucky to see that.'\n\nRogan has since objected the idea that comedians are being lumped into the 'right ecosystem' - claiming that both he and Von's shows rarely touch on politics, Mediaite reported. \n\nThe star podcaster claimed that their episodes are amplified - overall feeding into the public perception that several entertainers are much more political than they actually are.","summary":"Comedian Jon Stewart objected to former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki's remarks that both Joe Rogan and Theo Von are part of the right-wing 'ecosystem' feeding the 'Trump enterprise.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14399223/Jon-Stewart-slaps-Jen-Psaki-claiming-Joe-Rogan-Theo-Von-Trump-enterprise.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/21/95230993-0-image-a-43_1739568549711.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/08/7331384654208188952/1024x576_MP4_7331384654208188952.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-14 22:08:08","author":"Editor,Kelly Garino","authors":["Editor","Kelly Garino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":290639654,"title":"Trump Official Hints at Potential Governor's Run if Harris Throws Hat In","text":"Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump's envoy for special missions, \"wouldn't say no\" to running for California governor if former Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race, Politico reported on Friday.Newsweek reached out to Grenell at the Kennedy Center and Harris' office via online form.Why It MattersHarris previously served as California's attorney general and in the U.S. Senate.

Then-Republican nominee Donald Trump sat down with Rogan 10 days before the election he went on to win.The comedian and podcaster endorsed Trump the day before the election but had previously spoken favorably of Senator Bernie Sanders and criticized Trump in the past.What To Know Rogan hosts the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has around 11 million listeners. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Rogan extended invites to both the Democratic and Republican candidates to sit down on his show. An interview with Harris never materialized, while Trump's was released just under two weeks ahead of the election.A recently published excerpt from Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes details a failed negotiation between Rogan's team and Harris' campaign, alleging obstacles set by Rogan's camp ultimately derailed the interview.According to the book, Harris' campaign had initially sought to have her appear on the podcast in an effort to reach young male voters, a demographic where she was struggling. The negotiations, which began in October 2024, became a logistical struggle between Harris' campaign and Rogan's team.Rogan has denied some claims made in the book, stating that his team never lied about a scheduling conflict, Harris' team never sent a staffer to scout his Austin studio, and that her team never fully committed to the interview.On a Thursday episode of his show, he told guest Adam Curry that Harris' team \"just lie. They cover their a**, and they lie. I would have been very happy to have her on, and like I said, the goal was to release both the same day,\" in reference to his desire to publish episodes from both Harris and Trump on the same day.The host added that Harris' team \"got scared\" and that, he \"would have held her hand, we would have had a conversation.

The poll comes amid speculation that she is gearing up to make a bid in her home state’s gubernatorial race after losing to President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. \n\nThe poll found that a majority of Democratic Primary voters, 57%, would support Harris if she ran for governor of California. Another 9% said they would support former Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and another 17% are undecided, according to the poll. \n\nThe poll also found that without Harris in the race, there is no clear frontrunner.

Without Harris in the race, the primary is wide open. Former Rep. Porter leads the pack, performing well among voters with college degrees (26%) or postgraduate degrees (25%),” he added.\n\nHarris has been mulling over whether to toss her hat in the ring for the governor’s race.

Trump has a 37% job approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating. \n\nThe poll also pressed California voters on whether Trump’s order to open the dams in Central California was a good thing. Trump’s order to open the dams came in the wake of the deadly wildfires that ravaged Southern California last month, but many critics said that his order ended up wasting billions of gallons of water in the state.\n\nThe poll found 52% said opening the dams was a bad thing while 48% said it was a good thing.\n\nThe poll was conducted Feb. 10-11 among 1,000 registered voters in the state.

Not that I need to hold, you know, the vice president’s hand,” Rogan said on his podcast this week, four months after the scrapped interview.\n\nHe accused the Harris campaign of lying to conceal that they “got scared” of appearing on the podcast, in comments highlighted by Mediaite. \n\nThe podcaster spoke to President Donald Trump not long before the election and talked openly about discussions with Harris’s team going awry. \n\nRogan said he wanted to release the Trump and Harris interviews on the same day but that he was unable to come to terms with the Harris campaign when it came to issues such as scheduling or how long they would speak for. \n\nThis comes as a new book citing Harris officials outlines allegations that Rogan sabotaged his interview with Harris to favor Trump, who appeared for three hours on Rogan’s podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on October 26. \n\nAn excerpt from FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes outlines the decision by the Harris campaign to hold a rally in Houston in late October: \n\n“Only a few people knew the real reason: the whole Houston rally was built to put her in proximity to Rogan. The ongoing negotiations on that were touch-and-go,” Allen and Parnes write. \n\nHarris deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty called Rogan’s team on October 18, before the rally was scheduled. \n\n“We could do Friday, the 25th,” said Flaherty, according to the book.\n\n“Wish we had known about this sooner because he has the 25th blocked out as a personal day,” one of Rogan’s people replied. \n\n“What about Saturday morning?” Flaherty responded.\n\n“Only if it’s before 8:30 a.m.,” Rogan’s team member said. \n\n“The tone is different, Flaherty thought. The vice president of the United States is offering to come to your f***ing show, and you keep putting up more hoops. Harris’s team still wanted to make it work, but a new wariness set in,” Allen and Parnes write. “On October 22, the same day the Harris camp announced the rally, the Associated Press reported that Trump would be Rogan’s guest on Friday — the ‘personal day’ Rogan had originally reserved.”\n\n“Mutual friends Elon Musk and Dana White had convinced Trump and Rogan to bury their dispute, according to a Trump aide. There would be no Harris interview,” they add. \n\nRogan again rejected the allegation on his podcast this week that he somehow sabotaged the interview, arguing that the Harris campaign “got scared” and wasn’t telling the truth to “cover their a**.”\n\n“It’s just normal political bullshit. They just lie. They cover their a**, and they lie. I would have been very happy to have her on, and like I said, the goal was to release both the same day,” said Rogan. \n\nThe podcaster said he would have been “nice” and that he would have held her “hand.”\n\n“You probably would have voted for her,” said Adam Curry, Rogan’s guest.\n\n“No, I wouldn’t have done that. I wasn’t going to vote for her,” said Rogan, laughing. \n\nPreviously, Rogan claimed to have made concessions to the Harris campaign about the topics they would discuss, saying that the campaign didn’t want to discuss the possibility of legalizing marijuana.","summary":"New book outlines claim Rogan’s team sabotaged interview with vice president shortly before election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-rogan-kamala-harris-podcast-b2698618.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/14/19/55/GettyImages-2194398394.jpg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Hh5BIDgg-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-14 20:27:46","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":290659826,"title":"The Queensberry Dilemma","text":"The Marquis of Queensberry Rules were devised in 1867 to define sportsmanlike conduct in the boxing ring. Honorable pugilists follow them to this day.\n\nDonald Trump does not. He fights more like a common thug, with no holds barred and the occasional blackjack.\n\nUnfortunately, many liberals, thinking that this is still a normal democracy, or wanting to set a good example, or just plain fearful and hoping to appease the dictator, follow the high-minded Marquis. After Kamala Harris’s defeat, President Biden worked hard to ensure a “normal” presidential transition to Trump—which this never could be.\n\nYou are kind of damned either way. Get down into the slime pit with Trump—or play fair and get hit below the belt.\n\nI was thinking of what we might call the Queensberry Dilemma when I read of a couple of recent court decisions.\n\nOn February 8, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer, in response to a suit by 19 state attorneys general, temporarily enjoined Elon Musk and his henchmen from accessing sensitive Treasury Department systems. But on February 11, another federal district judge, Jeannette A. Vargas, modified Judge Engelmayer’s order to provide that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other high-level Treasury colleagues could have full access.\n\nShe wrote that the earlier order “did not suggest that Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior Treasury officials ‘posed a threat of disclosure of sensitive and confidential information, or that their access would result in systems that would be more vulnerable to hacking.’”\n\nPerish the thought that Bessent and Musk might be in cahoots. The credulous, deferential Judge Vargas is a Biden appointee.\n\nIn an even more dubious decision, on Wednesday, District Court Judge George O’Toole Jr. allowed Trump to proceed with his proposed “deferred resignation” program, encouraging federal employees to leave their jobs in exchange for several months of severance. On February 6, O’Toole had issued a temporary restraining order in response to a suit by several governent employee unions, pending oral argunents.\n\nAfter hearing arguments from the Trump Justice Department, O’Toole allowed the buyout to go forward. Astonishingly, the judge’s rationale was that the unions lack standing to bring the suit. If unions representing affected workers don’t have standing, who does?\n\nBeyond the technical question of standing, the entire buyout program was invented out of whole cloth. It’s not at all clear whether the government even has the legal authority to make good on the promised deferred severance payments. The workers could take early retirement in good faith, and then get stiffed—a well-known Trump technique.\n\nJudge O’Toole is a Clinton appointee.\n\nRobert Frost once defined a liberal as the fellow who is so high-minded that he won’t take his own side in an argument. If even Democrat-appointed judges are going to look for ways to split hairs to seem ultra-fair and balanced, in the face of a wholesale assault on the Constitution, American democracy is toast.\n\nMOST JUDGES, THANKFULLY, have not fallen into this trap. On Thursday, Judge Amir Ali, one of the last Biden appointees, issued a very forceful ruling ordering the Trump administration to restore funding for all USAID contractors.\n\n“Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shock wave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs,” Ali wrote.\n\n“Absent temporary injunctive relief, therefore, the scale of the enormous harm that has already occurred will almost certainly increase,” he added. Ali barred Trump officials from implementing any contract cancellations or stop-work orders while further litigation plays out.\n\nSo far, though there have been threats, the administration has followed most court orders, though some grants are still being illegally withheld. Even Trump has stopped short of saying that he would defy the courts. The major cases will end up at the Supreme Court.\n\nThere, one ray of hope is the year-end report by Chief Justice John Roberts, warning explicitly against threats to ignore court orders as a fundamental attack on the judiciary. After recounting the sordid history of defiance of court orders, such as the white South’s “massive resistance” to desegregation orders and personal threats against judges, Roberts added, “The final threat to judicial independence is defiance of judgments lawfully entered by courts of competent jurisdiction” by other branches of government. He added that “judicial independence is undermined unless the other branches are firm in their responsibility to enforce the court’s decrees.”\n\nThere is little doubt about who his audience was. Let’s see if Roberts is as good as his word. The Queensberry rules only work if both sides honor them.","summary":"Today on TAP: Should liberals and federal judges take the high road against Trump and get pummeled?","url":"https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2025-02-14-queensberry-dilemma-liberals-judges-trump/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22504/download/Kuttner%20on%20Tap%20021425.jpg?cb=349fce2ddcdf2d074539e27ec580aed0&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 20:00:00","author":"Robert Kuttner","authors":["Robert Kuttner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":290605030,"title":"Top Trump official teases 2026 bid for California governor if Harris jumps in race","text":"One of President Donald Trump's top aides is floating a potential bid for California governor if former Vice President Kamala Harris also runs. Richard Grenell, a longtime Trump loyalist who is serving as U.S. envoy for special missions in the president's second administration, ended a gaggle with reporters at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday by teasing, \"I'll make a little news.\" Grenell then pointed to the 2026 race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. \"If Kamala Harris runs for governor, I believe that she has such baggage and hundreds of millions of dollars in educating the voters of how terrible she is, that it's a new day in California and that the Republican actually has a shot,\" Grenell said. SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS THIS TRUMP SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA SHERIFF WILL RUN FOR GOVERNOR There has been plenty of speculation since Harris' defeat last November, regarding her next political move, with the two potential options likely being launching a 2026 gubernatorial run in her home state of California or seeking the presidency again in 2028. Harris served as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general and U.S. senator before becoming vice president. MAJOR CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT PREEDICTS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS WOULD CLEAR GUBERNATORIAL FIELD Sources in the former vice president's political orbit say no decisions have been made about any next steps. The Democrats' field for governor in the heavily blue-leaning state is already crowded. Among the more than a half-dozen candidates already running for governor are Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a Harris ally, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Former Rep. Katie Porter, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic Senate nomination last year, has expressed interest in launching a campaign. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who served in Congress and as California attorney general before joining the Biden administration, is also seen as a potential contender. But pundits predict that Harris could clear the Democrats' field if she decides to launch a gubernatorial campaign. It's been nearly two decades since a Republican won statewide office in California. You have to go all the way back to former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election victory. Grenell considered a run for California governor during the 2021 recall election that Newsom eventually ended up easily winning, but he ultimately decided against launching a campaign. Grenell served as ambassador to Germany and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term. In his role as U.S. envoy for special missions in Trump's second administration, he took part in a mission to Venezuela that led to the release of six hostages. Grenell also joined the president in Los Angeles last month to survey the horrific wildfire damage in the area. Grenell, who along with Trump blasted state and local Democratic leaders for their performance handling the wildfire crisis, returned to Los Angeles last week as he accompanied EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on a recovery tour. Grenell isn’t the only California Republican considering or moving toward a gubernatorial campaign in 2026 in the race to succeed Newsom. Fox News confirmed earlier this week that Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco is planning to announce his candidacy at a scheduled event Monday in Riverside, California.

These orders raise the question of whether Trump truly is president and whether he has the authority to reform the federal government.\n\nWhile Trump said he will “always abide by the courts,” he warned that any injunction “gives crooked people more time to cover up the books.”\n\nYet even the most activist judge can’t issue an injunction unless someone brings a case, and filing lawsuits costs money. That raises the question: Who are the deep state allies filing these cases in the first place?\n\nExhibit A: The Federal Buyout\n\nWhile many judges have granted the activists the injunctions they want, one Democrat-appointed judge has refused to dignify their obstruction.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge George O’Toole, a Clinton appointee, ruled that four unions—the American Federation of Government Employees; a local American Federation of Government Employees union; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; and the National Association of Government Employees—lacked standing to sue the Trump administration to block Trump’s offer of “deferred resignation” for federal employees.\n\nOn Jan. 28, the Office of Personnel Management sent a memo allowing federal employees to accept what it called “deferred resignation.” As long as they resigned by Feb. 6, bureaucrats could remain on administrative leave with pay and benefits through Sept. 30, the last day of the 2025 fiscal year, which would become their last day of employment.\n\nWhile the offer ostensibly allows bureaucrats an off-ramp if they refuse to stop working from home and return to work in the office, it may also represent a positive opening bid for bureaucrats who might otherwise seek to oppose Trump’s agenda from within the administrative state to leave. A recent poll found that 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Kamala Harris in November say they will refuse a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. Trump aims to prevent this deep state from growing.\n\nThe unions sued over the deferred resignation offer, and after temporarily blocking the Feb. 6 deadline, O’Toole ruled that “the unions lack standing to challenge the directive.”\n\n“Standing requires the plaintiffs to be more than ‘mere bystander[s]’ and instead requires a ‘personal stake in the dispute,’” he wrote, citing a 2024 Supreme Court case. “Further, the Supreme Court recently held that an organization that is not directly affected by an agency’s actions cannot establish standing simply by ‘divert[ing] its resources in response to a defendant’s actions.”\n\n“The plaintiffs cannot manufacture standing through self-inflicted harms,” the judge explained.\n\nWhy ‘Manufacture Standing’?\n\nThe AFGE represents 800,000 federal employees, and its natural interests lie with the bureaucratic status quo. The AFGE has vehemently opposed Trump’s reforms to weaken the administrative state because if Trump succeeds in streamlining the federal government and making it more efficient, the AFGE will be less necessary.\n\nThe AFGE is part of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest union. The AFL-CIO enjoyed access to the Biden White House and directed cash to the Left’s dark money network, particularly to shadowy nonprofits created by the for-profit company Arabella Advisors.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, form part of the dark money and influence campaign that staffed and advised the Biden administration. This influence campaign pushed the bureaucracy to champion critical race theory (the belief that America is systemically racist against blacks and in favor of whites), gender ideology, climate alarmism, and a preference for technocratic government.\n\nI call the network of these activist groups “the Woketopus,” and they are the subject of my new book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government.” Many of the lawsuits involve at least one of the activist groups I expose in the book.\n\nThe Woketopus has lost its influence in the White House, so it’s fighting for the next best thing—to prevent Trump from unraveling the administrative state that gave it power in the first place.\n\nA Judicial Attempted Coup\n\nMost of the federal rules Americans must live by are not passed by Congress but issued as regulations from one of the 438 “alphabet soup” agencies in the federal government—be it the ATF, the FDA, the NSA, the TSA, and so on and so forth. In 2022, for example, Congress passed 247 laws while agencies promulgated 3,168 rules and published 80,756 pages of those rules in the Federal Register.\n\nThe federal government employs about 2.4 million people, not counting active-duty military and Postal Service employees. According to the Constitution, those employees all answer to the president as head of the executive branch, but thanks to public sector unions and “civil service” protections, the president has difficulty firing them for poor performance or insubordination. Thus, the deep state opposition to the people’s elected president becomes a possibility.\n\nThe Left has weaponized this administrative bureaucracy, and that’s a prime reason why Trump wants to cut it down to size.\n\nTrump and the Department of Government Efficiency started with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has funded woke projects around the world. The administration has highlighted USAID grants of $1.5 million to advance “diversity, equity, and inclusion” in Serbia’s workplaces and $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia, among other examples. The USAID grants also dovetail with the foreign funding of the Open Society Foundations, a nonprofit founded by Hungarian American billionaire George Soros that helps fund the Woketopus.\n\nMy book explains how nonprofits like the American Federation of Teachers, the Human Rights Campaign, the American Civil Liberties Union, and others fed their staff members into federal agencies, wrote policy recommendations for the agencies, and worked closely with the administration to get their priorities enshrined into regulations that often have the force of law.\n\nNo wonder these same groups are now trying to use the courts to stop Trump’s reforms!\n\nFor instance, the American Federation of Teachers is suing to block the Treasury Department, the Department of Education, and the Office of Personnel Management from sharing documents with the DOGE.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is suing to force the military to kowtow to gender ideology after Trump issued an executive order declaring that clinically-diagnosed gender confusion will disqualify someone from military service.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is suing to block Trump’s order preventing taxpayer funding from paying for experimental transgender medical interventions. The ACLU is also suing to block Trump’s order interpreting the 14th Amendment the way it was originally intended rather than granting U.S. citizenship to “anchor babies.” The ACLU is also suing to block Trump’s order to fast-track deportations of illegal aliens.\n\nThe AFGE has touted its lawsuits: the one blocking Trump’s employee buyout order; another challenging the constitutionality of the original version of the DOGE; another challenging Trump’s Schedule F order that makes it easier for the president to fire bureaucrats; and another attempting to prevent federal agencies from sharing information with the DOGE.\n\nThe AFGE also filed a lawsuit to block Trump’s USAID reforms, and a judge blocked the USAID from placing 4,000 employees on leave. In that case, however, the judge also pressed the unions to prove their standing to sue, suggesting this lawsuit may face the same fate as the suit over Trump’s buyout order.\n\nDemocrat state attorneys general have also filed lawsuits, but unions like the AFGE are largely leading the charge.\n\nThe law firm Democracy Forward—headed by Democrat lawyer Marc Elias, who attempted to reverse the 2024 election results in the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania—has boasted of providing legal representation for nine of the lawsuits against Trump, many involving the AFGE.\n\nMake no mistake: these groups are the allies of the deep state, and they’re working overtime to shore up the woke bureaucracy.\n\nWhile Trump has moved quickly and aggressively, as president he should have the authority to control the executive branch. These lawsuits amount to an attempted coup by judicial fiat, and the same influence campaign that pushed woke orthodoxy on America under President Joe Biden is now screaming to high heaven as Trump attempts to dismantle its control on Washington.\n\nIf the democratically elected president cannot fulfill his promises to the American people by changing the administrative state, that raises the question whether America truly is a republic, or merely a bureaucracy.","summary":"President Donald Trump has entered Washington like a bull in a China shop, shattering the Mandarin norms of the administrative state in order to undermine...

On the Musk-owned X platform, Elez posted sentiments such as “Normalize Indian hate,” pleaded for a “eugenic immigration policy,” and suggested replacing “99%” of Indian immigrants on H-1B work visas with artificial intelligence. After Long reached out to the White House for comment, Elez, who had gained unprecedented, dangerous control over the source code of Treasury systems that disburse Social Security and Medicare payments, appeared to resign.\n\nThe aftermath, as with all Trump 2.0 events, was chaotic. Musk came to Elez’s defense over the “inappropriate” posts and vowed to rehire him, seemingly at the suggestion of a poll posted on X. Vice President J.D. Vance—who is himself the husband of an Indian American woman and father of three half-Indian children—also defended the DOGE staffer in an X post, saying that although he disagreed with “some of Elez’s posts,” he didn’t think they should “ruin a kid’s life.”(Elez is 25 years old, and some of his racist tweets were posted barely two months ago.)\n\nWhile vile, Elez’s posts and the reactions to them represent a pattern of anti-Indian racism that runs rampant throughout the GOP base and is winning out over traditionally pro–“model minority” Republicanism. At the heart of this issue is H-1B work visas, documents Elez and others on the right claim are intended to import Indian laborers at the expense of American workers. (Think of it as a version of the “great replacement” theory.) Though common, this view runs directly counter to those of many Trump supporters in the tech world, including Musk, who have long favored the immigration of “high-skilled” workers—and showcases a widening gap in the GOP between its base and its wealthy technocratic elite.\n\nThe “Normalize” post occurred last September, the same month that the “pro–white nationalist” influencer Laura Loomer replied to a post from then-candidate Kamala Harris with a screed of lazy stereotypes about Indians (e.g., smelling like curry, working at call centers). This earned enough offense to draw a rebuke from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, herself no stranger to bigoted social media posts.\n\nIn December, Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he’d be appointing Sriram Krishnan—an Indian immigrant, naturalized U.S. citizen, and longtime Silicon Valley bigwig—to an advisory position at the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. A day later, Loomer took to X to call Krishnan’s appointment “deeply disturbing” and plainly mischaracterizing a past statement he’d made in favor of expanding the H-1B program.\n\nX devolved into a dayslong posting spree of further anti-Indian racism—from Loomer, from Elez himself (the aforementioned “eugenic immigration” and H-1B attacks), and from the MAGA base at large, further widening some long-extant fissures between your garden-variety GOP voter and the high-level Silicon Valley converts who’d been advising Trump during the transition.\n\nWhile the tech moguls have long favored the immigration of “high-skilled” workers, their motivations aren’t completely altruistic. The Obama-era measures for which tech lobbyists advocated would have added flexibility for green card sponsorships and raised the annual number of low-paid immigrants approved for H-1B temporary guest worker visas. They also would have made it easier for these tech companies to fire U.S.–born workers, and they enacted penalties on Indian companies that connected willing foreign workers with American job opportunities.\n\nThe stated urgency, for these tech execs, is to fill open roles with the surpluses of talented engineers educated in countries like India; it’s also a canny way for these anti-union ideologues to sidestep the possibility of their U.S.–born employees exercising their constitutional rights to demand greater worker protections. (Not to mention, several Big Tech CEOs are Indian immigrants.)\n\nThe persistent clash between these strategically pro-immigration tech bosses and the immigration hard-liners (of all class levels) to whom Trump appeals was hinted at in a couple of summertime incidents. The Republican candidate, in his attempt to sway wealthy tech-world donors, appeared on a June episode of the All-In Podcast—the venture capital watercooler co-hosted by David Sacks, who’s now Trump’s “A.I. and crypto czar.” When Musk buddy Jason Calacanis asked that Trump “promise” to make it easier for the U.S. to “import the best and brightest” from nations like India, the now president agreed, proposing to automatically grant green cards to foreign-born U.S. college graduates on student visas.\n\nHis campaign walked that back just a day after the episode dropped, clarifying that a Trump 2.0 administration would express such generosity only after “the most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history” left standing “the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.” (Also, Trump likely wasn’t thinking about the bright Indian American students who’ve protested against Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip, whom he’s suggested should be deported as punishment for their exercising free speech.) Just a month after that episode, when Trump announced that he would go with Silicon Valley favorite Vance as his running mate, the ex-president’s most racist supporters immediately bemoaned that the veep hopeful was married to an Indian American, Usha Chilukuri Vance.\n\nThese contradictory impulses within Trump’s 2024 coalition weren’t limited to Silicon Valley forums. Shortly after Vance’s coronation, the Indian immigrant and conservative litigator Harmeet Dhillon gave a Sikh prayer onstage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, sparking brigades of online fury from far-right Trump supporters who disparaged her faith and called for her deportation.\n\nMuch of the blowback was voiced on X, which had sharply curtailed its anti–hate speech policies and granted white nationalists a louder megaphone. Other users catapulted off the trendy Republican obsession with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs to denounce Dhillon’s appearance as “a message of diversity and inclusivity” (the horror!) and an example of “racial and ethnic pandering.”\n\nBy the time Trump won reelection and granted his new tech buddies major influence over the presidential transition, the clash between their opportunistic immigration viewpoints and the base’s contempt for any foreigners was already obvious. Ironically, it was one of those pro-“skilled”-immigrant techies—Musk—who exposed this gulf best via his empowerment of blatant racists on X.\n\nAfter all, it was Musk who had restored Loomer’s Twitter account, years after she was expelled in 2018 for her Islamophobic posts about Rep. Ilhan Omar. In late December, as Loomer baselessly blamed Indian and Chinese programmers for holiday air-travel snafus—once again catapulting off Musk’s obsession with “DEI”—the South African multibillionaire took a break from fearmongering over immigrants to cheer for H-1B visa workers, citing the need for those engineers in the face of their “permanent shortage” within the American workforce.\n\nMusk’s DOGE counterpart Vivek Ramaswamy invited even more white rage after penning an unintentionally hilarious screed about why foreign-born engineers were often hired over U.S.–born ones: because the latter’s “culture” encouraged lazing about in front of the dang TV all day and venerating jocks over nerds, while foreign-born kids were incentivized to study.\n\nRamaswamy’s plea for white Americans to save themselves all but served as his death warrant in the MAGA technocracy, which was attempting (and struggling) to tread the line between its one immigration concession and the all-out anti-immigrant clamor of the Trump base. Sacks retweeted defenses of Krishnan and H-1B immigrants while claiming that he “completely trust[ed]” Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who’s rather pointedly not a fan of either Indian people or H-1B applicants. Sympathetic conservatives attempted to blame the furor—which manifested in scrutiny of Ramaswamy’s past as well as calls to fire both him and Musk from DOGE—on “bot activity.” Yet his post struck such a nerve that it led to his ouster from DOGE and marginalization from the central MAGA movement altogether.\n\nDid it matter that Ramaswamy had befriended bigots like Tucker Carlson, embraced the antisemitic “great replacement” theory, broken bread with Ann Coulter after she straight-up told him she’d never support a president of Indian origin, and yelled at reporters who asked him about white supremacists? Nope. None of that saved him from the virulent anti-Indian racism of the very voters he’d wished to win over during his presidential run. It would be tragic if it weren’t so wimpy.\n\nBut what happened with Ramaswamy was also a harbinger of where the MAGA–Silicon Valley immigration debate was always going to fall: on the side of the base. And for a minute, it appeared that some members of the Indian diaspora were finally coming to terms with this. A December piece penned by an Indian American writer for the Free Press, the kooky “anti-woke” website beloved and funded by the tech right, lamented: “Liberals Warned Me About MAGA’s Racism. I Didn’t Believe Them—Until Now.”\n\nIf Musk and his fellow Trump techies are now willing to excuse “social media posts,” they’ll likely brush off the president’s material actions against Indian immigrants. Trump’s unconstitutional (and now blocked) executive order to terminate birthright citizenship for U.S.–born children of immigrants made sure to deny 14th Amendment rights to even children of H-1B workers, denying protections to the many coming Indian children whose parents accepted Silicon Valley’s invitations to work at its firms.\n\nAnd last week, in a chilling recognition of the fact that many immigrants to the U.S. who lack permanent legal status are Indians fleeing from persecution and adverse economic circumstances in their home country, the Trump administration dispatched a military plane packed with 100 Indian-origin deportees who sat in shackles throughout the 40-hour flight. (Coulter’s choice commentary: “Anybody named Vivek on that plane?”)\n\nThe conditions these immigrants were subjected to were similar to those of the Brazilian and Colombian and Mexican deportees whose treatment earned international condemnation—and Indian citizens responded in kind, gathering on the streets to express their rage at this “torture.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his foreign minister responded somewhat meekly, realizing that their country sits directly in the crosshairs of the retaliatory tariffs that Trump is aiming at any nation that dares question him. Meanwhile, Modi himself has arrived in the U.S. to pose for photos with Vance and Musk.\n\nIt should be plain by now that the Indian immigrants (pro-Trump or otherwise) who provide the thin bulwark between Trumpism’s tech-bro wing and its blatantly ethnonationalist wing will be easy sacrifices down the line. Some Trump-supporting Indians have come to understand this. Others will continue to collaborate with the regime until the leopards come for their faces.","summary":"The racist posts from Musk’s DOGE staffer show a widening gap in the GOP between its base and its wealthy technocratic elite.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-staffer-racist-x-posts-anti-indian-american-racism.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/5262d692-a5f5-4979-a5a8-a86edc13dc65.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 17:20:04","author":"Nitish Pahwa","authors":["Nitish Pahwa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":290573448,"title":"Abbey Clancy recalls VERY awkward Valentine's Day gaffe after she slipped into saucy lingerie to surprise husband Peter Crouch","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Feb 14th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorror as female tourist's hands are bitten off by shark yards from Caribbean beach after she 'tried to engage the 6ft predator to take a picture'\n\nJ.D.

It was so awkward'.\nPete explained to listeners that this incident is the reason he buys his stunning wife a Burberry coat every Valentine's Day, laughing: 'You should've told me' \nTo which Abbey replied: 'I know. By the end of the meal, I was stuffed, and I put the fleece dressing gown back on.' \nEarlier this month Abbey was back in Agent Provocateur lingerie as she modelled the brand's new Valentine's Day range. \nThe busty beauty showed off her toned frame in one black lace set complete with suspenders, garter belt and sheer stockings. \nShe completed the sultry look with matching lace gloves and wore her light tresses in perfect bouncy waves while opting for radiant makeup.\nAnother look saw her slip into a nude lace look before changing into a busty corset and leopard print briefs. \nFor the final look she wore a black and pink-trimmed corset and fluffy heels as she posed on a podium. \n\nSpeaking on the last episode of the couple's podcast The Therapy Crouch she said: 'One Valentine's Day quite a few years ago, I was head to toe in Agent Provocateur [AP]' \n\nHowever to her surprise Peter has organised a swanky night in for a couple with a private chef coming to their home to cook them a meal \n\nPreviously she lifted the lid on her and Peter's sex life she joked that she was 'a bit of a fridge' as she recalled how they slept in the same bed 'multiple times' when they first began dating, without ever having sex. \nAbbey admitted the start of their relationship was not too romantic, recounting how Pete had taken her to a 'horrendous' pub on their first date and made her buy him a drink.\n\n Abbey Clancy jokes she's 'a bit of a fridge' as she reveals she slept in the same bed as husband Peter Crouch 'multiple times' before ever having sex \nIn an episode of their podcast, The Therapy Crouch, the couple were joined by comedian Joel Dommett and his wife Hannah Cooper.\nAbbey was quick to quiz the pair on their relationship, before saying: 'Did he make you buy him a drink on the first date? Because Pete made me buy one. I've never bought a drink in my entire life until I went out with you.'\nRecalling their first date, she added that she had no money at the time and had struggled to pay for their drinks.\nShe said: 'I was like 19 at the time. I was living with my mom, I had a job I was on like 15 quid a week. So I had like £7 to go on this date with Peter. And then I said 'Oh, I'll get the next one' and he went 'Oh, I'll have a Guinness'.\n'I was thinking 'S**t, how much is a Guinness? I've got £7 in my pocket.' So I came back with a Guinness and a tap water.'\nPeter burst into laughter as he revealed that when he asked Abbey why she wasn't drinking, she made up the excuse she was just 'thirsty'.\nThe blonde beauty scolded her husband for his 'not very good manners', before revealing she had refused the England star's offer to return to his house.\n\nPreviously she lifted the lid their sex life she joked that she was 'a bit of a fridge' as she recalled sleeping in the same bed 'multiple times' when they first began dating, without ever having sex \n\nShe said: 'You took me to the pub opposite your house.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy KATE DENNETT FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:16:45 GMT, 14 February 2025 |Updated:16:54 GMT, 14 February 2025 \n\nMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury reportedly spent Valentine's Day morning together after the Love Island star hit back at critics of their relationship.\nThe reality TV star and the boxer, both 25, announced their shock separation in August but sparked speculation they 'rekindled' their relationship in recent days.\nNow, it appears that the couple spent the morning of Valentine's Day together as Tommy was pictured leaving her Cheshire mansion on Friday.\nPictures obtained by The Sun showed Tommy driving his luxury Mercedes 4x4 out of the home he used to share with Molly-Mae.\nSince their separation, the couple have been co-parenting their daughter Bambi, two, and Tommy is often seen visiting Molly-Mae's home to see the toddler. In recent weeks, he has been seen at the property more frequently. \nMailOnline has contacted Molly's representatives for comment.\n\nMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury reportedly spent Valentine's Day morning together after the Love Island star hit back at critics of their relationship \n\nThe Love Island lovebirds, 25, fell for each other on the fifth series of the ITV show in 2019, but in summer Molly-Mae announced their romance was over (seen with their daughter Bambi)\nMolly-Mae hit back at critics of her relationship with Tommy following reports that her family is 'horrified' at reports she has 'reunited' with her ex-fiancé. \nAmid the speculation, Molly-Mae told MailOnline: 'What others think about my relationship is not my concern.'\nA representative for the star continued: 'At this current time Molly is focusing on what's best for herself and her daughter whilst co-parenting...\n'Others' opinion on her relationship is not her focus or her concern. Only she knows how she feels.'\nThe Love Island lovebirds fell for each other when they met on the fifth series of the ITV show in 2019, but Molly-Mae announced their romance was over in August.\nIn December, the pair sparked speculation that they may have reunited after social media footage showed them sharing a kiss on New Year's Eve.\nMolly-Mae and Tommy have not confirmed that they are back together but in the Maebe owner's documentary Behind It All, she shared that her ultimate goal was for them to reunite as a family. \nAnd according to The Sun, a source reportedly close to Molly-Mae confirmed their romance is indeed back on track - and claimed her family are not happy about it. \n\nNow, it appears that the couple (pictured in February 2022) spent the morning of Valentine's Day together as Tommy was pictured leaving her Cheshire mansion on Friday\n\n Tommy Fury sparks speculation he's landed his own fly-on-the-wall docuseries akin to ex Molly-Mae \n'Molly-Mae's family and friends saw the hell he put her through and they're horrified that his feet are back under the table,' the source told the publication. \n'Molly-Mae's closest friends and members of her family think this is a terrible idea and that it is all going to end in tears again.\n'[Her sister] Zoe is fiercely protective and will never forget what Tommy put her through, let alone forgive him.'\nIn Molly-Mae's recent documentary Behind It All, both her mother Debbie Gordon and sister Zoe Rae gave their thoughts on the break-up.\nIn a conversation with her sister Zoe, Molly-Mae candidly admitted 'all she wants in this life is to be with him and have another baby' so they can 'grow old as a family'.\nShe said: 'I do feel like I could burst into tears today, it is mainly Tommy. It is just thing after thing at the minute.\n'He's now sent me a text saying, \"we are just going round and round in circles and not moving forward,\"' to which Zoe replied: 'That is why you are sad.'\nMolly admitted to the camera: 'Up until now I had the mindset of we will end up back together one day, but right now we need to be apart and he needs to work on himself. But how it is looking this week is we are actually just done. It is exhausting.'\nZoe told her: 'If you don't draw a line in the sand it will carry on being exhausting for the next five years.'\n\nThey have not confirmed that they are back together but in the Maebe owner's documentary Behind It All she shared that her ultimate goal was for them to reunite as a family\n\nIn Molly-Mae's recent documentary Behind It All, both her mother Debbie Gordon and sister Zoe Rae (all pictured) gave their thoughts on the break-up \nMolly quipped: 'But I don't want to because I don't want to end it. I knew we were going to get back together.'\nZoe said: 'Surely you didn't,' to which Molly replied: 'No, I did. Why do you think I haven't cried. All I want in this life is to be with him and to have another baby with him and grow old as a family, and to live in a nice house together and to have a nice life together.'\nElsewhere in the documentary, Molly-Mae's mother Debbie said: 'I'm very fond of Tommy. \n'He looked after Molly, made her laugh, treated her well for a long time. That outweighed the not so great stuff going on.\n'She was going to through the turmoil of a break up and the heartbreak but moving forward she wouldn't have endlessly nights worrying.'\nAs Molly-Mae spoke about Tommy's alcohol use, Debbie told her: 'Can I be honest? Over the years there were so many occasions that I witnessed myself that made me beyond worried for you.'\nTommy FuryMolly Mae Hague\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury 'spend Valentine's Day together' after she hit back at 'concerns' over her relationship with the boxer\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nColin Firth's telling five-word response after finding out about beloved Bridget Jones character's fate in new sequel\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nLiam Payne asked me to be his best man.

$28M from Amazon for documentary deal: report","text":"First Lady Melania Trump will walk away with at least $28 million as part of her $40 million agreement with e-commerce giant Amazon to license a documentary film about her life, according to a report.\n\nTrump, who is due to receive over 70% of the deal’s proceeds, has also been shopping sponsorship deals for the film, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe first lady also reportedly told blue-chip CEOs who attended her husband’s inauguration on Jan. 20 that they would need to pony up at least $10 million in exchange for being acknowledged at the end of the film’s credits.\n\nAs a bonus, the CEOs who agree to pay for the sponsorship would get an invite to the documentary’s premier, according to the Journal.\n\nThe first lady’s Amazon deal came together shortly after company founder Jeff Bezos traveled to Mar-a-Lago in December to dine with her husband — who weeks earlier trounced his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the first lady was keen on persuading Bezos, the Amazon founder and Washington Post owner who historically has had a fraught relationship with the president, to buy the rights to the documentary.\n\nWeeks earlier, Bezos had blocked his newspaper’s traditionally Democrat-leaning editorial board from publishing an endorsement of Harris.\n\nHe later pledged $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, \n\nEager to sharpen her sales pitch, Melania Trump reportedly enlisted the aid of Brett Ratner, the Hollywood director and producer known for hits including the “Rush Hour” trilogy as well as his involvement with blockbusters such as “Red Dragon” and “X-Men: The Last Stand.”\n\nRatner has kept a low profile in Hollywood since he was accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo era.\n\nAt the Mar-a-Lago dinner on Dec. 18, which included the Trumps as well as Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, the first lady “regaled” her guests with details about the documentary film, the Journal reported.\n\nAbout two weeks later, Amazon announced that it would stream the film on its Prime Video service.\n\nThe Journal reported that the $40 million sum was the most that Amazon had ever spent on a documentary — an amount that was three time more than the nearest competing bids, according to the Journal.\n\nParamount, parent company of CBS, made what the Journal described as a “lowball” offer of $4 million while Disney submitted a more respectable bid of $14 million, according to the report.\n\nNetflix and Apple declined to bid, the Journal reported.\n\n“We licensed the upcoming Melania Trump documentary film and series for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it,” an Amazon spokesman told the Journal.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from the White House, Amazon and Bezos.\n\nThe lucrative documentary deal is part of a broader financial windfall for the Trump family since Trump’s return to the White House. \n\nIn total, businesses have directed about $80 million to the Trumps and the Trump presidential library, including settlements from lawsuits the president had previously filed against corporations.\n\nMeta settled a lawsuit with Trump for $25 million.\n\nSimilarly, ABC News paid $15 million to resolve a defamation suit, and Elon Musk’s X agreed to a $10 million settlement.\n\nParamount is reportedly in talks with the president’s lawyers about a settlement over a lawsuit filed in connection with a “60 Minutes” interview with Harris that Trump alleges was deceptively edited for political purposes.\n\nThe Trumps’ financial dealings have drawn criticism for their unprecedented scale. \n\nEthics watchdogs argue Trump is using his office for financial gain more aggressively than in his first term.","summary":"The Trump-Amazon deal came together shortly after company founder Jeff Bezos traveled to Mar-a-Lago

$5.95 million Tennessee estate belonging to the late country musician George Jones.\n\nAlongside photos of the newly engaged couple posing on the porch, Wilson also shared photos and a short clip of herself showing off the massive sparkler on her ring finger. \n\nAnother photo showed Wilson staring deeply into the 28-year-old athlete’s eyes, as he smiled for the camera after getting down on one knee.\n\nIn the Instagram caption, she referenced her song 4x4xU, writing ‘4x4xU forever’ with a red heart emoji.\n\nThe engagement came just in time too, after the Louisiana native admitted just last month that she was tired of ‘waiting’ for Hodges to propose and said she might have to pop the question herself.\n\nWhile the pair made their first public appearance together at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2023, the couple has actually been together long before then.\n\nFEMAIL has taken a closer look at Wilson and Hodges’ romance, and how they went from rising country star and rookie football quarterback to the southern version of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.\n\nWho is Lainey Wilson?\n\nLainey Denay Wilson was born on May 19, 1992, and raised in Baskin, Louisiana – a town of less than 300 people. Her father Brian was a farmer while her mother, Michelle, was a schoolteacher. Wilson also has an older sister named Janna.\n\nShe developed a passion for music at a young age, when she attended a performance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, at nine years old. ‘I just remember looking up there, being like, ‘Man, I wanna do that,’ Wilson told The Boot in 2020.\n\nHer father taught her a few chords on the guitar, which is when she began to take up songwriting. In her teenage years, Wilson even took up a job impersonating Miley Cyrus’s alter ego Hannah Montana – performing at birthday parties and county fairs.\n\n‘I’d be like, “Can Lainey Wilson open the show?”‘ she recalled to Rolling Stone in December 2021. ‘They’d be like, “Who’s Lainey?” I’d be like, “The person you hired to be Hannah Montana!”‘\n\nShe moved to Nashville when she turned 19, living in a camper trailer parked outside a recording studio owned by a family friend. After years of playing small shows throughout Nashville, she released her self-titled debut album in 2014.\n\nHer second album, Tougher, was released two years later and charted at No. 44 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums list. By 2018, Wilson had signed her first publishing deal with Broken Bow Records.\n\nHowever, her big break came in 2019 thanks to the hit Paramount western-drama series Yellowstone, when her song Working Overtime played during season two of the Kevin Costner-led show. \n\nYellowstone co-creator Taylor Sheridan went on to feature Wilson’s singles Straight Up Sideways and Small Town Girl in season three, along with Smell Like Smoke in season five.\n\nIn fact, Wilson made a four-episode on-screen appearance during Yellowstone’s fifth season in 2022 as Abby, a musician who has a romantic relationship with actor Ian Bohen’s character Ryan.\n\nWilson shot to stardom thanks to her Yellowstone stint, and went on tour with fellow country musician Morgan Wallen. Her 2020 single, Things a Man Oughta Know, later became a number one hit and her 2022 album, Bell Bottom Country, received numerous accolades.\n\nIn 2023, she won Album of the Year for Bell Bottom Country and Female Artist of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as the Grammy Award for Best Country Album.\n\nAlthough Wilson has kept her political views to herself, she hasn’t shied away from sharing her pride for her country. \n\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital in July 2024, Wilson said that being an American ‘means being free’ and that ‘freedom is a good feeling.’\n\n‘Being an American to me, oh my goodness, it means everything to me. I’ll tell you what, I would not be able to be doing this,’ she said. ‘It means being free and freedom is a good feeling.’\n\nWhile co-hosting the CMA Awards with Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning in November 2024, Wilson also made a subtle political message during the opening monologue.\n\n‘Side note y’all, there’s one thing that I wanna say to everybody here about the recent results,’ she said on-stage, referencing the recent 2024 presidential election, in which Donald Trump beat out then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nShe continued: ‘Whether the candidate you voted for won or lost, we all need to get together behind the winner.’\n\nManning then chimed in: ‘Lainey, we talked about this now. Let’s not get into politics tonight.’\n\nWilson jokingly clarified: ‘I’m talking about the vote for People’s Sexiest Man Alive.’\n\nWho is Devlin ‘Duck’ Hodges?\n\nThe Alabama native, who got his start playing football at Samford University, has been more vocal about his political leanings than his fiancée.\n\nIn 2019, during his rookie season with the Steelers, Hodges was caught deleting old posts on X (Twitter) expressing his support for Trump. According to Complex, one tweet simply read ‘Donald Trump’ with a thumbs up and an American flag emoji.\n\n‘Wanting Donald Trump to fail is like wanting the pilot to crash the plane that we are ALL on,’ another since-deleted tweet read.\n\nWhile playing football in college, he received the nickname Duck for his expertise in duck calling, ESPN reported. Hodges won the 2009 Junior World Duck Calling Contest when he was 13, and the Alabama State Duck Calling Championship in 2018.\n\nHe is also an avid duck hunter and his Instagram is filled with posts of Hodges wearing camouflage during duck hunts.\n\nAfter his contract with the Steelers expired in January 2021, he briefly signed with the Los Angeles Rams before signing a three-year deal with the Ottawa Redblacks of the Canadian Football League.\n\nHodges announced his retirement from professional football in April 2022, and went on to become a real estate agent. He currently works as an agent for Memphis-based real estate firm Myers Cobb Realtors.\n\nHis realtor profile states he’s an ambassador for Chene Gear, an outdoor hunting gear retailer.\n\nWhen did they begin dating?\n\nHodges and Wilson sparked a relationship in 2021 after meeting through mutual friends in Nashville.\n\nIn an interview with People, the singer recalled how her first date with Hodges took place at a dance hall and saloon that was known for its cheap drinks and live music.\n\n‘We went to this old place called Silverados, and it had free beer and wine from five to 10 pm,’ she said. ‘I was like, “This boy likes to ball on a budget too. This is gonna work out.”‘\n\nHowever, they didn’t make their romance public until two years later when they walked the red carpet at the 2023 Academy of Country Music Awards. Speculation surrounding their relationship had sparked weeks prior after Wilson performed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, wearing Hodges’ Steelers jersey on stage.\n\n‘I said, “We gonna see if you’re in it for the right reasons.” Turns out, he is,’ she told People.\n\nWilson also described her then-boyfriend as ‘one of my biggest cheerleaders and champions’ and gushed over their ‘healthy relationship.’\n\n‘I was never really able to write love songs, because I don’t know if I had actually felt it, but I’m writing me some love songs now,’ she added. ‘I’m grateful for him.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCountry music star Lainey Wilson and former NFL player Devlin &#8216;Duck&#8217; Hodges&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Country singer and NFL player from popular TV show Yellowstone are getting married after falling in love. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/country-singer-and-nfl-player-from-popular-tv-show-yellowstone-are-getting-married-after-falling-in-love/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Meet-the-MAGA-Travis-and-Taylor-Country.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 16:27:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.438},{"id":290560812,"title":"Trump aide Ric Grenell threatens to run against Kamala Harris for California gov","text":"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s envoy for special missions Ric Grenell said Friday that he’s considering running against Kamala Harris for California governor next year.\n\nGrenell, 58, told reporters at the Munich Security Conference that he believes the former vice president is vulnerable if she attempts a political comeback after her blowout loss to Trump on Nov. 5.\n\n“If Kamala Harris runs for governor, I believe that she has such baggage and hundreds of millions of dollars in educating the voters of how terrible she is, that it’s a new day in California, and that the Republican actually has a shot,” Grenell said. \n\n“I wouldn’t say no” to running, he added.\n\nIt’s unclear if Grenell, who is well-known for trolling Democrats on social media, has taken any concrete steps toward exploring a campaign.\n\nGolden State Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is term-limited and filling his position has been discussed as a possible next-step for Harris, 60.\n\nHarris has been elected statewide three times before — twice as California’s attorney general, in 2010 and 2014, and as US senator in 2016 — before carrying the state as the Democratic presidential nominee with 58.5% of the vote to Trump’s 38.3%.\n\nHer closest statewide election was in 2010, when she took scored a narrow 46.1% victory over GOP attorney general nominee Steve Cooley at 45.3%.\n\nCalifornia Democrats are reeling from the aftermath of last month’s wildfires in Los Angeles, which caused more than $250 billion in damage. Outraged residents and Republicans blame local Democratic policies for contributing to the infernos and lack of water available to extinguish them.\n\nGrenell’s amorphous current role includes serving as Trump’s point person on Los Angeles reconstruction. He’s also served as a foreign emissary — including recently traveling to Venezuela to broker the release of six Americans and an agreement by socialist strongman Nicolas Maduro to accept deportees.\n\nHe additionally is Trump’s interim executive director of the Kennedy Center in Washington. \n\nIn Trump’s first term, Grenell served as US ambassador to Germany, a role in which he helped block construction of the Nord Stream 2 Russian natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, which the Biden administration later allowed to resume.\n\nHe also brokered a diplomatic agreement between Serbia and Kosovo and served as acting director of national intelligence in 2020, becoming the first openly gay person to occupy a cabinet-level post.","summary":"“I wouldn’t say no\" to running, Grenell told reporters at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/trump-aide-ric-grenell-threatens-to-run-against-kamala-harris-for-california-gov/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-o94rvwpcv-1739549300157.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1739531319&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ojXZK63Z-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-14 16:23:28","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":290570516,"title":"Bluesky Sees 22% User Surge After Initial Post-Election Spike","text":"Bluesky, the platform that was dubbed “Blue Heaven” for left-leaning users ditching Elon Musk’s X, has maintained its post-2024 election momentum, according to new data shared with TheWrap on Friday.\n\nThe app averaged 2.83 million global daily users for the first week of February, according to data from market research company Sensor Tower. That represents a 22% increase from the first week of December, when the app averaged 2.33 million daily users, and a 6.3% increase from where Bluesky was during the first week of 2025.\n\nIn a matter of weeks following the election, Bluesky enjoyed rapid growth as some X users fled what was once Twitter. The reason? Donald Trump, who Musk publicly backed and spent more than $250 million to help get back into the White House, beat Kamala Harris.\n\nTo boycott the Musk-Trump alliance, those disenchanted X users turned to Bluesky and Threads — which is run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has also had a warm relationship with the president recently. A number of celebrities ditched X, including “Star Wars” star Mark Hamill and “Sons of Anarchy” actor Chad Lindberg.\n\nOther celebs who made the switch to Bluesky include: Gabrielle Union, who announced her exit from X with a photoshopped letter; Stephen King; Ben Stiller, who posts a lot about his New York Knicks; and Barbra Streisand.\n\nA laundry list of media personalities took their talents to Bluesky as well. The Washington Post’s Jen Rubin, MSNBC’s Katie Phang, former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, MSNBC’s Joy Reid, and former CNN host Don Lemon. They’ve all had a fair amount to say about Trump, the election and Musk since joining Bluesky.\n\nStill, those praying for X’s downfall have not had their invocations answered. X offset the users it lost with a healthy batch of new ones soon after the election, with the app enjoying a 27% increase in users. Sensor Tower data showed X had 25 million daily users in the U.S. a few weeks after the election. Plus, more advertisers, such as Disney and Apple, have recently resumed spending ad money on the app.","summary":"The X-like platform is approaching 3 million daily users \n\n\nThe post Bluesky Sees 22% User Surge After Initial Post-Election Spike appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bluesky-users-surge-after-post-election-bump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bluesky.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 16:15:55","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":290556246,"title":"Sam Thompson fights back tears as he shares emotional moment with his sister Louise as they spend Valentine's Day together to 'celebrate a different kind of love' following his split from Zara McDermott","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Feb 14th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorror as female tourist's hands are bitten off by shark yards from Caribbean beach after she 'tried to engage the 6ft predator to take a picture'\n\nJ.D.

No,\"' and Selena sweetly replied with, 'You're stuck with me.'\nThe pair are also preparing for the release of their album I Said I Love You First - which is slated to drop on March 21. \nAlong with announcing the LP, the first single Scared of Loving You was released on Thursday. \nIn regards to creating the album, Benny explained, 'We also just made it in this house. We weren't going to a studio every day. I'd be like, \"Hey, I have this cool chord thing.\" Then she'd come in.' \n'We weren't like, \"Today's the studio. We're going to write this song and that.\" So many times it was so hodgepodge. It was like two hours here, two hours there.'\n'I'd never worked that way with someone. Usually I work that way if I'm by myself, but it was so cool to be able to do that with her,' he added. \nTowards the end of the interview, Selena briefly talked about her Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez. \n\nIn regards to creating the album, Benny explained, 'We also just made it in this house. We weren't going to a studio every day. I'd be like, \"Hey, I have this cool chord thing.\" Then she'd come in'\n'It's transcended into something that's more of a gift than anything, and I couldn't be more grateful for it.' \nHowever, the movie has since been embroiled in drama after one of the leading stars Karla Sofia Gascon's controversial tweets resurfaced. \nIn regards to her 'dream role,' the actress said, 'I think my goal has always been to find characters that viscerally move me as an actor, especially after this experience.' \n'I don't need to be the lead. I will never be one of those actors. I just cherish and love filmmaking and storytelling, it's one of my greatest joys in life.' \nBenny BlancoSelena Gomez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nColin Firth's telling five-word response after finding out about beloved Bridget Jones character's fate in new sequel\n\nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nAs Kanye and Bianca head for 'divorce', we reveal the Censori family's chilling theory for why their daughter became a rapper's nude plaything \n\nWhat Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as model 'divorces' her ex Kanye West - and her cryptic 'marriage ending' comment\n\nLove is in the air: 10 top brands to help you celebrate Valentine's Day in style this year, from roses to jewellery\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, reveals he's engaged to girlfriend Vanessa Brown, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nInside Belle Gibson's warped mind after Netflix's Apple Cider Vinegar made her a 'star': Who she STILL blames for her downfall, her hope for the future \n\nRenee Zellweger as you've never seen her before!

He began the column in the Clinton years. Krugman left The Times just before Donald Trump was inaugurated.\n\nI asked him back then what has changed in 25 years.\n\nPaul Krugman, Former Columnist, The New York Times: When I began writing the column, people were extremely optimistic. I was hired basically to talk about all the good news and maybe funny stuff that was happening in this glorious late 1990s economic boom. And it's been a very troubled world since then.\n\nPaul Solman: By trouble, he means, at least domestically, Donald Trump's policies. But Americans voted for them, didn't they?\n\nPaul Krugman: Most voters have very little idea of policy. I mean, you look at the polling, ask people, do you approve of Obamacare, and it's still pretty negative. And you ask, do you approve of the Affordable Care Act, and it's very positive. So that's telling you something about what voters understand about policy.\n\nPaul Solman: Krugman pointed to this recent Michigan consumer confidence survey question.\n\nPaul Krugman: Are you personally better off than you were five years ago? In October, a clear plurality of Americans said, no, we're worse off. In November, a clear plurality of Americans said, yes, we're better off than we were five years ago.\n\nSo, people's assessment of their own financial situation turns out to be kind of driven by narratives that are floating out there.\n\nPaul Solman: Krugman supported President Biden's policy of manufacturing investment to help regions hurt by trade and China. But voters in those regions went for Donald Trump. Did they reject the policy?\n\nPaul Krugman: Maybe, or maybe they just didn't really attribute it to Biden or whatever, although I think we are seeing a dynamic now, which is that it's going to be harder than some Republicans think to reverse those policies, that people may not have given Biden credit for that new battery factory in your town, but they will get really angry if the battery factory closes because we have cut off the subsidies.\n\nPaul Solman: Did most economists, including yourself, not appreciate how huge a factor the cost of living change pre-COVID to today was, is?\n\nPaul Krugman: I would have thought — I did think — I even looked at statistical analyses that said that most of the discontent over inflation, which inflation peaked in the middle of 2022 and has come way down, and I would have expected people to have largely gotten over it by now. And they haven't.\n\nPaul Solman: Do you have an explanation for it?\n\nPaul Krugman: I think that part of it is just that the shock of this coming for the first time after decades of price stability was part of it. And then part of it is just that we are — our political discourse has become much more fragmented, much more polarized.\n\nPaul Solman: For voters with incomes under $50,000 a year, household incomes, Donald Trump actually did better than Kamala Harris. Why do you suppose that was?\n\nPaul Krugman: Trump promised to bring prices down, which is a promise that he immediately abandoned as soon as he won. But that — so, that would have appealed to low-income voters as a promise.\n\nAnd, also, there's a lot of confounding of income and education and paying attention. We know that Trump won heavily among people who pay very little attention to the news.\n\nPaul Solman: One great burden of a low income, besides not affording things, says Krugman.\n\nPaul Krugman: Is the cognitive burden it places on people. The biggest benefit once I started earning a nice income was not having to worry all the time about what things cost, whether I could afford this or that.\n\nSo, asking people to have a sophisticated view on what economic policy can and can't do is going to be correlated with income, unfortunately.\n\nPaul Solman: Krugman not only made a good living. He also advised various administrations on economic policy. Advice taken?\n\nPaul Krugman: The thing that I have learned in real life is that, no matter how much you know, no matter how right you have been, your ability to actually influence policy is very, very limited.\n\nI mean, if you ask, how many times has somebody with actual power actually taken advice that I gave them, the answer is once my whole life.\n\nPaul Solman: What are you least proud of?\n\nPaul Krugman: I think maybe the thing I'm least proud of is that I missed one of the important problems of globalization. I thought it was on the whole a good thing, but that it would be problematic.\n\nBut what I missed was the way that the impact would be concentrated on particular communities. So we can look and say that the China shock displaced maybe one or two million U.S. manufacturing workers. A million-and-a-half people are laid off every month, so what's that?\n\nBut what I missed was that there would be individual towns that would be in the path of this tidal wave of imports from China that would have their reason for existence gutted.\n\nPaul Solman: Yesterday, I caught up with him again for two final questions, first why he left The Times and moved to Substack, where more than 200,000 followers now read whatever's on his mind.\n\nPaul Krugman: It's very important to me, given my sort of dual career, to be able to weigh in on ongoing discussions of economics in a way that you can't do in an 800-word column written for a general audience. And so I had a newsletter at The Times, which was summarily canceled. They said I was writing too much.\n\nThat was when I decided I needed to leave, but also that I had always been very, very lightly edited at The Times, until the last year. And then the editing became extremely intrusive.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy KATE DENNETT FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:15:38 GMT, 14 February 2025 |Updated:16:37 GMT, 14 February 2025 \n\nCaroline Flack's best friend Lou Teasdale was gifted a heartwrenching portrait of the late presenter for Valentine's Day.\nThe celebrity hairdresser, 41, took to her Instagram Stories on Thursday night to reveal the emotional present her boyfriend Andy Carroll got for her.\nIn a touching Valentine's gesture, the footballer bought her a print of her late friend Caroline, which was created by acclaimed artists The Connor Brothers.\nThe artwork features half of Caroline's profile alongside a red printed background and her poignant quote: 'In a world where you can be anything, be kind.' \nThe signed print is available for purchase with the Yield Gallery for £1,250 and Lou was left overwhelmed after Andy bought it for her.\nSharing the picture to her Stories, Lou wrote: 'Ty [thank you] to my Valentine [broken heart emoji].'\n\nCaroline Flack's best friend Lou Teasdale was gifted a heartwrenching portrait of the late presenter for Valentine's Day\n\nIn a touching Valentine's gesture, her boyfriend Andy Carroll bought her a print of her late friend Caroline, which was created by acclaimed artists The Connor Brothers\nThe artwork was created after Caroline visited The Connor Brothers' studio to be photographed for a portrait she had commissioned, which would become her last photoshoot.\nAn online description explains: 'Just over two years ago Caroline Flack came to our studio to be photographed for a portrait she wanted to commission. \n'She was a joy to work with, and her playful personality and appetite for life were infectious. \n'Like everyone else, we were entirely unaware at the time that this would be Caroline’s last photoshoot. \n'Although we only met Caroline once, she left a big impression on us with her warmth and humour, and we were devastated by the news of her untimely death.'\nAfter her death, The Connor Brothers put the final portrait up for sale to raise money for leading suicide prevention charity CALM and NGO CHOOSE LOVE, who Caroline supported.\nCaroline's saying 'Be Kind', which went viral after she passed away, was incorporated into the artwork.\nThe Love Island presenter was found dead at her home in North East London on February 15, 2020, and her death was ruled a suicide in an inquest in August 2020.\n\nLou had been taking care of Caroline (both pictured in March 2014) and had popped out to the shops when the star had taken her life shortly after she left the property\n\nLou has been slowly rebuilding her life in the wake of her best friend's death in February 2020 and has recently started dating footballer Andy (pictured) \nLou had been taking care of Caroline and had popped out to the shops when the star had taken her life shortly after she left the property.\nWhen Lou could not regain access to Caroline's home, she called her father Ian, who found her.\nLast month, Lou shared a heartbreaking post about suicide in which she insisted that she did 'her best' to help Caroline amid her mental health struggles.\nAfter setting up an Ask Me Anything on Instagram, a fan wrote to her: 'If someone is intent on suicide, nothing will stop them. You did your best, dont 4get that [sic].'\nReflecting on her experience, Lou responded: 'Suicide has affected my life a lot over the past 10 years. As it does for many many people. If it's not you suffering personally it's someone around you.\n'I am currently working with an amazing charity Body and Soul.\n'Since experiencing and doing my best to care for 2 separate close friends around me attempting suicide numerous times without getting the professional help they need before inevitably seeing it through, I identified that between what our NHS and private health sectors offer and mental health \"helplines\" that raise millions of ££ a month in fundraising, there is quite literally NOTHING that actually works with and helps people who are suicidal.\n'Body and Soul offer a one-of-a-kind 6 month support programme for individuals who attempt suicide and boast a 100% success rate with 0 reattempts from those who have been on their You Are Not Alone course.\n\nThe Love Island presenter (pictured in 2019) was found dead at her home in North East London on February 15, 2020, and her death was ruled a suicide in an inquest in August 2020 \n\nLast month, Lou shared a heartbreaking post about suicide in which she insisted that she did 'her best' to help Caroline amid her mental health struggles \n\n Caroline Flack's friends' bitter feud with her family: Accusations fly over 'blame' for her suicide \n'They also offer free online workshops for people close to those who attempt who are, like me, completely unqualified but on front-line supporting someone going through this. I always say suicide is contagious.\n'One suicide creates enough trauma around those involved there becomes a risk of further suicides without proper support.\n'After researching a lot of different initiatives this is the only one that has stood out to me that has REAL on-the-ground impact with the work they do.\n'Reach out to them if you feel you need some help right now, or give them a follow and donate if you can. [sic]'\nAs well as her post, Lou and her boyfriend Andy made a £1,000 donation to the charity's You Are Not Alone programme.\nThe post came after a close friend of Lou's told the Daily Mail's Katie Hind of the anguish she feels over her fallout with Caroline's mother Christine. \nLast month, the Mail revealed that Christine is central to a new Disney+ documentary about Caroline, which will forensically detail her last 24 hours and try to give some answers as to why she died – and whether her life could have been saved. \nOne of the questions Christine has been desperately seeking answers to is why Lou and fellow friend Mollie Grosberg, left Caroline alone in her flat on the day she took her own life - with the Love Island star having made a previous suicide attempt the day before.\n\nCaroline's mother Christine is central to a new Disney+ documentary about Caroline, which will forensically detail her last 24 hours and try to give some answers as to why she died\n\nDisney confirmed the film would include first hand testimony, among them Caroline's family and friends, as Christine embarks on a journey to uncover the truth\nSince the news of the documentary emerged, a close friend of Lou's told the Mail it is 'devastating' that Christine is allegedly 'blaming' them after Caroline's death.\n'They had been with Caroline for hours and hours and they tried to get her to go to hospital but she wouldn't,' they said.\n'They remained at her flat to make sure she was OK but they couldn't stay there indefinitely, so they went.\n'It is devastating that they now have Caroline's mother blaming them. Christine was once so close to Lou but not any more.\n'Caroline's death has haunted her friends and changed their lives, and there is a view that she should be left to rest in peace.\n'But this documentary is going to drag everything up and, whether it intends to or not, runs the risk of laying blame in certain places.'\nLou has been slowly rebuilding her life in the wake of her best friend's death in February 2020 and has recently started dating footballer Andy. \nAndy and his TOWIE star wife Billi Mucklow, 36, confirmed their divorce in September after secretly separating earlier this year, having been together for 11 years.\nHe then went public with his new relationship with Lou at a Halloween party and Billi was said to have found out shortly before the news was made public. \nCaroline Flack\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCaroline Flack's best friend Lou Teasdale is gifted heartwrenching portrait of the late star for Valentine's Day by her boyfriend Andy Carroll\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nColin Firth's telling five-word response after finding out about beloved Bridget Jones character's fate in new sequel\n\nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nAs Kanye and Bianca head for 'divorce', we reveal the Censori family's chilling theory for why their daughter became a rapper's nude plaything \n\nRenee Zellweger as you've never seen her before!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MARTIN ROBINSON, CHIEF REPORTER \n Published:15:37 GMT, 14 February 2025 |Updated:15:46 GMT, 14 February 2025 \n\nIt wasn't being paraded naked by a husband who claimed 'dominion' over her, Bianca Censori reached her 'limit' when Kanye West's rampant anti-Semitism shamed her.\nKanye and Bianca are allegedly heading for divorce just 11 days after her naked stunt on red carpet where he ordered her drop her fur coat and ‘make a scene’.\nBut it appears that the tipping point was not the unsavoury incident at the Grammys - it was Kanye's decision to go on an anti-Semitic rant on Twitter, saying that he was a Nazi and loved Hitler, that led to him being banned.\nHe also took an advertising slot at the Super Bowl for his clothing line, which was reduced to just one item, a $20 t-shirt carrying the Nazi swastika that also distressed his wife.\nBianca was left so ‘traumatised’ by Kanye's vile anti-Semitic diatribe that she is now refusing to continue shooting their new film. 'She does not align with these views at all,’ an insider said. ‘She is horrified by what he has done'.\nMark Borkowski, arguably Britain's leading PR guru and an expert on the twists and turns in their relationship, told MailOnline: ''Turns out, even the most avant-garde fashion statements have a limit—swastikas. Who knew?\n'Bianca Censori has finally escaped the Yeezy asylum after realising \"dominion\" isn’t a marriage vow. Meanwhile, Kanye remains Kanye: a one-man 3 ring circus'.\nThe Australian-born architect could choose a path of retribution after suffering as part of her husband's 'circus', Mr Borkowski said.\n\nKanye West and Bianca Censori are said to be divorcing just 11 days after her naked stunt on the Grammy Awards red carpet (pictured February 2) \n\nWest remained in the crosshairs of controversy on Tuesday as his Yeezy Website - which he advertised with an expensive ad in Sunday's Super Bowl - was taken offline after he was selling a white shirt with a black swastika in the centre \n\nKanye's disgusting tweet\n\nThe 47-year-old rapper, now known as Ye, filmed a bizarre, close-up video of himself for a Super Bowl ad, telling viewers to visit his online store where he sold his swastika tee \n\nLast week, Censori shocked the world when she attended the Grammys naked under a sheer dress. West then insisted on X he would never force her to wear anything \nThe famously quiet Censori, who has been her husband's muse, is said to have offers of a tell-all book and reality show on the table that would make her millions.\nAnd depending on how bitter the split, perhaps a revenge relationship with a famous ex.\n'Bianca Censori just left the Kanye circus—and her next move could be gold. A tell-all book? A high-fashion comeback? A reality show exposing life inside the Yeezy empire? Or the ultimate revenge move: dating Pete Davidson', Mr Borkowski said.\n'Whatever she does, she’s sitting on a financial and PR jackpot'.\nEarlier this month it was reported that Bianca was left so ‘traumatized’ by Kanye's vile antisemitic diatribe that she is now refusing to continue shooting their new film.\nBianca is playing the lead in a fictional art film, partly shot in Japan and co-created by West, and their creative circle, with a focus on the female body as ‘something to showcase’.\nBut she is reportedly struggling to recover from his repulsive rampage on X which saw him post a slew of anti-Semitic, homophobic and sexist slurs, as well as using his Yeezy website to sell a $20 white T-shirt featuring a swastika.\nThe shocking three-day spree has left the fate of their $25 million film in jeopardy, with two producers on the verge of walking out, DailyMail.com can reveal.\n‘Bianca is deeply traumatised by Ye’s actions, and she does not align with these views at all,’ an insider said. ‘She is horrified by what he has done, as are so many people close to Ye.\n‘She is so put off by this that she is currently refusing to continue shooting.’\nThey said the film is ‘entirely funded’ by the couple.\nCensori, an architecture graduate, had been described as a ‘brilliant actress’ after taking on the lead in the all-female cast.\nWest made mention of the film on X hours after their headline-grabbing red carpet stunt at the Grammys.\n'My wife’s first red carpet opened a whole new world,' wrote the Grammy-winner. 'I keep staring at this photo like I was staring in admiration that night Thinking wow I am so lucky to have a wife that is so smart talented brave and hot.\n'She took a break from shooting her first film to make a movie in real life.'\nBut West renewed his attack on the Jewish community last week, referring to himself as a Nazi, claiming he 'loved Hitler,' and insisting that he will never 'trust or work with Jewish people' again.\n'IM NEVER APOLOGIZING FOR MY JEWISH COMMENTS I CAN SAY WHATEVER THE F**K I WANNA SAY FOREVER WHERES MY F***ING APOLOGY FOR FREEZING MY ACCOUNTS SUCK MY D**K HOWS THAT FOR AN APOLOGY,' he wrote.\nHours later he promoted his ‘greatest performance art piece thus far' – a swastika T-shirt – during the Super Bowl.\nHis Yeezy site was swiftly suspended by its hosts Shopify, with Isla Fisher and David Schwimmer spearheading a growing number of celebrities condemning him.\n\n‘Bianca is deeply traumatised by Ye’s actions, and she does not align with these views at all,’ an insider said. ‘She is horrified by what he has done, as are so many people close to Ye' \n\nEarlier this month it was reported that Bianca was left so ‘traumatized’ by Kanye's vile antisemitic diatribe that she is now refusing to continue shooting their new film\n\nAnd now it is being claimed their marriage is over.\nA source close to the rapper, 47, last night confirmed that the couple have now broken up and that they expect a legal filing to end the marriage in the coming days.\nCensori, 30, is understood to be staying at their $35 million house in Beverly Park North, Los Angeles for now.\nIt’s not known where West is but some believe he may even head back in the coming days to Tokyo, Japan, where he spent much of last year living in a hotel.\nShe appeared plainly unhappy on the red carpet on February 2 when West instructed her to drop her fur coat and ‘make a scene’ but she went along with his instructions.\nFriends of West insisted that the stunt was his idea of ‘art’ and also intended to replicate the cover of his album Vultures 2.\nIn an interview earlier this month. West said that he had been ‘misdiagnosed’ as bipolar and instead was autistic. He added that he believed that he was a former Emperor of Japan – as did Censori.\nWest was previously married to reality TV star and underwear mogul Kim Kardashian and they have four children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm. \n\n Hollywood's tidal wave against 'monster' Kanye West as AI video slams him after anti-Semitic rants \nLast week, Censori shocked the world when she attended the Grammys completely naked under a sheer dress, exposing her breasts and genitals. \nThe stunt made global headlines and many of West's followers were quick to accuse the rapper of being 'abusive' and 'controlling' while using his wife's body 'as clout'. \nAddressing the backlash amid a vile anti-Semitic, sexist and homophobic rant, West claimed that he has 'dominion' over Censori but insisted he would never force her to wear anything she didn't feel comfortable in. \nHe tweeted: 'I HAVE DOMINION OVER MY WIFE THIS AINT NO WOKE AS FEMINIST S**T SHES WITH A BILLIONAIRE WHY WOULD SHE LISTEN TO ANY OF YOU DUMB A** BROKE B*****S.\n'PEOPLE SAY THE RED CARPET LOOK WAS HER DECISION YES I DONT MAKE HER DO NOTHING SHE DOESNT WANT TO BUT SHE DEFINITELY WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT MY APPROVAL YOU STUPID A** WOKE PAWNS.\n'I HAVE NO RESPECT OR EMPATHY FOR ANY ONE LIVING CAUSE NO ONE LIVING CAN F**K WITH ME BUT I DO LOVE SOME PEOPLE AND I GIVE THEM FAVOR. [sic]'\nHe carried on his rant in the early hours, penning: Anyone who called my wife’s Grammy look a stunt is dumb and laaaame yes youuuu.\n'She been dressing naked for 2 years. Now all of a sudden it’s a stunt. Every single b***h on the planet wish they had her bravery body platform and access to money and a husband that supported they personal expression.\n'There are a lot of things that had to converge for this moment to happen.' \nHe later branded the sheer dress the 'best Grammys outfit of all time'. \nSince West married Censori in 2022 fans have expressed concern over her wellbeing, with the Australian architect continuously seen parading around in various states of undress. \n\nCensori, 30, is understood to be staying at their $35 million house in Los Angeles for now. It’s not known where West is but some believe he may head back to Tokyo, Japan \n\nDuring the Grammy Awards, Censori stepped onto the carpet clad in a furry black coat before theatrically dropping the garment and flashing her bare bottom to photographers.\nShe turned around to show off her topless chest and lack of underwear while West - nominated in the Best Rap Song category - leered at her nude body during the incident of indecent exposure.\nWest, who was fully clothed, was seen issuing commands to Censori. \nLip reader, Nicola Hickling went on to state that West said: 'You're making a scene now.'\nShe nodded her head and he told her: 'Make a scene, I'll say it'll make so much sense.' He added: 'Drop it behind you and then turn, I got you.' She then told him: 'Alright, let's go.' \nIn September, West and Censori were said to have split, but later confirmed they were still together in a move branded a 'stunt'. \nInsiders suggested that the stunt was concocted in a desperate bid to distract from claims that West drugged and raped his former assistant Lauren Pisciotta at a party with Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who is currently awaiting trial behind bars for allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering among others, all of which he denies. \n‘Kanye is concerned that his new lawsuit will drag him down to Diddy’s level and he has been speaking to his legal reps,’ the insider told DailyMail.com.\n‘He is paying attention to what is going on with Diddy and some believe that the publicity stunt was a way of overshadowing the details of the harrowing lawsuit.’\nInfluencer and former OnlyFans star Pisciotta sued West in June for allegedly sexually harassing and stalking her while she worked for him between 2021 and 2022.\nHe dismissed the accusations as 'baseless' and accused her of 'blackmail and extortion.'\n\nIn September, West and Censori were said to have split, but later confirmed they were still together. Insiders suggested that the stunt was concocted in a desperate bid to distract from claims that West drugged and raped his former assistant Lauren Pisciotta (pictured) at a party. He has denied the claims\nWest and Censori met when he hired her as an architectural designer at Yeezy, a year before the end of his six-year marriage to Kardashian. \nOne of her former friends alleged in an interview on an Australian radio show that the 24-time Grammy winner 'slid into her DMs.'\nAfter reportedly finding 'her on Instagram,' the friend claimed West asked her to 'come and work' for him. She proceeded to drop out of school to get a jumpstart on her career.\nThe friend stated that Censori was 'not a huge fan' of his music.\nIn 2022, West paid tribute to his new wife by releasing the track, Censori Overload, a play on her last name.\nIn the lyrics he revealed that he stayed celibate before tying the knot, singing: 'And The Bible said, I can't have any more sex 'til marriage.'\nThe song appears to reference his split from Kardashian, opening with the lines: 'Waking up to 'I can't do this anymore' text', adding 'I know it's 'cause the headlines / Why she wanna leave.'\nAt this time, West and Censori were photographed multiple times on lunch dates and holding hands. One date included an outing to the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, where he was staying, at the time.\n\nWest and Censori met when he hired her as an architectural designer at Yeezy, a year before the end of his six-year marriage to Kim Kardashian (pictured in 2023) \n\nOne week after his divorce was finalised, West and Censori had a private ceremony, where they exchanged vows and rings to symbolize their 'commitment together.'\nAt the time, a source told US Weekly: 'Kanye and Bianca did have a small marriage ceremony, friends don’t know if it’s legal, but it’s very real to them.'\nWithin two weeks, she was spotted meeting his eldest daughter, North, at Nobu and later that month, the duo honeymooned at a five-star luxury resort in Utah.\nThe romantic honeymoon took place at the Amangiri, an upscale resort with 34 suites with one four-bedroom Mesa home, located on 600 acres in Utah's Grand Circle of National Parks and Monuments.\nThey enjoyed a 25,000 square foot Aman Spa for treatments based on healing philosophies of the Navajo.\nRoom rates at the five-star resort range from $3,300 up to $6,400; prices for the Mesa home, which is a 5,853 square feet freestanding villa, was not available. The average per night rate for a suite at Amangiri is $5,000.\nThe performer rang in his 46th birthday with Censori and North, and went on to move into a $20,000-a-month apartment in West Hollywood, according to the US Sun.\nAccording to Us Weekly, in June, 'things couldn't' have been 'better' for the couple.\n'Kanye feels like he finally met someone who truly gets him and loves him for the person he is,' the insider added.\nThe source continued: 'Bianca complements Kanye on so many levels and he loves that they can work and collaborate together on projects.' \nAdditionally, he reportedly 'appreciates and respects her opinions.'\n'She really keeps him grounded and he’s feeling better than ever,' the insider concluded.\n\nWest was previously married to reality TV star and underwear mogul Kim Kardashian and they have four children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm \nIn February 2021, West's first wife Kardashian filed for divorce after almost seven years of marriage.\nThe reality TV star filed documents through her lawyer Laura Wasser, but the date of separation was not listed.\nAt the time, People reported that Kardashian was already 'ready to move on' from the divorce drama and a source said that Kim and Kanye's marriage 'has been broken for a long time.'\nThey said: 'Kim feels like she has done everything she can to save it. Filing for divorce is something she has been thinking about for a long time. She has also been dreading it. She really, really has done everything to avoid filing.\n'Last year, she hoped they could somehow work things out, In the past few weeks though, it has been clear that they are done. Although, there is still love, they are just too different and have different visions for the future.'\nKardashian and West started dating in 2012, became engaged in 2013 and wed in May 2014 in Italy after they had already welcomed their eldest daughter North.\nShe appeared to reference their split in the latest episode of The Kardashians during a conversation with her sister Khloe about how drug addiction destroyed her marriage to Lamar Odom. \nKim responded: 'That's the hardest part. I've been there, when you don't foresee something happening that really changes a person's personality.\n'And then they're not the same person and you can't ever get that person back, but you can't live with the new person, you know, like, I get it.'\nShe added in confession, 'It's tougher when you don't want your marriage to end off of like your personal reasons, but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.'\nMilo Yiannopoulos, who previously worked with Kanye on his short-lived presidential campaign, issued a denial purportedly on behalf of Kanye and Bianca, stating that West and Censori were in LA and looking forward to spending Valentine’s Day together. It is unclear whether Milo is their official representative. \nBianca Censori\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe vile anti-Semitic rant that 'spelled the end' for Kanye and Bianca Censori's marriage - after naked Grammys stunt sparked 'coercive control' rumours\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nColin Firth's telling five-word response after finding out about beloved Bridget Jones character's fate in new sequel\n\nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nAs Kanye and Bianca head for 'divorce', we reveal the Censori family's chilling theory for why their daughter became a rapper's nude plaything \n\nWhat Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as model 'divorces' her ex Kanye West - and her cryptic 'marriage ending' comment\n\nLove is in the air: 10 top brands to help you celebrate Valentine's Day in style this year, from roses to jewellery\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, reveals he's engaged to girlfriend Vanessa Brown, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nInside Belle Gibson's warped mind after Netflix's Apple Cider Vinegar made her a 'star': Who she STILL blames for her downfall, her hope for the future \n\nRenee Zellweger as you've never seen her before!

E-mail tom.lawrence@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM LAWRENCE \n Published:15:30 GMT, 14 February 2025 |Updated:15:36 GMT, 14 February 2025 \n\nA grandmother's 13-year battle to remove five large telecom boxes from outside her Carribbean restaurant has been discussed in Parliament.\nDebbie Monfries, 64, says the boxes have 'ruined' passing trade at Umana Yana in Herne Hill, south London.\nSome of the boxes are 6ft tall, which she says has meant potential customers cannot see her restaurant.\nThe boxes were installed in 2012 and Mrs Monfries says they have caused a devastating impact to her business and her health.\nUnder government rules, telecom companies can install their boxes without planning permission from councils. \nMrs Monfries has believes the boxes were installed by Virgin, which is said to own three of them, subletting another three to O2 and Vodafone. \nShe has spent several years complaining to Southwark Council in the hopes that they would be removed and said she has suffered because of the stress - leading to her suffering a heart attack in 2020.\nLast year she was told the boxes would be staying, leaving her fearing she may have to close her business.\n\nThe boxes were installed in 2012 and immediately impacted her revenue, Mrs Monfries said\n\nDebbie Monfries and her husband Junior are the owners of Guyanese restaurant Umana Yana\nBut on Wednesday, February 12, Dulwich and West Norwood MP Helen Hayes brought a petition calling for the removal of the boxes to the House of Commons - sparking fresh hope. \nMs Hayes said: 'The petition is in support of a restaurant called Umana Yana in Herne Hill, in my constituency.\n'It is a wonderful restaurant run by Deborah Monfries and her family, who are in the Public Gallery today.\n'Deborah's restaurant serves delicious Guyanese food and I would commend it to all Members in the House.\n'However, it has suffered a detriment in recent years as a consequence of the installation of enormous telecommunications cabinets that obscure the view of the restaurant for passing customers.\n'The petitioners therefore urge the government to bring forward legislation to ensure small businesses are not blocked from view by telecommunications equipment, to ensure the removal of equipment affecting small businesses like Umana Yana, and to ensure that businesses are duly compensated by the telecoms companies for disruption.'\nShe added that the petition had been signed by more than 1,700 locals. \nMrs Monfries, from Croydon, is hopeful that the petition may finally bring about a change. \nOver the years the grandmother-of-six has received significant support, including from famous faces such as rapper Central Cee. \nShe said: 'I am so happy we got the petition to Parliament because this injustice has been going on for 13 years.\n\nUnder government rules, telecom companies can install their boxes without planning permission from councils\n\nDebbie Monfries, from Croydon, said her health has suffered because of the stress - leading to her suffering a heart attack in 2020\n'I tried taking it to court on numerous occasions but from experience, no solicitors were brave enough to challenge these telecommunication companies.\n'I hope now that justice will finally prevail.\n'It is not fair I put my lifelong ambition and every penny we had to open this business, just for the telecommunication companies to write it off as if it does not matter.\n'It is so unjust that these big giants do not have any conscience or consideration for small businesses.'\nDebbie, from Croydon, says her health has suffered over the past decade because of the stress of the situation.\nShe said previously: 'Before the boxes were installed, our annual revenue was between £70,000 and £80,000. After they were put there, it dropped to around £30,000.\n'This was almost immediate. There was a clear link.\n'The boxes block the restaurant from view. We used to depend on passing trade, but now, no potential customers can see the restaurant.\n\nThe grandmother-of-six has received plenty of support - including from famous faces such as rapper Central Cee\n'We've never been able to recover from it. It's been so stressful.\n'In 2020, things got tough. I couldn't afford rising bills - and the boxes were ruining business. I had a heart attack.\n'It was really, really hard. It's emotional to think about.' \nEver since the boxes were first put outside Umana Yana, Debbie has been fighting to get them removed.\nShe has launched petitions, contacted politicians, and even presented her case at the Council Assembly, but Southwark Council only gave her a definite answer on October 8 - 12 years after the boxes first appeared.\nSouthwark Council said they had been trying to facilitate a resolution for 'a number of years' - but claimed that under government rules, telecom companies can install their boxes without planning permission from councils.\nAt a planning committee meeting, a council officer admitted that it was the 'worse case' he'd ever seen, Southwark News reported.\nBut when asked if the council would be removing them, he said 'no', claiming they had been installed 'lawfully'.\n\n A petition to try and stop the boxes outside her restaurant received 1,700 petitions\n\nHer local MP has now taken the issue to the Houses of Parliament following the petition \nMrs Monfries expressed her appreciation for local residents - who have shown her huge support. \n She said: 'The customers who know about me support me and love the restaurant.\n'I was born in Guyana and so I cook authentic Guyanese food. When I started, I was filling a gap in the London market. I just hope I can continue to do so.'\nThe government now has two months to consider the petition for Umana Yana.\nCommenting on the situation previously, Cllr Helen Dennis, Cabinet Member for New Homes & Sustainable Development at Southwark Council, said: 'We have been in support of the Umana Yana campaign - trying to facilitate a resolution with the telecom companies over a number of years whereby they remove their boxes.\n'Under government rules, telecom companies can install their boxes without planning permission from councils.\n'Since trying to help facilitate between all parties, we have always been clear that the boxes were lawfully installed and we join others in calling for councils to be given more power to act in these situations.\n'Different routes we have explored over the years have included looking into a meditator and advertising Umana Yana on the boxes with the telecom companies' consent.\n'We have every sympathy for Umana Yana's owner, which is why we put forward an Article 4 motion.\n'This requires telecom companies to ask us for planning permission to install their boxes, masts, and similar structures at this location, including any replacements.'\nVirgin has been contacted for comment. \nLondonO2Vodafone\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGrandmother's 13-year fight over giant telecom boxes ruining her restaurant reaches Parliament as MPs are urged to crack down on street clutter\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nColin Firth's telling five-word response after finding out about beloved Bridget Jones character's fate in new sequel\n\nSelena Gomez poses TOPLESS with fiancé Benny Blanco as they talk love and being engaged for first joint interview\n\nAs Kanye and Bianca head for 'divorce', we reveal the Censori family's chilling theory for why their daughter became a rapper's nude plaything \n\nWhat Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as model 'divorces' her ex Kanye West - and her cryptic 'marriage ending' comment\n\nLove is in the air: 10 top brands to help you celebrate Valentine's Day in style this year, from roses to jewellery\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, reveals he's engaged to girlfriend Vanessa Brown, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nInside Belle Gibson's warped mind after Netflix's Apple Cider Vinegar made her a 'star': Who she STILL blames for her downfall, her hope for the future \n\nRenee Zellweger as you've never seen her before!

'They were walking through the park, reminiscing about Elf, when Ben suddenly proposed.\n'It was so heartfelt — happy tears, laughter, and, of course, an immediate 'yes!'\nThe couple were said to have celebrated afterwards with champagne at The Plaza Hotel and are already planning a small, intimate wedding for later this year. \nThe proposal comes after a whirlwind one-month-long romance which saw MailOnline exclusively reveal the news of their relationship.\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, has revealed he's engaged to his new girlfriend Vanessa Brown, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nThe couple were said to have celebrated afterwards with champagne at The Plaza Hotel and are already planning a small, intimate wedding for later this year \n\nBen's new relationship comes almost two years following the breakdown of his long-term romance with Vanessa Feltz (pictured in 2021), who was left distraught after discovering the singer had been unfaithful\nBen met aesthetics expert Vanessa, who's from Carlisle, last April at an awards ceremony where he performed with group Boyz on Block and she later asked him to appear on her podcast The Late Late Aesthetics Show. \nBut the couple didn't connect romantically until Ben's relationship with ex-girlfriend Precious Muir ended in November over them wanting different things for the future. \nSources close to Ben, who was with This Morning agony aunt Vanessa Feltz, 62, for 16 years until they separated in 2023 over his infidelities, say he's calling his new girlfriend 'Vanessa 2.0'.\nAn insider revealed to MailOnline: 'Ben is smitten with Vanessa, he's really hoping she's The One after multiple failed romances… he wants someone to build a future with.' \n'The couple have spent the beginning of the year on holiday together in Dubai, which has been incredibly romantic,' they continued.\n'Vanessa is everything Ben's been looking for, she's ambitious and driven, he is definitely attracted to her focus and how she's furthering herself in business.\n'His split from Vanessa Feltz haunted him for years so some people may question how he's happy to date another woman with the same name, but his new Vanessa marks the start of an exciting chapter.'\nBen and Vanessa are currently enjoying their first holiday together, staying at hotel NH Collection Dubai The Palm, where they met with Another Level singer Dane Bowers for a night out this weekend. \n\nBen met aesthetics expert Vanessa last April at an awards ceremony where he performed with group Boyz on Block and she later asked him to appear on her podcast\n\nMailOnline revealed that Ben and ex-girlfriend Precious had parted ways in November following a year together over the former model's hesitation to start a family.\nPrecious, 40, said at the time: 'Ben needs a partner who can settle down right now and have children sooner rather than later. \n'Due to our age difference, for me, I would like to wait a bit longer, perhaps within five years' time, who knows.'\nBen's new relationship comes almost two years following the breakdown of his long-term romance with broadcaster Vanessa, who was left distraught after discovering the singer had been unfaithful.\nVanessa told of how she threw herself out of a moving taxi the moment Ben confessed to the infidelity because she couldn't bear to hear another word. \nIn an interview, she said: 'My coat was torn. Blood was seeping from a cut on my arm. I assumed he would stop the cab and follow to see if I'd survived the leap. He didn't.' \nAfter their break-up, Ben spoke to MailOnline about how he felt the author had no interest in making their relationship official, alleging their 10-year age gap 'bred insecurity'.\n\nBut the couple didn't connect romantically until Ben's relationship with ex-girlfriend Precious Muir ended in November over them wanting different things (pictured January 2024)\nIn February last year, Ben said: 'I gave myself to someone for a quarter of my life and ultimately I got nothing from it… it's absolutely heartbreaking.\n'I met Vanessa when I was 34 and I lived 17 years in her life and it was all what she wanted.' \nThe former couple were engaged to marry but Ben alleged he felt Vanessa, who appeared on E4's Celebs Go Dating following their separation, only stayed with him to make her feel younger.\nHe explained: 'I was so in love but I felt like I was being strung along and she just wanted a bit of arm candy, whereas I wanted marriage and kids and real love.\n'For her, I felt I was just a convenience. I was a cooler, younger guy that gave her a youthful appearance.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, reveals he's engaged to new girlfriend, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nWhat Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as model 'divorces' her ex Kanye West - and her cryptic 'marriage ending' comment\n\nBREAKING NEWS\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu, 52, reveals he's engaged to girlfriend Vanessa Brown, 29, after a MONTH of dating\n\nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to tweet defending Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown\n\nAs Kanye and Bianca head for 'divorce', we reveal the Censori family's chilling theory for why their daughter became a rapper's nude plaything \n\nMaura Higgins and Pete Wicks SPLIT after calling time on their private romance following series of rows\n\nLove is in the air: 10 top brands to help you celebrate Valentine's Day in style this year, from roses to jewellery\n\nKylie Jenner flashes her abs in Georgia as she surprises her 'amazing' fans with autographs and selfies\n\nInside Belle Gibson's warped mind after Netflix's Apple Cider Vinegar made her a 'star': Who she STILL blames for her downfall, her hope for the future \n\nEthan Slater gushes he is 'unendingly proud' of his 'incredible' girlfriend Ariana Grande after landing her first Oscar nomination for Wicked\n\nCalling all foodies!

I spoke to Simon, obviously it was a private conversation, but he usually contains his emotions, he's quite stoic isn't he, but he was absolutely gone.\n'Just holding the phone, he was just sobbing. It's the first time in my life I thought 'well we normally come to you when we don't know what to do,' but he was absolutely devastated.\n'They were like his babies. He went on this journey with them, he was part of it - he was almost the sixth member.'\nSinitta said that fan criticism over Simon's involvement in Liam's troubled life has been 'unfair'.\n\nSimon Cowell 'cried uncontrollably' when Liam Payne died as his best friend says he wasn't to blame for One Direction star's death because 'he was a grown man and you can't bubble wrap everyone' (Pictured: Simon Cowell and Liam Payne)\n\nPictured left to right: Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Simon Cowell, Harry Styles, and Zayn Malik on set during One Direction celebrates 1D Day at YouTube Space LA in 2013\nShe said that while people have said Simon should have done more to help, he wasn't to blame for Liam's untimely death, saying: 'Liam was a grown man' and 'you can't bubble wrap everyone.' \nSimon met Liam when he auditioned for X Factor for the very first time at the age of 14. \nAnd upon learning of his death, Simon released a touching tribute to the 'kind, funny and talented', pop star, who 'never forgot the fans'. \nHe wrote: 'You never really know how you feel about someone until a moment like this happens.\n'Liam, I am truly devastated. Heartbroken. And I feel empty. And I want you to know how much love and respect I have for you. Every tear I have shed is a memory of you.\n'This is so difficult to put in words right now. I went outside today, and I thought about so many times we had together. \n'I wanted to let you know what I would always say to the thousands of people who would always ask me. \n'What is Liam like? And I would tell them you were kind, funny, sweet, thoughtful, talented, humble, focused. And how much you loved music. And how much love you genuinely had for the fans.\n'I had to tell you when you were 14 that this wasn't your time. And we both made a promise that we would meet again. \n\nSinitta said: 'He was absolutely devastated. I spoke to Simon, obviously it was a private conversation, but he usually contains his emotions, he's quite stoic isn't he, but he was absolutely gone'\n\nShe added: 'They were like his babies. He went on this journey with them, he was part of it - he was almost the sixth member' (Simon pictured with partner Lauren Silverman at Liam's funeral)\n\nSimon rleased a touching tribute to Liam on Instagram after ehe died describing him as 'kind, funny and talented\n\n'A lot of people would have given up. You didn't. You came back and within months the whole world knew Liam. \n'And you never forgot the fans. I watched you spending so much time with people who had wanted to meet you. You really cared.\n'You came to see me last year. Not for a meeting. Just to sit and talk. And we reminisced about all of the fun times we had together. \n'And how proud you were to be a Dad. After you left, I was reminded that you were still the sweet, kind boy I met all of those years ago.\nHe continued: 'I have met your son, Bear.

The Daily Show host argued this during the latest episode of his podcast The Weekly Show. It came up during a discussion with guest Jen Psaki, a former press secretary for President Joe Biden who now has her own MSNBC show. Their conversion centered on the intersection between media and politics. \n\nStewart spoke about the aggressive lengths Fox News executives went to help get President Donald Trump back in office. Where the right succeeded is in his eyes where the left failed in efforts to get Kamala Harris elected. “This is absolutely corrupt, but this is how the f—ing world works,” were strong words laid down by Stewart, who acknowledged Fox News’ success and influence. \n\n“They’ve certainly created a machine, and nobody is building that machine [on the left] as far as I can tell,’ Stewart said of the difference between the two networks. Stewart used the opportunity of having someone on the MSNBC payroll to gain insight on the inner-workings at the news organization. He asked if the people there come to her to provide their opinion on what they think is “important to preserve and fight for.” \n\nPsaki revealed the hosts determine “here’s what I’m going to cover today, and here’s what I’m going to talk about, and here’s what I think is important.” She continued, ‘There is an independence-ish of that, and…you’re not waiting to be told what to say about anything. You’re going to say what you think.”\n\nShe then turned the tables on him asking Stewart what MSNBC should do as they find their footing in this new MAGA administration. The opinionated host called for a more cohesive message among the programming. \n\nThe two did come together when Fox News under the late Roger Ailes emerged a mouthpiece for the Republican party. That said, Stewart made sure to clarify he didn’t think MSNBC should be that for the Democratic Party. He explained, “it should be a check on the excesses. It should be muckraking in the best sense of the word. But effective muckraking needs organization and a leader. And it can’t just be left to everybody’s random show.”\n\nStewart did not hold back and went in with a criticism where he found the shows “wildly redundant and to not really have a macro view.” He added, ‘I think it can stand for something more coherent and be more effective in its execution of that by doing so.’ He found the only way to turn the tide for the “progressive” is to better organize their think tanks and media apparatus. \n\nPsaki began hosting Inside with Jen Psaki in March 2023. She has also served as a contributor for CNN for a few years prior. Along with Biden, Psaki worked under President Barack Obama. \n\nWhat did you think of Stewart’s thoughts on MSNBC?

He remains a good man, a devoted father, & a loving husband. \n\nSocial meda users were left shocked on Friday when a tweet that seemed to be from Bianca Censori defended Kanye West following his vile anti-Semitic meltdown \n\nHowever, it was not all as it seemed as the X account the 'statement' came from is fake and does not belong to the Aussie architect - despite being verified with a blue tick \nIt continued: 'Everyone has their flaws, & he is no exception. Pple should allow him space to breathe. \n'After all, he is only using words, & while his words may sometimes raise concern due to his status, words alone do not define a person's heart, especially for a rap artist. Respectfully #GodBlessIsrael #GodBlessTheGoodJewishPeople.'\nThe X account with the username @bianca_censori, features a photo of Bianca as the profile picture and one of Bianca and Kanye as the cover image.\nThe bio reads: 'Designer at Yeezy. A perspective from inside the world of Bianca Censori for discussions only. Thoughts inspired by Bianca Censori. Don't sue me.'\nAs of Friday, it had a whopping 56,000 followers and racks up hundreds of likes on each post.\nAnother of the fake tweets, which was posted on Thursday, reads: 'My Ye has undoubtedly been one of the most polarizing figures in modern culture. \n'He is an artistic genius with undeniable influence, but his public statements have often sparked controversy. \n'People react strongly to his words, sometimes with reason, but the way social media dehumanizes him is excessive. \n'He has always had his reasons for any outbursts, & while I wish I could explain, I do not have the authorization to do so. Perhaps one day, he will choose to share that information himself.'\n\nThe tweet, which quickly picked up traction online, read: 'It's truly saddening to see how people insult & dehumanize my Ye across social media'\n\nThe bio reads: 'Designer at Yeezy. A perspective from inside the world of Bianca Censori for discussions only. Thoughts inspired by Bianca Censori. Don't sue me'\n\nAnother of the fake tweets, which was posted on Thursday, reads: 'My Ye has undoubtedly been one of the most polarizing figures in modern culture'\n\n What Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as she and Kanye West split \nThe account appearing to belong to Kanye's wife also shocked fans after it shared a photo of the two and a prayer asking God to 'protect' the rapper and 'lead him toward understanding & respect for all people' earlier this week. \nBut a representative for Bianca, 30, told The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday night that the account on X (formerly Twitter) was a fake and 'does not belong to Ye's wife.'\n'We have reached out to X to get the account unverified and/or banned,' the representative added. \nThe fake X post attributed to @bianca_censori featured a photo of the Australian architect–turned–provocateur sitting on a wooden counter or desk while wearing a busty black semi-sheer dress with spaghetti straps, as well as white flip flops.\nShe was perched just over West's shoulder as he snapped a mirror selfie across the room while wearing a black T-shirt and matching pants, which he appeared to be grabbing around his crotch area.\nSo-called 'blue checkmarks' on the site formerly known as Twitter were once given to celebrities and high-profile people to verify their identities and help prevent online impersonation, but after the site was bought by Elon Musk — who later renamed it X — the verification badges were turned into a money-making scheme in which users could acquire them by paying for a premium subscription. \nA yellow badge to denote celebrities was later instituted on the Musk-owned site, but the ease of getting a blue badge and the number of prominent figures who are no longer verified has made it particularly easy for accounts to impersonate celebrities, although the action is still technically barred by the platform. \nIt follows the news that Kanye and Bianca are allegedly heading for divorce just 11 days after her naked stunt on the Grammys red carpet.\nIt's thought that they have verbally agreed that she will get a payment of $5 million following the short marriage, which began in December 2022.\nA source close to the rapper, 47, confirmed that the couple have now broken up and that they expect a legal filing to end the marriage in the coming days.\n\nBut a representative for Bianca, 30, told The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday night that the account on X (formerly Twitter) was a fake and 'does not belong to Ye's wife' \n\nThe account appearing to belong to Kanye's wife also shocked fans after it shared a photo of the two and a prayer asking God to 'protect' the rapper \n\nWhile some X users have pointed out the account is fake, others have been fooled into believing it's real and replying to 'Bianca's statement'\nBianca is understood to be staying at their $35 million house in Beverly Park North, Los Angeles for now.\nIt's not known where Kanye is but some believe he may even head back in the coming days to Tokyo, Japan, where he spent much of last year living in a hotel. \nMilo Yiannopoulos, who previously worked with Kanye on his short-lived presidential campaign, issued a denial purportedly on behalf of the couple, stating that West and Censori were in LA and looking forward to spending Valentine's Day together. It is unclear whether Milo is their official representative. \nBianca appeared plainly unhappy on the red carpet on February 2 when Kanye instructed her to drop her fur coat and 'make a scene' but she went along with his instructions. \nFriends of Kanye insisted that the stunt was his idea of 'art' and also intended to replicate the cover of his album Vultures 2. \nThe following day he wrote on X: 'My wife's first red carpet opened a whole new world. I keep staring at this photo like I was staring in admiration that night Thinking wow I am so lucky to have a wife that is so smart talented brave and hot.'\nHe went on: 'She took a break from shooting her first film to make a movie in real life We Tailored that invisible dress 6 times And just like magic poof we disappeared.'\nIn the days following the Grammys, Kanye went on an anti-Semitic rant on Twitter, saying that he was a Nazi and loved Hitler.\n\nIn the days following the Grammys, Kanye went on an anti-Semitic rant on Twitter, saying that he was a Nazi and loved Hitler \n\nHe also took an advertising slot at the Super Bowl for his clothing line, which was reduced to just one item, a $20 t-shirt carrying the Nazi swastika. The site was closed down by Shopify within 24 hours.\nHe was also banned from X, formerly Twitter, but returned to the site on Thursday having deleted much of his offensive comment. He said that his rants had been a 'social experiment.'\nHe stated: 'So funny how N****** rapping about killing N****** is not hate but posting a swastika is hate.'\nHis actions have prompted outrage in Hollywood, with Australian actress Isla Fisher and Friends icon David Schwimmer being among those to publicly condemn him.\nIn an interview earlier this month Kanye said that he had been 'misdiagnosed' as bipolar and instead was autistic. He added that he believed that he was a former Emperor of Japan – as did Bianca.\nWest was previously married to reality TV star and underwear mogul Kim Kardashian and they have four children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.\nBianca CensoriKanye West\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNew 'Bianca Censori' statement is not as it seems: Confused social media users react to lengthy tweet about Kanye West\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nWhat Kim Kardashian REALLY thinks about Bianca Censori as model 'divorces' her ex Kanye West - and her cryptic 'marriage ending' comment\n\nMaura Higgins and Pete Wicks SPLIT after calling time on their private romance following series of rows\n\nEleanor Tomlinson gives birth!

A federal spending spree diminished the purchasing power of the dollar and sent prices higher, inducing sticker shock among Americans that influenced their choices on Election Day. Now we're seeing indications that inflation is back, and the new administration will have to live up to promises to bring the cost of living under control.\n\nPrices Rise Faster Than Expected\n\nThis week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in higher than expected. \"The all items index rose 3.0 percent for the 12 months ending January, after rising 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending December,\" according to the press release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWriting for The New York Times, Jeanna Smialek noted that inflation \"showed worrying staying power after volatile food and fuel costs were stripped out — a reminder that bringing price increases under control remains a fraught, bumpy process.\"\n\nA day later, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which is considered a predictor of future prices for consumers, also showed bigger increases than anticipated. \"On an unadjusted basis, the index for final demand moved up 3.5 percent for the 12 months ended January 2025,\" according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"Another U.S. inflation reading came in stronger than expected,\" commented The Wall Street Journal. \"Wholesale prices rose by 0.4% in January, and the December reading was revised up.\"\n\nAdding to the sting is that last month's inflation numbers had already delivered bad news. The numbers aren't terrible—certainly not by comparison to the official 9.1 percent inflation rate in June 2022 during the recent surge in prices as the value of the dollar fell. But nobody wants to see their paychecks fall behind rising prices. That was a problem for the Biden administration and contributed to Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump.\n\n\"In surveys prior to the election, inflation was typically the most commonly cited concern on voters' minds,\" Johns Hopkins University economist David A. Steinberg commented after the election. \"Most voters also thought Trump would do a better job than Harris at bringing prices down.\"\n\n\"Bringing prices down\" is a tall order once the value of money has eroded. Trump himself admitted in December of grocery prices that \"it's hard to bring things down once they're up.\" But the new president undoubtedly wants to avoid the discontent rising prices bred under his predecessor, especially since his promise to address inflation was an important part of his appeal. In terms of at least not making things worse, he's off to a decent start with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and efforts to shrink the size and expense of government. Because that's where things went terribly wrong from 2021–2023.\n\nGovernment Spending at the Root of the Problem\n\n\"Inflation comes when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply,\" economist John Cochrane of the Hoover Institution and the Cato Institute wrote in a March 2024 piece for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"The source of demand is not hard to find: in response to the pandemic's dislocations, the US government sent about $5 trillion in checks to people and businesses, $3 trillion of it newly printed money, with no plans for repayment.\"\n\nThat Trump may have some hard choices to make is clear from the fact that the trillions in federal spending began on his watch, when COVID-19 erupted while he was in the White House during his first term. President Joe Biden carried that forward with his own spending spree. Back in office, Trump must deal with the consequences of government fiscal irresponsibility in which he played a role.\n\nThe DOGE and its cuts are a step in the right direction. A federal apparatus that's not dumping trillions of dollars on the world won't fuel worse inflation. Unfortunately, except for the proposal to eliminate the Department of Education, efforts so far at reducing government expense largely nibble around the edges. And even the Department of Education represents only 3-4 percent of federal outlays.\n\n\"The primary problem is entitlement spending and interest payments on the debt,\" Veronique de Rugy wrote this week for Reason. \"Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid already make up most federal expenditures and drive nearly all projected future deficits.\"\n\nEntitlements make up about 50 percent of federal spending. Defense spending and \"income security\" are another 13 percent each, with interest on the debt at 11 percent. Unless you address the big-ticket items, the government isn't getting much smaller or less expensive.\n\nCall Off the Trade War\n\nAdding to the problem is President Trump's affection for tariffs. An economic nationalist, he wants to encourage domestic manufacturing by raising high barriers to imports. That's a guarantee of higher prices for consumers purchasing heavily taxed imports or domestic goods shielded from foreign competition.\n\nTrump in his first term and Biden during his four years embraced protectionism. Erica York of the Tax Foundation warns that \"Trump-Biden tariffs have raised prices and reduced output and employment.\"\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston forecast \"an additional 25 percent tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico combined with an additional 10 percent tariff on goods from China could add as much as 0.8 percentage point to core (excluding food and energy) inflation.\" Broader tariffs would further hike prices.\n\n\"The resurgence of inflation in 1979 is usually attributed not to the Fed directly stoking the fire, but to 'supply shocks,\" economist John Cochrane, who penned last year's piece for the IMF, commented this week about inflation. \"We may be in for adverse supply shocks from trade.\"\n\nCochrane is also critical of the Federal Reserve for being insufficiently aggressive, as he sees it, in raising interest rates after the federal government fueled inflation by dumping new dollars on the economy. But he holds out hope that the new administration's enthusiasm for deregulation, energy production, and artificial intelligence may offset some of the price pressure of trade barriers.\n\nSo, what should Trump do to prevent inflation from returning as a problem? He should step up his efforts to slash the government and go after the giants of federal spending. He should also abandon his threats of renewed trade war. Maybe then he can keep his promise to bring prices under control.","summary":"Cutting government spending and calling off the trade war would be steps in the right direction.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/14/trump-may-have-to-grapple-with-returning-inflation/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/dreamstime_l_19395018-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 12:00:12","author":"J.D.

Boaler champions a reformist approach to teaching maths, arguing that strategies that emphasise reasoning over memorisation lead to more equitable outcomes. When she first moved to the US from Britain in the late 1990s, she was warned that her research would anger defenders of traditional methods. Backlash from some colleagues – including accusations of “scientific misconduct” that the university dismissed – grew so personal that she briefly moved back to the UK.\n\nBack at Stanford two decades later, Boaler was tapped in 2019 by the California department of education with four other scholars to rewrite the state’s mathematics pedagogical framework, a non-binding guide seeking to help educators improve outcomes “for all students”.\n\nThat made Boaler a target once again. This time, the debate moved beyond the so-called “math wars” to become another battle in a newer conservative-led war over diversity and inclusion. Because her research focused on outcomes for students of all demographics and backgrounds, Boaler’s critics branded her as “woke” and attempted to delegitimise her work. Tucker Carlson, Ted Cruz and Elon Musk came after her. Opponents of her research sought to ruin her career, she says.\n\nThe campaign against her harmed her reputation and took a personal toll. “The physical threats to my family were obviously the worst aspects, but erroneous and unfounded attacks on my work are physically and mentally draining,” she said.\n\nBut the campaign against Boaler was hardly an isolated incident. Instead, it followed a well-tested playbook, which, since the 2024 resignation of the former Harvard president Claudine Gay over plagiarism accusations, has been increasingly wielded against women, scholars of color and others perceived by the right as progressive.\n\n“Most institutions, and even most individual scholars, aren’t fully aware of what’s been happening,” said Rebekah Tromble, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. “And how this is ratcheting up and what could come for them.”\n\nRufo’s playbook\n\nRecent, organised attacks against scholars have often involved accusations of academic misconduct published in rightwing media, social media campaigns to make the allegations go viral and pressure on universities to disown their faculty. These kinds of campaigns have been pioneered by Christopher Rufo, a conservative operative who first made a name for himself as a crusader against “critical race theory”, an academic approach examining the role of systemic racism in society.\n\nRufo first surfaced the plagiarism allegations against Gay just six months after she made history as Harvard’s first Black president, and shortly after she came under fire during highly charged congressional hearings on accusations of campus antisemitism. He called the campaign to force her out of her job a “successful strategy” and “team effort”.\n\nWhile he gleefully took credit for Gay’s demise – when she quit, he posted the news with a comment, “scalped” – Rufo spoke of the campaign against her as a model he hoped others would emulate. It involved, he said, “varying degrees of coordination and communication” with media figures, conservative donors and politicians. (He was not involved in the campaign against Boaler.) “I’ve run the same playbook on critical race theory, on gender ideology, on DEI bureaucracy,” he told Politico magazine. “This is a universal strategy that can be applied by the right to most issues.”\n\nRufo’s comments following Gay’s resignation were a candid acknowledgement of a growing phenomenon scholars have increasingly warned about, involving sustained campaigns by conservative activists seeking to undermine the legitimacy of higher learning institutions they view as the root of “woke”, or liberal, politics. It’s a movement that has been embraced by many in the Republican party, including Donald Trump, who has made diversity and equity initiatives a primary target and who has promised to end “the scourge of DEI”.\n\nRufo declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about these campaigns or his role in them.\n\n“Scholars have been screaming from the rooftops: ‘This is a playbook,’” said Tromble.\n\nAlarmed by the growing trend, in September she launched the Researcher Support Consortium, an online tool for scholars facing harassment or intimidation that seeks to fill the gap left by academic institutions, which she says have been slow to address the problem.\n\nSince publishing the toolkit, Tromble has heard from “hundreds of scholars from across more than a dozen disciplines who have either experienced harassment or know colleagues who have,” she said. Since Trump came into office, she says she personally spoke with “over 200 scholars, administrators, and representatives from scholarly associations”, she added. “Outreach has skyrocketed.”\n\nThose coming under attack are often surprised to learn that their own experiences follow a tried mechanism and come at a high professional and personal cost. In some cases, scholars have been forced to scrap their public profiles or seek police protection.\n\n‘Weaponising’ plagiarism accusations\n\nIsaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College, documents rightwing efforts to undermine higher education. Both he and Tromble noted that while earlier campaigns came in response to statements made in class or online, they now are increasingly aimed directly at scholars’ work, including through accusations of plagiarism or other research misconduct.\n\n“That general narrative about higher education being hostile to conservatives, being overly woke, that field had already been plowed,” Kamola added. “But Chris Rufo really just poured gasoline on that fire, and turned it into a terrain of real political success that the right, donors, rightwing activists, and thinktanks like the Heritage Foundation and Manhattan Institute can really double down on.”\n\nThe Manhattan Institute, where Rufo is a senior fellow, has published several stories accusing faculty of plagiarism. (Rufo was formerly a fellow at Heritage, the thinktank behind the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint.) One of the stories he wrote for City Journal, the institute’s magazine, shows paragraphs of a scholar’s work apparently marked up by plagiarism detection software. In another, he writes openly about having “tasked my researchers with investigating potential plagiarism by Harvard scholars”.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign Rufo also accused Kamala Harris of plagiarising passages of a book she wrote in 2009 – with Harris’s campaign responding that the accusations were the work of rightwing operatives “getting desperate”.\n\nBut Rufo is not alone, Kamola noted: the Washington Free Beacon, another rightwing publication and the first outlet to publish misconduct allegations against Boaler, has dedicated an entire section to stories about “plagiarism”. Most of those articles are about Black scholars, while others are about deans working on DEI programmes; another is about a white scholar whose work focuses on racism. In the three months following Gay’s resignation, at least seven other scholars faced similar accusations, the education publication Inside Higher Ed reported last year. Six of them were Black, and three were Black women at Harvard. (The Harvard Crimson, the university’s student paper, called the attacks a “witch hunt” against Harvard’s Black faculty.)\n\nRufo’s own articles for City Journal also disproportionately target faculty of color, though Rufo has denied targeting Black women and said that he investigated scholars of “all racial groups” and that the results point to a “ponderance of plagiarism by academics who specialized in ‘diversity’”. The Guardian reached out to a range of professors from different backgrounds for this story; most did not agree to speak on the record.\n\nGay’s resignation prompted much debate about plagiarism – with one scholar Gay was accused of copying from dismissing the conduct as “trivial” and others noting that there is little consensus about what constitutes plagiarism.\n\nBecause plagiarism is not “cut-and-dry”, it should be investigated and adjudicated by committees, Kamola said.\n\n“The Washington Free Beacon and Rufo instead want to litigate these issues in the court of public opinion,” he said. “And then, of course, when one set of political interests builds an infrastructure to weaponise plagiarism accusations, the result is that only certain people are subject to these investigations.”\n\n‘A political attack’\n\nAs the campaign against Boaler, the Stanford professor, picked up, Tucker Carlson in 2021 accused her of “infusing social justice into math”. Opponents of her equity-focused approach called on academic journals to retract her publications, edited her Wikipedia page, and lobbied conference organisers and grant funders to distance themselves from her work. The attacks against Boaler grew so intense that she had to change her phone number, while campus police started surveilling her home.\n\nThen last March, someone filed an anonymous, 100-page complaint with Stanford accusing Boaler of 52 instances of “citation misrepresentation”. “Our contention is that Dr Boaler has misrepresented the findings and/or methods of a number of reference papers,” the complainants wrote. “For her to erroneously represent that these papers support claims made in her work, when they do not, is a reckless disregard for accuracy.”\n\nA story about the allegations published by the Washington Free Beacon was picked up by other publications, and shared widely on social media, including by high-profile figures such as Ted Cruz and Elon Musk, who wrote that she “undermined math education in California”.\n\nWhile Boaler has the support of some within Stanford’s administration, the university still launched an investigation. They closed it in April, with a spokesperson saying: “The University has reviewed the matter and has concluded that no formal process is needed, and that the allegations reflect scholarly disagreement and interpretation.”\n\nWhile Stanford cleared her, Boaler said the experience was “awful”, isolating and intended to intimidate her out of pursuing her work.\n\n“They’re literally trying to block research evidence from going out,” she said of those attacking her work and that of other scholars. “And it seems to me that the academic community isn’t coming together around this, and protecting its independence.”\n\nSitting ducks\n\nTromble, of the Researcher Support Consortium, noted that while some university administrations have publicly defended their faculty, others have caved to outside pressure. She points to Stanford’s closure of a research observatory focused on misinformation that had come under attack from Republicans. (Stanford disputed that the observatory was being dismantled, saying that its work would continue “under new leadership”.)\n\nIncreasingly, she added, legislators have directly contributed to the climate of harassment, for instance by demanding universities turn over syllabuses referencing certain terms, setting up committees to review scholars’ work, and sending letters and in some cases subpoenas. Few universities, she noted, have forcefully pushed back.\n\n“Even if there’s absolutely no basis to the claims whatsoever, they’re likely to sort of shrink back,” Tromble said of many universities. “And the scholars themselves are put on the defensive and brought into account to justify themselves, when in truth they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.”\n\nAt times, the campaigns to discredit faculty have been fueled directly by legislators or university boards.\n\nLast spring, Bethany Letiecq, a professor at George Mason University’s College of Education and Human Development, published an academic article about what she called “marriage fundamentalism”, a critique of the supremacy of the two-parent married family. The research was covered – and Letiecq says wildly distorted – by the College Fix, a conservative publication dedicated to higher education that quoted scholars calling her research “dangerous” and “terrifying”. The coverage was soon picked up by many other outlets, including Fox News.\n\nAround the same time, another article Letiecq co-authored with the Harvard professor Christina Cross also came under attack, with Rufo leading the charge and accusing Cross of “plagiarism”. (Rufo was not involved in the original attacks against Letiecq.) Cross declined to comment, but Letiecq said the experience had been “incredibly traumatising” for her colleague. Harvard called the accusations against Cross “false” and “absurd”.\n\n“As a scholar, your integrity is all you have,” Letiecq said. “And so when they go after the very core of your scholarship, and you don’t have the mechanisms to fight back, it’s a pretty powerful tactic that they’re using to silence faculty.”\n\nIn her case, the coverage led to the “onslaught of the typical harassment that faculty endure these days”, Letiecq said. People called George Mason University demanding she be fired. Parents Defending Education, a conservative group, published one of her syllabuses on an online list of classes they said were examples of “indoctrination”. Someone left a graphic death threat on her voicemail. The university gave her police protection, scrubbed her address from the internet, and installed a panic button in her office.\n\n“My family felt threatened, my partner felt threatened,” she said, adding that she had to warn her children to be alert for people who may approach them. “The stakes keep getting higher.”\n\nBut while the administration supported her, Letiecq worries about influence from the university board. She points out that the board member Lindsey Burke directs the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation and authored the education section at Project 2025, which calls for the elimination of the education department. When the stories about Letiecq and her colleague went viral, Burke’s colleague at the foundation retweeted a story about her calling on the governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, to “clean out GMU”.\n\nBurke did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.\n\n“The university talks about trying to defend academic freedom, but they’re at the whim of these boards,” said Letiecq, who played a recording of the death threat she received at a meeting with Burke and the GMU the board.\n\n“We are totally under attack,” she added. “They have massive resources. And we’re like sitting ducks.”","summary":"The campaign against Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, has become a blueprint increasingly wielded against women and scholars of color\n\nJo Boaler, a professor of mathematics education at Stanford University, is not new to criticism of her work turning ugly.

We did this together, kiddo!'\nSpeaking about working with Mia, Kate admitted that she was 'blown away' by her daughter's courage on set.\n\nIt's none other than Mia Threapleton, the daughter of Kate Winslet and her ex-husband, Jim Threapleton (pictured with Kate in 2023)\n\nMia looked nothing short of stunning at Thursday's film festival, as she showcased her sensational figure in a strapless black gown\n\nIt appears history is repeating itself, as her famous mother Kate currently boasts a staggering six Oscar nominations, with her winning in 2008 for her performance in The Reader (pictured)\nThe film industry veteran insisted Mia didn't need her advice and would even tell her to 'shut up' and proudly gushed that her daughter has a 'power' that she herself never had as a young actress.\nAppearing on Lorraine, she explained: 'As far as performance, she didn't need me at all. There are even moments where she'd look at me and go, \"Shut up Mum, let me do it!\"\n'It was really amazing working alongside her and actually being blown away by her courage… she's very, very powerful. \n'I think this young generation of actors, I have to say there is a naturalism to their acting and they're just braver'.\nDespite getting to call the legendary actress her mother, Mia has previously explained she didn't get to spend much time learning acting skills by watching her mother at work as a child. \nSpeaking to Variety, she admitted: 'I never actually spent much time around sets that my mum was working on. It was always a special treat.\n'It’s a very different experience when it is happening to you, and not just something I was getting to observe from time to time. \n'I really understand why my mum has always impressed on us how hard the work is. She is right! And I loved every second of it.' \n\nThe Sense and Sensibility star shared the screen with Mia for the first time in hard-hitting drama I Am Ruth, where they played mother and daughter (pictured)\n\nAnd she shared a sweet tribute to Mia as she accepted the BAFTA for Leading Actress for the role in 2023, saying: 'If I could break [the award] in half, I would give the other half to my daughter Mia Threapleton.

(pictured at BAFTAS)\n\nAnd while Mia has been regarded as one of the biggest new nepo babies, Kate has been insistent that her daughter's success is down to her own talent.\nShe's previously said: 'What's great for her is she has a different surname so she slipped under the radar and the people who cast her didn't know she was my daughter and that was important for her self-esteem, of course'. \nKate met Mia's father Jim on the set of Hideous Kinky in 1998 where he was assistant director and they tied the knot the same year.\nThe couple went on to welcome Mia in 2000, but then divorced just a year later. \nKate has also insisted she was not the brains behind Mia's I Am Ruth casting, as she said the idea came from Dominic Savage, the show's creator, and said she told him: 'You have to audition her, and that has to be separate to me.'\nSpeaking of her casting in the show, Mia said: 'I had just finished school, was free of exam hell, and felt excited, nervous and ready to start auditioning for things, and hoping that the opportunities to audition would come my way...\n'I just hoped I would get the chance to do what I had wanted to do for so long!'\nWhile the show's producer Krish Majumdar, also confirmed in a radio interview that Mia had auditioned separately to her mother.\nHe said: 'Mia was there completely on merit and her performance was terrific.'\n\nAnd while Mia has been regarded as one of the biggest new nepo babies, Kate has been insistent that her daughter's success is down to her own talent (pictured in 2023)\n\nKate met Mia's father Jim on the set of Hideous Kinky in 1998 where he was assistant director and they tied the knot the same year.

Berlin International Film Festival jury president Todd Haynes warned reporters during a press conference that people are in a \"state of particular crisis right now in the U.S. but also globally,\" from the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. \"I think everyone I know in the U.S. and friends abroad are witnessing this barrage of actions in the first three weeks of the Trump administration with tremendous concern, shock,\" Haynes said. \"I think that’s been part of the strategy, is to create a sense of destabilization and shock among the people so that how we proceed to coalescing different forms of resistance are still in the works and still being figured out among Democrats,\" he continued. HOLLYWOOD INSIDERS SAY TRUMP'S RETURN HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON FILM INDUSTRY Haynes insisted even people who voted for Trump will likely be \"quickly disillusioned\" over his inability to provide \"economic stability.\" However, he was more concerned about how this would affect \"financiers who are willing to take risk and willing to support strong voices.\" \"How the return of the Trump presidency will affect filmmaking is a real question hanging over all American filmmakers,\" Haynes said. \"And it’s a question that extends beyond the world of filmmaking: how do you maintain your own integrity and point of view and speak out to the issues around us… That remains to be seen.\" Fellow jury member and film critic Amy Nicholson also spoke out against \"people who are trying to divide us\" at the same press conference. \"I just want to say on my country, I think Americans hear all the time that we are a divided country,\" Nicholson said. \"I feel like some people in my country agree on just wanting to feel security, security for healthcare, security for housing, that their work has value [and] their lives have dignity. I would like to see like the people of my country realize that they should unite [against] those people who are trying to divide us in America.\" Though Haynes openly criticized Trump at the Berlin International Film Festival, other similar festivals have been less political than they were in the past. HOLLYWOOD FINDS FAILURE TO ELECT KAMALA HARRIS 'UNSETTLING': 'NOT THE DRIVER ANYMORE' Earlier this month, the Sundance Film Festival was noticeably absent of anti-Trump protests in contrast to the beginning of Trump’s first term in 2017. Though outlets like Variety claimed this was because of publicists demanding journalists stay away from politics, Christian Toto, host of the \"Hollywood in Toto\" podcast, told Fox News Digital that it was likely due to Hollywood’s waning influence. \"Blame several factors for the weak Resistance sequel. The industry is in trouble thanks to the pandemic's fallout, the dueling 2023 industry strikes and, most recently, the devastating LA fires. Actors realize getting overtly political doesn't help their bottom line at such a challenging time,\" Toto said.

NPR has gone so far as to \n claim that \"federal funding is essential to public radio's service to the American public and its continuation is critical for both stations and program producers, including NPR.\"\n\n The media outfits' \n unmistakable ideological bias and imbalanced coverage in recent decades have prompted a steady stream of calls to defund both organizations or perhaps even to close the fountainhead of most of their taxpayer funding, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — a move that would require lawmakers to revisit the Communications Act of 1934 and its amendments.\n\n Following the re-election of President Donald Trump, who has characterized NPR as a scam and whose first administration \n sought to cut funding for the CPB, there has been mounting pressure both to ascertain whether NPR, PBS, and their respective member stations have violated federal bylaws and to spare American taxpayers from having to bankroll leftist propaganda.\n\n Blaze News reviewed the media outfits' recent history of partisan hackery and reached out to a top critic of public broadcasting as well as to lawmakers involved in holding the taxpayer-funded media outfits accountable. It appears that to ensure no partisan media outfit is subsidized at taxpayers' expense, the government may have to get out of the business of public broadcasting altogether.\n\n NPR, a beneficiary of National Endowment for the Arts grants, \n claims that less than 1% of its annual operating budget comes in the form of grants directly from the CPB — which has an operating budget of $545 million for fiscal year 2025 — and other federal sources.\n\n The outfit, which operates as a syndicator to a network of well over 1,000 public radio stations, has acknowledged, however, that multitudes of public radio stations that receive grants directly from the CPB use the funds to \"pay NPR and other public radio producers for their programming.\"\n\n According to consolidated financial statements, the organization secured \n over $96.1 million in \"core and other programming fees\" in 2023, $93.2 million in 2022, $90.4 million in in 2021, and $92.5 million in 2020.\n\n \"These station programming fees are one of NPR's primary sources of revenue,\" noted the media outfit. \"The loss of federal funding would undermine the stations' ability to pay NPR for programming, thereby weakening the institution.\"\n\n Like NPR, public TV stations that receive CPB funding pay significant programming dues to PBS.\n\nAccording to the public TV broadcaster, its flagship \"News Hour\" program, for instance, receives roughly 35% of its \"annual funding/budget from CPB and PBS via national programming funds — a combination of CPB appropriation funds and annual programming dues paid to PBS by stations re-allocated to programs like ours.\"\n\n A spokesman for PBS, which has over 330 member television stations, recently \n indicated that the organization receives 16% of its funding directly from the federal government each year.\n\n While neither NPR nor PBS has done a good job hiding its political leanings, Uri Berliner, a Peabody Award-winning senior business editor who worked at NPR for 25 years, helped shine a spotlight last year on just how slanted public broadcasting has become, slamming NPR specifically in an \n opinion piece for mindlessly advancing Democratic propaganda and altogether giving up on journalistic independence.\n\n Berliner, the son of an LGBT activist and a grandson of Holocaust victims, made clear at the outset he was no rightist, characterizing himself instead as something akin to the stereotypical NPR listener, \"an EV-driving, Wordle-playing, tote bag-carrying coastal elite.\"\n\n While acknowledging the media outfit’s long-standing \"liberal bent,\" Berliner noted that NPR had effectively transformed into a Democratic propaganda machine, working vigorously to \"damage or topple Trump's presidency,\" in part by \"hitch[ing] our wagon to Trump's most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff,\" and amplifying the Russia collusion hoax.\n\n Berliner — who \n discovered that 87% of NPR’s Washington, D.C., editors and reporters were registered Democrats and that none were registered as Republicans — hammered NPR further for gaslighting Americans about the likely origins of COVID-19, for turning a blind eye to the Hunter Biden laptop scandal and its characterization of the damning story as a \"pure distraction,\" and over its obsession with race.\n\n While NPR's objectivity had been criticized for decades, Berliner suggested that \"independent journalism\" at the company really began to slip under former CEO John Lansing, who apparently used George Floyd's death as an excuse to center race and identity in everything the company did while eliminating any remaining \"viewpoint diversity.\"\n\n Berliner indicated that things worsened under the current CEO, Katherine Maher, \n a longtime BLM supporter who previously helped transform Wikipedia into a repository of leftist propaganda, publicly stated, \"Donald Trump is a racist,\" and suggested that \"our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that is getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done.\"\n\n After Maher \n said that Berliner had been \"profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning\" for daring to question the neutrality and integrity of taxpayer-funded propagandists, NPR suspended him. The journalist resigned shortly thereafter.\n\n PBS may not have a Berliner-caliber whistleblower to call its own, but it is certainly no better.\n\n The Media Research Center \n conducted a study from June 1, 2023, to Nov. 30, 2024, analyzing political labels used by anchors, reporters, and contributors on PBS' \"News Hour.\" PBS staff apparently threw around the term \"far right\" or some variation thereof 162 times but used the term \"far left\" only six times.\n\n Reporters reflexively deemed social conservatives and Trump-adjacent Republicans as \"extreme\" or \"extremists.\"\n\n 'I understand the importance of nonpartisan, balanced media coverage.'\n\n While numerous reporters and guests liberally applied the \"fascist\" label to Trump or his polices, PBS reportedly clamped down on characterizations of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris and other Democrats as Marxists or communists, writing them off as \"slurs.\"\n\n another study published last year, the MRC tallied every comment made by PBS journalists during the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Of the 191 minutes of PBS commentary on the Republican National Convention, 72% of opinionated comments were reportedly negative and only 28% were positive.\n\n For instance, when it came to the RNC, \"News Hour\" co-anchor Amna Nawaz exhibited no pretense of neutrality, accusing Republicans of \"echoing some white supremacist notions\" and veering \"into outright racism.\"\n\n The DNC coverage was a different story altogether. Not only did PBS air more speeches and footage from the Democratic convention than for the Republican convention, the co-anchors salivated over the speakers.\n\nGeoff Bennett said that the \"elevation and evolution\" of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was \"so striking because she has found a way to blend populism and pragmatism and blend protest and power.\"\n\n Not to be outdone by her co-anchor's fawning over AOC, Nawaz stated, \"We know we're hearing a lot of this messaging around the joyful warriors that are Harris and Walz, which is really a stark contrast to what we saw on the Republican side.\"\n\n There have been numerous efforts in recent years to defund NPR, defund PBS, and/or shutter the CPB.\n\n Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), for instance, took aim at both NPR and PBS with a \n bill in March 2023 titled the No Partisan Radio and Partisan Broadcasting Services Act. By the following year, the bill had 13 co-sponsors but did not go the distance.\n\n noted that whereas at the time of the media outfits' initial receipt of federal funds, the understanding was that their content \"would remain unbiased and benefit every American,\" it has become \"obvious that NPR and PBS have abandoned their founding principles.\"\n\n Following Berliner's suspension, Republican lawmakers narrowed their focus and pushed multiple bills aimed specifically at kneecapping NPR.\n\n Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), for instance, introduced the \n Defund NPR Act of 2024, a piece of legislation co-sponsored by 16 other Republicans that would have prohibited federal funding to NPR or to any successor organization.\n\n \"As a former newspaper owner and publisher, I understand the importance of nonpartisan, balanced media coverage and have seen firsthand the left-wing bias in our news media,\" Tenney \n said at the time. \"NPR is using American taxpayer dollars to manipulate the news and lie to the American people on behalf of a political agenda.\"\n\n Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, tried something different in December, introducing the \n No Propaganda Act, which would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit federal funding for the CPB. Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) introduced a corresponding bill in the House.\n\n cast doubt on whether the over $15 billion already blown by Congress on the CPB has actually gone toward satisfying the organization's stated goal of educating, informing, fostering curiosity, and promoting civil discourse essential to American society, suggesting that instead it has merely bankrolled \"Big Brother's propaganda outlet.\"\n\n \"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting refuses to provide Louisianans and Americans with fair, unbiased content,\" said Kennedy. \"It wastes taxpayer dollars on slanted coverage to advance a leftist political agenda.\"\n\nMike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who has long written about the need to defund public broadcasting, emphasized to Blaze News that given the option of whether to defund the propaganda outfits or to defund the CPB altogether, the latter choice is optimal, although he'd personally seek to go farther.\n\n Gonzalez, who indicated that no attempt at mending could justify keeping taxpayers on the hook for public broadcasting, said that Kennedy \"going after the CPB is the right approach.\"\n\n \"I would prefer dissolving it,\" continued Gonzalez. \"You can defund the CPB, but that only delays the problem. That's not a permanent solution.\"\n\n 'For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS.'\n\n While Gonzalez anticipates that the liberal media will continue to circle the wagons and gripe over the potential loss of taxpayer cash to fellow travelers, he suggested that those open to defunding public broadcasting should not lose sight of NPR's and PBS' long-standing efforts to antagonize at least half the population..\n\n \"My liberal friends say, 'Look, this is important. We need more journalism, not less journalism.' I don’t, first of all, think [NPR and PBS] are going to go away, but if they go away, I don’t care,\" said Gonzalez. \"Second of all, you have to know what they're doing.\"\n\n Gonzalez noted that NPR and PBS \"gave up any attempt at appearing impartial or objective in any way,\" adding that in the case of NPR, the choice of Maher as CEO was a crystal-clear message that things won't soon change for the better.\n\n \"Maher, on the record, is calling Trump racist. She was an enthusiastic supporter of Kamala Harris,\" said Gonzalez. \"She's on the record as saying the First Amendment and our obsession with truth is getting in the way of consensus. Well, gee — that's the CEO of NPR. Anything else you need to know?\"\n\n Neither NPR nor PBS responded to Blaze News' request for comment by deadline.\n\nComeuppance\n\n There is clearly blood in the water.\n\n The Federal Communications Commission has public broadcasting in its sights, as does the new House Oversight Delivering on Government Efficiency subcommittee, which is chaired by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n\n On Jan. 29, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr \n announced that the commission's enforcement bureau was opening an investigation into the airing of NPR and PBS programming across their various broadcast member stations.\n\n Carr expressed concern that the two media outfits might be in violation of federal law by airing commercials. While apparently concerned that NPR and PBS member stations might be testing the boundaries of their federal noncommercial authorizations, Carr made no secret that the investigation could furnish lawmakers with further justification to pull the plug on the whole project.\n\n \"Congress is actively considering whether to stop requiring taxpayers to subsidize NPR and PBS programming,\" wrote Carr. \"For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS, given the changes in the media marketplace since the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\"\n\n 'We shouldn't be taxing the American people to fund radically left-wing propaganda.'\n\n \"To the extent that these taxpayer dollars are being used to support a for-profit endeavor or an entity that is airing commercial advertisements, then that would further undermine any case for continuing to fund NPR and PBS with taxpayer dollars,\" added Carr.\n\n On Feb. 3, Greene invited the CEOs from NPR and PBS to testify at a hearing in March regarding their biased news coverage. Both Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger were notified that the hearing constitutes an opportunity to explain why they feel they deserve to continue receiving federal funds.\n\n The subcommittee \n said in a release, \"NPR and PBS have repeatedly undermined public trust by ignoring stories that were damaging to the Biden administration, dismissing genuine calls for balanced reporting, and pushing partisan coverage. As stewards of tax dollars, NPR and PBS have an obligation to provide objective and accurate coverage that serves all Americans.\"\n\n When asked about the perceived need to defund NPR and PBS and the significance of doing so, a spokesman for Greene told Blaze News that the congresswoman \"is looking forward to the hearing and questioning the heads of these publicly funded media outlets, and her letters speak for themselves.\"\n\n In Greene's letters to the CEOs of the liberal media outfits, she noted on both occasions that as organizations that receive federal funds through their member stations, they should provide reporting that serves \"the entire public, not just a narrow slice of like-minded individuals and ideological interest groups.\"\n\n When asked about the prospect of defunding NPR and PBS or dissolving the CPB altogether, Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), a member of the DOGE subcommittee, told Blaze News in a statement, \"I fully support defunding these organizations and am exploring legislative options to ensure public funds are spent responsibly.\"\n\n \"We shouldn't be taxing the American people to fund radically left-wing propaganda,\" continued Gill. \"Nothing about NPR or PBS is neutral, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to bankroll news organizations that hate them and everything they stand for.\"\n\n While NPR appears set in its ways, PBS — having seen the writing on the wall — appears eager to placate some of its harshest critics by doing the bare minimum: its lawful obligation.\n\n A PBS spokesman confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter on Feb. 10 that the organization had shuttered its race-obsessed DEI office in order to comply with President Donald Trump's \n executive order \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preference.\"\n\n \"The staff members who served in that office are leaving PBS. We will continue to adhere to our mission and values. PBS will continue to reflect all of America and remain a welcoming place for everyone,\" the spokesman \n said in a statement.\n\n While it was apparently easy to shutter the DEI office and kick to the curb Cecilia Loving, the organization's senior vice president of DEI, eliminating political bias at PBS and NPR would be a herculean feat with no promise of a lasting solution.\n\n condemning the use of taxpayer funds for public broadcasting during the first Trump administration, Mike Gonzalez appealed to Thomas Jefferson to help make his point, quoting the third president as saying, \"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagations of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.\n\nLike Blaze News?

She unloaded over 65% of her shares and options in the past 12 months, yielding $168 million before taxes–benefitting from the stock’s spike following President Donald Trump’s election victory in November.\n\nDenholm, who’s led the Tesla board since the Securities and Exchange Commission forced CEO Elon Musk out of that role in 2018 following his false tweets about securing funding to take the company private, retained just 85,000 shares and 412,000 options in the company following her most recent share sale this month, for $43 million, according to SEC filings. That’s down from 15,000 shares and 1.47 million options a year ago. A likely reason for the heavy selling: her options are due to expire in June. So she’ll likely remain a heavy seller of her remaining options in the next few months. Since 2017, she’s sold $448 million of Tesla stock, before taxes.\n\n“Board directors get paid in stock and it's really scary to have your entire net worth in one company's assets. So it's perfectly understandable that executives and directors would sell some stock when they can,” said UCLA professor Andrew Verstein, co-director of its Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy. “On the other hand, it’s a little bit scary because they know how the company is going to do, and if they're selling that could be a bad sign.”\n\nFor the latest news in cleantech and sustainability news, sign up here for our Current Climate newsletter.\n\nMost of Denholm’s sales occurred under a plan set in July 2024–she’s exercised and sold over 403,000 options since then–so while the overall reduction in her holdings is dramatic, it isn’t entirely surprising. She, Musk and the six other board members are also on the hook to reimburse the company for as much as $919 million under a settlement approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery last month that found they excessively compensated themselves between 2017 and 2020. The board as a group is returning $277 million in cash, over $450 million of stock options and foregoing options for 2021 through 2023.\n\nDenholm’s individual portion isn’t detailed in the settlement agreement. Given Musk’s 12% stake in Tesla, he’s likely to owe most of the reimbursement.\n\nDenholm didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on her stock sales. Tesla rose 5.8% to $355.94 on Thursday.\n\nlon Musk, with his son X Æ A-Xii, speaks with President Donald Trump and reporters in the Oval Office at the White House this week.\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nWith a current $1.1 trillion market valuation Tesla is by far the world’s most valuable automaker, and a highly volatile stock since its 2010 IPO. Musk’s close ties to Donald Trump, enhanced by over $200 million the South African-born billionaire contributed to aid his 2024 presidential run, have been wildly beneficial for Tesla so far. The stock began spiking in November following Trump’s defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris, peaking at an all-time high of $479.86 on Dec. 17, with investors assuming the new administration would be highly favorable to Musk’s companies, which had faced investigations and regulatory scrutiny under the Biden Administration. An early bonus for Tesla appeared to be a $400 million State Department contract to buy armored electric vehicles, initially identified as Teslas, though that deal is suspended for now.\n\nDenholm, an Australian native who joined Tesla’s board in 2014, is also a partner with Blackbird Ventures, which operates in Australia and New Zealand, and was previously CFO of Australian telecom company Telstra Corp. She is not the only Tesla board member to sell off a big chunk of stock in the past year.\n\nKathleen Wilson-Thompson, who formerly served as chief of human resources at Walgreens Boots Alliance and joined Tesla’s board in December 2018, has sold $106.5 million of stock and options in the past year, offloading most of her shares in the company. She still had options for 120,948 shares as of last month, down from 765,855 a year ago.\n\nTesla board members, including Musk’s brother Kimbal, who holds 1.46 million shares, and James Murdoch, have been big financial winners as the stock’s value has surged, especially since the company became highly profitable in 2020 when its Shanghai Gigafactory opened. However, that adds to concerns that they’ve failed in recent years to moderate CEO Musk’s increasingly polarizing comments and actions that threaten the Tesla brand. That’s become an even bigger issue now that he’s leading DOGE, the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, for President Donald Trump, and attempting to make major federal budget cuts despite concerns about the legality of that effort.\n\n“It is a company that is succeeding by all metrics, even though all of its inputs are shoddy by conventional standards of good corporate governance or what the Delaware chancellors want to see,” Vernstein said. “Tesla seems to be following the thesis that we can do just fine without those procedures and we don't care if it looks bad.”\n\n“Can you run a company that is quite ambitious and does not check any of the good practices boxes if your idea is good enough, if your CEO is charismatic enough, if your engineering is good enough?” he said. “Can you ignore all of the other niceties, and rally investors and customers? And if that pisses off a few judges and a few law professors, so be it.”\n\nWith reporting assistance from Kerry Dolan and Andrea Murphy.\n\nMore From Forbes\nForbes14 States Sue DOGE Alleging Elon Musk Is Acting As An ‘Agent Of Chaos’—Here’s What To KnowBy Molly BohannonForbesTesla Faces Protests, Vandalism And Boycott Threats Over Musk’s MAGA-DOGE RampageBy Alan OhnsmanForbesElon Musk Denies US Government's Possible $400 Million Deal To Buy Musk's Tesla Cybertrucks—Here's What To KnowBy Derek Saul\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

Në ditën e zgjedhjeve në SHBA, kur Trump e ka mposhtur kundërshtaren e tij demokrate, Kamala Harris, lideri hungarez ka thënë ‘Ne fituam’, përmes një postimi në faqen e tij në Facebook.\n\nOrbani “ndihet i shfajësuar dhe vetëm sa po e forcon pozicionin e tij prej ‘euroskeptiku’ dhe qasjen e tij joliberale”, ka thënë Zsuzsanna Vegh, prej Fondit Marshall të Shteteve të Bashkuara, me bazë në Berlin.\n\nAjo ka thënë në disa përgjigje për Radion Evropa e Lirë se Orbani tani ndihet se ka më shumë autoritet për t’i shtypur grupet opozitare dhe kritikët qeveritarë.\n\n“Narrativa qeveritare është sulmi ndaj mediave të pavarura dhe organizatave joqeveritare në Hungari.

Sipas tij, Fico nuk mund të kategorizohet lehtë si politikan i krahut të djathtë.\n\n“Është e vërtetë që ai duke çuar përpara ide shumë të ngjashme me të djathtës ekstreme, por nuk është lloji i politikanit të ekstremit të djathtë.

The reversal followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s warning that “intense fighting” would resume in the Gaza Strip barring the terrorist group’s continued release of hostages, though it appears to fall short of President Donald Trump’s demand that Hamas return “all” of the remaining abductees by Saturday. Negotiations to decide the terms of the second phase of the agreement are ongoing. \n\nAn Afghan man reportedly drove a car into a crowd of protesters in Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation into the incident after authorities found that the suspect, a 24-year-old asylum-seeker who arrived in Germany in 2016, had an “extremist background.” The ramming came on the eve of the annual Munich Security Conference, which is set to be attended by world leaders including Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nApple and Google reinstated TikTok to their app stores on Thursday, reversing the platform’s removal last month following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a law requiring Chinese firm ByteDance to divest its ownership of the app or face an effective ban. The move reportedly followed assurances by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that the government would not immediately enforce the legislation, which imposes hefty civil penalties on app store owners and servers who allow TikTok to operate. Trump had previously signed an executive order delaying the ban’s enforcement while he seeks to negotiate a deal that addresses lawmakers’ national security concerns about the app.\n\nDanielle Sassoon resigned from her position as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, in protest of the Trump administration’s order directing federal prosecutors to drop charges against New York City Mayor Adams on Monday. Prosecutors charged Adams in September 2024 with bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy, and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals. In a letter to Attorney General Bondi, Sassoon—who was appointed by Trump to her now-former position last month—wrote that the decision to dismiss the case was “inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.”\n\nThe Senate voted 52-48 on Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Sen. Mitch McConnell—the lone Republican dissenter and a polio survivor—released a statement on Thursday expanding on his opposition to Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic. “In my lifetime, I’ve watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world,” he said. “I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles.”\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management advised federal agencies on Thursday to fire most of their estimated 220,000 probationary employees—that is, workers who have generally held government jobs for around one to two years. Following the push, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it had dismissed more than 1,000 employees and the U.S. Forest Service indicated plans to fire more than 3,400 people. The layoffs marked the Trump administration’s latest effort to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. \n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said on Thursday that she will not seek reelection in 2026, paving the way for a crowded Democratic primary in the blue-leaning battleground state. Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan already announced plans to run for the Senate seat, and her boss, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz—former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 presidential election—is reportedly considering a bid. Democratic Reps.

Now it’s time to defend ourselves | Jodie Ginsberg","text":"In 1971, the Nixon administration asked for a court order to stop the New York Times from publishing further stories about the so-called Pentagon Papers – documents that showed the US government had escalated its Vietnam war efforts even as it was acknowledging privately that it could not win the war. A temporary restraining order – the first time the US press had been restrained prior to publication – was granted.\n\nKnowing she could be sued, jailed and could even have faced financial ruin if her own paper followed suit, the Washington Post’s publisher, Katharine Graham, decided that the Post, which had copies of some of the Pentagon Papers, would publish anyway. As immortalised in the 2017 film The Post, Graham – who had previously described herself as shy and insecure – took a deep breath and told her editors: “Let’s go. Let’s publish!”\n\nDefying the court order was a seriously risky move for Graham. The Washington Post Company had gone public just three days earlier. A criminal charge put its multimillion-dollar stock offering in jeopardy. Not to mention that Graham herself could have been jailed or that a criminal conviction could have given the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) justification for stripping the Post of television broadcast licences.\n\nThat decision looks especially brave in today’s climate, when the new administration led by Donald Trump – who in his first term repeatedly called the press “enemies of the people” – seems even more determined than the Nixon administration to stifle reporting.\n\nToday, Graham’s defence of the right of the press under the first amendment to publish news of public interest should be a clarion call for her modern-day counterparts. The US media is, as the judge Murray Gurfein – who issued the Pentagon Papers’ restraining order – noted, “cantankerous” and “obstinate”. But it has also, unlike the media in many parts of the world, traditionally been united against threats to its independence – even when those threats are being made to organizations from across the political aisle.\n\nBut that defiance and solidarity now appears under strain as outlets cave to politically motivated threats from the new administration.\n\nIn December, ABC News settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump for $15m, a case that many media law experts said they should have fought given the high threshold traditionally required for a public figure such as Trump to prove defamation.\n\nNow CBS looks like it might settle a lawsuit over edits it made to a 60 Minutes interview with the presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which Trump’s team allege had been deceptively edited to cast Harris in a more favorable light ahead of the election. (Editing interviews is standard practice in news reporting to avoid repetition.) Initially, CBS refused to hand over the transcripts but following pressure from the FCC, it sent the raw footage and all transcripts to the agency, now led by the Trump appointee Brendan Carr.\n\nCarr has made no secret of his desire to use the FCC’s powers to go after organizations he believes are not fulfilling their public interest mandate; he explicitly linked the CBS case to a deal in which CBS’s parent, Paramount, is seeking approval to sell 28 of its local broadcast TV stations.\n\nThe capitulations – on top of last-minute interventions by the owners of both the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times to halt editorial endorsements of either candidate ahead of last year’s presidential elections – are worrying, not least because they send a signal that such spurious lawsuits work to silence the “cantankerous” press.\n\nAnd while the likes of ABC and CBS may have deep pockets to be able to weather such attacks, the vast majority of US news outlets do not. The online non-profit newsroom Wasau Pilot & Review, which has a staff of just four, faced bankruptcy after a state senator sued it for defamation over its report that he was overheard using an anti-gay slur during a county board meeting. In a story headlined “Even if we win, we lose,” the Pilot & Review acknowledged the challenge that faces so many small news outlets – the cost of defending such suits is prohibitive, even if the case is ultimately thrown out. Such legal harassment, increasingly common across the world, can also taint the public’s view (“there’s no smoke without fire”) of the press, further eroding already febrile trust in the media.\n\nNon-profit newsrooms are particularly worried. A call hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) last November, in the weeks following the election, was attended by representatives from more than 100 non-profit news outlets throughout the United States, eager to understand what vectors might be used to challenge their reporting.\n\nTheir caution is warranted; local press is already severely weakened. A 2024 report from researchers at Northwestern University found that more than 55 million Americans had limited or no access to local news – the kind of information that shows how local tax dollars are being spent, what decisions local school boards are making, or even how your local sports team is doing. Repeated academic studies have shown a strong link between the amount of local political coverage and voter turnout. Local media proved vital in covering recent extreme weather such as the Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nWhen Gurfein denied the Nixon administration’s request for a preliminary injunction, he stated: “A ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.” If vital media institutions are to survive this administration, it will be because essential media, on all sides, stand up clearly and unequivocally for the right to report the news. After all, challenging the bullies is part of the job.\n\n Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists","summary":"The one-time defiance and solidarity of publications across the political aisle is strained as outlets cave to Trump’s threats\n\nIn 1971, the Nixon administration asked for a court order to stop the New York Times from publishing further stories about the so-called Pentagon Papers – documents that showed the US government had escalated its Vietnam war efforts even as it was acknowledging privately that it could not win the war.

For the first time since 2008, the Democratic presidential candidate did not receive at least 60 percent support among young voters. It was a profound shift in the American electorate that appears, at least so far, to be holding up in the first hectic weeks of the Trump administration.A majority of young voters, 55 percent, approve of the job Trump is doing as president, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released ahead of the Super Bowl. That's higher than the 52 percent of 30 to 44-year-olds (Millennials) who said the same, and 50 percent of voters 65 and older (Boomers) who agreed.On a generational basis, Gen Z's support of Trump is only eclipsed by that of Gen X, who gave Trump his highest marks, with 56 percent saying they approved of how he has handled his job as president. Gen X is, generally speaking, the parental generation to Gen Z.Gen Z's embrace of Trump is part of a broader national trend showing the president enjoying some of the highest marks of his political career. But a deeper look at the data also suggests something more puzzling: the Gen Z voters who overwhelmingly helped propel Joe Biden to the White House in 2020 are not the same Gen Z voters who backed a second Trump term in 2024.An Intra-Generational DivideSo are the Zoomers — defined as those born between approximately between 1997 and 2012 — really two different generational cohorts? And if so, what is the dividing line?It's a theory that was recently floated on social media by Rachel Jafanza, the 27-year-old researcher and founder of Up and Up Strategies. As an elder member of Gen Z, Jafanza has been holding listening sessions with young Americans for the past few years.\"I really noticed a split in how older members of Gen Z and younger members of Gen Z are thinking about their place in society and in the country,\" Jafanza, who also publishes the Zoomer culture-focused newsletter Up and Up, told Newsweek. \"They've expressed just different life experiences that have shaped their collective adolescence.\"Last week, her infographic explaining the split between what she coined \"Gen Z 1.0\" and \"Gen Z 2.0,\" received more than 5.4 million views on X.On one side are the older Zoomers: those born between 1997 and 2004, who graduated high school before the COVID pandemic. As Janfaza sees it, these are young people who grew up in a society that was not yet completely online, and one that still deemed progressive political activism as \"cool.\"On the other side, the younger Zoomers: those born between 2005 and 2012, whose high-school years were upended by a global health crisis, and whose births roughly coincided with the invention and rise of the iPhone and social media. These are the true digital natives who grew up with the internet, developing a drastically different idea of what \"counterculture\" looks like: fewer marches, more memes.The divide Janfaza identified would explain at least some of the drastic drop off in support that Kamala Harris received from younger voters. Among 25- to 29-year-olds, Harris' margin of victory was just 3 percent lower than Biden's in 2020. But when it comes to 18- to 24-year-olds, that margin dropped 23 points below what Biden garnered four years prior.It All Comes Back to CovidFor all the concern generated around the toll the pandemic would have on masked, social-distanced and virtual learning, five years after the initial health emergency was declared it is becoming increasingly clear that those impacts would also manifest themselves politically.Unlike Gen Z 1.0, many of whom were in college during the first Trump era, the college experience of Gen Z 2.0 was widely characterized by a frustration over the pandemic protocols that were preventing them from partaking in the full college experience.\"They couldn't see their friends, they couldn't leave their home, and whether or not it was understood at the time, if you're a young person who spent a year doing online classes or a year of social-distance school, you know, it's just frustrating,\" Janfaza said.\"It's not that they are denying the pandemic or the validity of any of the medical recommendations from epidemiologists, or anything like that, I think is a little bit more simple in the sense that they were sad that they couldn't see their friends.\"As their social circles moved online virtually overnight, TikTok became the formative media outlet for the younger Zoomers. In video after video, young people complained about missing their high school graduations and senior proms, of the desolate college campuses that welcomed them and the increasingly precarious economy that waited for them on the other side.\n\nThis shift happened while public health officials around the world made few, if any, concessions for young people, despite it becoming clear even by mid-2020 that they were at much less risk from the virus as older cohorts.Janfaza wrote in November that while there are \"extreme social and emotional ramifications\" for anyone whose adolescence was upended by a global pandemic, \"it hasn't changed everyone in the same ways.\"\"I'd argue that those members of Gen Z, who were younger at the peak of the pandemic, had a very different — and frankly harder — experience than those a bit older,\" she wrote.Is Protesting Still Cool?That experience was markedly different from the older Zoomers, who were getting their degrees and starting their careers during the bubbling resistance movement that accompanied Trump's first term. For many, every year of their college experience was marked by a different protest.The day after Trump's first inauguration in 2017, young people helped turn the Women's March into the largest single-day demonstration that the U.S. had seen. In 2018, after the Parkland shooting became the deadliest mass shooting at a high school, students spearheaded a national movement calling for gun control legislation. In 2019, many of those same students would take to the streets again, joining millions of others around the world as they skipped class as part of \"Fridays for the Future,\" an international movement demanding action from political leaders on climate change.By 2020, when the Black Lives Matter movement swept the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, social justice advocacy was almost a given for many Zoomers. As Americans rushed to post black squares to the Instagram feeds and businesses in the U.S. drafted up diversity promises and hung BLM flags in their storefronts, the protests of that summer would go onto surpass the Women's March in terms of reach.\"It was very much in the social zeitgeist to attend marches and demonstrations, whether that was the Women's March, the March for Our Lives, climate strikes, Black Lives Matter movement. Those were all fervent on and off college campuses,\" Janfaza said.Of course, young people have been resisting \"the man\" for generations. The difference is while Trump was the embodiment of that man among Gen Z 1.0, he was not for Gen Z 2.0.For many, he actually embodied the resistance.\"Over the past four years, when Biden was the president, MAGA and Trump was the counterculture,\" Janfaza said. \"If you were going to be anti-authority, that meant being anti-the party in charge, which [for the last four years] was the Democrats.\"Janfaza said she believes the rightward shift of the younger generation is less about Trump himself and more reflective of an overall exhaustion with politics as a project.\"Right now, in 2025, there's a desire to not be talking about politics all the time,\" she said.\"People don't want to be fighting anymore with their peers,\" she added. \"I think people are really understanding of the fact that they are in community with people who likely disagree with them, no matter what side of the aisle they stand on.\"Of course, most of the younger Zoomers aren't old enough to remember much of the first Trump term. When Trump won his shock victory back in 2016, the oldest members of Gen Z 2.0 would have been 11.Those voters might look back on that period as a time \"when everything was good,\" Janfaza said. \"I had no problems I had to worry about. I wasn't trying to afford groceries or gas. I wasn't in college, I wasn't a student, I wasn't I wasn't trying to get my first job.\"That has given Trump a path to build a new reputation among voters who are still relatively impressionable in their own political views and thinking.And he has delivered. Voters under 30 are more likely than any other age group to describe Trump as \"effective,\" (63 percent), \"focused,\" (62 percent), \"competent,\" (58 percent), and \"energetic,\" (71 percent), according to the recent CBS poll.'Yearning' for a Past That No Longer ExistsIn December, Janfaza declared 2024 the \"year of Gen Z nostalgia.\" From their booming interest in vinyl records and film cameras to Y2K fashion and a desire to go \"off the grid,\" the obsession \"with a past they didn't experience\" has become a defining aspect of the generation, she said.\"That yearning is also reshaping our politics,\" she added in a post on X. \"President-elect Donald Trump tapped into this and made surprising inroads with young voters – many of whom were too young to vote in 2016 or even remember his first term - by promising to Make America Great Again for our generation.\"To be sure, every generation faces its own struggles. Boomers came of age during Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement, Gen X were the \"latchkey kids\" coming home from school to an empty home, and Millennials grew up in a post-9/11 world only to enter the workforce just as the global economy was unraveling. What's unique to all of Gen Z is, as Janfaza said, the sense of never-ending crises, exacerbated by phones and social media.\"In today's digital age, difficulties feel inescapable, never-ending, and are documented in real time for all to witness.\"\"Romanticizing the past isn't a trend for Gen Z, it's survival,\" she added. \"We've grown up in constant crisis: economic downturn, a global pandemic, the loneliness epidemic, fall of Roe v. Wade and climate change —which will have bigger consequences for us and our children than anyone else.\"","summary":"Gen Z, or Zoomers, might as well be two generations in one when it comes to politics. The dividing line can be traced back to the pandemic.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gen-z-zoomer-politics-trump-covid-2029955","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587518/two-gen-zs.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 11:00:01","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":290659572,"title":"Trump Prepares to Wipe Out Years of Progress on Gun Violence","text":"By the time Joe Biden became president in January 2021, guns were the top killer of children and teens in America, overtaking car crashes and cancer as the leading cause of death. As that trend continued, the Biden White House responded with gun safety policies to enforce existing laws and bolster gun-violence prevention programs. In June 2022, following mass shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo, NY, and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Congress passed gun legislation for the first time in three decades. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act strengthened background checks for some gun buyers and prohibitions for domestic abusers, and it dedicated about $15 billion for states to build mental health and violence intervention programs. The Biden White House later established the Office of Gun Violence Prevention and an initiative to help states implement “red flag” laws that allow for removing guns from troubled people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThese policies at a broad level have coincided with a reduction in gun violence nationally: By 2024, shooting homicides overall were in steady decline throughout the country. Mass shootings also declined, both by conservative and broader measures of the problem.\n\nNow, President Donald Trump has moved quickly to undo the progress made with gun safety policies. He shut down the Office of Gun Violence Prevention immediately after taking office. And on Feb. 7, he signed an executive order directing US Attorney General Pam Bondi to “examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans, international agreements, and other actions of executive departments and agencies” from Biden’s term, to assess whether those “infringe on the Second Amendment rights” of Americans. Within 30 days, Bondi is to give Trump “a plan of action.”\n\nTrump made clear during his 2024 campaign what that plan is likely to do. At the National Rifle Association’s annual convention in Dallas last May, he vowed to “roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment.”\n\nAreas at risk could include efforts to combat the emerging danger from untraceable firearms that are made from kits or using 3-D printers, known as “ghost guns.” Trump has a history from his first term in office of undermining regulation of these weapons. When Biden became president, crime involving ghost guns was skyrocketing. Biden moved to make such firearms subject to serial numbers and background checks, and later established an ATF task force to focus on the problem. (A gun industry-backed challenge to Biden’s ghost gun policy is currently at the Supreme Court.) By 2023, crimes using ghost guns began declining nationally.\n\nThe problem of ghost guns came back into stark view in December, when a disgruntled 26-year-old man allegedly used one to execute UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a street in New York City. That attack apparently was the first time a ghost gun was used for a high-profile assassination.\n\nRed flag laws, which have strong bipartisan support among voters and spread to nearly half of all states in recent years, are also vulnerable under Trump. In early 2024, then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced a new center based at Johns Hopkins University to provide technical and training support to states implementing the laws, an initiative funded with a grant from the US Justice Department. Studies in California and elsewhere have shown that these laws— which allow a civil court judge to remove guns temporarily based on evidence that a person poses a threat—are effective for preventing suicide and mass shootings.\n\nTrump in fact openly supported red flag laws following a spate of gun massacres in summer 2019. But in 2022, he blasted the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provided states with funding for red flag laws, painting it as a nefarious gun grab by “Radical Left Democrats” and “RINO” senators including Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn.\n\nDemagoguery from Trump and the firearms industry about government “gun grabs” is disconnected from the reality in the United States. There are more than 400 million guns in circulation today, far surpassing the total population. Americans buy more than a million guns every month, and in many states there are few restrictions on doing so. The number of civilian-owned AR-15s—a popular rifle that was designed for maximum killing in war and became a profit center for the industry—has ballooned to well over 20 million. In recent years those became the weapon of choice for mass shooters, too.\n\nTrump’s supporters in the gun industry now anticipate a big political payoff.\n\n“NRA members were instrumental, turning out in record numbers to secure his victory, and he is proving worthy of their votes, faith, and confidence in his first days in office,” NRA CEO Doug Hamlin said in a statement after Trump’s executive order.\n\n“Gun owners fought hard to elect a president who would take a sledgehammer to Biden’s unconstitutional gun control policies, and today, President Trump proved he’s serious about that fight,” Aidan Johnston, a director for Gun Owners of America, said in a statement. “We hope that this executive order is just the first of many victories reestablishing our Second Amendment rights during the Trump administration.”\n\nGun safety advocates are sounding the alarm, including those galvanized by the devastating high school massacre that took place seven years ago Friday in Parkland, Florida.\n\n“Trump’s priorities couldn’t be more clear. Spoiler: it’s not protecting kids. Gun deaths finally went down last year, and Trump just moved to undo the rules and laws that helped make that happen,” said Natalie Fall, Executive Director of March For Our Lives, in a statement. “He is going to get Americans killed in his thirst for vengeance and eagerness to please the gun lobby and rally armed extremists. Remember the next time that a mass shooting happens, Trump did everything in his power to enable it, not prevent it.”","summary":"By the time Joe Biden became president in January 2021, guns were the top killer of children and teens in America, overtaking car crashes and cancer as the leading cause of death. As that trend continued, the Biden White House responded with gun safety policies to enforce existing laws and bolster gun-violence prevention programs.
