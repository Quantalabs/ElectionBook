It was not an easy task, given that the lineup of current and former elected officials sharing the stage at the Sunday morning forum agreed on almost all the issues, with any differences largely playing out in the margins. They pledged to take on President Trump, make the state more affordable, safeguard immigrants and provide them with Medi-Cal healthcare benefits, and keep the state's over-budget bullet train project intact. There is not yet any clear front-runner in the race to run the nation's most populous state, though former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter has had a small edge in recent polling. Aside from a opaque dig from former state Controller Betty Yee, Porter was not attacked during the debate. They were joined onstage by former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, California Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. State Sen. Toni Atkins, who was supposed to participate, dropped out due to illness. Wealthy first-time political candidate Stephen J. Cloobeck withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. The forum was sponsored by the National Union of Healthcare Workers, in partnership with the Los Angeles Times and Spectrum News. It was held in Los Angeles and moderated by Associated Press national planning editor Lisa Matthews, with L.A. Times California politics editor Phil Willon, Spectrum News 1 news anchor Amrit Singh and Politico senior political reporter Melanie Mason asking the questions. Sen. Alex Padilla and businessman Rick Caruso have also both publicly flirted with a bid for the state's top office, but have yet to make a decision. Two major GOP candidates, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton, are also running for California governor, but neither were invited to the debate because they did not complete an endorsement questionnaire from the union. California's June 2 gubernatorial primary is just eight months away, but the horde hoping to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom has been competing for attention against an extraordinarily crowded landscape, with an unexpected special election this November pulling both dollars and attention away from the race for governor. To say nothing of the fact that the race had been somewhat frozen in place for months until the end of July, when former Vice President Kamala Harris finally announced she would not be running. The candidates reiterated their support for Proposition 50, the Newsom-led November ballot measure to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year by redrawing California congressional districts. Newsom pushed for the measure to counter efforts by Republican-led states to reconfigure their congressional districts to ensure the GOP keeps control of Congress. \"This is not a fight we actually wanted to have,\" Yee said. \"This is in response to a clear attempt to mute our representation in Washington. And so we have to fight back.\" The candidates repeatedly focused on their families' origins as well as their efforts to protect immigrants while serving in elected office. Thurmond raised his upbringing in his opening remarks. \"I know what it is to struggle. You know that my grandparents were immigrants who came here from Colombia, from Jamaica? You know that I am the descendant of slaves who settled in Detroit, Mich.?\" he said. Becerra highlighted his support for undocumented people to have access to state healthcare coverage as well as his successful lawsuit protecting undocumented immigrants brought to this nation as young children that reached the Supreme Court. \"As the son of immigrants, I know what happens when you feel like you're excluded,\" he said. Becerra and Thurmond addressed the diverse audience in Spanish. Yee, who spoke about sharing a room with her immigrant parents and siblings. also raised her background during a lightning-round question about what the candidates planned to dress up as on Halloween. \"My authentic self as a daughter of immigrants,\" she said. The debate was overwhelmingly cordial. But there was some dissent when the topic turned to Proposition 36, a 2024 anti-crime ballot measure that imposed stricter penalties for repeat theft and crimes involving fentanyl. The ballot measure — which undid key parts of the 2014 criminal justice reform ballot measure Proposition 47 — sowed division among California Democrats, with Newsom and groups including the ACLU strongly opposing it. Its passage marked a turning of the tide in Californians' attitudes about criminal justice reform and response to crime, following years of support for progressive policies that leaned away from punitive prison sentences for lower-level crimes. First, Villaraigosa contended that he was the only candidate on stage who had supported Proposition 36, though Porter and Becerra quickly jumped in to say that they too had supported it. But Porter also contended that, despite her support, there were \"very real problems with it and very real shortcomings.\" The measure should have also focused on prevention and incarcerating people for drug offenses doesn't make anyone safer, she said. Thurmond strayed sharply from the pack on the issue, saying he voted \"no\" on Proposition 36 and citing his career as a social worker. \"Prop. 36, by design, was set up to say that if you have a substance abuse issue, that you will get treatment in jail,\" Thurmond contended, suggesting that the amount of drugs present in the prison system would make that outcome difficult. As governor, he would more money into treatment for substance abuse programs and diversion programs for those who commit minor crimes, he said. When the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they supported a single-payer healthcare system, Porter and Villaraigosa did not, while Becerra, Yee and Thurmond did. Issues of affordability are top of mind for most Californians, particularly when it comes to housing. Thurmond said he would build two million housing units on surplus land on school sites around the state and provide a tax break for working and middle class Californians. Villaraigosa also focused on the need to build more housing, criticizing bureaucratic red tape and slow permitting processes. Villaraigosa also twice critiqued CEQA — notable because the landmark California Environmental Quality Act was once held seemingly above reproach by California Democrats. But the law's flaws have become increasingly accepted in recent years as the state's housing crisis worsened, with Newsom signing two bills to overhaul the the law and ease new construction earlier this year. Porter said that if she were governor, she would sign SB 79, a landmark housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to expand high-density housing near transit hubs. The controversial bill — which would potentially remake single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops — is awaiting Newsom's signature or veto.","summary":"In a darkened airport hotel ballroom room, a bevy of California Democrats sought to distinguish themselves from the crowded field running for governor in 2026.

Don’t dismantle the network, just put all the news, sports, entertainment and more on Disney streaming service Hulu, where all of its FX shows run, and on the ABC app.\n\nThat way, the next time FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatens licenses over his upset about a comedian’s bad joke, or station groups decide to pre-empt programming, Disney could continue reaching its audiences and advertisers. The key: don’t sell the broadcast licenses when you stop broadcasting, because that puts the FCC back in position to commit political mischief, because it must approve license transfers.\n\n“We calculate that shutting down (not selling) ABC would force (Disney) to write off about $1.7 (billion) to $2.7 (billion) of free spectrum value, plus about $1.4 (billion) of lost (free cash flow) per year, which is worth about $8.3 (billion) of value based on current TV trading comps,” Martin wrote.\n\nThat sounds like a fair amount of money, but Martin and Medina suggest, “Value destruction would be (as) low as a percent of (Disney’s $204 billion) market (capitalization), and (one-time) only, which Wall Street would add back.\"\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAnd ABC, despite its top-rated evening news and hits such as Abbott Elementary, isn’t driving a lot of viewership overall. Nielsen estimates the network is averaging only 2.4 million viewers in prime time across broadcast and cable. Martin and Medina estimated the network and its owned & operated local stations generate only about $4 billion in revenues, down 11% from 2024.\n\nDumping the fading broadcast platform for streaming and online delivery would allow Disney investors to better value the company’s faster-growing sectors, expanding valuation multiples by 40 to 60 basis points per year for the next decade, Martin and Medina wrote. That would add 10% more value for Disney shareholders.\n\nThe real issue driving Needham’s proposal: studios can’t afford to screw around with political headaches and grandstanding at a moment when the entire business is being radically transformed by generative artificial intelligence.\n\n\"GenAI collapses time frames, thereby making the delays, distractions and headaches of regulation more expensive, so jettisoning regulatory risks is increasingly valuable,” the Needham analysts wrote.\n\nAs with just about any way-out-of-the-(TV)-box idea, there are some big caveats.\n\nThough broadcast ratings continue to decline, they remain the best way to reach a large, broadly based audience. That’s particularly important to the major sports leagues who provide some of TV’s most valuable programming. They depend on broadcast to reach casual fans, relying on subscription services to extract more income from hard-core followers.\n\nThe NBA’s rich new contracts signed last summer were decided in part by the fact that Disney had ABC and ESPN and its streaming operations. Comcast’s NBCUniversal bid was also considered superior because of its broadcast component, compared to long-time league partner Warner Bros. Discovery, which only has a cable network and streaming. Amazon, the third winning bid, is, well, Amazon.\n\nSimilarly, CNBC reported last week that the NFL wants to advance its “look-in” provisions by a year for $111 billion in TV contracts. After more recent big rights renewals for the NBA, college football, and other leagues, the creators of television’s most-watched programming are concerned they may have left money on the table when they signed those original NFL deals.\n\nWill having a broadcast operation still be required of any traditional media partner going forward as the league tries to anticipate what will matter in the media ecosystem of the early 2030s?\n\nAnother potential complication for such a bold move: Carr and influential FCC staffers have rumbled about expanding the commission’s regulatory power far beyond broadcast, where government regulation is said to be necessary because it relies on divvying up scarce publicly owned broadcast spectrum.\n\nBut getting into areas such as regulating online cable-like operators such as YouTube TV, or more broadly tweaking the Communication Act’s Section 230 safe-harbor provisions protecting online services are a different thing altogether.\n\nThose kinds of regulatory extensions would require a deeply divided Congress to get on board. That could be difficult, especially given that even some conservatives said they were deeply dismayed by Carr’s comments around the Kimmel controversy.\n\nBeyond all these issues, there is one of history and sentiment. ABC and Disney have been connected since the 1950s, when Leonard Goldenson needed programming for his new American Broadcasting Corporation. But the movie studios largely wouldn’t countenance letting even their old movies run on television, with one exception.\n\nWalt Disney’s family-owned studio had lots of animated features and shorts and nature documentaries sitting largely unused in its library. And Walt needed money to finance his ambitious plans for a Disney theme park in Anaheim.\n\nOut of that shared set of interests came The Wonderful World of Disney (among many other names), which would anchor Sunday prime-time schedules for ABC and then other networks for decades.\n\nFast forward to the 1990s. Walt is gone, Michael Eisner is CEO, charged with transforming the studio into a bigger media company. Among his deals: the $19 billion acquisition in 1996 of Capital Cities/ABC, whose senior TV executives included an ambitious former weatherman named Robert Iger.\n\nIger spent 22 years with ABC before the Disney deal, and now has run Disney as CEO for close to that long across two stints. Iger’s been a fierce guardian of the Disney brand, but he’s not known as a sentimentalist. Given his ABC roots, though, would Iger ever countenance a dramatic move like Martin and Medina suggest?\n\nProbably not. But there is another consideration. The Disney board is expected to name Iger’s successor over the next few months, and the clubhouse favorite has long been co-head of entertainment Dana Walden.\n\nWalden, a frequent walking partner with Iger, is also a long-time friend of former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mere name seems to enrage Trump. Would a move out of Brandon Carr-regulated broadcasting take away one of the ways the administration might monkey with a preferred successor, or any major moves she might undertake at CEO?\n\nAgain, probably not. But the bigger question, as Martin and Medina lay it out, is how well Hollywood’s battered media companies can navigate a fast-changing ecosystem where YouTube attracts more streaming eyeballs than anyone, AI is dramatically reducing the cost of production and marketing, politically motivated regulators are seeking even more power, and dirt-cheap micro dramas out of China are grabbing more and more attention. Bold moves may be just what’s needed.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Needham Securities analysts suggest Disney get out of broadcasting, without selling ABC licenses, to shed itself of any ongoing FCC regulation at a time of rapid change.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2025/09/28/should-disney-drop-broadcasting-abc-to-avoid-government-meddling/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d988611105596c1d76c3ec/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 20:48:55","author":"Beata Zawrzel,David Bloom,Senior Contributor","authors":["Beata Zawrzel","David Bloom","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":364305774,"title":"New York Mayor Eric Adams Quits Re-election Bid, Know Who Remains In Contest With Zohran Mamdani","text":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced that he is ending his re-election campaign, a decision that rivals of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani had long pushed for in hopes of uniting the opposition.\nAdams, who had been trailing in opinion polls, initially secured office as a Democrat but entered the race for a second term as an independent.

He attributed this to “constant media speculation about my future” as well as the city’s campaign finance board’s decision to withhold matching funds.\nHe further conceded that accusations of corruption had shaken public confidence in him. “I was wrongfully charged because I fought for this city,” Adams said, while insisting the charges over alleged illegal campaign donations and overseas-funded luxury travel were baseless.\nOnly in America. Only in New York.Thank you for making my story a reality. pic.twitter.com/efHuyBnITJ\n— Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) September 28, 2025\nReflecting on his time in office, Adams said, “This campaign was for the underserved, the marginalized, the abandoned and betrayed by government. Since then, it has been my honour to be your mayor, and I’m proud to say that we took that victory four years ago and turned it into action, making this city better for those who have been failed by government.”\nAdams’ withdrawal clears the way for a three-way contest to decide the leadership of America’s largest city. The remaining contenders are Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\nMamdani, a democratic socialist, stunned observers in June when he defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Cuomo is now running as an independent, while Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa remains in the race.\nCNN reported that Cuomo allies had privately urged Adams to step aside to give the former governor a stronger chance against Mamdani in November. Former US President Donald Trump also weighed in, suggesting that the crowded field should narrow. One of his aides, Steve Witkoff, reportedly met with Adams to discuss possible roles for him in a future Trump administration.\nTrump’s interventions into New York politics have complicated the race further, with his low standing in the city believed to have benefited Mamdani.\nDespite Trump urging Sliwa to exit, the Republican candidate has dismissed such suggestions, insisting he will stay in the contest. Cuomo’s team is hoping Adams’ withdrawal could help shift some of the Black vote, potentially tightening the race.\nDemocratic Support Swings Toward Mamdani\nWhile Trump’s involvement has drawn scrutiny, state and national Democrats have increasingly rallied around Mamdani. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and former Vice President Kamala Harris are among those who have publicly endorsed him, CNN reported.\nElected in 2021 as New York’s second Black mayor, Adams had pitched himself as a working-class candidate with strong ties to the city’s blue-collar population. His campaign had emphasised public safety and economic recovery post-pandemic.\nHowever, his administration became mired in corruption scandals, including charges that he had solicited donations from Turkish nationals and exchanged political favours for wealthy backers.

But he said that \"constant media speculation\" about his future and a decision by the city's campaign finance board to withhold public funding from his reelection effort, made it impossible to stay in the race.\n\n\"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign,\" Adams said.\n\nThe one-term Democrat's decision to quit the race comes days after he repeatedly insisted he would stay in the contest, saying everyday New Yorkers don't \"surrender.\"\n\nBut speculation that he wouldn't make it to Election Day has been rampant for a year. Adams' campaign was severely wounded by his now-dismissed federal bribery case and liberal anger over his warm relationship with President Donald Trump. He skipped the Democratic primary and got on the ballot as an independent.\n\nAdams makes no endorsements in dropping out\n\nIn the video, Adams did not directly mention or endorse any of the remaining candidates in the race, but he warned of \"insidious forces\" using local government to \"advance divisive agendas.\"\n\n\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer (is) to destroy the very system we built over generations,\" he said. \"That is not change, that is chaos. Instead, I urge leaders to choose leaders not by what they promise, but by what they have delivered.\n\nAdams capitulation could potentially provide a lift to the campaign of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a fellow centrist who has portrayed himself as the only candidate potentially able to beat the Democratic Party's nominee, state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani.\n\nIt was unclear, though, whether enough Adams' supporters would shift their allegiances to Cuomo to make a difference.\n\nMamdani, who, at age 33, would be the city's youngest and most liberal mayor in generations if elected, beat Cuomo decisively in the Democratic primary by campaigning on a promise try to lower the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive cities.\n\nRepublican Curtis Sliwa also remains in the race, though his candidacy has been undercut from within his own party; Trump in a recent interview called him \"not exactly prime time.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has endorsed Mamdani, said in a statement after the mayor's announcement that she has been proud to have worked with Adams for the last four years, and that he leaves the city \"better than he inherited it.\"\n\nRough showing in polls\n\nPolls conducted in early September illustrated Adams' challenges. One poll by The New York Times and Siena University and another by Quinnipiac University showed likely voters favoring Mamdani over Cuomo, with Sliwa and Adams trailing further behind.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll suggested the gap between Mamdani and Cuomo could narrow if Adams dropped out. The Times/Siena poll suggested that if both Adams and Sliwa withdrew, Mamdani's advantage over Cuomo could shrink even further.\n\nSliwa, though, has repeatedly insisted he will not quit under any circumstances.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump administration intermediaries interested in blocking Mamdani's path to victory by getting him into a one-on-one matchup with Cuomo had approached Adams to see if he could be coaxed out of the contest with an offer of a government job.\n\nAmid reports on those discussions, Adams called a news conference where he pledged to keep running and derided Cuomo and Mamdani as \"spoiled brats.\" Later, Adams went even further on social media, calling Cuomo \"a liar and a snake.\"\n\nIndictment overshadows progress\n\nAdams, 65, is the city's second Black mayor. A former New York City police captain and Brooklyn borough president, he took office in 2022 promising to crack down on crime and revitalize the city with his signature \"swagger\" as it recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn his signature issue, he succeeded. Crime rates that ticked upward after COVID-19 hit the city has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, though it is unclear how much that had to do with Adams' policies.\n\nBut Adams' focus on reducing crime and disorder has been overshadowed, time and again, by swirling scandals, corruption probes and lawsuits that have alleged rampant favor-trading at the highest levels of city government.\n\nOver a head-spinning period of weeks last year, his police commissioner, schools chancellor and several deputy mayors resigned following a series of federal raids on their homes. None have faced criminal charges.\n\nThen, in late September, federal prosecutors brought fraud and bribery charges against Adams himself, saying he had accepted illegal campaign contributions and steep travel discounts from a Turkish official and others in exchange for accelerating the opening of Turkey's diplomatic building, among other favors.\n\nTrump intervenes\n\nAdams denied wrongdoing and pledged to remain in office as he fought the case in court. But he also began speaking warmly about Trump, who was then seen as having a growing chance of regaining the White House. He defended Trump in media briefings, urged his own party to tone down rhetoric against the Republican, refrained from criticizing him and also largely stopped promoting the campaign of Trump's Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter Trump won, Adams met with Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, and pledged the city's cooperation with some aspects of the new administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nThen, in February, Trump's Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges against Adams so the mayor could assist with the Republican president's immigration agenda.\n\nThe extraordinary intervention set off a fresh round of tumult in City Hall and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, with some of Adams' closest allies suggesting he had struck a deal with the White House for his freedom.\n\nAdams announced he would skip the June Democratic primary but would stay in the race.\n\nSummer brings no reprieve\n\nSince returning to the campaign trail this summer, Adams, who often describes himself as \"perfectly imperfect,\" once again found himself surrounded by scandal.\n\nIn late August, his former top advisor - who served as a campaign volunteer - was hit with fresh bribery charges. Another former aide was removed from the campaign after handing a potato chip bag full of cash to a local reporter.\n\nIn the final weeks of his campaign, he had rejected mounting calls to bow out to give Cuomo a better shot at beating Mamdani.\n\n\"History is going to be kind to me when I'm out of the political spotlight 10, 15 years from now, and they look over and say: You know what? We got to give this guy his due,\" Adams said recently. \"That's what I'm fighting for.\"","summary":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams has abandoned his campaign for reelection.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-abandons-reelection-campaign/17899172/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17899175_092825-wls-adams-no-relex-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 18:06:07","author":"Jake Offenhartz And Anthony Izaguirre","authors":["Jake Offenhartz And Anthony Izaguirre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":364283310,"title":"Food pantries in Maine are running out of food...and volunteers.

They did so by comparing these rioting left-wing losers to the American soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day during World War II. After all, “antifa” supposedly just stands for “anti-fascist.”\n\nPaul Farhi of the Washington Post called D-Day soldiers the “original antifa.” Mara Liasson of NPR posted a photo of D-Day and called it the “biggest antifa rally in history.” Chris Cuomo, then of CNN, defended antifa on multiple occasions with these comparisons, as did the Lincoln Project operatives and members of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns.\n\nThis normalization of street violence set the stage nicely for the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020, with violent left-wingers in Democrat-run cities and states learning that they would not be held accountable for street violence, and that their side would ignore, defend, or even justify their violent acts. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris vindicated that idea when she promoted the bail fund for rioters and other violent criminals in Minneapolis during the BLM riots.\n\nThe most obvious example of prominent left-wingers celebrating terrorists is the aftermath of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack against Israel in 2023. Palestinian terrorists invaded Israel, slaughtered 1,200 men, women, and children, and took over 200 hostages back to Gaza. The despicable attack should have been roundly and relentlessly condemned.\n\nBut Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) were unable to provide that moral clarity. Instead, they treated Hamas leaders as unassailable reporters of the truth whose word must be taken as fact, peddling Hamas propaganda about both specific incidents — such as the fabricated ‘Israel bombed a hospital’ story and the fictional “genocide” in Gaza. The cause they have taken up paints Hamas as heroic resistance fighters by necessity.\n\nOther Democratic politicians have then ignored pro-Hamas demonstrations on campus, including the illegal encampments that have led to antisemitism and violence on college campuses. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg dropped charges against multiple Columbia University students who trespassed in a university building and effectively took janitors hostage.\n\nThe worst has come from university professors and other education officials, who have gone as far as to glorify the antisemitic terrorists responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks. You can sort through the various lists of pro-terrorist professors and pick out your favorites, but a few stand out. A Cornell University professor called the rape and murder of Israeli civilians “exhilarating” and “energizing.” A Virginia Tech professor said, “We must refuse those who demand that we condemn Palestinian violence.” A professor at the University of Chicago celebrated the massacre as “Morning freedom.”\n\nThe celebration of terrorists at universities goes beyond Hamas. Weather Underground terrorists were responsible for bombings and other acts of domestic terrorism through the 1960s and 1970s, and leader Bill Ayers lamented in 2001 that he didn’t get to do enough bombings. He went on to become a much-celebrated professor at the University of Chicago. Kathy Boudin was in the same terrorist group when she and others went on to kill a security guard and two police officers in an armed robbery. She spent more than a decade as a professor at Columbia, while fellow terrorist conspirator David Gilbert was praised as a humanitarian when his sentence was commuted by then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2021.\n\nLiberal media is not immune to the terrorist glorification and whitewashing either. The New York Times has turned its opinion pages over to a Taliban terrorist wanted by the FBI for killing six people and to an eco-terrorist who has called for committing domestic terrorism and blowing up pipelines. In the latter piece, the man who wrote a book titled “How to Blow Up a Pipeline” called for “sabotage” against not just pipelines but terminals, cranes, and mines.\n\nMurderous dictators\n\nDemocrats and left-wing professors have also praised and whitewashed dictators and authoritarian regimes throughout the years, often speaking of them in more glowing terms than they use for Republicans and other conservatives. Former vice presidential nominee and current Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz praised Chinese communism as a system where “everyone is the same and everyone shares,” and everyone gets food and housing. Aside from downplaying the authoritarianism of China’s police state, Chinese communism only took roughly 65 million dead bodies to reach Walz’s ideal political state.\n\nCuban dictator Fidel Castro and hatchet man Che Guevara are also popular in left-wing circles, despite their body count hitting five digits. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Rep. and current mayor of Los Angeles Karen Bass, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus have all praised Castro. Then-President Barack Obama posed for a photo in Cuba in front of a giant mural of Guevara, a cult hero among the most left-wing students and professors on college campuses. Black Lives Matter hero Colin Kaepernick, in the twilight of his NFL career, tried to lecture people about Castro’s greatness before playing a game in Miami, the city known for being full of refugees from the horrors of Castro’s regime.\n\nYES, CELEBRATING MURDER IS GROUNDS FOR SOCIAL EXILE\n\nThe New York Times obituary section praised Castro as a “fiery apostle of revolution” who “defied the United States for nearly half a century,” hailing the “medical advances” of his communist regime and noting his “admirers from around the world, including some Americans, were impressed with the way that healthcare and literacy in Cuba had improved.” The outlet also marked the anniversary of Chinese dictator Mao Zedong’s death by highlighting his rise from “an obscure peasant” to “one of history’s greatest revolutionary figures.” That was deemed the appropriate framing for history’s single-greatest mass murderer.\n\nAll of this has persisted as Democrats, professors, liberal “journalists” and pundits, and left-wing activists all run around calling Republicans fascists who are going to kill us all. Is it any wonder, then, that a political movement that venerates terrorists, street thugs, and Fidel Castro is going to develop a culture of violence against its domestic political opponents who disagree with them on tax policy or immigration?

Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.”\n\nSomehow, she reckoned, the electorate that chose a black man whose middle name is Hussein would not vote for a gay man who had served in the military.\n\nShe did not admit that Buttigieg had other weaknesses — such as having done a shockingly poor job as transportation secretary, disappearing for two months in the midst of an acute cargo crisis in 2021; or presiding over several massive nationwide airport shutdowns; or spending tens of millions on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) in air traffic control, rather than on qualified employees and urgent upgrades.\n\nInstead, she blamed voters’ perceived anti-gay prejudices — as well as Americans’ supposed misogyny, racism, and antisemitism. Perhaps the voters she had in mind were her own Democrats: she reportedly turned down Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a running mate because anti-Israel and antisemitic “progressives” did not like the fact that he was Jewish and pro-Israel.\n\nBut her overall explanation betrays a contempt for Americans in general that underscores the fact that she was never suited to lead the country.\n\nJoel B.

The editorial board recounted Harris' several interviews last week, which included conversations with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and ABC's \"The View.\" The board wrote she \"managed to put on a book tour even less compelling than her presidential campaign.\" \"Harris offered her first major interview since leaving office, to a predictably deferential MSNBC. Yet even on friendly turf, the former vice president seemed uncomfortable and inauthentic,\" the editors wrote. The editorial board called out Harris' explanation for skipping over former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a possible VP pick, as well as why she refused to create distance between herself and former President Joe Biden while she was campaigning. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS \"Is Harris a brilliant political mind who simply freezes up in front of cameras? Alas, taking the time to organize her thoughts in writing doesn’t help much. Indeed, virtually every page of her book, ‘107 Days,’ offers a glaring reminder of why she failed to close the deal,\" the editors continued. The editorial board said Harris was attempting to settle scores throughout the book and accused her of having \"the sort of small-mindedness that Democrats rightly knock President Donald Trump for.\" \"A once and perhaps future presidential candidate should have a better grasp on what presidential leadership sounds like, even in a self-serving memoir. Instead, Harris creates the image of herself as an A student who tells interviewers her greatest weakness is that she’s just too much of a perfectionist,\" the board continued. KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, MEDIA TOUR SLAMMED BY LIBERAL CRITICS AS 'EMBARRASSING' AND 'UNHELPFUL' \"The best that can be said about Harris’s step back into the spotlight is that it’s happening now. Democrats have a real shot at victory in 2028, but they won’t have time to waste on someone like the former vice president,\" they concluded. Harris' media tour and book were criticized by other liberal media figures this week as well, including former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza. \"Harris’ recent media tour to tout her memoir — ‘107 Days’ — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn’t gotten much better over her decades in the business,\" Cillizza wrote in his Substack.

Biden's debate performance against Donald Trump in 2024 was viewed as an abject failure, with the Democratic president tripping over his words, losing his train of thought and displaying a raspy voice attributed to a cold during the event. Harris argued that Biden whiffed an easy question on the military and omitted any acknowledgment of the 13 U.S. service members who died during the Afghanistan withdrawal. She also pointed to his claims that he was \"the only president this century\" and \"this decade\" who did not have any troops \"dying anywhere in the world.\" KAMALA HARRIS REJECTS IDEA THAT BUNGLED 'VIEW' INTERVIEW WAS TIPPING POINT IN CAMPAIGN Harris in her book, however, identified those who were killed as \"13 marines,\" — except it was not all Marines who died during the withdrawal. Eleven Marines, one soldier and one Navy corpsman were killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul Airport's Abbey Gate. Harris explained in her book that Biden first faced a question on the economy during his debate in June 2024, which she said was rushed, with Biden showing \"no light in his eyes, no expression in his voice.\" The next question was on the military, and included Biden omitting an acknowledgment of the horrific attack that plagued his administration as one of its greatest failures. \"He’s got so much material on this—Trump calling our fallen soldiers 'suckers and losers,'\" Harris wrote of what ran through her head when Biden was asked about his role as commander-in-chief. KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION \"He managed to get off that line but had stepped on it earlier by saying no one had died in wars overseas on his watch, seeming to forget the thirteen marines who died in the bomb blast at the airport during the evacuation of Afghanistan. I’d been on Air Force Two when it happened, and we had to change our flight plan to get back to DC in the face of that tragedy. How could he overlook that day?\" she wrote, expressing her surprise over the response, but misidentifying those who were all killed as members of the Marines Corps. \"I know his deep feelings for those men and women. It’s personal to him,\" she added. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' The Biden administration repeatedly came under fire for its handling of the Afghan withdrawal. It was viewed as paving the road for adversaries such as Russia to invade Ukraine, as the U.S. looked weak on the international stage, critics such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at the time. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan upon the U.S.' withdrawal. The families who lost loved ones during the botched withdrawal previously slammed Biden and Harris for their deaths, including launching a scathing defense attack against Harris when she was running for president. Parents and other loved ones claimed that the \"administration killed my son\" and that they \"have not seen any support from you or your administration.\" KAMALA HARRIS COMPLAINS ABOUT 'IMPOSSIBLE' LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BIDEN'S COMMS TEAM, INNER CIRCLE Biden added fuel to the fire of the botched withdrawal criticisms when he appeared on a tarmac during a dignified transfer ceremony of those killed in 2021 and was seen looking at his watch. Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office for comment on the section of the book, including a response as to why Harris stated the 13 service members were all identified as \"marines,\" but did not immediately receive responses. Biden's office declined to comment. Harris' book, \"107 Days,\" hit store shelves Tuesday and reflects on the former vice president's truncated presidential campaign cycle after Biden dropped out of the race amid mounting concern over his mental acuity.

It sits at the southern end of San Francisco Bay in the heart of Silicon Valley. The median household income there, according to data released this month from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, was $181,913.\n\nThat was more than twice the national median household income of $81,604.\n\nBut the median household income of $181,913 in California’s 17th Congressional District only narrowly beat California’s 16th District, which sits to the south and west and north of the 17th and also includes parts of Silicon Valley. The median household income there was $181,659.\n\nIn the 2024 election in California’s 17th Congressional District, Democrat incumbent Rep. Ro Khanna defeated Republican nominee Anita Chen 67.7% to 32.3%. In the same district, Harris defeated Trump 67% to 29%.\n\nIn the neighboring 16th District, a Republican candidate did not even make it into the final congressional election, which in California pits the top candidate from an open primary against the second-place candidate. In the 2024 general election in this district, Democrat congressional candidate Sam Liccardo beat fellow Democrat Evan Low 58.2 to 41.8%.\n\nIn this second-wealthiest district in the nation, Harris beat Trump 72% to 24%.\n\nThe third- and fourth-wealthiest congressional districts in 2024 were on the other side of the continent in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.\n\nVirginia’s 11th District, which had the nation’s third-highest median household income ($158,109), sits in Fairfax County. In 2024, it reelected incumbent Democrat Rep. Gerry Connolly, who beat Republican candidate Michael Van Meter 66.7% to 33.0%.\n\nAfter Connolly passed away in May, Democrat candidate James Walkinshaw won a special election on Sept. 9, beating Republican candidate Stewart Whitson 75.14% to 24.67%.\n\nIn this same district, Harris beat Trump 65.18% to 31.18% in the 2024 election.\n\nVirginia’s 10th District, which had the nation’s fourth-highest median household income ($157,863), sits to the south and west of the 11th District. It had a closer congressional election in 2024. But Democrat candidate Suhas Subramanyam still won, beating Republican candidate Mike Clancy 52.3% to 47.7%.\n\nNew York’s 12th District, which straddles Central Park in Manhattan, had the fifth-highest median household income ($153,117). Incumbent Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler defeated Republican candidate Mike Zumbluskas 80.5% to 19.5% in this district—and Harris beat Trump here 81% to 17%.\n\nThe sixth-wealthiest congressional district was California’s 10th ($151,546), which sits in the East Bay suburbs. In this district, Democrat Rep. Mark DeSaulnier beat Republican candidate Katherine Piccinini 66.5% to 33.5%. Harris beat Trump 81% to 17%.\n\nThe seventh-wealthiest district was California’s 15th ($151,546), which includes the western side of the San Francisco peninsula and part of the city of San Francisco. In this district, incumbent Democrat Rep. Kevin Mullin defeated Republican candidate Anna Cheng Kramer 73.1% to 26.9%. Harris beat Trump 72% to 24%.\n\nMaryland’s 8th Congressional District was also the eighth wealthiest in the country ($146,362). In this district, incumbent Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin defeated Republican candidate Cheryl Riley 77.0% to 20.5%. Harris beat Trump 76.01% to 20.17%.\n\nCalifornia’s 11th District, which includes most of the city of San Francisco, was the nation’s ninth-wealthiest congressional district ($142,524). Incumbent Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, defeated Republican candidate Bruce Lou 81.0% to 19.0% in this district. Harris beat Trump 82% to 14%.\n\nNew Jersey’s 11th District, which is in the northern part of the state, was the 10th-wealthiest congressional district ($141,429). Incumbent Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican candidate Joseph Belnome 56.5% to 41.8% here. Harris beat Trump 53% to 45%.\n\nNew York’s 3rd Congressional District, the 11th wealthiest in the country ($138,234), was the only one of the 15 wealthiest congressional districts to vote for Trump (51%) over Harris (47%). But it still reelected its Democrat incumbent Rep. Thomas Suozzi. He defeated Republican candidate Michael LiPetri Jr. 51.8% to 48.2%.\n\nThe wealthiest congressional district to elect a Republican in 2024 was Georgia’s 7th District, which sits north of Atlanta and ranked as the nation’s 16th-wealthiest district ($135,546). Republican Rep. Rich McCormick beat Democrat candidate Bob Christian 64.9% to 35.1% in this district in 2024. Trump beat Harris in this district 60.5% to 38.4%.\n\nAfter Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” was enacted this summer, a Tax Foundation analysis said, “We estimate the OBBBA [One Big Beautiful Bill Act] will reduce federal taxes on average for individual taxpayers in every state.”\n\n“Across all individual tax filers throughout the country, the average tax cut per taxpayer will be $3,752 in 2026,” said this analysis.\n\nEvery House Democrat voted against this bill, including, of course, those who represent the 15 wealthiest districts in the country.\n\n“Is it beautiful to do this? To give tax cuts to billionaires in our country?” asked Pelosi, who represents the nation’s ninth wealthiest district.\n\nWhat was beautiful was that it not only cut taxes for people in Pelosi’s district, but for people who work for a living all across this country.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Is Gavin Newsom glad she did?","text":"Democrats, despite their hypersensitive, bleeding-heart reputation, can be harsh. Ruthless, even. When it comes to picking their presidential nominee, it’s often one and done. Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore and John Kerry were embraced and then, after leading their party to disappointing defeat, cast off like so many wads of wet tissue. Compare that with Republicans, who not only believe in second chances but, more often than not, seem to prefer their presidential candidates recycled. Over the last half century, all but a few of the GOP’s nominees have had at least one failed White House bid on their resume. The roster of retreads includes the current occupant of the Oval Office, who is only the second president in U.S. history to regain the perch after losing it four years prior. Why the difference? It would take a psychologist or geneticist to determine if there’s something in the minds or molecular makeup of party faithful, which could explain their varied treatment of those humbled and vanquished. Regardless, it suggests the blowback facing Kamala Harris and the campaign diary she published last week is happening right on cue. And it doesn't portend well for another try at the White House in 2028, should the former vice president and U.S. senator from California pursue that path. The criticism has come in assorted flavors. Joe Biden loyalists — many of whom were never great fans of Harris — have bristled at her relatively mild criticisms of the obviously aged and physically declining president. (She leaves it to her husband, former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, to vent about the \"impossible, s— jobs\" Harris was given and, in spite of that, the failure of the president and first lady to defend Harris during her low points.) The notable lack of self-blame has rankled other Democrats. Aside from some couldas and shouldas, Harris largely ascribes her defeat to insufficient time to make her case to voters — just 107 days, the title of her book — which hardly sits well with those who feel Harris squandered the time she did have. More generally, some Democrats fault the former vice president for resurfacing, period, rather than slinking off and disappearing forever into some deep, dark hole. It's a familiar gripe each time the party struggles to move past a presidential defeat; Hillary Clinton faced a similar backlash when she published her inside account after losing to Donald Trump in 2016. That critique assumes great masses of voters devour campaign memoirs with the same voracious appetite as those who surrender their Sundays to the Beltway chat shows, or mainline political news like a continuous IV drip. They do not. Let the record show Democrats won the White House in 2020 even though Clinton bobbed back up in 2017 and, for a short while, thwarted the party's fervent desire to \"turn the page.\" But there are those avid consumers of campaigns and elections, and for the political fiends among us Harris offers plenty of fizz, much of it involving her party peers and prospective 2028 rivals. Pete Buttigieg, the meteoric star of the 2020 campaign, was her heartfelt choice for vice president, but Harris said she feared the combination of a Black woman and gay running mate would exceed the load-bearing capacity of the electorate. (News to me, Buttigieg said after Harris revealed her thinking, and an underestimation of the American people.) Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the runner-up to Harris' ultimate vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, comes across as unseemly salivating and greedily lusting after the job. (He fired back by suggesting Harris has some splainin' to do about what she knew of Biden's infirmities and when she knew it.) Harris implies Govs. JB Pritzker and Gretchen Whitmer of Illinois and Michigan, respectively, were insufficiently gung-ho after Biden stepped aside and she became the Democratic nominee-in-waiting. But for California readers, the most toothsome morsel involves Harris' longtime frenemy, Gov. Gavin Newsom. The two, who rose to political power in the early 2000s on parallel tracks in San Francisco, have long had a complicated relationship, mixing mutual aid with jealousy and jostling. In her book, Harris recounts the hours after Biden's sudden withdrawal, when she began telephoning top Democrats around the country to lock in their support. In contrast to the enthusiasm many displayed, Newsom responded tersely with a text message: \"Hiking. Will call back.\" He never did, Harris noted, pointedly, though Newsom did issue a full-throated endorsement within hours, which the former vice president failed to mention. It's small-bore stuff. But the fact Harris chose to include that anecdote speaks to the tetchiness underlying the warmth and fuzziness that California's two most prominent Democrats put on public display. Will the two face off in 2028? Riding the promotional circuit, Harris has repeatedly sidestepped the inevitable questions about another presidential bid. “That’s not my focus right now,” she told Rachel Maddow, in a standard-issue non-denial denial. For his part, Newsom is obviously running, though he won't say so. There would be something operatic, or at least soap-operatic, about the two longtime competitors openly vying for the country's ultimate political prize — though it's hard to see Democrats, with their persistent hunger for novelty, turning to Harris or her left-coast political doppelganger as their savior. Meantime, the two are back on parallel tracks, though seemingly headed in opposite directions. While Newsom is looking to build Democratic bridges, Harris is burning hers down.","summary":"The former vice president's campaign diary takes aim at several of her fellow Democrats, including California's governor.

Tom Cruise will be yet another American celebrity who won’t integrate into the community.”\n\nOther villagers have complained that stars “don’t speak to us” and prefer to frequent upmarket venues such as The Bull in Charlbury while ignoring local pubs.\n\nThe gastropub recently hosted a pre-wedding dinner for Steve Jobs’ daughter Eve and Olympian Harry Charles, with former US Vice President Kamala Harris among the guests.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance’s family holiday to the hamlet of Dean last month sparked road closures, police checkpoints and the arrival of sniffer dogs — fuelling resentment among locals. Protesters waved signs telling Vance to “go home” and “make Charlbury great again.”\n\nCruise, however, is likely to be welcomed by friends David and Victoria Beckham, who live in a converted farmhouse in nearby Great Tew. Also close by is the exclusive members’ club Soho Farmhouse, where Cruise marked his 60th birthday in 2022 alongside guests including James Corden and Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThe actor’s property empire already includes several mansions in Beverly Hills and a £35million penthouse in Knightsbridge, west London.\n\nHe is dating Cuban actress Ana de Armas, 37, who he met while filming in Oxfordshire last year.

However, Democrats are hopeful that Trump’s wavering approval rating could hurt Collins in an era of heightened polarization and declining ticket splitting, as the state backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points last year.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nWood, 35, has been in D.C. before, serving as chief of staff to former Representative Katie Porter and as political director for End Citizens United. He was born and raised in Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine. He faces several other Democrats in the primary and is hoping his anti-corruption focus will resonate with Mainers.\n\nGenerational change is among the concerns he hears most from on the campaign trail, Wood said.\n\n“I hear it most from older voters who watched what we went through with Joe Biden, where an elder statesman, someone who has served this country in the Senate since he was, I think, younger than me, but clinging to power and not willing to pass the torch and bring in generational change. The consequences of that we are dealing with now,” he said.\n\nHe said that having younger leaders in Congress could help legislators address more of the issues facing young Americans. \n\nYounger Americans also see Congress as “detached” from the issues they are most concerned about—one way his campaign is “different” from others in the past that ran against Collins.\n\n“If we had more senators who had graduated college with massive amounts of student loan debt, I think we would have solved this problem. If we had more senators who had as much exposure to gun violence as I have, and so many young people have, we would have solved that problem,” he said.\n\nWood said he was moved to jump into the race after he and his husband had their first child earlier this year.\n\n“My daughter was a big part of ultimately deciding to run to and how I think about the future and the work in front of us to make sure that our children grow up in a country that respects the rule of law that embraces democracy and stands up for what’s right,” he said.\n\nHe said he believes the campaign is about two major issues: the need to end political corruption and affordability. \n\nIssues around the cost of living have become “too much to overcome,” he said.\n\n“The theme of this campaign, since we started, has been Maine courage, not just concern. Courage to stand up to Donald Trump in what I believe is this lawless, unconstitutional behavior coming from the White House, but also courage to stand up for working people in families like the one I grew up in,” Wood said.\n\nWhen it comes to issues like health care, Maine is already facing challenges, such as the risk to rural hospitals and the closure of maternity wards across the state, he said. He said he believes Congress should work toward a single-payer system, such as Medicare-for-All, and that the first step would be to create a public option in the marketplace.\n\nOn tariffs, Wood said that the implementation has been “haphazard, chaotic, and senseless,” hitting Maine’s economy hard, particularly in coastal towns like Old Orchard Beach and Ogunquit that have seen reduced tourism from Canada.\n\nStill, he said he believes parts of towns, including his hometown of Lewiston, have been “left behind” by trade deals.\n\n“Truthfully, a lot of these trade deals were driven by corporate America and the wealthiest, and that’s who’s benefited from these. Growing up in Lewiston, and spending time in mill towns across the state, I know what that looks like,” he said.\n\nWood on Plans to End Corruption and Strengthen Democracy\n\nWood’s emphasis on corruption stems from his time advocating for issues like climate change or gun safety reform, he said, noting that after the Citizens United Supreme Court case, he realized how big money “is really standing in the way of our ability to deliver” on key issues.\n\n“If you’re trying to influence a member of Congress by advocating for policy, you shouldn’t also be able to leverage money. That’s what voters want,” he said. “These reforms are essential to earning back the trust of working people, everyday people in our country to know that the policy solutions that Congress is passing are done in their best interest only, not because of donors or special interests.”\n\nThis decline in trust in democracy has played a role in fueling growing political violenc...","summary":"Jordan Wood, a Democrat running for Senate in Maine, told Newsweek it is time for new leadership in Washington, D.C.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/susan-collins-challenger-calls-generational-change-jordan-wood-10788973","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Susan-Collins-Challenger-Calls-for-Generational-Change.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 09:00:00","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.29},{"id":364180530,"title":"Donald Trump’s Approval Rating Is Shifting With Women","text":"President Donald Trump’s approval rating among women voters appears to be rebounding slightly after hitting a low point in August, according to new polling data.\n\nIn July, women gave the president a 31 percent approval and 65 percent disapproval rating (-34 net), according to Quinnipiac University polling. By August, that figure slipped to 29 percent approval and 65 percent disapproval (-36 net), the lowest point in months. But September’s polling shows a modest recovery, with 32 percent approving and 61 percent disapproving (-29 net).\n\nWhile the numbers suggest some stabilization, the polling was conducted before Trump’s recent remarks about Tylenol use during pregnancy, which have already drawn scrutiny from medical experts and could affect future support among women.\n\nWomen’s Issues Take Center Stage in Trump’s Second Term\n\nSince returning to the White House in January 2025, Trump has repeatedly made women’s issues and gender policy a centerpiece of his agenda—often in ways that triggered fierce backlash. \n\nOn his first day, he signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to define sex strictly as male or female and roll back protections for transgender people. Days later, he banned transgender individuals from serving in the military, a move tied up in court but allowed to proceed. In February, Trump expanded these efforts with measures aimed at “keeping men out of women’s sports,” and by mid-summer, his administration issued guidance directing agencies to enforce sex-based distinctions in personnel and workplace policies.\n\nPolling suggests women voters reacted negatively. In YouGov/Economist surveys, Trump’s approval among women slid from 43 percent approve/47 percent disapprove in January (-4 net) to 43 percent approve/50 percent disapprove in March (-7 net).\n\n The sharper decline was seen in Quinnipiac polling, where women’s approval fell from 36 percent approve/53 percent disapprove in January (-17 net) to just 32 percent approve/63 percent disapprove in March (-31 net), a double-digit drop in two months.\n\nIn September, Trump turned his attention to maternal health, warning pregnant women against taking Tylenol and suggesting it could be linked to autism. His administration announced new research initiatives and ordered the FDA to review labeling, even as medical experts said the claims were misleading and not supported by scientific consensus. How this episode will affect Trump’s standing with women remains uncertain.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a signed executive order in the Oval Office at the White House on September 25, 2025.\n\nTrump has a long record of incendiary remarks about women, ranging from political rivals to public figures and even allies’ spouses.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly targeted then-Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning her intelligence and mental fitness. At a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania in 2024 he called Harris “mentally impaired,” claimed she was “born that way,” and described her as “Lyin’ Kamala Harris,” before adding, “Something’s wrong … there is definitely something missing.” At other events, he has mocked her with labels such as “dumb,” “low IQ,” and “stupid.”\n\nHis insults have extended beyond politics. In 2018, after a judge dismissed adult film actress Stormy Daniels’ defamation lawsuit against him, Trump called her “horseface” on social media, prompting widespread backlash.\n\nEven in diplomatic settings, Trump has drawn criticism for comments about women’s appearance. During a 2017 state visit to Paris, he greeted French First Lady Brigitte Macron by remarking, “You’re in such good shape,” repeating it before adding “Beautiful” — comments widely reported by international outlets at the time.\n\nTrump has also been reported to offer advice to men facing allegations of misconduct. In Bob Woodward’s book Fear: Trump in the White House, Trump is quoted telling a friend accused of inappropriate behavior: “You’ve got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women. If you admit to anything and any culpability, then you’re dead. … You’ve got to push back hard … Never admit.” \n\nTrump’s history of disparaging comments about women has also been underscored by a long line of sexual misconduct allegations which he has consistently denied.\n\nMike Tappin, an honorary fellow at Keele University and co-author of American Politics Today, told Newsweek that this explains why the majority of women have not voted for Trump in the past. “Hardly presidential, or even respectful. You can understand the gender gap,” he said.\n\nGains on the Economy and Trade\n\nBut polling shows that Trump is regaining some ground with women on the economy and trade.\n\nOn the economy, Trump’s net approval among women fell to -37 in August, but it rebounded sharply to -27 in September, his strongest showing since July. The same pattern emerged on trade, where his rating dropped to -36 in August before improving to -28 this m...","summary":"Donald Trump’s approval rating among women voters appears to be rebounding slightly after hitting a low point in August.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-shifting-women-10786777","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25268827454086.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 09:00:00","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":364173840,"title":"Democrats’ rhetoric shows they can’t be trusted on immigration ","text":"Jahn’s anti-ICE attack was not an isolated incident. In July, 11 anti-ICE activists set an ambush at another ICE facility, in Alvarado, Texas, and shot an officer in the neck. Fortunately, he survived. This comes after a fire bomb was thrown at ICE officers in Portland, Oregon, a Border Patrol officer was shot in McAllen, Texas, and an ICE building in Yakima, Washington, was burned.\n\nDemocrats say they oppose violence against ICE, but their rhetoric is reason to doubt. Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) have called ICE “the Gestapo,” Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Delia Ramirez (D-IL) have called ICE a “terrorist organization,” and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) has compared ICE to “slave patrols.” How should good people be expected to react to the presence and actions of Nazis, terrorists, and slavers? \n\nShouldn’t the Gestapo and slave patrols be met with forceful resistance? If so, how is comparing ICE to such people not a call to violence?\n\nDemocrats have blurred what used to be an obvious and bright line between speech and violence. Holding signs and shouting at ICE agents is protected speech. Standing in front of ICE vehicles and preventing the transportation of detainees is obstruction of justice. House Democratic candidates now compete to see who can obstruct ICE agents the most. Blocking cars is just a step away from throwing rocks and slashing tires. Once some violence against ICE is normalized, lethal violence is not far behind. Both these candidates have called for the abolition of ICE as a law enforcement agency.\n\nAs bad as the link between Democratic rhetoric and anti-ICE violence is, the larger problem for Democrats is that they still don’t accept that ICE is a necessary part of immigration policy.\n\nSince former Vice President Kamala Harris’s election loss last November, some Democrats have tried to address the party’s immigration problem by embracing tougher standards for asylum-seekers and paying to hire more Border Patrol agents.\n\nBut what is still verboten among Democrats is support for ICE and its mission, deporting illegal aliens. Democrats say they support the deportation of illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes such as rape and murder, but they cannot bring themselves to accept that those who broke the law to enter the country should be kicked out. Even if bipartisan legislation were to be passed fixing the asylum system, fixing high-skill immigration, and fixing guest worker programs, the federal government would still need a law enforcement agency to deport people here illegally. Before Biden’s illegal immigrant invasion, more than half of illegal immigrants entered legally and then overstayed their visas. Without ICE, we would have no way of sending them back to their home countries. If we build a system without ICE that allows people to stay forever, we don’t really have an immigration policy at all.\n\nTRUMP PROTECTS AMERICAN WORKERS WITH H1B REFORMPresident Donald Trump’s goal of 3,000 deportations a day is causing unnecessary strain in immigrant communities, driving down his approval on immigration as an issue. But as unpopular as aggressive deportations are, poll after poll shows Democrats are less trusted on the issue. They deserve it. Their anti-ICE rhetoric shows they still reject the agency’s core mission and lack the will necessary to enforce the law.","summary":"Democrats continue to compare Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Gestapo.

That’s why Carr came out swinging, reminding ABC and Disney they have business before his agency, which under law he could throttle if they didn’t at least put Kimmel in the penalty box. \n\nIt didn’t matter. The left and its MSM allies claimed the Constitution was being burned before our very eyes. Trump and his FCC chair were staging a totalitarian coup. Disney unsuspended Kimmel. \n\nSorry guys, Brendan Carr is far from the first — or worst — practitioner of alleged First Amendment overreach. In fact, you can make a good case that his invoking of the Communications Act of 1934 to enforce its “public interest” guidelines on free, local TV (as opposed to cable) is exactly what Congress meant when it sought to curtail stuff like obscenity or Kimmel’s shameless prevaricating. \n\nLiberal agitprop \n\nLet’s be real: We’re in an age where there’s good evidence of “60 Minutes” interviews edited to make Kamala Harris sound smarter, and make Joe Biden sound less sleepy. ABC’s “The View” is regarded as a news program even as it features left-wing women bantering about their -hatred of all things Trump. \n\nKimmel’s comment fits nicely into this relentless stream of leftist agitprop we see on regulated airwaves that are supposed to provide both sides of the political -debate. \n\nHow did we get to this point? Go back in history to thank the thought police under the Obama administration, which it turns out has much to do with the biased and quite frankly anti-free-speech content you have been seeing all over network TV for years. \n\nIn particular, let’s recall the dozens of conditions it imposed on Comcast in 2011 to greenlight the cable-TV giant’s $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal. Those included some very un-free-speechy stuff — not only who must be hired by the company, with a strict emphasis on now dubiously legal Diversity Equity and Inclusion measures — but also what should appear on the air. \n\n“NBCU will report annually on its diversity efforts with particular emphasis on programming/content, procurement and pipeline programs,” the consent decree stated. It would make those disclosures not just to the US government but to a slew of race-based organizations including the NAACP. \n\nIf you’re wondering why you rarely see conservatives on Colbert, who is conceivably to the left of Kimmel, or why Al Sharpton is a long-running host on MSNBC and a contributor to “news” content on NBC, this is it. \n\nComcast told me it stopped complying with the consent decree when its term ended in 2018, but I found that its DEI obsession with metrics on hiring and programming remains largely intact. It proudly stated as much on its website until earlier in the year when Carr launched an inquiry into Comcast’s practices.\n\nOnline censorship \n\nJust last week, Google admitted it canceled YouTube creators who were off message on COVID-19 following “repeated and sustained outreach” from “senior Biden officials, including White House officials,” in response to a GOP House investigation into online censorship by Bidenistas. \n\nFacebook faced similar pressure. Biden’s free-speech assault included putting pressure on the likes of JPMorgan and Bank of America to “debank” conservatives including a certain conservative in the White House. \n\nTell me, did Brendan Carr invent debanking as well?","summary":"FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is far from the first — or worst — practitioner of alleged First Amendment overreach.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/27/business/no-trumps-fcc-is-not-going-after-free-speech-but-the-left-has-been-stifling-open-debate-for-years/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-xpzwtw2ud-1759018972054.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1759004664&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 01:36:03","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":364074964,"title":"\"You don’t need 107 days\" - Bill Maher reacts to Kamala Harris' extended book tour, saying people like her less the more they know her","text":"American comedian and actor Bill Maher recently commented on Kamala Harris' extended book tour.

He put forth his view, saying how the more the public got to know Harris, \"the less they liked her.\"Commenting on the book and its concept, Bill Maher said, “You don’t need 107 days.

However, the former Vice President talked Joe Biden out of the plan as it would hurt her chances of securing delegates to ensure a place in the party's nomination.Kamala Harris also wrote about when Joe Biden spoke to the nation to explain his decision to drop out of the presidential race, \"it was almost nine minutes into the eleven-minute address before he mentioned me.\"Additionally, Kamala Harris mentioned another instance of the same, citing Joe Biden's speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2024, stating: \"He spoke for nearly an hour, detailing the accomplishments of our administration. It was a legacy speech for him, not an argument for me, and he was entitled to it. But if we waited for some personal stories about working with me and what qualities he had seen that led him to endorse me, they weren't there.\"Kamala Harris' election campaign memoir, 107 Days, was released on September 23, 2025.

Sherrill has been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue. She voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, twice, when the bill was first proposed in 2023, and again this past February when it was re-introduced. Sherrill has also co-sponsored the Equality Act, but also co-sponsored the Transgender Bill of Rights, which more explicitly \"guarantees certain rights for transgender and nonbinary people with respect to public services and accommodations.\" Sherrill is a self-proclaimed \"advocate for women’s athletics.\" She previously proposed the Women in NCAA Sports Act in the U.S. House of Representatives alongside Rep. Maria Salazar D-Fla., and led a resolution to honor Billie Jean King with the Congressional Gold Medal. However, she has recently been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports. Former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer and women's sports activist Paula Scanlan, the first UPenn swimmer to speak up about the school's Lia Thomas controversy in 2022, called out Sherrill on X over the issue this week. The New Jersey GOP attacked Sherrill for this record directly in a campaign graphic last week. Sherrill's opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, mentioned this issue for Sherrill in a post back in July. New Jersey is the original home state of well-known transgender track and field athlete Sadie Schreiner, who previously competed for Rochester Institute for Technology and went viral multiple times for posting videos sharing the athlete's first-hand experience as a biological male trans athlete competing against, and often dominating, females. Schreiner is from Hillsborough, according to the athlete's RIT Athletics page. Schreiner has filed a lawsuit against Princeton University for an alleged incident at a May 3 women's race. Schreiner's lawsuit claimed the athlete attempted to participate in the women's 200-meter sprint at the Larry Ellis Invitational as one of the 141 participants unattached to a university or club. The suit alleges officials told Schreiner the athlete could not participate 15 minutes before the race began. Schreiner alleged the university violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which designates \"gender identity or expression\" as a protected status. Schreiner has since filed a second lawsuit against SUNY Genesco for being banned from a women's race in March, per multiple reports. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS Back in January, a New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%. The 81 independents who were interviewed represented the group with the most reluctance to say transgender athletes shouldn't be allowed to compete. Just 64% said they were against it, while 26% refused to answer. Just 3% of the Democrats and 1% of the Republicans refused to answer. Nearly 70% of Americans say biological men should not be permitted to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll last year. Additional data suggests the issue impacted the 2024 election. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms\" as important to them.

Several polls suggest they are—and the shift could have major implications.\n\nThe New York Times recently spoke with 11 young voters who backed Trump in the 2024 election but now say they regret their decision. When asked to describe life under Trump, they used words like “aggressive,” “overpowering,” and “reckless.” Frustration ran across his policies—from hard-line immigration stances to the lackluster economy and his handling of foreign conflicts.\n\nIn the latest edition of the Times’ “America in Focus” project, Trump voters in their late 20s and early 30s aren’t impressed with his presidency explained why. \n\nMustafa, a 28-year-old Republican from Georgia, didn’t hold back.\n\n“The way that he’s been handling things recently, dictatorship,” he said.\n\nThis represents a real shift. Trump’s support among young voters was a key factor in his 2024 victory. Yet an August survey from the Pew Research Center found only 69% of Trump 2024 voters under age 35 still approve of his performance—a steep 23-percentage-point drop since the start of his second term. \n\nThe trend started showing up earlier this year. As far back as April, his approval rating among voters under 30 had fallen to a -27 points on net, even though he had lost those voters by 10 points to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris last year. Young people are clearly driving much of his slumping approval rating today.\n\nThe issues driving the discontent are telling. A spring poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, which surveyed more than 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds, found opposition is especially high on tariffs (19% support, 50% oppose) and Trump’s economic policies. Among those struggling financially, 51% believe Trump’s policies will hurt their finances over the next few years, while just 18% think the policies will help.\n\nYoung voters generally don’t hold deeply conservative views and are highly sensitive to rising costs, including housing, student debt, and stagnant wages. They also tend to have weaker partisan loyalties, with many identifying as independents or rating both parties poorly.\n\nThose traits helped draw many young voters to Trump in 2024. But even as his support among this demographic grew, it was always fragile—seemingly driven more by a desire to shake up the political establishment than a wholehearted endorsement of his policies.\n\nNow, Trump has become the establishment, and young voters—including a notable share of young Republicans—are beginning to push back. This isn’t just a smattering of dissenting voices, though their stories matter too. Even some of his biggest supporters are starting to question his leadership.\n\nMustafa, who works in the automotive industry, told the Times that he expected Trump to “end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East,” but instead, he sees the U.S. “focused on Ukraine and Israel more than I feel like the United States.”\n\nQuinton, a 33-year-old account manager from Georgia, blasted Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\n“The job market is just not good at all. I have a lot of friends and family members who are struggling to find work,” he said. “He made it seem like he was going to look out for the working-class people, and it’s the exact opposite.”\n\nJohn, a 28-year-old delivery driver in Florida, voiced similar frustration. \n\n“Even though my specific investment in cryptocurrency is doing good overall, he has ruined the cryptocurrency market for a lot of cryptocurrencies,” he said. “This is not really what I voted for.”\n\nOthers pointed to Trump’s draconian deportation plans. Kelsey, a 32-year-old independent in the tech industry, said, “I just think it’s way too aggressive. Even if it’s the worst of the criminals, can they be treated more humanely once they get to the deportation centers?” \n\nSarah, a 32-year-old engineer in Montana, added that she’s having a “hard time trusting in my current democracy” when she doesn’t see constitutional principles “honored” in those processes.\n\nYoung voters aren’t the only group pulling away. Polling shows Latino voters have soured on Trump as well, partly over the same immigration agenda.\n\nWhether this disillusionment translates into anything concrete—like more Democratic votes in next year’s midterms or a revolt against Trump-aligned candidates in 2028—is still an open question. But for now, the warning signs are flashing.","summary":"Are young voters finally turning on President Donald Trump?

Of course I do.”\n\nHarris – who was in Philadelphia plugging her new book “107 Days” about the 2024 loss to now President Donald Trump, declined to say whether the tour is the start of a political comeback that includes running for president in 2028.\n\nBut insiders told the Journal that the book — and critical reaction to it– shows that Harris’ leadership is faltering in the party. \n\nSome longtime supporters told the outlet they are ready to move on from Harris, while more vocal Dems are openly airing their frustrations with Harris’s re-emergence — especially her book, which is critical of ex-President Joe Biden and her pool of choices for a running mate, before settling on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nIn her tome, she characterized Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as overly ambitious and ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, as someone who’d be politically risky running alongside a black woman.\n\nAshley Etienne, Harris’ former communications director, called the ex-veep’s book a a missed opportunity for not focusing on the Biden administration’s accomplishments and her role in them as the first female vice president.\n\n“I would have advised her to write a different book, one that cements her legacy,” Etienne told The Journal. \n\nFaiz Shakir, who ran Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, said the book affirms concerns people had about Harris.\n\n“Her campaign struggled with being a campaign of conviction, of clarity, of deep, principled positions,” Shakir said.\n\n“It’s a sign of weak leadership to just start blaming these kind of outside actors for your own shortcomings. It hurts the Democratic Party.”\n\nHarris, however, insisted she didn’t write tell-all book, claiming “it’s about just presenting people with a journal of my experience running for president of the United States.”\n\nHarris’ biggest liability on the national stage remains how she stayed mum as Biden’s mental health plummeted month after month. \n\nIn her book, Harris notes Biden “got tired,” but said, “I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”\n\nHarris recently angered the growing far left contingent in her party by failing to mention socialist Zohran Mamdani by name in an MSNBC interview, instead saying she supports “the Democrat” in the race for NYC mayor.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Harris was more definitive, saying “No, I did endorse Mamdani,”\n\nWhen asked about the growing tensions within the moderate and far-left wings of her party playing out in the Big Apple and elsewhere, Harris added, “There is a lot of consensus around the priorities of this moment, and that’s where I’m focused.”\n\nTh ex-veep signed with A-list talent agency Creative Artists Agency in February to represent her in speaking and publishing engagements and is demanding $250,000 a speech, sources told the outlet.","summary":"Kamala Harris says she still views herself a top leader within the Democratic Party – at least in her own mind.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/27/us-news/kamala-harris-believe-shes-still-a-leader-in-the-democratic-party-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/112267527.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dHFaOXhv-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 19:42:31","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":364230850,"title":"‘Entrapment’: Will high court take a look at FBI’s role in Whitmer kidnapping case?","text":"In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the media and Democratic Party politicians have pointed to the 2020 scheme to abduct and assassinate Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as evidence that political violence comes from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nNews organizations routinely cite the plot in a timeline of recent incidents of political violence in this country; Whitmer herself mentioned the plan to “kidnap and kill me” in a video message posted on X last week while condemning Kirk’s murder.\n\nBut the two examples aren’t comparable, and not only because Gretchen Whitmer was never harmed – nor ever in any real danger. The big difference is that federal agents were involved in the very conceptualization of the plot against the governor – and in all the overt acts that led to criminal charges against an array of right-wing defendants.\n\nThe defendants’ lawyers believe – and they cite voluminous supporting evidence – that if the appeals in these cases ever reach the Supreme Court, the nine justices will learn details about one of the most brazen FBI entrapment operations in U.S. history. Moreover, the timing of the original arrests suggests to some government critics that the sting represents another instance of the FBI interfering in a presidential election to sabotage Donald Trump.\n\nArrests in the case produced shocking headlines just a few weeks before Election Day 2020 as early voting was underway in the crucial swing state of Michigan. Whitmer, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris repeatedly raised the issue on the campaign trail; during a rally in Michigan on Oct. 16, 2020, Biden compared the Michigan group to ISIS and blamed Donald Trump for “fanning the flames of hatred.”\n\nNearly five years later, the saga is not over. In July, Barry Croft Jr., one of two men found guilty of federal kidnapping charges in 2022, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking Supreme Court review of lower courts’ decisions that led to his conviction.\n\nSolicitor General John Sauer informed SCOTUS the government would waive its right to file a response – but the court subsequently asked Sauer to file a response by Oct. 14; Croft’s petition is set for conference on Sept. 29, when justices will consider roughly 2,000 requests filed over the summer recess.\n\nCroft and co-defendant, Adam Fox, ended with a hung jury after the first trial in Michigan in April 2022; two other defendants were acquitted on all charges amid convincing evidence of FBI entrapment. The Justice Department immediately announced that it would retry Fox and Croft, and both men were convicted after a second trial in August 2022.\n\nCroft was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Fox received a 16-year sentence.\n\nLike a Broadway Show\n\nCroft is now asking the Supreme Court to review U.S. District Court Judge Robert Jonker’s decision to prohibit jurors from seeing more than 250 communications between FBI handlers, informants, and undercover employees involved in manufacturing the plot. In preparing for trial, defense attorneys discovered messages that proved the informants were taking directions from FBI agents in Detroit over the course of several months to entangle the targets in the conspiracy. (My overview of the case can be found here.)\n\nIn the end, there were more FBI assets involved in the plot than the number of would-be “kidnappers.”\n\nJonker, however, determined the communications consisted of inadmissible hearsay by ruling that FBI informants are akin to “independent contractors” whose out-of-court statements did not represent credible evidence of entrapment. (In support of this legal theory, the judge cited the movie “The Truman Show.”)\n\nWhile Jonker’s decision did not impact the first trial – the DOJ walked away without a single conviction on any charge in what was considered the biggest domestic terror investigation in decades – Croft’s lawyer argues that it represented the deciding factor in his client’s guilty verdict after the second trial. (Jonker also ignored allegations that the foreman of the second jury was a BLM activist who had told co-workers he planned to find the men guilty.)\n\n“Barry Croft, Jr. was one of several citizens targeted in 2020 by the FBI and a tightly controlled cohort of paid confidential agents/informants, all working together on a coordinated FBI team to ensnare these citizens in an FBI promoted ‘conspiracy’ to ‘kidnap’ Michigan’s governor, who was in on the hoax and updated regularly, all timed for splashy arrests before the November 3, 2020 election,” Timothy Sweeney, Croft’s court-appointed appellate attorney, wrote in the petition. “Like a Broadway show, government agents served as producer, director, script writer, choreographer, photographer, principal actors, and dancers. Even the supposed ‘victim’ was in on the act.” Whitmer has admitted she knew about the plot for months.\n\nSweeney detailed how the FBI executed the scheme. The main informant, an alleged Iraq War veteran named Dan Chappel, was paid upwards of $60,000 in cash by the FBI to stitch the group together. Wearing a wire with real-time access to his FBI handlers, Chappel and the other informants – including repeat felon and longtime informant Steve Robeson – plied the mostly indigent defendants with booze and weed to provoke inflammatory conversations later used as incriminating evidence.\n\nChappel created group chats where he suggested ways to advance the plot and get the targets to go along, which included organizing meetings and “training” camps. On behalf of the FBI, he paid for travel, meals, hotel rooms, and even offered FBI-paid credit cards with a $5,000 limit to encourage the men to make purchases such as military gear and ammunition. The FBI created a fake militia, the “III% Patriots Militia,” with Robeson as its leader.\n\nRaising the Stakes Right Before the 2020 Election\n\nIn September 2020, when it appeared the ragtag group was about to disband, mostly over disdain for Croft, the FBI raised the stakes by introducing an undercover FBI agent named “Red,” who claimed expertise on how to build explosives. During another FBI-generated gathering that month, “Red” showed the group a video of an SUV destroyed by a bomb, since plans to “kidnap” Whitmer involved blowing up a bridge outside her summer cottage.\n\nThe FBI produced the video.\n\nThat same night, FBI assets drove their targets to Whitmer’s cottage in upper Michigan. Whitmer was well aware of the operation; she had already allowed the FBI to install pole cameras on her property to capture evidence of the so-called “reconnaissance” mission.\n\n“The FBI arranged for three cars to participate this time, all driven by FBI assets or their associates,” Sweeney wrote. (Chappel, at the time, at the behest of his handlers in the Detroit FBI field office, was trying to frame a disabled Vietnam veteran in Virginia to make similar plans against Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.)\n\nFourteen men were arrested on Oct. 8, 2020; six faced a federal indictment, and eight were charged by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. Of the total, five men were convicted at trial, five were acquitted at trial, and four men pleaded guilty.\n\nFuzzy Appellate Court Ruling Demands Clarity\n\nJonker’s ruling at trial prevented jurors from understanding the full scope of the FBI’s behind-the-scenes effort to set up their targets. “The result was a trial about entrapment with defendants’ hands tied behind their backs and the jury blindfolded to critical relevant facts,” Sweeney wrote.\n\nAnd while the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in April agreed Jonker had “erred in [his] announcement and application of the rule for admissibility of informant statements,” the court held that Jonker’s decision was “harmless” to Croft since he had other ways to bring up the communications, such as taking the stand. That conclusion, the defense argues, “unconstitutionally penalized Croft for not sacrificing his Fifth Amendment privilege so that he could thereby preserve his Sixth Amendment right to present his defense.”\n\nBoth Croft and Fox are incarcerated at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado that houses some of the most violent criminals in the world; they have been behind bars since their arrests in October 2020.\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, has mentioned the case several times in public. During a CPAC appearance in 2022, Trump described the plot as a “fake deal” and a “sting.” The following year, he criticized the harsh sentences imposed by Jonker. “I followed the Whitmer Kidnapping Hoax (a weak case!), and saw all of those who were exonerated, and now they’re putting a man in jail for almost 20 years for something that never happened to a corrupt Governor? This was a sting operation!” Trump posted on Truth Social in 2023.\n\nA reporter asked the president this past May whether he would consider pardoning Fox and Croft. Trump was, although he said the matter had been brought to his attention several times. “It looked to me like a railroad job,” Trump said. “A lot of people think they got railroaded.”\n\nWith trust in American institutions, including the DOJ, FBI, and federal court system, at an all-time low, the Supreme Court has a chance to, at the very least, bring attention to the abusive tactics by both government officials and judges, inexorably stripping away constitutional rights to help Democrats produce political narratives.","summary":"'Federal agents were involved in the very conceptualization of the plot against the governor – and in all the overt acts that led to criminal charges against an array of right-wing defendants'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/09/entrapment-will-high-court-take-look-fbis-role/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gretchen-whitmer-dnc-video-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 18:56:14","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":364122938,"title":"A crucial race viewed as referendum on Trump is tightening","text":"In 2025, Democratic and GOP strategists are paying very close attention to two gubernatorial elections: one in New Jersey, the other in Virginia. And both are viewed as a referendum on Donald Trump's second presidency.\n\nThe Democratic candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (an ex-CIA officer) in Virginia, are attacking Trump relentlessly. But Jack Ciattarelli, New Jersey's GOP gubernatorial nominee, is countering that the race isn't about Trump — it's about the Garden State. And Ciattarelli's messaging might be working.\n\nIn an article published on September 27, The Hill's Caroline Vakil stresses that Democratic strategists are growing worried about how much the New Jersey race is tightening.\n\nAn Emerson College/The Hill poll released in late September found Sherrill and Ciattarelli in a dead heat, with 11 percent of the voters still undecided. And the Decision Desk HQ polling average, Vakil notes, shows Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by only four points.\n\nVakil reports, \"The (Emerson College/The Hill) survey underscores how Democrats can't take the state for granted, particularly after term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D) narrowly won his last reelection four years ago by 3 points and former Vice President (Kamala) Harris only won it in November by close to 6 points.\"\n\nAlthough New Jersey is a blue state, it isn't deep blue like Massachusetts or California. \n\nDemocratic strategist Julie Roginsky told The Hill that polls showing Sherrill ahead by 8 percent are \"outliers\" and said of the Emerson/Hill poll, \"I'm not surprised — I always thought this was a competitive race.\"\n\nVakil observes, \"The survey shows that Trump enjoys a higher approval rating, 41 percent, compared to Murphy at 35 percent. At the same time, Trump has a higher disapproval rating of 51 percent compared to Murphy’s 44 percent.

A separate 17 percent of independents say they're undecided.\" \n\n Read Caroline Vakil's full article for The Hill at this link.","summary":"In 2025, Democratic and GOP strategists are paying very close attention to two gubernatorial elections: one in New Jersey, the other in Virginia. And both are viewed as a referendum on Donald Trump's second presidency.\n\nThe Democratic candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (an ex-CIA officer) in Virginia, are attacking Trump relentlessly. But Jack Ciattarelli, New Jersey's GOP gubernatorial nominee, is countering that the race isn't about Trump — it's about the Garden State. And Ciattarelli's messaging might be working.\n\nIn an article published on September 27, The Hill's Caroline Vakil stresses that Democratic strategists are growing worried about how much the New Jersey race is tightening.\n\nAn Emerson College/The Hill poll released in late September found Sherrill and Ciattarelli in a dead heat, with 11 percent of the voters still undecided. And the Decision Desk HQ polling average, Vakil notes, shows Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by only four points.\n\nVakil reports,","url":"https://www.alternet.org/new-jersey-sherrill-ciattarelli-trump/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61655254&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C196%2C0%2C196","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 18:35:08","author":"Alex Henderson","authors":["Alex Henderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":364017846,"title":"Bill Maher says to bring back 'old America,' the left must tone down their radical progressivism","text":"On Friday's episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" host Bill Maher argued that to get back to what he called \"old America,\" Democrats must scale back their more radically progressive ideology. \"If we are ever going to get back to the old America, that's got to be the Democrats' part of the bargain.

It’s a campaign that began soon after Trump returned to office and one that critics see as an abuse of power that puts every American who dares to criticize the president at risk of retaliation.\n\n“Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Comey indictment came less than a week after Trump installed a former White House aide and confidant to the role of U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The president had forced the ousterof his previous pick because he wasn’t sufficiently responsive to calls from Trump to bring charges against his longtime targets.\n\n“This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power,” Warner said. “Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores.”\n\nAn escalation in retribution\n\nThe first former president convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to conceal an alleged affair — Trump won the White House despite a host of other legal troubles over his alleged retention of classified information after leaving the White House in 2021 and his role in stoking denials of his 2020 electoral defeat that culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThursday’s moves were the latest in a concerted effort by Trump to wield the vast powers of his office in unparalleled ways to punish his enemies since returning to the Oval Office in January. During his campaign, Trump made clear this was his intention if he returned to office.\n\n“In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,” he said in 2023. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nEarlier this week, he signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa — short for “anti-fascists” — as a domestic terrorist organization, a move testing broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\n\nThe Thursday memo went further, targeting liberal-leaning groups and donors, and “represents a significant abuse of power where the government is either changing the law or bending definitions to try and investigate and punish their political opponents in a way that is really unprecedented,” said Caitlin Legacki, of Americans Against Government Censorship, which was founded to fight the Trump administration’s weaponization of the federal government against its political rivals.\n\nAs for Comey, she said, “It reeks of selective prosecution, it reeks of vindictive targeting and calls into question the integrity of many of the charges being brought by the office.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, denied Friday that he’s on a campaign of retribution.\n\n“It’s about justice, really. It’s not revenge, it’s about justice. It’s also about the fact that you can’t let this go on,” he told reporters. “They are sick, radical left people and they can’t get away with it.”\n\nAsked who is next on his list, he responded: “It’s not a list, but I think there’ll be others.”\n\nA widespread pressure campaign\n\nBeyond Comey, Trump has also pressured prosecutors to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a massive civil fraud case against the president. Attorney General Pam Bondi last month named a special prosecutor to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against James and Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another top Trump target. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Justice Department has also begun examining mortgage fraud allegations against Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor who’s won success in lower courts in challenging Trump’s effort to remove her from her job in a move she says is designed to erode the central bank’s independence. Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow him to oust her.\n\nOn Friday, Trump called on Microsoft to fire former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, whom he has long held a grudge against, from her position as president of global affairs.\n\n“Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” he wrote. Trump previously stripped her of her security clearance, along with numerous others.\n\nHe has also stripped Secret Service protection from a slew of former officials, including his 2024 Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, members of former President Joe Biden’s family, and people who’ve fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump has also targeted major institutions, revoking security clearances for attorneys at law firms he disfavors, pulling billions of dollars in federal research funds from elite universities, and securing multimillion-dollar settlements against media organizations in lawsuits that were widely regarded as weak cases.\n\nEarlier this week, he threatened ABC over the network’s decision to allow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to return to the airwaves.\n\n“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump crowed.\n\nAnd his administration has fired or reassigned federal employees for their earlier work, including prosecutors who worked on cases against him. The Justice Department also fired Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was politically motivated.\n\nTrump celebrates the indictment\n\nTrump, meanwhile, cheered the Comey indictment, saying “JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” had been served, even as Comey denied wrongdoing and expressed confidence in being acquitted at trial.\n\nThe indictment was the culmination of a pressure campaign that burst into public view over the weekend when Trump aired his frustrations with Bondi on his social media site and demanded she move forward with charges against Comey, James and Schiff.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” he wrote on Truth Social Saturday. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer and a White House aide, to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to quicken the pace after the ouster of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to bring charges against James.\n\nThe charges against Comey came even as prosecutors in the office had written a memo detailing concerns about the pursuit of an indictment and their likelihood of success at trial.\n\nThe former FBI director said in a video he’s innocent but knew “standing up to Donald Trump” would come with costs.\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I am innocent,” Comey said.","summary":"“Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” Trump wrote.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/09/27/trump-retribution-campaign-microsoft-fire-former-deputy-attorney-general-lisa-monaco/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2169585602-e1758986314867.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 15:26:29","author":"Jill Colvin,The Associated Press","authors":["Jill Colvin","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":364074514,"title":"Trump demands Microsoft fire global affairs head Lisa Monaco","text":"President Donald Trump declared Friday that Microsoft needs to fire Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs.\n\nCiting her roles as “a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet ‘Boss’ Attorney General Merrick Garland,” Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco’s current role gives her access to “Highly Sensitive Information,” which he deemed “unacceptable.”\n\n“It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” he wrote.\n\nAs Trump noted, Monaco worked with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden, including as a deputy attorney general under the Biden administration. Trump rescinded Monaco’s security clearance earlier this year, in the an order that did the same for Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, and the Biden family.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. Monaco joined the company in May, taking on a role overseeing the company’s cybersecurity policy and its relationship with world governments.\n\nFar-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer has repeatedly criticized Microsoft for hiring Monaco in posts on X, complaining in one post that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was “born in India” and accusing him of “disgraceful scammer behavior.” On Friday, Loomed triumphantly quoted Trump’s post and again called on the president to “cancel all of Microsoft’s government contracts.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has targeted a tech executive since returning to office.

Mrs. Biden’s former spokesperson, Michael LaRosa, has published an op-ed on Fox News.\n\nThe title reads, “Harris is speaking. This time, she isn’t bending to Biden’s bullies.” A short jab to Harris’s Mr President I’m speaking! LaRosa has claimed Joe Biden’s presidential administration was full of bullies. She called them, “the Regina Georges of Biden’s circle,” making a Mean Girls reference.\n\nLaRosa added that they “were serving a cult.” Her op-ed reads, “while the Bidens were “warm, decent, empathetic,” people, they were also guilty of empowering “some of the nastiest and most mean-spirited people I’ve ever encountered in politics.”\n\nKamala Harris just debuted her campaign trail memoir ‘107 Days,’ and LaRosa’s claims come right after it. In the book, Harris has written about her feud with Jill, and there’s also a mention of workplace bullying that she had to suffer. “I often learned that the president’s staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me.”\n\nShe further added, “Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That, given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital.”\n\nThere may have been workplace bullying, but it does not align with Jill Biden’s anti-bullying campaign, where she denounced all forms of bullying. She even made Donald Trump an example of bullies everywhere while taking a huge stance on anti-bullying in 2020 and 2024.\n\nJoe Biden even called Trump, “the bully I knew my whole life. He’s the bully that I’ve always stood up to. He’s the bully that used to make fun of me when I was a kid because I stuttered, and I’d smack him in the mouth.” It is surprising that people who speak out against bullies can act like bullies themselves.\n\nEven during public appearances, Jill Biden was seen giving Kamala Harris the cold shoulder while smiling. The video went viral with people commenting how Jill hates her.\n\nLaRosa confirmed the bullying often came from inside as Biden’s final mission was to save the country from Trump, she added, “But bullies are everywhere, even among Democrats, and despite his brand — even around Biden, Jill Biden has not responded to the claims yet or what Harris has written in her book.\n\nHowever, the claims are damaging to her image and may add even more fuel to their feud. The Biden family may also be planning a scheme to denounce the claims and bully Kamala Harris a bit more.","summary":"Michael LaRosa, Jill's former spokesperson went all in with her op-ed piece.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/some-of-the-nastiest-people-former-white-house-staffer-adds-fuel-to-kamala-harris-fiery-feud-with-jill-biden","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fire-to-Kamala-Harris-and-Jill-Biden-Feud.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 15:01:35","author":"Diksha,Giobruno1600/x; Dogspink3/x","authors":["Diksha","Giobruno1600/x; Dogspink3/x"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":363991844,"title":"The Post endorses Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey governor","text":"New Jersey voters sick of the blue-state blues have a shot at some relief this November, by backing Republican Jack Ciattaralli for governor.\n\nWe heartily endorse Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman who came within three points of toppling incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in 2021 and now faces same-old, same-old hack Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill.\n\nIf Garden Staters want more of Murphy’s misery — through-the-roof utility bills, nation-leading taxes, woke schools, decaying infrastructure, oppressive crime and massive state debt — they should race to back Rep. Sherrill.\n\nIf not, Ciattarelli is the clear choice.\n\nStart with Sherrill’s professed top priority: “affordability.”\n\nHer plan to tame costs boils down to: more handouts (at taxpayer expense), targeting mysterious “bad actors,” locking in pricey “clean energy” and, of course, fighting big, bad Orange Man.\n\nNo joke: She actually blames Donald Trump for high prices — even though inflation struck during the Biden years (when Trump was out of office), and was fueled by reckless federal spending that she herself, along with her fellow Democrats in Congress, rammed through.\n\n“There’s no cost higher than the price that all of us will have to pay if we don’t stand up” to Trump, she huffs. \n\nFunny: Lots of other states manage to keep their utility bills and taxes down even while supporting Trump…\n\nHer pathetic plan to lower grocery bills centers on going after “large corporations [that] jack up food prices and take advantage of consumers during a crisis.”\n\nSounds like she’s cribbing from socialist Zohran Mamdani’s book on magically repealing the laws of supply and demand.\n\nShe’d “transform New Jersey’s energy picture” by building “cheaper and cleaner energy generation” and “hit our emissions and clean-air goals.”\n\nHello? It’s precisely Democrats’ drive for zero emissions that has sent electric bills soaring: A report by Affordable Energy for New Jersey cites a $1.4 trillion price tag for Murphy’s greener-than-green Energy Master Plan.\n\nSherrill doesn’t just vow to lock in that plan, she wants to double down on it, .\n\nIn other words, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result — and that’s not remotely the only Sherrill policy that fits that definition of insanity.\n\nShe’ll stick to the Murphy policies that ram DEI into every school district, leave property and income taxes ever-growing and fail to control crime. \n\nHilariously, her idea for providing relief for the state’s onerous taxes (the nation’s second-highest, after New York) is (get this!) to “close tax loopholes” — i.e., raise taxes even more.\n\nAnd, like Murphy, she opposes letting parents opt out of LGBTQ education.\n\nSherrill also has a trust problem: She pretended not to know that her stock holdings have soared by $7 million since she entered Congress — most likely because she doesn’t want to answer questions about her “good luck.”\n\nBy contrast, Ciattarelli, a CPA and former business owner, would reverse the Murphy agenda, relying on common-sense ideas to tackle Jersey’s biggest ills:\n\nActually lowering income taxes, for both individuals and businesses, which could then pass the savings on to customers via lower prices.\n\nChopping state spending dramatically and limiting budget growth to the inflation rate.\n\nScrapping Jersey’s sanctuary-state policy and banning sanctuary cities.\n\nPushing through a new Energy Master Plan to keep costs down by allowing for new sources of reliable and affordable electricity while repealing “unrealistic and unaffordable mandates” to electrify everything from cars to household appliances and home heating.\n\nFixing bail-reform flaws and tapping sensible judges who’ll keep repeat offenders behind bars.\n\nExpanding charter schools and school choice for families.\n\nYes, the Garden State has leaned blue for years, but there’s a limit to how much pain even liberals can take.\n\nLast November, Jersey voters gave Sherrill’s boogey man, Donald Trump, a full 46% of their votes, making Kamala Harris’ six-point margin of victory the smallest the Garden State’s given a Democratic presidential hopeful in 32 years.\n\nAnd last week, an Emerson College poll had the race locked in a dead heat, with Sherrill and Ciattarelli each pulling 43% support.\n\nHer party knows she’s in trouble: The Democratic National Committee just doubled its spending on the campaign to $3 million, the most it’s ever shelled out in Jersey for an off-year election.\n\nSo hopes are high for Ciattarelli. He’s the Garden State’s best chance at shedding the blues once and for all.","summary":"New Jersey voters sick of the blue-state blues have a shot at some relief this November, by backing Republican Jack Ciattaralli for governor.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/27/opinion/the-post-endorses-jack-ciatarelli-for-new-jersey-governor/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/republican-jack-ciattarelli-responds-questions-111917547_5d7092.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/v5iZkkaE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 14:54:52","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":363983578,"title":"JD Vance makes scathing remark after Kamala Harris leaked surprising comments Trump made to her in private","text":"Vice President JD Vance has had some choice words for Kamala Harris in a recent interview that comes right after she revealed something Trump said to her.\n\nThe VP appeared in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News for The Ingraham Angle on Friday, when he was asked about former Vice President Harris’ new memoir 107 Days, which tells all about her presidential campaign in 2024.\n\nIn particular, Ingraham quoted a moment when Harris called Vance ‘a juvenile and shapeshifter’ when Vance let loose about his own opinion of her.\n\nVance and Harris were not very interactive in-person during the elections; however, they did make mention of each other from time to time when up on the podium.\n\nFor Vance, he’s been clear that he doesn’t think she has what it takes to be a political leader, but now, he’s expanded on that claim with a far more scathing remark.\n\n“She is now blaming the campaign, her loss, for the fact that it was short,” the Fox News host claimed. “That’s one of the main things she cites. If she had more time, she could have gotten more traction.”\n\nTo this, Vance said: “The problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short. It was too long.\n\n“When people actually listened to what she had to say, per polling, it went down and down and down. A 150-day campaign, three additional senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Trump won 312 electoral votes and Harris won 226.\n\nVance said that the votes speak for themselves, and it was a matter of people coming to their own conclusions the more she spoke.\n\n“The more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there is no substance there,” Vance said. \n\n“When we disagreed with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate the viewpoint. I listen to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes.”\n\nHe went on to say she doesn’t know how to speak to her audience, saying: “That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s going to continue to be the problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint and articulate it for the American people.”\n\nHis chat comes after Harris made her own comments about Trump in her book, specifically speaking of the time after his second assassination attempt made by Ryan Routh.\n\nShe explained that while Trump would say bad things about her in public, when it came to talking with her behind closed doors, all he had to say were good things.\n\nHe allegedly said to her when she spoke to him after the incident: \"How do I say bad things about you now? I'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\"\n\nTrump also is said to have admitted that his daughter Ivanka was a 'big fan' of Harris'.\n\nHowever, Harris didn’t buy it.\n\n\"He’s a con man.

I find that it is increasingly rare that people from opposing sides of politics can even be near each other — let alone be friends or have a meaningful conversation. This is most certainly a sad state of affairs. It didn’t used to be this way, and in countless conversations with both Democrats and Republicans, I do feel that blame can be placed on both sides.\n\nThat being said, I have witnessed something very intriguing this past year that began slowly and has only increased with each passing month. Almost every single Republican I have spoken to over the past year, no matter how far right they are, for the most part has nothing but great things to say about Mexico’s president. Think about that for a moment. At a time when political polarization in the U.S. is at extreme levels, when there is increasingly little if any common ground being found on issues, when respect for the other side is at embarrassingly low levels, there is widespread respect and admiration from Sheinbaum.\n\nSo why is that? In countless conversations with Republican friends, I can boil it down to 7 key areas:\n\n1. Professional Demeanor. In politics, as in life, how you look, act and dress matters a lot. Sheinbaum always looks and dresses sharp. She always looks professional. She has a magnetic smile and carries herself with elegance. She exudes class.\n\n2. Education. This is a funny one. Although she graduated from Berkeley — a university not exactly associated with right-leaning political ideology — people are willing to look past that. Why? Having an undergraduate degree in physics matters to people. Having a Ph.D. matters to people. Being a scientist matters to people. Being part of a team that won a Nobel Peace Prize matters to people. She clearly is very intelligent and worked hard to achieve the level of academic success few reach.\n\n3. Hard work ethic. Sheinbaum works tirelessly. She is always active and her every move is covered on government social media sites. Every weekday morning she has a press conference at 7:30 a.m. for 60-90 minutes. Imagine preparing for a press conference to take any question on any topic as well as do a deep dive presentation on a given topic every single day! Every weekend she hits the road or the skies, traveling to different cities and states around the country to meet with people and do massive rallies to connect with Mexicans of all economic levels. She is visible. She is present. She is a constant cheerleader for the country. And people like and respect that.\n\n4. She walks the walk and talks the talk. In an age where many people have become completely cynical about politicians being corrupt — from insider trading to nepotism to closed-door fundraisers to access to billionaires’ private jets, few people believe that politicians actually do what they say. Sheinbaum has won admiration and respect by living a simple life, even as president. She — as did her predecessor — eschewed the presidential palace to live in a small apartment in the National Palace. She very often is seen being driven around in modest SUV’s on her weekend road trips. On two of her international trips, to Brazil for the G20 meeting and then to Canada for a G7 meeting, she flew commercial airlines — in economy class!\n\n5. She has embraced the business community. Often times, political rhetoric from the left leaves the business community feeling alienated. Correct or not, the business community often feels that some politicians on the left view them solely as a force that must be constrained or a source of income that must be extracted. They feel that there is not an appreciation or respect for the jobs that are created, taxes that are paid, or soft power that is projected through their efforts. Sheinbaum, unlike her predecessor, was quick to publicly embrace the business community. She created a business advisory council and named a successful, well-known business leader, Altagracia Gómez, to lead it. Every Thursday she dedicates her morning press conferences to business and the economy, and often has members of the business community presenting and sharing updates on new investments or initiatives. Her secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, was a very respected leader in the business community and led Mexico in the previous round of the USMCA negotiations during the first Trump presidency.\n\n6. She has taken some real tangible actions against the cartels and in the drug trade. No reasonable person expects her to solve these issues overnight, but she has made high profile arrests, handed over criminals to the U.S., worked with the DEA, sent troops to the border, shut down fentanyl labs, and recently announced a security agreement with the United States. She has shown a dramatic difference from her predecessor in her level of understanding of the significance of the problem to the U.S. and demonstrated sincerity in her willingness to solve it.\n\n7. She has put on a masterclass in how to work with Trump. My friends respect that she has learned how to work with Trump. She has demonstrated patience and restraint. She has focused on data, dialogue and the mutual benefits of free trade rather than threatening to respond to Trump’s tariffs. She has maintained her professionalism as she has drawn red lines that cannot be crossed with respect to Mexico’s sovereignty. I have often heard that she has been the best example of a politician working under the pressure of the Trump administration. This is especially admirable given how dependent the Mexican economy is on the U.S., which puts her at a significant disadvantage in negotiations.\n\nSo what can Democrats learn from all of this? A lot! At the risk of getting skewered by my Democratic friends, I think there are four key learnings from Sheinbaum that the U.S. left should consider.\n\n1. Engaging in “an eye for an eye” politics with a leader like Trump is a losing strategy. He excels at that style of engagement, and it is nearly impossible to beat him at his own game. Overcoming a political opponent by simply mirroring their tactics rarely works.\n\n2. Creating an adversarial relationship with the business community is a losing strategy. Especially when there is a much larger economic war that must be won against China. Like it or not, the choice we are left with is to embrace our business community and try to influence the actions we want from them, or accept an increasing level of Chinese influence and dominance across the business spectrum.\n\n3. The professionalism and perception of a candidate’s demeanor and background matters — often more than policy ideas. For example, some voters may agree with the policy ideas of certain politicians, but find their public persona to be a barrier. A candidate like Bernie Sanders might have some good policy ideas, but many people are deterred by the perception that he is an “angry socialist.” Elizabeth Warren might have some good policy ideas, but her tone is often perceived as lecturing. AOC might be a dynamic speaker, but many people focus on her prior career as a bartender as a shorthand for her perceived lack of experience. I am not making personal judgements on these politicians, but to ignore people’s perceptions has proven to be a mistake.\n\n4. Walking the walk and talking the talk matters. Nobody likes a hypocrite, and politicians whose actions appear to contradict their words risk losing public trust — especially when they criticize others for similar behavior. When a political party’s messaging focuses on inequality or critiques the wealthy, certain actions can create a powerful perception of hypocrisy, whether justified or not. Voters notice things like Nancy Pelosi’s stock trading, Bernie Sanders taking private jets, Hunter Biden getting lucrative consulting jobs, or prominent party members like the Clintons, the Obamas, or Kamala Harris enjoying a lavish lifestyle with the same wealthy class their rhetoric often targets. Al Gore faced criticism for talking about the threats of global warming while flying around the world in private jets to attend conferences. While politicians on both sides of the aisle face this kind of scrutiny, when a party’s core message is about championing the common person against powerful interests, these perceptions of hypocrisy can be especially damaging.\n\nWe live in interesting political times. A day doesn’t go by in which I don’t feel a mix of fear, anxiety, stress and concern about the state of politics in the world. But there are glimmers of hope. There are politicians that provide inspiration. There are times when the political divide is crossed to make progress. We all just have to work harder at making it work, be more open minded to what the other side is saying, and learn what we can from examples like President Sheinbaum.\n\nTravis Bembenek is the CEO of Mexico News Daily and has been living, working or playing in Mexico for nearly 30 years.","summary":"The president's level-headed professionalism and her embrace of the business community has earned her respect among U.S. conservatives, Travis Bembenek writes.\n\n\nThe post Why my Republican friends like Sheinbaum, and what Democrats can learn from her: A perspective from our CEO appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/opinion/republicans-like-sheinbaum-ceo-perspective/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1047421_Sheinbaum-La-Transformacion-Avanza-Tlaxcala_impreso.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 12:00:16","author":"Travis Bembenek","authors":["Travis Bembenek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.369},{"id":364079620,"title":"Kamala Harris’s new book details her steep challenges without acknowledging her failures","text":"Kamala Harris’s book 107 Days confirms two truths: Joe Biden never should have sought re-election and she did not belong on a national ticket.\n\nBiden was snared by Father Time and hubris. The 46th president was not the transformational figure he saw in the mirror. More than half the US rated him a failure.\n\n“People hate Joe Biden,” Harris quotes David Plouffe, her senior strategist and an Obama White House veteran, as saying.\n\nWhat’s unstated is that Harris was never a vote-magnet. When she ran for attorney general of California in 2010, she won by less than 1%, a margin of fewer than 80,000 votes in a deep blue state. Seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, her bid ended in December 2019, two months before the Iowa caucus.\n\nFast forward to 2024. Harris’s second White House run was hardly conventional, plunged as she was into the maelstrom with just those 107 Days to go. Clearly, thanks to Biden and his enablers, Harris faced steep challenges. Nonetheless, timidity and indecision pocked her campaign. Fear of being overshadowed led her to pick a disheveled dad for vice-president. No one foisted the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, on Harris. He became her prime-time emotional support pet, all the same.\n\n“There was a feeling that we needed to feed the beast,” she confides. “But I knew that beast would eviscerate me if I wasn’t properly prepared.”\n\nThat moment of proper preparation failed to arrive.\n\nNow Harris unloads on Walz, lacerating him for his poor debate, accusing him of falling into a trap. With cameras rolling, JD Vance, then an Ohio senator, played Mr Nice Guy instead of a pit bull, lulling Walz into somnolent irrelevance.\n\n“When Tim fell for it and started nodding and smiling at JD’s fake bipartisanship, I moaned to Doug [Emhoff, her husband], ‘What is happening?’” Harris recalls. “I told the television screen: ‘You’re not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate.’”\n\nHarris is not finished.\n\n“The following weekend, Saturday Night Live did a sketch in which actors posed as Doug and me, sitting on our couch, watching the debate. While I did not in fact spit out wine, it was otherwise uncanny in its portrait of our evening.”\n\nSNL gifted Harris a cameo, a consolation prize at best.\n\nWalz was not the pick of Harris’s dreams. That honor goes to Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, population 103,000, a fraction of the size of a congressional district. He quit the 2020 race on 1 March, months after Harris, after sharing Iowa with Bernie Sanders, then spent four years as transportation secretary under Biden. Harris felt she couldn’t pick him, because he was a gay man and she was a woman of color. Harris’s campaign memoir may be many things. Profiles in Courage, it is not.\n\nHarris betrays shortcomings on policy. She says little that is coherent about the border or inflation.\n\n“Immigration had surged, and to some it felt like an invasion: we couldn’t gaslight the people who felt that way by denying the problem,” she half-heartedly acknowledges.\n\n“We did not succeed in making a passionate case for a complete immigration overhaul that combined securing the border with a better legal mechanism for the people who arrive here with a dream of success and contribution.”\n\nIn plain English, the electorate refused to buy what Harris tried to sell.\n\nRegardless, Harris does not grapple with the incompatibility of porous borders on the one hand, and Obamacare on the other. “Open immigration can’t exist with a strong social safety net,” to quote Paul Krugman. “If you’re going to assure healthcare and a decent income to everyone, you can’t make that offer global.” The costs are too high for enough voters to stomach both.\n\nIn the end, Donald Trump drew nearly even with Harris among Hispanic voters. In southern Texas, thousands backed Trump, after rebuffing him four years earlier.\n\nHarris failed to make the case that inflation was “transitory”. She bathes in self-praise for breaking a Senate tie on the Inflation Reduction Act. But congressional titles mean little.\n\n“Part of the challenge of this very short campaign,” she writes, “was that we had to focus on needs that felt more immediate, like how to deal with the grocery bill or the cost of childcare.”\n\nThat problem didn’t suddenly arise. The administration appeared clueless, in much the same way the Trump administration now claims prices aren’t rising.\n\nHarris also elides the role of identity politics as a factor in her defeat. In 2019, she authored The Truths We Hold, signaling her intent to vie for the nomination by running left, seemingly unaware Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren had more credibly staked out that lane.\n\n“We need to speak truth: that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces,” Harris proclaimed.\n\nUnlike Barack Obama in his 2004 convention speech or in The Audacity of Hope, his 2006 book, Harris left little room for nuance. Nor is she afflicted with a surplus of self-awareness.\n\n“I wish I could have gotten the message across that there isn’t a distinction between ‘they/them’ and ‘you,’” she writes without a hint of irony, referring to a brutally effective Republican ad on the issue of transgender rights.\n\n“The pronoun that matters is ‘we’,” Harris says. Now.\n\nPro-tip: faculty lounge orthodoxies and campus activist jargon can play poorly outside ivy-covered walls.\n\nHarris also reminisces about “A-list talents such as James Taylor and Yo-Yo Ma” headlining a fundraiser in Martha’s Vineyard. A cultural chasm divides blue-collar voters from such preppy purlieus. Harris offers no prescriptions for healing the breach. As a politician, she lagged among voters without four-year degrees.\n\n“There is so much at stake,” she intones. “I cannot fail these people.” But she did.\n\n 107 Days is published in the US by Simon & Schuster","summary":"In 107 Days, Harris leaves little room for nuance – nor is she afflicted with a surplus of self-awareness\n\nKamala Harris’s book 107 Days confirms two truths: Joe Biden never should have sought re-election and she did not belong on a national ticket.\n\nBiden was snared by Father Time and hubris.

Here's what she said","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' highly anticipated book detailing her experiences on the unprecedented 2024 campaign trail only included three mentions of Michelle Obama, the majority of which were quotes about the former first lady and prominent Democrat voice, a Fox News Digital review of the memoir found. The name \"Michelle\" or \"Michelle Obama\" appears in the book, \"107 Days,\" only three times across its 300 pages, including two mentions related to the Obamas' delayed public endorsement of the vice president to serve as the 2024 Democratic nominee for president. \"Saddle up! Joe did what I hoped he would do. But you have to earn it,\" former President Barack Obama told Harris when the pair shared a conversation about a presidential endorsement following then-President Joe Biden dropping out of the race in July 2024. \"Michelle and I are supportive but not going to put a finger on the scale right now. Let Joe have his moment. Think through timing,\" Obama continued, according to Harris' notes of their conversation, which she published in her book. OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE In another section of the book, Harris details that on July 26, 2024, the Obamas endorsed Harris through a video message after holding off an endorsement since July 21, 2024. \"The big news of the day for my campaign wasn’t news to me. Barack and Michelle Obama had decided the time was right to endorse me. They’d wanted to make a film of them calling me, and it was now up on social media,\" she wrote in a second example of mentioning Michelle Obama. The former first lady is again mentioned for a third and final time in a section of the book detailing that Harris' husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, was \"moved way up the roster\" of speakers at the Democratic National Convection (DNC), delivering a prime-time speech the same evening as the former first couple. KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION The book detailed Harris' account of the conversation Emhoff shared with DNC planners of the speech, which included the final mention of Michelle Obama: \"'You’re going Tuesday,' he was told.\" \"'Oh, okay, who am I on with?' he asked.\" \"'Barack and Michelle. You three are the prime-time package.'\" \"No pressure.\" Fox News Digital searched \"first lady\" and \"the Obamas\" for any other mention related to Michelle Obama, but turned up empty-handed. The lack of mention regarding Michelle Obama in a personal manner came despite the former first lady hitting the 2024 campaign cycle, including stumping for the Harris–Walz ticket at rallies; the New York Times publishing an opinion piece capturing Michelle Obama's speech during a Harris–Walz rally in Michigan; and addressing the DNC in Chicago to champion the Democratic ticket. \"My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment,\" Michelle Obama said of Harris during her DNC speech. \"She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency. And she is one of the most dignified. A tribute to her mother, to my mother and to your mother, too. The embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country. Her story is your story. It’s my story. It’s the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life.\" KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' Conversely, former first lady Hillary Clinton is mentioned 14 times in Harris' book, including personal anecdotes. Former first lady Jill Biden was mentioned five times, all of which included anecdotes, an assessment of Jill Biden's mood during a meeting or a photo of the first couple accompanied by a favorable caption reading, \"Hillary supporters sour that she’d been run over by Barack.\" Barack Obama is mentioned nine times, including reflecting on conversations the pair shared, anecdotes about his White House and staff, as well as a comment that \"Hillary supporters sour that she’d been run over by Barack\" during the 2016 election.

At least those in the cheap seats could take comfort in knowing the event might be worth the price of a good therapy session.\n\nFintan O’Toole, the evening’s interviewer, got straight to business. He focused on history’s lessons and soon the discussion turned to the savagery in the Middle East.\n\n“Gaza,” Obama said, “is an example of the prison of the past.” He outlined the competing and very real historic grievances on both sides.\n\n“The starting point is to acknowledge history,” he said, offering what on this side of the Atlantic might be considered the most palatable interpretation from middle America. He was unequivocal about the current slaughter.\n\nO’Toole asked how we got here, and Obama gave a concise history of liberal democracy’s evolution — from World War II through the Cold War, globalization, and the fallout that left many disillusioned. There was nothing particularly new in his account, but it’s how he tells it: distilling complex systems and ideas into a version that goes down easily, leaving an aftertaste of more.\n\nOf course, hanging over everything was He Whose Name Shall Not Be Spoken. At no point in the 90-minute interview did that person’s name cross Obama’s lips. The closest was O’Toole’s reference to “the T word.”\n\nBeyond that, it was all what wasn’t said. Obama spoke about authoritarian rule in “Hungary, Turkey and now it’s being mimicked in other places”. (And where might that be?) \n\nRecalling an oil spill during his presidency, he referenced “the Gulf of Mexico,” pausing for a beat to underline that he would not use T’s rebranded “Gulf of America.” He warned, “People who are oppressors will go after storytellers, comics and artists”. Another pause. Jimmy Kimmel anybody? And on it went in that vein.\n\nThe strategy nodded to the once-quaint tradition of former presidents avoiding criticism of incumbents, especially abroad. On another level, it worked perfectly — symbolically denying oxygen to a megalomaniac who can’t open his mouth without self-praise. Still, despite Obama’s stirring rhetoric, a heaviness from the outside world lingered over the arena.\n\nEleven months ago, a week before last November’s US presidential election, the Irish Examiner was in Philadelphia’s Temple University arena, where 10,000 adoring supporters practically sat at Obama’s feet during a rally for Kamala Harris.\n\nHe wore no jacket, his white shirt sleeves rolled up for work.\n\nThe audience was bulling the fight ahead, confident the approaching darkness could be pushed back. Obama lifted them to new heights. That night, he had no hesitation in plainly calling out Harris’ opponent.\n\n“Here’s a man, a 78-year-old billionaire, who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down that golden escalator nine years ago. He’s still tweeting at all times of night, all cats. When he’s not complaining he’s trying to sell you stuff. He wants to sell you a Swiss watch, $100,000, but they can’t find where exactly in Switzerland it is actually made. He wants to sell you a Trump bible.” \n\nThat was then. The battle was lost. The T word won, and now rules rather than governs. Could Obama, when he was First Citizen, have done more to ward off the storm? O’Toole asked.\n\n“I grapple with that, did I say enough,” he replied. “Maybe if I called it out more clearly some people and their politics, people might have been forewarned. It’s a tough balance and I haven’t figured it out yet.” \n\nIn the end, O’Toole invoked Martin Luther King’s dictum that “the long arc of history bends towards justice.” Does Obama still believe that?\n\n“I’d emphasise the long point,” he quipped, adding that everyone has a role in preserving and nourishing democracy.\n\n“It does not bend by itself,” he said of the long arc. “We grab it and pull it towards justice.” \n\nHe’s no Messiah, this former president who broke new ground but perhaps took his eye off the ball. Neither, unlike the current incumbent, would he claim to be. Still, he is a tonic in dangerous times, and for one evening, maybe that was enough.","summary":"At Dublin’s O2, Barack Obama offered a mix of caution, candour and hope as democracy’s fragility loomed large","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41713211.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9597/4798556_1_seoimage1x1_An_20Evening_20With_20President_20Barack_20Obama_20In_20Conversation_20with_20Fintan_20O_27Toole_20at_20the_203Arena_20Photo_20by_20Ray_20Keogh-7_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 09:25:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Mick Clifford Special Correspondent","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Mick Clifford Special Correspondent"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.136},{"id":363933818,"title":"Trump Demands Microsoft Fire Lisa Monaco","text":"President Donald Trump is demanding that Microsoft fire former Biden Justice Department official Lisa Monaco, who Trump has previously blamed for federal investigations into his mishandling of classified documents and alleged election interference, furthering his retribution campaign against his former antagonists.\n\nTrump urged the software giant to remove Monaco, who it recently appointed as its president of global affairs, and argued her tenure as former deputy Attorney General and connections to investigations he views as illegitimate discredit her.\n\n“Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information.

Several European state broadcasters have threatened to boycott the next Eurovision song contest if Israel were to participate.\nSports governing bodies like Europe’s Uefa are also under pressure from icons, including former France and Manchester United striker Eric Cantona, to expel the Jewish-majority state from international tournaments.\nBut none of this adds up to a “critical mass” that would persuade Israel’s most important allies, especially the United States, to abandon Israel because of its ruthless pursuit of Hamas, perpetrator of the October 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Kenneth Katzman, senior Middle East fellow of the Soufan Centre, a New York-based think tank.\n\nWhile public opinion in the West has turned against Israel because of revulsion at its killings of more than 65,000 Gazans so far, politicians remain reluctant to punish it by cutting off military supplies, curbing trade or executing war-crime arrest warrants for Israeli leaders issued last year by the International Court of Justice.\nDelegations staged a mass walkout before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at the UN General Assembly on Friday – which Hamas said showed Israel’s “isolation” as a result of the Gaza war.\n“Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement.\nIn his angry address, Netanyahu vowed to block a Palestinian state, accusing European leaders of pushing his country into “national suicide” and rewarding Hamas.\n“Israel will not allow you to shove a terrorist state down our throats,” said. “We will not commit national suicide because you don’t have the guts to face down the hostile media and anti-Semitic mobs demanding Israel’s blood.”\nThe message to Hamas, Netanyahu said, was that “murdering Jews pays off”.\n\nDespite the UN’s findings, the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada and France have declined to declare Israel’s killings of Gazans a genocide.\nThey have also been at pains to emphasise that their conditional recognition of Palestinians was not designed to punish Israel, but to encourage it to accept a peace deal to end the Gaza war and refrain from annexing the West Bank.\nThis was also true of the US Congress, where there had been increased questioning of support for Israel “pretty much on both sides of the aisle – more so on the Democratic side”, but no substantial action because of “much lingering sympathy” over Hamas’ October 7 assault, said Katzman, who previously worked as a Middle East specialist for the Congressional Research Service for 30 years.\n“There’s criticism and recriminations on Israel’s tactics in Gaza … but there is not a critical mass to somehow abandon Israel,” he told This Week in Asia.\n“They are not adding up to a game changer in terms of what Israel is going to be able to do” in the Middle East, Katzman said, pointing to Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\nThe belated recognition of Palestinian statehood by Western governments is largely aimed at placating their voters’ anger without triggering retaliation from the US, according to analysts.\n“Mustering agreement on symbolic recognition is easier for Canadian and European politicians than mustering agreement on sanctions against Israel, because it is less likely to provoke Trump’s ire or to hit hard interests in the pocketbook,” said Monica Marks, professor of Middle East politics at New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus.\nOne reason Western states recognised Palestinian statehood together as a group was to “protect themselves from punitive US backlash”, she added.\n\nStill, their symbolic recognition of Palestinian statehood has incurred US President Donald Trump’s anger.\nAddressing the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, he conflated the recognition with an encouragement of continued conflict.\n“The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities … even while they refuse to release the [Israeli] hostages or accept a ceasefire,” Trump raged.\n“Instead of giving in to Hamas’s ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.”\nNotably, Western countries that have recently recognised Palestinian statehood have made it conditional upon the release of Israeli hostages, the disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from a future Palestinian administration of Gaza. They also want the Palestinian Authority to undergo significant internal reforms before it is allowed to replace Hamas as Gaza’s administrator.\nThe difference between the position adopted by Australia, Britain and France, and other Israeli allies like Italy and Japan, is that the latter group wants these conditions fulfilled as a precondition for recognition of Palestinian statehood.\nThese conditions “show little grasp of three basic facts”, UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese said in a social media post on Tuesday.\n“Colonialism is over; self-determination is unconditional; doing this amid genocide suggests contempt for human dignity.”\n\nModerate Palestinian politicians, while appreciating the growing recognition of Palestinian statehood, are not convinced it would yield results for their people.\nHanan Ashrawi, a minister of the Palestinian Authority administration which struck peace agreements with Israel in the 1990s, said the recognition of Palestinian statehood by many Western governments signalled “a sea change in the world that had hitherto granted and protected Israel’s impunity and ongoing genocide”.\nNow “many courses of action are open” to these states to “stop the genocide and take punitive measures against Israel”, Ashrawi said in a social media post. “The test lies in whether they will.”\nMustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, said the recognition was welcome, “but it is not enough as it must be associated with immediate sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide in Gaza and the settlers’ terror and annexation of the West Bank”.\nWithout that happening, Israel was “not really feeling an inordinate amount of pressure at this point that would contain or circumscribe what they feel they need to do in Gaza”, Katzman said. “They don’t feel constrained to change course.”\nNetanyahu and his coalition allies remained opposed to the rule of Gaza by the Palestinian Authority because “they feel that doing so would create the underpinnings of a Palestinian state”, he said.\nMarks agreed, saying Israel continued to think “short term, trying to effectuate as many of its goals to achieve absolute military dominance locally and regionally while it has an open runway to do so”.\n\nNetanyahu supported Trump’s election campaign over Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020 and 2024, respectively, “for precisely this reason: because he felt sure that Trump would give him even more unfettered ability to do whatever he wants”, she said.\nIf Israel’s leaders were prioritising Israel’s long-term stability, “they would dial down their present behaviour to better hedge against those risks”.\n“But they’re prioritising Israel’s domination and their own political careers in the present – gobbling up as many opportunities to achieve more domination, territorially and militarily, while they can,” Marks said.\nThey might wager that, in the long term, younger generations in the US “might forget their current feelings of disgust over Israel’s excesses, or that jihadist terrorist attacks might recentre their ire on Islamist extremists”.\nNetanyahu and his coalition partners might also gamble that Israel could – in the long term – manufacture more of its own weapons or source them from countries besides the US “after furthering the Israeli right’s territorial and military goals by leaps and bounds”, Marks said.\n“And they may be right.”\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse, Reuters","summary":"After two years of warfare with Hamas that the United Nations says has brought genocide and famine to Gaza, Israel finds itself more isolated than ever, as it remains intransigent in pursuing its goal of defeating the militant group and rejecting rising global support for Palestinian statehood.\nMany of its Western allies, including Australia, Britain, Canada and France, have recognised – albeit conditionally – the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority as the government of a non-existent...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3327045/us-backing-israels-rising-global-isolation-over-gaza-not-game-changer","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/26/fd2fd901-2b27-448d-9224-971607d4f41e_c9747563.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 08:00:15","author":"Tom Hussain","authors":["Tom Hussain"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.137},{"id":364079864,"title":"SNL returns next week. When the show debuted, it didn't shy away from assassination talk","text":"On Sept. 22, 1975, 45-year-old Sara Jane Moore dropped her son off at his San Francisco school, visited a private gun dealer and, in what she later told the Los Angeles Times was a \"a kind of ultimate protest against the system,\" drew a .38-calibre pistol outside a hotel later in the day, firing at then-president Gerald Ford.\n\nMoore, who had a history of mental illness but had become enmeshed in radical left-wing groups, didn't hit her target in two attempts. \n\nBizarrely, Moore's wasn't the only attempt on the president's life that month by a woman. Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, a one-time acolyte of murderous cult leader Charles Manson, had been tackled by a Secret Service agent 17 days earlier as she pointed a gun in Ford's direction in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nMoore — whose death at 95 was reported this week — insisted she wasn't influenced by Fromme. She pleaded guilty, while Fromme — not unlike Ryan Routh, convicted this week of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump — proved a somewhat unruly defendant. Both women spent decades in prison and were released in the late 2000s.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 1975, a new NBC late-night comedy show aired just its third episode. One sketch on the show piloted by young Canadian producer Lorne Michaels had Laraine Newman guesting on a talk show \"Dangerous But Inept\" as Fromme, calling the interviewer, played by Jane Curtin, a \"fawning fascist sycophant.\" The sketch ended with Curtin teasing the talk show's purported guest the following week, Moore.\n\nThe now-voluminous lore of the early years of Saturday Night Live, which includes several books and television profiles, contains tales of battles between the show's cast and writers with NBC censors, as well as accounts of affiliates baffled by the show's brand of humour. But if there was any great upset at the Fromme sketch, let alone comment from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair at the time, it never registered as a seminal moment.\n\nIt is, obviously, now a much different late-night landscape as SNL kicks off its 51st season on Oct. 4 — not just compared to the show's earliest days, but even since it last aired a new episode in mid-May. It has been announced that Stephen Colbert's weeknight CBS show is in its last months, while Jimmy Kimmel was suspended for a week following comments he made on his ABC show in the wake of the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, an influential but polarizing political organizer in the MAGA movement.\n\nFord 'good-natured' about jokes: Michaels\n\nPrevious FCC chairs have regulated in relative anonymity, but Brendan Carr has offered opinions on what he views as liberal bias, from standard political news shows to even entertainment offerings. As president again, meanwhile, Trump has openly hoped the Colbert and Kimmel troubles will precede the cancellation of NBC's weeknight shows which air after local news programs for most affiliates, hosted by SNL alum Jimmy Fallon and Seth Myers, and executive produced by Michaels.\n\nKimmel, in his return to the air carried on the ABC network but not by dozens of local affiliates, blasted Trump for cheering the potential unemployment of \"hundreds of people\" who work on those NBC offerings.\n\n\"Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods, because he can't take a joke,\" said Kimmel.\n\nWhile the media landscape of 1975 and 2025 can't be reasonably compared, the reactions of Trump and Ford to SNL, among the nine U.S. presidents it has satirized, provide a glaring contrast.\n\nSNL began to hit its stride with a boomer audience, then teens and young adults yearning for something new on television, by its fourth episode, Michaels later recounted to Tom Shales and James Miller, authors of a 2002 oral history of the show — and cast member Chevy Chase's portrayal of Ford was part of the winning formula.\n\nFord, despite a background as a college athlete, had more than one stumble while president. The show's writers revelled in putting Ford the character in various scenarios, with Chase indulging in elaborate pratfalls. \n\nRon Nessen, Ford's press secretary, later recounted just happening to catch a January 1976 SNL episode, and by March, Ford and Chase were gently ribbing each other at a pair of gala dinners. Ford was \"incredibly decent and good-natured\" about the sketches,\" Michaels said when the former president died in 2006.\n\n\"Luckily for me, Mr. Ford had a sense of humour,\" Chase reflected in an op-ed in early 2007, thanking the president and his wife, as the actor once sought help at the Betty Ford Center in the 1980s.\n\nNessen, in an election year where the Republican Party was still stinging from Richard Nixon's Watergate-fuelled resignation, saw a greater opportunity to connect with young voters. He hosted SNL in April 1976, with Ford pre-recording SNL's now-famous cold open.\n\nThe decision probably backfired, both Ford and especially Nessen — who died in March — wrote in respective memoirs. That's because some writers and cast members have since recounted wanting to be merciless on that episode and not treat the Ford administration with kid gloves.\n\n\"The comedian's job was to point out the defects of the establishment and revel in the anarchy,\" Matt Fotis writes in 2020's Satire & The State: Sketch Comedy and the Presidency. \"Ford and Nessen's miscalculation about hosting SNL lies in their misunderstanding of the changing comedic landscape.\"\n\nNational tragedies, changing sensibilities\n\nPresidential candidate portrayals have continued ever since, and the show was even referenced during a 2008 Democratic primary debate, after it had recently lampooned fawning coverage of Barack Obama in a sketch, featuring the fuzziest of softball questions for the candidate.\n\n\" … if anybody saw Saturday Night Live, you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow,\" Hillary Clinton said during the debate.\n\nClinton's barb evinced annoyance with her own media coverage. If Obama was annoyed, it didn't prevent him from nominating her for secretary of state in a matter of months.\n\nBrendar Carr, chairperson of the FCC, will likely take note of what SNL airs this season. When Democratic candidate Kamala Harris popped in for a cameo on the show, Carr complained Trump wasn't afforded \"equal time\" during the campaign. Trump hosted the show in 2004 when his reality show The Apprentice was a hit, and as a presidential candidate in 2015. In 2024, he made appearances on network-aired sporting events; Harris did not.\n\nCameos on the show in the last weeks of the 2008 campaign by Republican John McCain — who hosted in 2002 — and his vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin had no evident impact on their election, which they lost. Obama's lone cameo occurred in October 2007, long before he secured the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump, through tweets over the years, has rapped SNL in harsher terms than anything Ford mustered over the Nessen-hosted show. More applicable to current conditions, Trump complained in 2019 it was \"truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live … can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over &, over, without so much of a mention of 'the other side.'\"\n\nTrump's 2015 appearance, as well as Elon Musk's six years later, were said to have rankled some show members. Michaels admitted to Susan Morrison for her book, Lorne: The Man who Invented Saturday Night Live, that cast sensibilities have changed, telling her he tried to impress upon the cast \"the distinction between their own personal feelings and the script.\"\n\nMichaels was bemused at the time that a cast member was hesitant to portray Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 85 at the time.\n\n\"They care so deeply now,\" he told Morrison in the book. \"The women in particular feel so threatened.\"\n\nBy that point, Morrison reported, former longtime writer Jim Downey had complained to friends still with the show that SNL sometimes felt like the \"comedy division of the [Democratic National Committee].\"\n\nFormer cast member Kate McKinnon, on a new episode of Hot Ones, said she believes Michaels will meet the moment in polarizing times exacerbated by the Kirk killing.\n\n\"Every time there has been a national tragedy that has demanded a sincere cold open,\" she said on the podcast.\n\nSNL under Michaels's leadership has both sidestepped national tragedies — the Oklahoma City bombing was better fodder for a Weekend Update joke about the domestic terrorist from Canadian Norm Macdonald — but also been praised at other times, as with the first new show after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAfter a sombre opening on Sept. 29, 2001, with New York City first responders onstage, Michaels appeared with then-mayor Rudy Giuliani and asked, \"Can we be funny?\"\n\nGiuliani perfectly delivered the response: \"Why start now?\"","summary":"Donald Trump, who hosted Saturday Night Live twice before becoming president, has consistently complained about his treatment on the sketch comedy show.

Discussing Harris’ return to the spotlight, Fox’s Laura Ingraham asked Vance to respond to her claims about why she lost the 2024 election. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Claims Her Rally Crowds Would ‘Pass’ Babies Around In Bizarre Word Salad)\n\n“My reaction is if you look at the polling, both the public and the private polling, the problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short, it’s that it was too long,” Vance said. “That when people actually listened to what she had to say, her polling went down and down and down. I think that if we had had a 150-day campaign, we probably would have had three additional Republican senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide. Because the more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there’s no substance there.”\n\n“Agree or disagree with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate a viewpoint,” Vance added. “I listened to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds, and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes. That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s gonna continue to be her problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint, articulate it for the American people. Just say what you actually believe. Don’t do this word salad, talking around in circles. It doesn’t work, and it’s why she didn’t win.”\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC’s “The View” Tuesday, Harris falsely claimed that the 2024 presidential election was the “closest” of the 21st century. Despite the actual closest election being between former President George W. Bush and former Democratic nominee Al Gore, Harris blamed her loss on having only 107 days to launch her presidential campaign.\n\nSince the release of her book and media tour, some Democrats have expressed frustration with the former vice president’s comments, telling Politico that the book appears to be “unhelpful and divisive.”\n\nIn July 2024, former President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee. A little over two weeks later, Harris selected Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nReceiving almost immediate backlash for her lack of in-depth interviews, Harris’ on-camera responses were often criticized as word salads, with some explanations leaving viewers confused. In October 2024, during an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Harris’ answer to a question about the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas appeared to be quietly edited in the online footage released after the episode’s live airing.\n\nBy February, the Federal Communications Commission released the full video and transcript of Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview, which was over twice as long as the edited version that the network had published on Oct. 7, 2024.\n\nThroughout Harris‘ campaign, the former vice president struggled to connect with voters and their top concerns, which focused on the economy, inflation and immigration. Instead, Harris either pushed race-based policies, such as her appeal to black business owners or refused to distance herself from previously supported policies, like funding transgender surgeries for illegal migrants and cutting funding to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nPost-election polls showed Harris not only earned 7 million fewer votes than Biden in the 2020 race but also failed to match President Donald Trump’s gains, falling short in three of the seven key swing states and in 80% of counties nationwide, according to The New York Times.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
