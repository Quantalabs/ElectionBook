Apparently, it never occurred to him that Americans would be appalled at:\n\n1. Masked ICE agents snatching their neighbors off the streets, many of whom were arrested because of the color of their skin. Some even turned out to be U.S. citizens.\n\n2. Hiring an antivaxxer and science denier, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to be in charge of the nation’s health.\n\n3. Targeting his political opponents by bringing frivolous, made-up charges.\n\n4. Starting a trade war with our friends, such as Canada and Mexico. He just raised Canadian tariffs simply because they played a Ronald Reagan commercial disparaging tariffs during the World Series.\n\n5. Sending the National Guard into cities in Democratic-run states on the pretext of crime preventionand against the will of the governors.\n\n6. Cutting back Medicare and Medicaid benefits to give huge tax cuts to his billionaire donors.\n\nArthur Straus\nWalnut Creek\n\nThe truth about\ndemocratic socialism\n\nRe: “Democrat Zohran Mamdani elected New York City mayor” (Page A3, Nov. 5).\n\nMany Americans don’t understand the difference between communists, socialists, and democratic socialists. Democratic socialists believe in a market-based capitalist economy run to benefit the majority, not the few. They advocate for a robust social safety net, government control over essential services like health care and policies to reduce economic inequality, such as higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. They want universal health care, free higher education and to strengthen labor unions.\n\nWhile communism and some forms of socialism involve state control of everything, democratic socialism works within existing democratic structures to achieve its goals. It is opposed to the authoritarian communism of Russia and China.\n\nMany also worry that democratic socialism will slide into full-fledged socialism or some form of communism. That ignores long-established and respected Social Democratic Parties in Europe — the Labour Party in the UK and the Socialist Party in France, as well as left-of-center parties throughout Scandinavia.\n\nJim Wolpman\nWalnut Creek\n\nRestoring SNAP would\nbe best thing for Trump\n\nRe: “Congress must cement health care, food aid” and “Trump administration must prop up SNAP” (Page A6, Nov. 6).\n\nThank you, Jim Driggers and Ricardo Narvaez, for your recent letters advocating for SNAP, the government program providing food for needy children and families.\n\nObviously, Mr. Trump has never had to go without food due to a lack of money, so he cannot understand the meaning of hunger. Well, Mr. Trump, there are many people without the means to buy food who have used SNAP to feed their families. Do you really want to be seen as the wealthy leader responsible for starving American children?\n\nRestore SNAP.\n\nTari Nicholson\n\nFederal rules against\ngerrymandering needed\n\nMy party just put another nail in the coffin of democracy in California with Proposition 50.\n\nEven in high school, we learned that gerrymandering was undemocratic and unacceptable. It needs a non-political federal implementation of standard rules for all states. States’ rights are an issue, but these are elected federal positions and cannot be left up to the local political bias of states. It beats rolling in the mud with the rest of the country.\n\nIn the future, the California Democratic Party’s claim to defend democracy and protect all minorities (Republicans) will ring hollow.\n\nJames Roesler\n\nProgressive tide rolls\nin with election\n\nThe political tide has changed in America.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s emphatic victory over Andrew Cuomo shows that New Yorkers support progressive, for-the-people policies, over for-the-rich favoritism.\n\nDemocratic wins around the country — Virginia and New Jersey governors, races in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia again, and Proposition 50 here, are all blows to Donald Trump’s nasty, erratic divisiveness.\n\nYet, the Democratic Party leadership resists progressive policies because they fear losing corporate campaign funds and are satisfied with the status quo. Chuck Schumer didn’t endorse Mamdani. Hakeem Jeffries only did so, and Barack Obama only called him at the last minute, after the outcome was clear.\n\nHad Kamala Harris supported progressive policies rather than spouting limp anti-Trump rhetoric, she would have won.\n\nThe only way for Democrats to win back power is to prioritize ordinary people’s needs, tax the shamefully rich and give first-time and younger voters reasons to support Democrats. It’s common sense.\n\nKeith Nakatani\n\nGaza tragedy must\nnever happen again\n\nRe: “It’s time to face the enormity of Gaza’s loss” (Page A13, Oct. 26).\n\nI can only imagine returning to the devastation that once was home in Gaza. Consider the whole Bay Area reduced to powder: Grace Cathedral, 680, Golden Gate Park — no more. Schools and hospitals — piles of concrete and rebar. No clean or running water, not even any pipes or treatment facilities. No toilets; no sewers. No food. Your home is now contaminated rubble. Can you even find the lot? Your pets?\n\nHow do you rebuild centuries of history, beauty, life and culture that have all been bombed to dust? Bring back whole families blasted out of existence? Help so many WCNSFs (Wounded Child No Surviving Family)? This, while Israel continues its bombing, torture, starvation, detention and land theft of innocent Palestinians.\n\nWe must find a way to reclaim the vibrancy and history of Palestine and ensure that “never again” will such obliteration be funded with our money and support.\n\nElizabeth Fisher\nPleasant Hill","summary":"Also: Democratic socialism &#124; The best thing &#124; Federal rules &#124; Progressive tide &#124; Gaza tragedy.

But experts said it's unlikely that an investigation would result in lower prices at grocery stores, and a trade group representing meat packers said they're not to blame.\n\nTrump did not present evidence for his claims, writing on social media that “I have asked the DOJ to immediately begin an investigation into the Meat Packing Companies who are driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.”\n\nHe said he was taking the action to help ranchers, who were recently angered by his suggestion that the U.S. would buy Argentine beef to bring down stubbornly high prices for American consumers.\n\n“We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation’s food supply,” Trump said.\n\n Why beef prices have climbed \n\nBeef prices have soared to record levels in part after drought and years of low prices led to the smallest U.S. herd size in decades. Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, have also curbed imports.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for beef remains strong. Prices are high because consumers want to eat it, and they’re willing and able to pay for it, said Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University.\n\nTonsor said the ownership mix in the meat packing industry has not changed significantly in the past four years.\n\nConcentration in the meat packing business has been a longtime concern for farmers and politicians on both sides of the aisle. Four major meatpacking companies dominate the beef market in the United States.\n\nThere’s no evidence to back up claims that the big packers have undue market power and use it to drive up beef prices, said Derrell Peel, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.\n\n“The packing industry in this country has been investigated and researched for 50 years, and it’s been an issue for over a hundred years, at least, for some producers,” Peel said, expressing skepticism that consumers or producers will benefit from the investigation Trump announced.\n\n“If the outcome is to break up the big packers, the outcome will be higher beef prices for consumers, and lower cattle prices for producers,” Peel said.\n\n Meat packers say they're getting pinched by high prices \n\nOklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said he and his fellow Republican senators Cindy-Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Tim Sheehy of Montana visited the White House to speak with Trump about recent volatility in the beef market. Mullin said Trump agreed to have the Justice Department look at the issue.\n\nMullin blamed meat processors, saying that “we’re seeing the same exact game play again out” as a 2019 lawsuit against large meatpackers for violating antitrust laws.\n\nJBS, which is based in Brazil, is the largest U.S. beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees.\n\nThe company has faced price-fixing charges before. In 2022, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement with grocery stores and wholesalers who accused JBS, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods and other companies of working together to suppress the number of cattle being slaughtered in order to drive up beef prices. \n\nJBS did not admit wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Messages seeking comment were left Friday with JBS USA.\n\nThe Meat Institute, a trade group that represents JBS and other meat producers, said its industry is being pinched by the price of cattle, despite record prices for U.S. beef.\n\n“For more than a year, beef packers have been operating at a loss due to a tight cattle supply and strong demand,” Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna Potts said in a statement. “The beef industry is heavily regulated, and market transactions are transparent. The government’s own data from USDA confirms that the beef packing sector is experiencing catastrophic losses and experts predict this will continue into 2026.”\n\nTrump’s accusations have renewed a bipartisan presidential fight against rising food prices.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden talked with independent farmers and ranchers about initiatives to reduce food prices by increasing competition within the meat industry. And then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in winning reelection last year, used her campaign to vow to crack down on food producers and major supermarkets’ “ price gouging.”\n\nKarnowski reported from Minneapolis.

Donald Trump‘s administration has once again been slammed by an artist for using their music without permission, this time receiving a comment from an unhappy Olivia Rodrigo after the White House and Department of Homeland Security shared a video set to one of her songs.\n\nThe controversial clip in question was shared in a joint Instagram post on Tuesday. Soundtracked by “All-American Bitch,” the opening track on the pop star’s Billboard 200-topping sophomore album, Guts, the video shows United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers forcibly tackling, detaining and deporting people.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Caps Guts Tour With ‘Lacy’ Performance in NYC\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Speaks Out Against Jimmy Kimmel’s Suspension: ‘Blatant Censorship’\n\nOlivia Rodrigo & Gracie Abrams Refuse to ‘Remain SILENT’ About Starving Palestinian Children\n\nIt then cuts to a montage of supposed immigrants voluntarily boarding flights organized by the DHS, smiling and giving thumbs up as they go. “LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” the caption reads. “If you don’t, you will face the consequences.”\n\nIn the comments, Rodrigo wrote, “don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.”\n\nBillboard has reached out to the White House and ICE for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear why the government would want to use a song by the three-time Grammy winner. Not only has Rodrigo been vocal in her opposition to Trump, endorsing his opponent Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, but she’s also specifically called out his harsh crackdown on immigration by way of ICE raids this past year.\n\n“I’ve lived in LA my whole life and I’m deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” she wrote on her Instagram Story in June. “LA simply wouldn’t exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful. I stand with the beautiful, diverse community of Los Angeles and with immigrants all across America. I stand for our right to freedom of speech and freedom to protest.”\n\nThat said, Trump’s administration is famous for using music without artist permission at this point. In the past few weeks alone, Kenny Loggins slammed the twice-impeached POTUS for pairing “Danger Zone” with an AI-generated video of himself dumping feces on “No Kings” protestors, and Swifties called out the White House for making a TikTok set to Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia.” (The pop star herself didn’t comment on the issue, but given her long history of clashing with Trump, it’s probably safe to say she didn’t give him the green light.)\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Some of these areas had the largest shifts towards Trump last year, particularly in New York and New Jersey, but on Tuesday, the returns more closely resembled 2020 margins.\n\nThis came alongside relatively high turnout, at least compared to recent off-year elections, suggesting that one pattern of the last decade in American politics — Republicans doing well when Trump is on the ballot, and Democrats doing better when he is not — continues to hold.\n\nThe AP’s analysis is based off county- and precinct-level data. In all cases, 2025 margins are as of 10:45 a.m. on Nov. 7. Additional votes will be counted as election officials tabulate late-arriving mail and provisional ballots. Here are some of the findings.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey continue a trend — but with big margins\n\nVirginia and New Jersey, the two states that elect governors in the year following a presidential election, both have a tradition of moving against the party in the White House.\n\nStarting in 1976, every time a party has won back control of the presidency, Virginia voters have chosen a governor from the opposing party the following year. And in New Jersey, voters elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting president in every election from 1989 to 2017.\n\nDemocrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill continued this trend with double-digit victories.\n\nSpanberger’s victory was especially notable for its scale. In the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections, the average margin of victory was 8.6 percentage points.\n\nSpanberger’s 14.4-point win — coming a year after Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won the state by just 5.8 percentage points — was bolstered by big margins in Northern Virginia, home to Washington, D.C., suburbs heavily affected by federal government cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. It also greatly exceeded former President Joe Biden’s 10.1-point victory in 2020.\n\nThese shifts helped Spanberger win 15 counties and independent cities that her predecessor, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, had won four years earlier. Six of those jurisdictions — Spotsylvania, Lynchburg, Nelson, Waynesboro, Prince Edward and Surry — also supported Trump in 2024.\n\nSpanberger also benefited from a spending advantage of around $27 million and Trump’s reluctance to endorse her Republican opponent.\n\nIn succeeding term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, Sherrill not only restarted New Jersey’s history of voting for the party not in power but also broke a 60-year streak. No party has held the New Jersey governorship for more than three consecutive terms since the 1960s, when a two-term Democratic governor succeeded another two-term Democratic governor.\n\nRecent voting patterns in New Jersey suggested the governor’s race could have been much tighter. And in addition to receiving Trump’s endorsement, Republican Jack Ciattarelli kept pace with Sherrill in terms of spending.\n\nHe also got close the election prior. Ciattarelli came within 3 points of ousting Murphy in 2021. And between Ciattarelli’s 2021 and 2025 campaigns, Trump made massive inroads in New Jersey: He flipped five counties that Biden won in 2020 and cut the Republican margin in the state down to just 5.9 percentage points.\n\nSherrill’s 13.5-point win indicated a return to pre-2024 levels. While she fell short of Biden’s 15.9-point win, she returned all five of the counties Trump flipped to the Democratic column. She also improved on Harris’ margin in Bergen County, the state’s largest, by more than 8 points.\n\nNew York City saw generational turnout\n\nSome of Tuesday’s elections were notable outliers in terms of the number of people they brought to the polls, while others were more in line with past races.\n\nIn New York City, state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani juiced turnout in his successful primary campaign and built on that in the general election. More than two million New Yorkers voted for mayor this year, a level of voter enthusiasm the city hasn’t seen in a mayoral election since 1969, when John Lindsay won a second term.\n\nThe governor races were more of a mixed bag. New Jersey had the highest turnout rate in a governor election since 2009, when Republican Chris Christie beat incumbent Democrat Gov. Jon Corzine. As of Friday morning, this year’s turnout was just under 50%.\n\nVirginia’s turnout rate was just shy of 2021 levels as of Friday morning. It is not yet clear if turnout in 2025 will meet or exceed 2021 as ballots continue to be counted.\n\nMamdani made strides among voters of color\n\nBefore the general election, Mamdani drew skepticism from political pundits for perceived weakness with some voters of color in New York City. While he did well in June’s primary among neighborhoods with large Asian and Muslim populations, he generally fell short of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.\n\nThe general election was a different story. Whether it was because of outreach, the benefit of running on the Democratic ballot line, or his mega-viral campaign videos, Mamdani won nearly every single majority Black and majority Hispanic neighborhood.\n\nIn general, Mamdani did well in areas and among demographics that moved toward Trump over the last two presidential elections.\n\nForty-seven New York City neighborhoods shifted at least 25 points towards Trump in 2024. Mamdani won 37 of them.\n\nMamdani won most of the city’s neighborhoods that experienced the greatest shift right in 2024\n\nAnd a year after Trump eroded Democrats’ advantage among young voters nationally, Mamdani won about three-quarters of voters under the age of 30, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nCalifornia becomes the first state to draw more Democratic seats\n\nThere was only one race on the ballot in California, but it had major implications for control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterm elections. In passing Proposition 50, which temporarily substitutes a Democratic-drawn congressional map for the map created by an independent redistricting commission, California voters could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats next year.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to adopt a new map that would add Democratic seats. Four other states — Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio — have also enacted new maps since Trump began encouraging states to redistrict over the summer. Those four states all changed their district lines to create winnable Republican seats.\n\nFederal workers voted blue\n\nTwo groups that have been particularly affected by the ongoing government shutdown are military families and federal workers. Many in these groups have been furloughed or are working without pay as the shutdown stretches into a sixth week.\n\nDemocrats sought to capitalize on this in both gubernatorial campaigns.\n\nIn Virginia, home to one of the largest concentrations of federal workers as well as major military bases, federal workers in particular supported Spanberger.\n\n… Military households were more split\n\nHouseholds with a current or former member of the military were evenly split between the two candidates in Virginia and favored Ciattarelli in New Jersey.","summary":"This year’s electorate moved decisively towards the Democratic Party.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/11/07/takeaways-2025-election-charts/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Election_2025_America_Votes_96874-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 22:03:31","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":376890620,"title":"James Carville says he'd 'find a convicted pedophile' to run against Republicans after election wins","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville stirred controversy Thursday with provocative remarks reacting to Tuesday’s election results.

Gavin Newsom justified the redistricting effort by claiming it was in response to redistricting in Texas and other red states. The new congressional map is expected to flip several congressional districts blue, including the ones currently represented by California Republican Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Kevin Kiley, Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, and David Valadao.\n\nIssa, Valadao, and Kiley are expected to come under immense pressure come the 2026 midterms.\n\nCalifornia’s 52 congressional seats are currently occupied by 43 Democrats and just nine Republicans. While President Donald Trump secured nearly 40% of the Golden State’s vote in 2024, less than 20% of the congressional seats are occupied by Republicans.\n\nCalifornia is already #1 in the nation for poverty, unemployment, and homelessness.

The bill provided about $100 billion for border enforcement, modernization of the U.S.’ air traffic control system, preserved and expanded Trump’s tax cuts, and increased the child tax credit, among other things.\n\n“I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California—regardless of their party or where they live,” Issa said in a statement following Tuesday’s election results. Issa’s new district, drawn by the state Legislature, has turned his seat from solid red to light blue. \n\nIssa is serving his second stint in Congress. He first came to Washington in 2001 and held his seat until 2019. During his first stint, he chaired the House Oversight Committee from 2011 to 2015 and managed Congress’ response to the Obama-era IRS scandal.\n\nIssa returned to Washington in 2021 and has kept his seat with a strong, conservative voting record.\n\nThe Southern Californian has robust conservative bona fides. He has earned an A+ rating from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America by voting for legislation like the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and a resolution condemning attacks on pro-life facilities and churches.\n\nIssa has also supported the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would make it against federal law for schools that receive federal funding to allow males to participate in athletic programs meant for girls and women.\n\nValadao Looks to Hold On\n\nLike Issa, Valadao has served two separate stints in Congress. His first stint ran from 2013 to 2019, but he returned to Washington in 2021.\n\nValadao has likewise received an A+ from the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America scorecard.\n\nValadao’s new district will still likely be red, with it reportedly going, according to Punchbowl News, “from a seat President Donald Trump won by six points to one he won by two points.”\n\nValadao’s office was not immediately available for comment.\n\nDoes Kiley Have a Chance?\n\nMeanwhile, Kiley, who currently represents California’s 3rd Congressional District, will face a steeper uphill battle. His district’s new borders now encompass a region that went for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her 2024 presidential bid by 10 points. \n\nKiley, a member of Congress since 2023, has yet to announce whether he will seek reelection, but the prospects of flipping the 3rd District are already enticing Democrat challengers, as Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., has declared his intention to run.\n\nOther Republicans find themselves in a similar situation to Kiley.\n\nCalvert is campaigning for California’s new 40th Congressional District, which includes greater than 50% of the district he presently represents. But he’ll have to face off against Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., the current representative for the 40th District, who has said she will run for reelection in the solidly red new district as well.","summary":"Republican representatives from California will have to fight for their survival in the 2026 midterms as Democrats redraw the Golden State’s congressional maps to increase...

How’d Zohran Do?","text":"At this point last November, Zohran Mamdani was a largely unknown state assemblyman, and the Democratic Party’s brand in New York City was at rock bottom. \n\nIn the 2024 election, President Donald Trump picked up about 100,000 more votes in the city than in 2020; Kamala Harris fell more than half a million votes shy of Joe Biden’s total. And some of the most dramatic shifts in the entire country could be found in immigrant neighborhoods in Mamdani’s home borough of Queens. The party’s outer-borough collapse mirrored the party’s national crack-up; as it spent millions to court college-educated voters in the suburbs, Democrats were losing ground with the sorts of working-class, non-white voters in blue cities who traditionally helped form the backbone of the party. The term you kept hearing over and over was “realignment.”\n\nWhen we chatted with residents and elected officials this spring, in the Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights and Corona, we found deep-seated frustrations with Democratic governance—and concerns about crime, immigration, sex-workers, poor services, and the cost of living. Many people brought up the pandemic, which had hit the area hard and damaged people’s faith in the social contract.\n\n“The former governor, Andrew Cuomo, never stepped foot in Corona, even during the pandemic,” Democratic state assemblywoman Catalina Cruz told us. “I had to fight him to get a vaccination site in my district because while we were the epicenter, because my community was undocumented and immigrant, we were the last ones to get help.” Corona, she said, was what you get “when the government ignores its community.”\n\nMamdani’s victory on Tuesday over Cuomo was the product of a relentless campaign that united a broad multi-racial coalition with a focus on affordability. But it was also a test of how well the Democratic Party was recovering in the places where it has suffered the most. This outer-borough collapse, clustered most intensely in working-class Latino and Asian communities, loomed over the New York City mayoral race from the start. Mamdani soft-launched his candidacy by talking to Trump voters and non-voters in outer-borough neighborhoods about what it would take to win them back. \n\nSo: How’d he do?\n\nComparing off-year races with presidential elections can be a little difficult, but Mamdani’s vote total—the highest for a winning mayoral candidate since the 1960s—offered some clear takeaways. Although 700,000 fewer people voted in the city this November compared to last, Mamdani actually earned more votes than Harris in a few notable areas. \n\nIn parts of the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick, home to many young and left-leaning voters, overall turnout matched or exceeded 2024 totals, and nearly all those votes went to Mamdani. That’s a major achievement for an off-year election, and a reflection of the mayor-elect’s appeal among younger Americans who opposed Trump and were unenthusiastic about the Democratic Party. \n\nBut Mamdani also ran well ahead of Harris in another, much different area: along parts of Hillside Avenue in Queens. This is one of the two neighborhoods Mamdani visited last November to talk to residents about the presidential election. In the now-famous video, voters expressed their frustration with the Democratic Party’s appeasement of Israel and their sense that politicians had done little to address the high cost of living. In one heavily Bangladeshi precinct on Hillside Avenue, Mamdani ended up winning more raw votes than Harris on Tuesday—despite 14 percent fewer people showing up. \n\nThe story was similar in other pockets of the city with large South Asian and Muslim populations, and where Democratic support lagged in 2024. Mamdani, despite running against a prominent Democratic former governor, scored a 24-percent improvement on Harris’ vote total in one precinct in Brooklyn’s “Little Bangladesh”—where turnout was just as high as last year.\n\nMamdani’s energetic emphasis on affordability, his implicit and explicit rejection of unpopular Democratic figures like Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, and his unique appeal as one of the city’s first major-party Muslim mayoral candidates helped him make up ground that Democrats had recently lost.\n\nOn Tuesday, a few hours before polls closed, we returned to the Queens neighborhoods we profiled earlier this year for Reveal, to see how Mamdani’s pitch had gone over. What we found was backed up by the numbers. It would be wishful thinking to call Mamdani universally beloved, but there were signs that his message of affordability resonated with voters who had been on the fence about Democrats, and that Trump’s 2024 coalition was beginning to fracture.\n\nIn conversations with about two dozen voters, we heard firsthand from people who voted Democratic after rejecting Harris last year, and from voters—particularly young voters—who were drawn to Mamdani by his emphasis on issues that affected their lives on a daily basis.\n\n“I don’t take buses because I don’t trust them—I pay for the bus, it just, like, skips my stop or something,” said a young Elmhurst voter named Diego. Another voter outside the precinct said he voted for Trump as “the lesser evil” in 2024, but felt that Mamdani offered a new direction and saw promise in his plans to make the city “affordable.”\n\n“The free bus thing, I think, is great,” he said. “A lot of the time people don’t want to pay for the bus anyway. That’s a good incentive, and honestly, I’d rather if we all paid a little more tax and make the MTA free.” \n\nBeyond Mamdani convincing some Trump voters, there were signs of dissatisfaction in the Republican electorate, too. More than one voter mentioned that they voted for Trump—and not for Mamdani—but were disappointed by the administration.\n\nA senior citizen in Jackson Heights who voted for Cuomo because of his emphasis on public safety told us that he and his wife had both voted for Trump last November. \n\n“He promised a lot of things [were] going to change,” he said. \n\n“But nothing’s changed,” his wife added.\n\nMamdani had some of his strongest performances in Jackson Heights, an extraordinarily diverse neighborhood with large South Asian and Latino populations. In one heavily South Asian voting district in the neighborhood, Mamdani ran 20 percentage points ahead of Kamala Harris and netted more votes overall. \n\nOutside a polling site in the neighborhood on Tuesday, Abdul Aliy said that he left the presidential line blank last November. “I just couldn’t bring myself to vote for Harris, [and] obviously I wasn’t gonna vote for Trump, so there wasn’t really an option I saw,” he said. But he told us he voted for Mamdani enthusiastically, because the democratic socialist’s platform aligned with his own values: “Free transit, free buses,” he said, rattling off the campaign promises that resonated. “He has this idea of a public market that will stabilize the prices of certain goods—I like that idea.”\n\nOutside of P.S. 89Q in nearby Elmhurst, Rina Hart, a 32-year-old user interface designer, said that she and her family were long-time New Yorkers who had voted for Cuomo in the past. Hart initially thought she would do so again in the primary. But she was turned off by the former governor’s campaign and the wealthy donors backing him. “I was concerned about Mamdani’s experience,” she explained, “but at least he has integrity.”\n\nHer parents ended up voting for Cuomo in the primary, while she and her brothers went for Mamdani. There was no generational divide in the general election: They all backed Mamdani. Hart explained that her mom, who is South Asian, had been alienated by the racist videos promoted by Cuomo’s backers. \n\n“It’s been a really tough time to be a Democrat. And you’re kind of seeing why we didn’t win,” Hart said about Mamdani’s rise in the wake of recent Democratic losses. “It’s been really hopeful.” She now wants the party to move on from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who did not endorse the mayor-elect. \n\n“That’s the only way we can get out of this MAGA cycle that we’re in,” Hart said.\n\nGlacel, an Ecuadorian immigrant who has worked at one of the original Equinox gym locations for the past 31 years, went with Cuomo.\n\nShe said she didn’t vote in last year’s presidential election because of the local crime and disorder. It was the worst she’d ever seen things get in Queens, and she blamed the decay on Democrats not dealing with the migrant crisis. “Disgusting. Filthy. Messy,” she said. “Ecuador is better than here.” \n\nAnother Elmhurst voter, an Argentine immigrant named Miguel Mendez, described himself as a sometime-Democratic voter. He opposed Trump during his first election and had once been curious about Bernie Sanders, but came around to the Republican nominee by 2024. He believed the neighborhood was deteriorating and that Democrats were more interested in pushing their ideology than in fixing it up.\n\n“If it wasn’t the Salvadorans, the MS-13—it was the Tren de Aragua, or even cartels,” he said. “I mean, you can ask anyone over here where the gangs are. You can go to Roosevelt, you see what I mean. The prostitution, it’s everywhere.\n\nMendez chose Curtis Sliwa. (His girlfriend, he said, told him he couldn’t back Cuomo.) \n\nDespite voting for Trump, he wasn’t happy with how things were playing out in Washington. The second Trump term had been “a big disappointment for me, because I was begging him to talk about all the weird drones that came in New Jersey and New York,” he said. “He said that he was gonna bring that out, same thing with the Epstein names, a bunch of stuff that he’s not doing—so that makes me think that no matter what party the guy who’s in office, they just have to follow an agenda.”\n\nFurther along Roosevelt Avenue, in the heavily Latino parts of Queens that swung heavily toward Trump in 2024, the picture was mixed. Turnout in Corona, a working-class Latino neighborhood, was up dramatically from the last mayoral election, but still well short of a presidential year. Among those who voted, data from the New York Times shows Mamdani winning the neighborhood by 11 points.\n\nAna, a 58-year-old Democratic voter in Corona from the Dominican Republic, said she voted for Cuomo after backing Kamala Harris last year. Like other voters in Corona, the problems along Roosevelt Avenue, which she also blamed on more recent immigrant arrivals, were front of mind.\n\n“I like the Democrats because they’re humanitarians but as a result they’re hurting us,” Ana said. She lamented that her own Democratic representatives had not done enough when it came to immigration.\n\nThat included her own member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But Ana still mostly liked her congresswoman, who unlike Mamdani, she thought had enough experience.\n\nAna was skeptical about the feasibility of Mamdani’s plans to make the city more affordable. Free buses won’t make her daily 4 am subway commute to a restaurant job at Google’s Manhattan campus any cheaper. Nor would his proposed rent freeze for stabilized units cover her market-rate apartment. \n\n“You can’t offer free things in New York,” Ana explained in Spanish. “Even looking at something here costs something.” Then she laughed with a sigh of resignation. \n\nMamdani now has four years to prove voters like her wrong.","summary":"At this point last November, Zohran Mamdani was a largely unknown state assemblyman, and the Democratic Party’s brand in New York City was at rock bottom.&#160; In the 2024 election, President Donald Trump picked up about 100,000 more votes in the city than in 2020; Kamala Harris fell more than half a million votes shy [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/11/democrat-collapse-realignment-new-york-city-mayor-race-mamdani-trump-harris-2024-corona-queens-jackson-heights/","image":"https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251106_mamdani-queens-voters_2000_D.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 19:51:19","author":"Chasity Hale,Tim Murphy and Noah Lanard","authors":["Chasity Hale","Tim Murphy and Noah Lanard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":376869426,"title":"Judge Dismisses Suit by Des Moines Register Subscriber Who Alleged Fraud Over the Paper's Trump-Harris Poll","text":"Last January, Dennis Donnelly, a longtime Des Moines Register subscriber, sued the newspaper and pollster Ann Selzer, alleging that they had committed multiple torts by conducting and publicizing a poll suggesting that the presidential contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Iowa was much closer than expected. On Thursday, a federal judge in Iowa dismissed that lawsuit with prejudice, deeming it inconsistent with the First Amendment. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger also concluded that Donnelly had failed to properly plead any of his claims.\n\nThat decision in Donnelly v. Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. does not bode well for a similar lawsuit that Trump filed against Selzer and the Register last December. \"A party cannot evade First Amendment scrutiny\" by \"simply labeling an action one for 'fraud,'\" Ebinger notes. Yet that is exactly what Trump is trying to do when he portrays \"fake news\" as a form of consumer fraud.\n\nIf anything, Trump's fraud claims are even less plausible than Donnelly's. Donnelly, who sued on behalf of all Des Moines Register subscribers, actually has a commercial relationship with the newspaper. Trump, by contrast, does not seem to have any such connection with the Register or Selzer. But both lawsuits suffer from the same basic problem: Because they treat misleading journalism as actionable fraud, they amount to thinly veiled assaults on freedom of the press.\n\nThe poll at the center of both cases, which Selzer conducted in late October 2024, gave Harris a three-point lead over Trump in Iowa, a difference that was within the statistical margin of error. The Register reported the results two days before the election under the headline \"Iowa Poll: Kamala Harris leapfrogs Donald Trump to take lead near Election Day.\"\n\nBy contrast, several other polls conducted around the same time gave Trump a lead of seven to nine points in Iowa. He ultimately won Iowa by 13 points.\n\nThe gist of Donnelly's complaint is that the Register and Selzer misled him and other readers about the state of the race in late October. But as Ebinger notes, he did not allege that Selzer's methodology \"differed from the one disclosed in the accompanying article\" or that the defendants \"altered responses or weighed the sample in an attempt to produce a certain result.\" In fact, Donnelly noted that Selzer's Iowa Poll \"is historically accurate and is the 'gold standard' for polling\" in that state. But he thinks Selzer and the Register should have been skeptical of the surprising results because other polls painted a different picture.\n\nIs that sort of journalistic failure enough to strip Selzer and the Register of the constitutional protection that ordinarily would apply to their work? Ebinger thinks not. \"Each of Donnelly's claims must satisfy First Amendment scrutiny,\" she notes, \"because 'there is no free pass around the First Amendment.'\"\n\nThe defendants argued that they were entitled to \"absolute immunity\" from Donnelly's claims, which they described as \"a frontal assault on the First Amendment.\" Donnelly argued that he could prevail by showing \"actual malice,\" the standard that applies to defamation claims by public figures.\n\nFinding the relevant case law unclear, Ebinger applies the \"actual malice\" test but concludes that Donnelly has failed to meet it. \"Actual malice requires showing 'sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of [their] publication,'\" she writes. It is not enough to argue that a \"reasonably prudent\" person would not have published an article or that he \"would have investigated before publishing.\" To show a \"reckless disregard for the truth,\" a plaintiff must do more than allege that the defendant failed to \"recognize a mistake or ambiguity and its potential consequences.\"\n\nAt this stage of the case, Ebinger says, Donnelly had to allege \"non-conclusory\" and \"non-speculative\" facts \"sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference of actual malice.\" She says he clearly failed to do so.\n\nDonnelly suggested that Selzer and the Register \"designed the poll's methodology to produce an intentionally inaccurate result and knowingly published the inaccurate result,\" Ebinger notes. But \"no specific facts have been alleged to support such a\n\nThat failure, Ebinger says, dooms all of Donnelly's claims. She nevertheless addresses each one separately.\n\n\"Donnelly alleges fraudulent misrepresentation of the state of the election,\" Ebinger writes. \"Under Iowa law, a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation requires a plaintiff to show: 1) a representation was made; 2) the representation was false; 3) the representation was material; 4) the defendant knew the representation was false; 5) the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff; 6) the plaintiff acted in reliance on the truth of the representation and that reliance was justified; and 7) the representation was a proximate cause of plaintiff's damages.\"\n\nDonnelly's claim fails right out of the gate, Ebinger says, because \"no false representation was made.\" The defendants \"conducted a poll using a particular methodology which yielded results that later turned out to be different from the event the poll sought to measure,\" she writes. But \"the results of an opinion poll are not an actionable false representation merely because the anticipated results differ from what eventually occurred.\"\n\nDonnelly \"does not claim the disclosed methodology was not followed, that results were falsified, or that Defendants altered the poll in some other way which did not reflect the publicly disclosed methodology,\" Ebinger notes. \"Defendants told readers exactly what they did and how they did it.\" Donnelly \"fails to cite to any authority finding an opinion poll [regarding] a future event constitutes a false factual assertion.\"\n\nDonnelly also alleges \"negligent misrepresentation to a reckless degree.\" That claim requires a plaintiff to show that the defendant, by virtue of his profession and his relationship to the plaintiff, had a \"duty of care.\"\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court has said \"professionals such as accountants, abstractors, and attorneys owe a duty of care in supplying information to foreseeable third parties as members of a limited class of persons who would be contemplated to use and rely upon the information.\" But that duty extends only to \"a person in the profession of supplying information for the guidance of others\" who \"acts in an advisory capacity,\" is \"manifestly aware of the use [to which] the information will be put,\" and \"intends to supply it for that purpose.\"\n\nDonnelly's negligent misrepresentation claim \"fails because a pollster and a general\ncirculation newspaper reporting on the results of an election poll are not in the business or profession of supplying information to a limited class of others who [they know will] rely on the information,\" Ebinger says. \"The relationship between a newspaper and the public is fundamentally different from the relationship between an accountant or attorney and his or her client. There is no 'limited class of persons' a newspaper contemplates will use the information the paper publishes.\"\n\nDonnelly asserted that Selzer and the Register violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act, which prohibits \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" practices \"in connection with the advertisement, sale, or lease of consumer merchandise.\" That claim, Ebinger says, \"fails because publishing the results of a political opinion poll that matches the co-published methodology is not an unfair or deceptive practice.\"\n\nAn \"unfair practice\" entails \"substantial and unavoidable injury to consumers.\" That did not occur here, Ebinger says.\n\nDonnelly claimed the defendants promised \"trustworthy, accurate news\" and \"knowingly or recklessly failed to deliver that product\" by \"blowing their biggest story of the year.\" Under Iowa law, \"a course of conduct contrary to what an ordinary consumer would anticipate contributes to a finding of an unfair practice.\" But \"ordinary customers of the Des Moines Register would expect the paper to publish the Iowa Poll as it has done for decades,\" Ebinger writes. \"Consumers would expect the poll to be conducted commensurate with the methodology accompanying the poll. Consumers would understand from the methodology statement, as well as the inherently uncertain nature of opinion polling, that polling is an inexact science which can yield errant results in prognosticating future election results.\"\n\nDonnelly \"cites to no law which establishes that mere inaccuracy of an opinion poll constitutes an unfair practice,\" Ebinger notes. \"Donnelly's assertion is also internally contradictory as such a standard would mean every [pollster] cited favorably by Donnelly was similarly engaged in an unfair practice because they too published polls which did not accurately forecast the election outcome.\"\n\nTo establish \"deception,\" a plaintiff must show that \"an act or practice\" was \"likely to mislead a substantial number of consumers as to a material fact or facts.\" Deception \"therefore necessarily requires the false statement or material omission of a fact,\" Ebinger writes. \"Donnelly does not allege any misrepresentation with regard to either the methodology statement or the poll results…No factual information regarding how the poll was conducted was withheld from readers. The article fully described the poll results [and the] the poll methodology, and provided additional analysis of the surprising nature of the results.\"\n\nDonnelly claimed Selzer and the Register engaged in \"professional malpractice.\" But he \"fails to allege the necessary element of duty,\" Ebinger says.\n\nDonnelly argued that the defendants owed Register readers \"the ordinary care of a\njournalist or pollster,\" which would have entailed recognizing \"the obvious problems with the Iowa Poll.\" But \"the nature of the relationship between newspapers and their readers…does not impose such a general duty,\" Ebinger writes. \"Donnelly fails to cite\nto any Iowa law imposing such a duty on newspapers, and courts generally find no such duty exists.\" She quotes one of those decisions, which concluded that \"imposing a high duty of care on those in the business of news dissemination and making that duty run to a wide range of readers or TV viewers would have a chilling effect which is unacceptable under our Constitution.\"\n\nTo illustrate the implications of imposing such a legal duty, Ebinger cites a 1999 decision rejecting the proposition that the Weather Channel could be held liable for an inaccurate forecast. The judge noted \"the litany of absurd suits which could follow from imposing such a duty, such as construction workers suing when they pour concrete in reliance on a weather report forecasting no rain or commuters suing when they are stuck in traffic and late to work because the news reported there would be light traffic,\" Ebinger writes. \"Finding for Donnelly here would permit similar absurdity.\"\n\nFinally, Donnelly argued that Selzer and the Register were guilty of \"interference with the right to vote.\" In support of that claim, he cited a 1911 Iowa case involving local officials who prevented someone from voting. The outcome hinged on \"the proper interpretation of the Iowa Code section governing voter eligibility,\" Ebinger notes, and the decision \"makes no mention of a cognizable tort under Iowa law for interference with the right to vote.\" Donnelly \"cites to no other Iowa law establishing such a tort.\"\n\nLike Donnelly's lawsuit, Trump's complaint against Selzer and the Register alleged \"fraudulent misrepresentation,\" \"reckless negligent misrepresentation,\" and violations of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. \"The claims are essentially identical,\" notes Robert Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which represents Selzer.\n\nTrump's case, like Donnelly's, was assigned to Ebinger. But on September 30, he asked her to dismiss it without prejudice. She initially resisted but was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit last week. \"Right now,\" Corn-Revere says, \"the question in the Trump case is about whether it will remain in federal court.\"\n\nCorn-Revere nevertheless welcomed Ebinger's ruling in Donnelly's case. \"This decision shows where petty politics ends and the rule of law begins,\" he said in a press release. \"The court's strongly worded opinion confirms that a legal claim cannot be concocted with political slogans and partisan hyperbole, and that there is no hiding from the First Amendment. This is a good day for freedom of speech.\"","summary":"On Thursday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit that echoed Donald Trump's claims against the Des Moines Register and pollster Ann Selzer.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/11/07/this-ruling-does-not-bode-well-for-trumps-attempt-to-portray-journalism-as-consumer-fraud/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trump-face-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 19:40:53","author":"Jacob Sullum,Joakim Book","authors":["Jacob Sullum","Joakim Book"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.598},{"id":376847090,"title":"None of the above: Democrats were asked to name who the real leader of their party is – and most don’t know","text":"While Democrats essentially swept Tuesday’s off-cycle elections by overwhelming margins, boosted by Donald Trump’s historic unpopularity and an extremely energized liberal base, the party is still hunting for a figurehead leader who can help them retake power from the GOP.\n\nAccording to a new poll from Politico, the most popular answer when Democratic voters were asked who they considered to be the real leader of the party was “I don’t know.” Finishing in third place was “nobody.”\n\nThe survey, which polled Americans who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, showed that there are currently dozens of competitors for the crown, with Harris garnering the second most responses.\n\nEven though the ex-veep was the only person on the list to hit double-digits, only 16 percent of the people who voted for her last year believe she is the Democratic leader. In comparison, “I don’t know” or a variation of that answer was chosen by 21 percent of respondents.\n\nWith last year’s presidential nominee – who is seen as a possible 2028 contender and has been making the media rounds recently promoting a book – pulling in relatively meager support as the face of the party, a host of other senior lawmakers and ex-presidents were also named by Democrats as possible leaders.\n\nOn the flip side, the only other notable name who has been floated as a 2028 hopeful is California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who barely topped six percent in the poll despite his highly publicized antagonism towards Trump and Republicans – which culminated in his redistricting effort winning easily in Tuesday’s elections.\n\nBarack Obama, who left the White House in 2017 following Trump’s first electoral victory and cannot run again, was picked by 7.4 percent of Democratic voters as the leader of the party – just behind Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House.\n\nJoe Biden, the 82-year-old former president who announced last July that he would not seek a second term amid calls for him to drop out following his disastrous debate performance against Trump, finished in 8th place at 4.4 percent.\n\n“Ugh no one,” a 26-year-old white woman in Arizona who voted for Harris told Politico when asked who the leader of the party was, while a 49-year-old white man in Maryland added: “I do not believe there is a leader right now.”\n\nWith Democratic strategists also telling Politico that this is merely “where we are” and that even they “couldn’t couldn’t tell you who the leader of the Democratic Party” despite working for Democrats, they still see a lot of hope after Tuesday’s results.\n\nTwo moderates in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races sailed to double-digit victories despite some pollsters (and Fox News) suggesting the GOP candidates – especially in Jersey – could make it close or even win the seats. At the same time, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani convincingly beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral election, leading to a full-blown freakout by MAGA media and Republicans sounding the alarms about the midterms and 2028.\n\n“It felt like we’re getting our footing back, in terms of politics,” a strategist for the centrist Third Way think tank told Politico, adding: “That has not yet translated to people seeing clearly who they think is pointing the direction of the party.”\n\nOn the flip side, Trump – who can’t run in 2028 despite what some MAGA influencers have claimed – is overwhelmingly seen as the current leader of the GOP, with no other Republican even garnering three percent of the tally. The president finished at 81 percent among voters who chose him in last year’s election.\n\nJared Leopold, a strategist who has worked for the Democratic Governors Association, pointed out that the lack of a clear leader for Democrats is “pretty standard for a party that is out of power.” He compared the party’s situation right now to where Democrats were in 2008, when Obama emerged, and in 2016, when Trump became the face of the GOP.\n\n“Democrats were successful [Tuesday] as a big tent party running on affordability and against Donald Trump,” he added. “That’s a two-piece equation that will be successful for us as we move toward 2028.”","summary":"‘Ugh no one,’ a 26-year-old white woman in Arizona who voted for Harris told Politico when asked who the leader of the party was, while a 49-year-old white man in Maryland added: ‘I do not believe there is a leader right now’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrat-leader-poll-2025-kamala-harris-b2861052.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/02/15/04/FILE-PHOTO-U-S--President-Biden-attends-a-Department-of-Defense-Commander-in-Chief-farewell-ceremony.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/34lDqYt9-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 19:09:49","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":376847076,"title":"Katie Porter’s polling for California governor tanks after screaming fit at staffer and interview walkout","text":"Support for California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter has tanked after she nearly stormed out of a recent interview and old footage surfaced of her berating a staffer, according to new polling.\n\nIn a UC Berkeley survey released Friday, 11 percent of Golden State voters said they back Porter, a former Democratic congresswoman, down from 17 percent in August.\n\nShe’s now been overtaken by Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, who garnered 13 percent support, up three points from this summer. The shift may reignite hope among Republicans keen on retaking the governor’s mansion for the first time in decades.\n\n“Californians are craving real leadership after eight years of [Governor Gavin] Newsom’s posturing and primping while so many are suffering,” Bianco told The Independent when asked about the survey. “A new way forward begins in November 2026 when I am elected Governor.” \n\nThe poll comes on the heels of a turbulent few weeks for Porter, one of nearly a dozen candidates running to replace term-limited Gavin Newsom in 2026. \n\nIn October, a sit-down interview she conducted with CBS News went viral after she became flustered by the reporter’s questions.\n\n“What do you say to the 40 percent of California voters, who you’ll need in order to win, who voted for [President Donald] Trump?” journalist Julie Watts asked Porter.\n\n“How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?” Porter, who made a name for herself by grilling corporate executives during congressional hearings, responded. \n\nWhen pressed on this question, she complained Watts was “unnecessarily argumentative” and came close to tearing her mic off while threatening to end the interview. \n\nThe next day, Politico obtained footage from 2021 of the then-congresswoman yelling at an aide during an online discussion with then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.\n\n“Get out of my f***ing shot!” Porter can be heard shouting when the unnamed aid briefly appears on camera to offer a correction to a statement Porter made about electric vehicles.\n\nIn response, Porter told The Independent at the time, “It’s no secret I hold myself and my staff to a high standard, and that was especially true as a member of Congress,” adding, “I have sought to be more intentional in showing gratitude to my staff for their important work.”\n\nThe two incidents have sparked fierce criticism from Porter’s rivals.\n\nBianco told FOX News that Porter’s CBS News interview revealed her “entitlement” and “narcissism.” And Betty Yee, a former California State controller, said Porter lacks the right temperament for high office.\n\nBut, it’s still early in the race and many voters still have not made up their minds about the crowded field of candidates — which is expected to grow.\n\nIn the UC Berkeley survey, nearly half of respondents, 44 percent, said they remain undecided ahead of the June primaries and November general election.\n\nAnd despite recent challenges, Porter remains the frontrunner among Democrats — a vital advantage in a state that has not elected a GOP governor since Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006.\n\nA 19 percent plurality of Democrats said they support her. Xavier Becerra, who served as former President Joe Biden’s secretary of Health and Human Services, came in second, garnering 13 percent support.\n\nPorter is “the leading Democrat among the various ones that are in there right now,” Mark DiCamillo, director of the survey, told The Los Angeles Times. “But it’s because nobody really on the Democratic side has really jumped out of the pack. It’s kind of a political vacuum at the moment.”\n\nHe added that the relative lack of interest in the race also could be down to the special election on redistricting, which passed on Tuesday, as well as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s belated decision to not run for the governor’s mansion. \n\nNow that the special election is over, candidates can “rev up the public to pay attention,” DiCamillo said.\n\nThe survey was conducted October 20-27 with 8,141 registered voters in California and it has a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Porter’s campaign for comment.","summary":"The former congresswoman has now been overtaken by a Republican sheriff, according to the poll","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/katie-porter-california-governor-poll-b2860971.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/09/9/17/Katie-Porter.png?crop=2446.5,1631,x96.7,y0&trim=0,97,0,96&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dcNnLMkC-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 19:09:10","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.182},{"id":376869062,"title":"US intel found Israeli military lawyers warned there was evidence of Gaza war crimes, former US officials say","text":"The United States gathered intelligence last year that Israel’s military lawyers warned there was evidence that could support war crimes charges against Tel Aviv for its military operations in Gaza reliant on American-supplied weapons, five former US officials said.\n\nThe previously unreported intelligence, described by the former officials as among the most startling shared with top US policymakers during the war, pointed to doubts within the Israeli military about the legality of its tactics that contrasted sharply with Israel’s public stance defending its actions.\n\nTwo of the former US officials said the material was not broadly circulated within the government until late in the Biden administration, when it was disseminated more widely ahead of a congressional briefing in December 2024.\n\nThe intelligence deepened concerns in Washington over Israel’s conduct in a war it said was necessary to eliminate Hamas fighters embedded in civilian infrastructure. There were concerns Israel was intentionally targeting civilians and humanitarian workers, a potential war crime which Israel has strongly denied.\n\nUS officials expressed alarm at the findings, particularly as the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza raised concerns that Israel’s operations might breach international legal standards on acceptable collateral damage.\n\nThe former US officials Reuters spoke to did not provide details on what evidence, such as specific wartime incidents, had caused concerns among Israel’s military lawyers.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians during a two-year military campaign, say Gaza health officials. Israel’s military has said at least 20,000 of the fatalities were combatants.\n\nReuters spoke to nine former US officials in then-president Joe Biden’s administration, including six who had direct knowledge of the intelligence and the subsequent debate within the US government. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nReports of internal US government dissent over Israel’s Gaza campaign emerged during Biden’s presidency. This account, based on detailed recollections from those involved, offers a fuller picture of the debate’s intensity in the administration’s final weeks, which ended with President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, declined to comment when asked for a response about the US intelligence and the internal Biden administration debate about it.\n\nNeither the Israeli prime minister’s office nor the Israeli military spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nDebate intensified in final days of Biden term\n\nThe intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council (NSC), where officials and lawyers debated how and whether to respond to the new findings.\n\nA US finding that Israel was committing war crimes would have required, under US law, blocking future arms shipments and ending intelligence sharing with Israel.\n\nIsrael’s intelligence services have worked closely with the US for decades and provide critical information, in particular, about events occurring in the Middle East.\n\nBiden administration conversations in December included officials from across the government, including the State Department, the Pentagon, the intelligence community and the White House. Biden was also briefed on the matter by his national security advisers.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We do not comment on intelligence matters,” a State Department spokesperson said in response to emailed questions about Reuters reporting.\n\nThe American debate about whether the Israelis had committed war crimes in Gaza ended when lawyers from across the US government determined that it was still legal for the US to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the US had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict, according to three former US officials.\n\nThey reasoned that the intelligence and evidence gathered by the US itself did not prove the Israelis had intentionally killed civilians and humanitarians or blocked aid, a key factor in legal liability.\n\nSome senior Biden administration officials feared that a formal US finding of Israeli war crimes would force Washington to cut off arms and intelligence support — a move they worried could embolden Hamas, delay ceasefire negotiations, and shift the political narrative in favour of the group.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 251 in its October 7, 2023 attack, with Israel launching its campaign in retaliation.\n\nThe decision to stay the course exasperated some of those involved who believed that the Biden administration should have been more forceful in calling out Israel’s alleged abuses and the US role in enabling them, said former US officials.\n\nPresident Trump and his officials were briefed by Biden’s team on the intelligence but showed little interest in the subject after they took over in January and began siding more powerfully with the Israelis, said the officials.\n\nState Department lawyers repeatedly raised concerns\n\nEven before the US gathered war crimes intelligence from within the Israeli military, some lawyers at the State Department, which oversees legal assessments of foreign military conduct, repeatedly raised concerns with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes, according to five former US officials.\n\nAs early as December 2023, lawyers from the State Department’s legal bureau told Blinken in meetings that they believed Israel’s military conduct in Gaza likely amounted to violations of international humanitarian law and potentially war crimes, two of the US officials said.\n\nBut they never made a conclusive assessment that Israel was violating international humanitarian law, a move that other US officials at the State Department saw as the legal bureau pulling its punches.\n\n“They saw their job as being justifying a political decision,” one of the former US officials said. “Even when the evidence clearly pointed to war crimes, the Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card was proving intent,” one of the officials said.\n\nThe lack of a definitive conclusion by the State Department’s lawyers was largely reflected in a US government report produced during the Biden administration in May 2024, when Washington said Tel Aviv might have violated international humanitarian law using US-supplied weapons during its military operation in Gaza.\n\nThe report, which was prepared by the State Department, stopped short of a definitive assessment, citing the fog of war.\n\n“What I can say is that the Biden administration constantly reviewed Israel’s adherence to the laws of armed conflict, as well as the requirements of our own laws,” Blinken said through a spokesperson for this story. Blinken declined to comment on the intelligence matters.\n\nInternational concerns about possible war crimes\n\nLast November, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, as well as Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.\n\nHamas has since confirmed Israel killed Deif.\n\nIsrael has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.\n\nAmong the issues debated by US officials in the final weeks of the Biden administration was whether the government would be complicit if Israeli officials were to face charges in an international tribunal, said people familiar with this debate.\n\nUS officials publicly defended Israel but also privately debated the issue in light of\nintelligence reports, and they became a point of political vulnerability for Democrats. Biden and later Vice President Kamala Harris waged ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaigns.\n\nBiden did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIsrael, which is fighting a genocide case at the International Court of Justice, rejects genocide allegations as politically motivated and says that its military campaign targets Hamas, not Gaza’s civilian population.\n\nThe Israeli military says it seeks to minimise civilian harm while targeting militants embedded in hospitals, schools and shelters, using warnings and appropriate munitions.\n\nAn Israeli military official told Reuters in September that the military was investigating about 2,000 incidents of possible misconduct, including civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure.\n\nSome cases came to light through the genocide case filed at the International Court of Justice, the official said.","summary":"The United States gathered intelligence last year that Israel’s military lawyers warned there was evidence that could support war crimes charges against Tel Aviv for its military operations in Gaza reliant on American-supplied weapons, five former US officials said.\n\n\nThe previously unreported intelligence, described by the former officials as among the most startling shared with top US policymakers during the war, pointed to doubts within the Israeli military about the legality of its tactics that contrasted sharply with Israel’s public stance defending its actions.\n\n\nTwo of the former US officials said the material was not broadly circulated within the government until late in the Biden administration, when it was disseminated more widely ahead of a congressional briefing in December 2024.\n\n\nThe intelligence deepened concerns in Washington over Israel’s conduct in a war it said was necessary to eliminate Hamas fighters embedded in civilian infrastructure.

Markey of Massachusetts — also make our list. But their biggest challenge is likely to come in the primary from a member of their own party.\n\nThe ranking is based on extensive conversations with campaign insiders, party officials and independent election analysts, as well as candidates’ fundraising and race ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.\n\nCQ Roll Call typically focuses on the 10 most endangered members in each chamber, but our latest Senate list features only six.\n\nBecause our list focuses on incumbents, it doesn’t take into account open-seat races, whose outcomes will also determine the balance of power in the Senate. Three Democratic incumbents from competitive states — Michigan’s Gary Peters, New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen and Minnesota’s Tina Smith — as well as Republicans Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa all announced their retirements, leaving behind competitive seats.\n\nDemocrats need a net pickup of four seats to win control of the chamber next year. Speaking before Tuesday’s off-year elections, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin admitted that would be a “pretty steep” hill to climb.\n\nBut sweeping Democratic wins across the country Tuesday injected some optimism into the minority party, with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Kirsten Gillibrand, both of New York, saying the results “make clear that Republicans’ Senate majority is at risk.”\n\nDemocrats harbor long-shot hopes of expanding their path to the Senate majority through red-state races that could become competitive under the right conditions. In Alaska, for instance, Democrats are already criticizing two-term Sen. Dan Sullivan for his votes in favor of legislation that included cuts to Medicaid. Former Rep. Mary Peltola, the last Democrat elected statewide, would be a strong opponent, but she has not yet announced her 2026 plans.\n\nAnd Nebraska’s Pete Ricketts is fighting off a challenge from independent Dan Osborn. In 2024, Osborn, a former labor leader, came within 7 points of defeating the state’s senior senator, Republican Deb Fischer. But Ricketts, a popular former governor, is seen as a stronger contender against Osborn.\n\n1. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga.\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nAs the only Senate Democrat on this list from a state that Trump won in 2024, Ossoff has had to navigate the political complexities of a purple state. But this is his first test since his victory over former Sen. David Perdue in a runoff election in early 2021 helped hand Democrats control of the Senate. This year, Ossoff faces a fractured Republican field: Two congressmen, Mike Collins and Earl L. “Buddy” Carter, are running, along with former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, a political newcomer who has the backing of Gov. Brian Kemp. Despite the GOP divisions, Republicans are confident the party will coalesce behind the winner of the May primary. Ossoff, meanwhile, has a big fundraising advantage over his potential rivals. He raised $12.1 million between July and September and ended the third quarter with $21.4 million in the bank. Democrats were also encouraged by Tuesday’s election results, which saw a pair of Democrats flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission.\n\n2. Susan Collins, R-Maine\n\nRace rating: Tilt Republican\n\nMaine is unsurprisingly shaping up to host another marquee Senate race next year. Collins, the lone Republican senator representing a state won by Kamala Harris last year, has yet to officially announce her campaign for a sixth term. But the Democratic primary to take her on has heated up, with Gov. Janet Mills and oyster farmer Graham Platner locked in a battle that highlights the generational and ideological differences within the party. Platner, who raised $3.2 million in the first six weeks of his campaign, has been dogged by recent negative headlines over unsavory past social media posts and a problematic tattoo. But a University of New Hampshire survey from last month showed him with a double-digit lead over Mills. Also running is former congressional aide Jordan Wood, who’s raised $3.1 million since joining the race in April. To hang on as New England’s only Republican in the Senate, Collins will have to overcome low favorability ratings (which she’s done before) and fend off Democratic attacks over health care costs and the fall of Roe v. Wade, which occurred after her last reelection. She ended September with $6.7 million banked.\n\n3. John Cornyn, R-Texas\n\nRace rating: Likely Republican\n\nFor months, Cornyn has been fighting for his political future against firebrand primary challenger Ken Paxton, the state attorney general. Now, the senator faces a battle on a new front, with GOP Rep. Wesley Hunt joining the field. Cornyn has Senate GOP leaders behind him, and a pro-Cornyn super PAC is already running ads supporting his campaign. That spending has boosted Cornyn’s poll numbers: An October survey by the University of Houston and Texas Southern University found him and Paxton effectively tied, with Hunt in third place. Cornyn reported raising $910,000 last quarter through his main reelection committee and about $2.4 million through his joint fundraising accounts. Paxton raised $1.3 million in that same span, while Hunt netted $366,000 for his House account. On the Democratic side, state Rep. James Talarico has proved to be a fundraising juggernaut, bringing in $6.2 million in his first three weeks. Former Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Sen. Ted Cruz by 8 points last year, raised about $4.1 million for his second Senate bid.\n\n4. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nRace rating: Solid Republican\n\nIn conservative Louisiana, Cassidy would only be vulnerable in the primary. He started October with $9.5 million in the bank, giving him a massive money edge over his GOP opponents: state Treasurer John Fleming, state Rep. Julie Emerson, state Sen. Blake Miguez, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. But he’s on our list because he’s one of just three Republican senators still in office who voted to convict Trump at his post-Jan. 6 impeachment trial. Cassidy’s rivals have already attacked him over his vote, as they angle for Trump’s endorsement. But Cassidy supporters say he has worked to rebuild his relationship with the president. The senator has been invited to the White House more than a dozen times this year and has nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. In September, Trump sent Cassidy a birthday note thanking him for his “continued friendship and enduring commitment to our cherished American values.”\n\n5. Jon Husted, R-Ohio\n\nRace rating: Lean Republican\n\nHusted was Ohio’s lieutenant governor when Gov. Mike DeWine appointed him earlier this year to fill the seat left open after Republican JD Vance became vice president. A close ally of DeWine’s, Husted enjoys a clear path to the GOP nomination, unlike in recent cycles, when Vance and Bernie Moreno, now Ohio’s senior senator, each faced contentious primaries. But the special election to fill the remaining two years of Vance’s term has drawn a familiar Democrat: former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his seat to Moreno in 2024. In red-leaning Ohio, Brown, the gravel-voiced populist with historical ties to the labor movement, is likely the only person who could make the race competitive, but even his supporters concede it will require a lot of money, and a bit of luck. Democrats say the impacts of Trump’s tariff policy will weigh heavily on the minds of voters, but it won’t be easy overcoming Ohio’s reliably Republican underpinnings. Brown, long a skilled fundraiser, reported total receipts of $7 million in the first six weeks since launching his bid. Husted had about $5 million in the bank at the end of September.\n\n6. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.\n\nRace rating: Solid Democratic\n\nMarkey, who is 79 and the longest-serving Democrat in Congress, is facing an intraparty challenge from Rep. Seth Moulton, 47, who has framed the race as a generational battle for the future of the Democratic Party. Markey has been here before: In 2020, he handily beat back a challenge from another Democratic House member, Joseph P. Kennedy III. Markey has also built strong ties with younger progressives, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A new University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB poll found Markey leading Moulton by 20 points. The field could grow: Politico reported Tuesday that Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley is weighing a Senate run. Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary would be heavily favored in the general election. The Bay State hasn’t elected a Republican to the Senate since 2010, when Scott P. Brown notched a surprise special election win to succeed the late Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Brown is running for Senate in New Hampshire this cycle.\n\n©2025 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved. Visit cqrollcall.com.

But what is clear so far is that mid-decade redistricting will have a major impact on the House battlefield.\n\nNewly enacted maps in a handful of states have influenced where some lawmakers land on our list of the most vulnerable House incumbents a year before Election Day 2026.\n\nOf course, incumbents from the most evenly split and competitive House districts continue to dominate the list. But the top two spots are claimed by a pair of Democrats, Don Davis of North Carolina and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, whose districts were made significantly redder by state Republicans after President Donald Trump called for new maps to help the GOP defend its narrow House majority next year.\n\nTo compile this list, CQ Roll Call’s campaign team relied on interviews with party insiders, district dynamics, past results, candidates’ campaign finances, race ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and district-level presidential performance, as calculated by Inside Elections. We only looked at incumbents and not at open seats, which could also flip and affect party control.\n\nThis month’s list excludes vulnerable lawmakers from California, where the state’s House map had not been finalized as of publication time. Golden State voters on Tuesday passed Proposition 50, a ballot measure to rubber-stamp a Democrat-drawn map for the next three election cycles. That means we left off two freshman Democrats — Adam Gray, who topped the list in May, and Derek Tran, who came in at No. 5. — and did not consider five House Republicans who could be vulnerable: Doug LaMalfa, Kevin Kiley, Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa and David Valadao.\n\nWe’ve also held off on including Missouri Democrat Emanuel Cleaver II, who would be at or near the top of the list after his Kansas City-area district was carved up by the GOP-led Legislature. But Missouri Democrats have begun an initiative process to place the map on the ballot in 2026, which could block it from being used next year. An advocacy group, People Not Politicians Missouri, has until next month to gather enough signatures, but if the current map holds, Cleaver will almost certainly move onto the list should he choose to seek reelection.\n\nThe new map in Texas has left some Democrats still sorting out which districts they plan to run in. Rep. Julie Elizabeth Johnson, for instance, has seen her Dallas-area district transform into a heavily red seat that stretches into East Texas and it’s unclear where she will seek reelection next year.\n\nWith the recent adoption of a new map in Ohio, longtime Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur makes our list, after her Trump-voting district shifted further right.\n\nAnd more redistricting targets could be joining her in future editions of this list. A state judge in Utah has until Nov. 10 to choose new congressional lines after ruling earlier this year that the state’s current GOP-drawn map did not comply with Utah’s redistricting standards.\n\nLegislators in Indiana and potentially Kansas are expected to meet this year to consider new Republican-initiated map changes, while Democratic legislators in Virginia have begun a process aimed at amending the commonwealth’s constitution to allow for mid-decade redistricting. New boundaries in Florida remain on the table as well.\n\nRedistricting notwithstanding, the typical dynamics of a midterm election are still in play. The House represents the best chance for Democrats to cut into full GOP control of Washington, but Republicans are looking to build on their 2024 success to maintain and grow their majority.\n\nHistory dictates that midterm elections in a president’s second term favor the party out of power. Democrats are hammering Republicans over their massive tax and spending bill enacted over the summer, particularly its health care provisions, and over the economy more broadly. Republicans are confident that popular provisions in the new law, such as no tax on tips, will win support from voters. And it remains to be seen whether the ongoing partial government shutdown will resonate with voters a year from now.\n\nSeveral lawmakers, including longtime Democratic incumbents, are facing primary challenges this cycle. Some of their primary opponents appear to be building legitimate campaigns, and those incumbents could join future versions of this list as the dynamics become clearer.\n\nDon Davis (D)\n\nNorth Carolina’s 1st District\n\nRace rating: Tilt Republican\n\nDavis was first elected in 2022, but Republican state lawmakers have since twice redrawn the boundaries of his northeastern North Carolina district. Their most recent effort shifts the seat from one that Trump carried by 3 points to one that would have backed him by 12 points. Davis hasn’t said whether he’ll seek reelection to his current seat or challenge GOP Rep. Greg Murphy in the new 3rd District, which now includes Davis’ home in Snow Hill. Republican hopefuls in the 1st District include state Sen. Bobby Hanig and Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson. Davis entered October with $1.6 million in the bank. Roberson, who has loaned his campaign $3 million, had $2.4 million on hand, Hanig $246,000 and Murphy $2.1 million.\n\nVicente Gonzalez (D)\n\nTexas’ 34th District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nGonzalez, a political moderate serving his fifth term, represents a Latino-majority border district that swung more than 15 points toward Trump in 2024. And that was before Texas Republicans passed a new gerrymander that made his South Texas district even more favorable to the GOP. Despite the new map, Gonzalez has said he intends to run for reelection. He outperformed Kamala Harris in 2024 and has criticized his party for moving too far to the left on abortion and transgender rights. Gonzalez ended September with $1.3 million stockpiled, besting two leading Republican challengers: former Rep. Mayra Flores, whom Gonzalez beat in both 2022 and 2024, and Army veteran and attorney Eric Flores (no relation to the former congresswoman).\n\nGabe Evans (R)\n\nColorado’s 8th District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nEvans is seeking a second term in Colorado’s most competitive district, which reaches from the northern fringe of the Denver metro area to Fort Lupton and Greeley. Several Democrats are seeking to defeat him, including state Reps. Manny Rutinel and Shannon Bird, state Treasurer Dave Young and Marine veteran Evan Munsing. Former Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who held the seat for a single term before Evans ousted her in 2024, briefly launched, then dropped, a comeback bid. Evans had nearly $2 million in his campaign account at the start of October, far more than any of the Democrats in the race.\n\nRyan Mackenzie (R)\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nMackenzie’s 1-point win last year in this Lehigh Valley swing district came with Trump boosting Republicans across Pennsylvania as he completed a nationwide sweep of battleground states. With Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro at the top of the ticket next year, the down-ballot effects could be different, though Republicans see Mackenzie in a strong position. Democrats are locked in a crowded five-way primary between Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell, former utility company executive Carol Obando-Derstin, Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley and firefighter union head Bob Brooks. Mackenzie’s fundraising dipped in the third quarter, but, at $1.4 million, he still has a significant cash-on-hand advantage over his Democratic rivals.\n\nMariannette Miller-Meeks (R)\n\nIowa’s 1st District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nIt took Miller-Meeks four tries to win her House seat in Iowa’s southeastern corner; one of her Democratic opponents, former state Rep. Christina Bohannan, is hoping to do it in three. Miller-Meeks barely edged Bohannan in 2024, winning by 798 votes, but supporters of the third-term Republican say the close call prompted her to bolster her fundraising efforts. She’s brought in more than $3 million so far this cycle and ended September with $2.6 million on hand. Bohannan, a law professor, has raised nearly $2 million since launching her bid and had $1.6 million banked. Both will need to get past primary challengers before squaring off for the third time. Miller-Meeks once again faces Gold Star dad David Pautsch, who took 44% of the primary vote last year. Bohannan’s primary opponents include attorney Taylor Wettach and health care worker Travis Terrell.\n\nMarcy Kaptur (D)\n\nOhio’s 9th District\n\nRace rating: Tilt Republican\n\nThe longest-serving woman in congressional history, the 79-year-old Kaptur is a political survivor who has managed to keep winning despite Ohio’s shift from a purple battleground to a comfortably red state. But the latest redraw of her Toledo-anchored district might spell the end of a House career now in its fifth decade. Under the state’s new map, the 9th District shifts from one Trump carried by 7 points to one he would have carried by 11 points. Republicans lining up to take on the congresswoman include 2024 nominee Derek Merrin, a former state representative who lost to Kaptur by fewer than 2,400 votes, state Rep. Josh Williams and Air Force veteran Alea Nadeem. Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, whose home now falls within the new district, could run as well. Kaptur dominated her Republican opponents in fundraising, the latest filings showed, with $1.2 million in her coffers on Sept. 30.\n\nMike Lawler (R)\n\nNew York’s 17th District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nWith Don Bacon announcing his retirement in June, Lawler is now the only Republican holding a seat carried by Kamala Harris on this list. (Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick has a more proven electoral record in his Harris-supporting district in suburban Philadelphia.) Lawler is once again a top target for Democrats, who have a crowded primary to pick their nominee in this lower Hudson Valley district. Rockland County Legislator Beth Davidson and Army veteran Cait Conley are seen as top Democratic contenders and entered October with $657,000 and $950,000 on hand, respectively. But those totals were dwarfed by Lawler’s $2.8 million. Still, next year is the congressman’s first midterm election as an incumbent as he tries to parlay his image as a relative moderate into a third term.\n\nJuan Ciscomani (R)\n\nArizona’s 6th District\n\nRace rating: Toss-up\n\nCiscomani prevailed twice over Democratic former state Sen. Kirsten Engel, but in his quest for a third term, he faces a new opponent: Marine veteran JoAnna Mendoza, who grew up in a working-class family in southern Arizona. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and is the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in the House, has focused on water security, a key concern in the district tucked into the state’s southeastern corner. Mendoza has emphasized economic issues and Republican-enacted cuts to Medicaid. Mendoza narrowly topped Ciscomani in third-quarter fundraising, $696,000 to $613,000, although the congressman ended September with $2.4 million in his campaign coffers, far ahead of his opponent’s $950,000.\n\nMarie Gluesenkamp Pérez (D)\n\nWashington’s 3rd District\n\nRace rating: Tilt Democratic\n\nGluesenkamp Pérez twice beat Republican Joe Kent, a retired Green Beret and MAGA favorite, in this southwest Washington district that’s a mix of rural, suburban and urban communities. This time, she’s facing John Braun, the top Republican in the Washington Senate, with Kent taking a top counterterrorism role in the Trump administration. Republicans are hoping Braun’s government experience and less combative approach to politics will appeal to the district’s independent-minded voters who were turned off by Kent. But Democrats say Gluesenkamp Pérez’s voting record and willingness to occasionally buck her party will once again help her prevail. The congresswoman had $1.9 million in the bank at the end of the third quarter, while Braun, who entered the race in August, had less than one-third of that.\n\n©2025 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Inexplicably, shockingly, distressingly, Trump won voters making less than $50,000, while Democrat Kamala Harris carried those earning more than $100,000, according to exit polls.\n\nTrump promised big things—chief among them lowering prices “on Day One.” Not only has he failed to deliver since taking office, he also hasn’t even bothered trying. His policies have instead fueled inflation: tariffs driving up costs, and mass deportations shrinking the cheap labor supply.\n\nThen Zohran Mamdani shocked the political establishment, coming from nowhere to win New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary on a platform primarily-focused on soaring living costs. His campaign only stumbled when he strayed into the Israel-Palestine debate—an issue irrelevant to running a city. But when he spoke about economics, he was pitch-perfect. This past Tuesday, he handily won the general election, too.\n\nThe lesson from Mamdani’s success is simple: Voters care most about how their vote will improve their financial health. Nothing else comes close. That’s how Trump managed to get 46% of Latinos to vote for him despite his open bigotry. Many were willing to stomach a racist in the White House if it meant a better shot at feeding their families. It sounds harsh, but worrying about climate change, trans rights, abortion rights, or immigration—all of which I fiercely support—is something of a privilege for those not consumed by the daily struggle of making rent or affording groceries.\n\nA candidate focusing their campaign on anything beyond a core economic message can be a liability. Even democracy itself doesn’t sway people when they’re struggling to survive—I’ve seen it firsthand in my native El Salvador. Hell, they’ll happily trade their civil liberties for economic security. \n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean Democrats shouldn’t fight for those causes. It means only that they shouldn’t campaign on them. A politician’s first job is to win elections. So talk about what voters actually want: a reason to vote. The answer must always be “A better life for you and your family.”\n\nTrump promised that. He hasn’t delivered. And now he’s paying the price—both in the polls and at the ballot box.\n\nLast year, Trump made New Jersey competitive, losing by just 6 percentage points—a 10-point improvement over his 2020 margin. Some of his biggest gains came in Latino-heavy, working-class areas.\n\nBut if New Jersey’s results on Tuesday are any indication, that flirtation with Trump may be over. According to exit polls, Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill won 68% of Latino voters and 71% of voters making less than $50,000 a year. She also carried 54% of those making more than $100,000. This is how it should be: Democrats winning everyone but billionaire assholes.\n\nVirginia wasn’t much different. Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger won 67% of Latinos and 63% of the under-$50,000 crowd, while retaining 56% of those making more than $100,000. \n\nTrump lied about lowering prices. He lied about caring. He never gave a damn about anyone outside of his gilded circle. There are White Houses to demolish and ballrooms to build. Why would he care whether the yokels he’s always despised can afford dinner?\n\nTuesday’s elections suggest Republicans may be in deep trouble. Their gains with the working class are going up in smoke, even as Democrats hold onto wealthier, educated voters. And even farm country might be trending away from the GOP.\n\nNew Jersey doesn’t have much rural territory left, but Virginia does. Outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won 63% of rural and small-city voters in 2021, according to exit polls. Spanberger just won 54% of them. And if you’re wondering whether those numbers were skewed by Republicans’ train wreck of a nominee, they weren’t. The lieutenant governor’s race shows the same pattern: The Republican won 56% of rural Virginia this year, but in 2021, they won 62%.\n\nIf even farm country is turning, another year of tariff pain and White House dysfunction could strip Republicans of one of the last voting blocs they thought was safe.","summary":"In 2024, Democrats reversed generations of elections as the party of the working class and ceded the title to Donald Trump.

Sherrill also received support from almost 90% of black voters and 80% of Asian voters. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) similarly overperformed with black, Asian, and Latino voters in Virginia, compared to the 2024 results.\n\nVoters under 30 also shifted significantly to the left in virtually every race. Spanberger pulled 70% of the demographic, according to CNN’s exit polls, while Sherrill pulled 68%. In New York’s mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani pulled in a whopping 78% of young voters. In California, 79% of voters under 30 voted for Proposition 50, the congressional redistricting proposal put forward by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA).\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin was bullish about Tuesday’s results, particularly when it came to younger voters.\n\n“While there’s a lot of work in front of us, which we’re starting today, I’m buoyed by this statistic,” he said when asked whether this week’s results foreshadow next year’s midterm elections. “Remember that young people, probably more than any group, are feeling the impacts of this terrible economy that Trump has created. The job market is soft. There’s few opportunities for recent college graduates, most young people who are already disillusioned about their economic future are feeling even more disillusioned now, right? There are fewer opportunities. Rent is high, many of them having to move home to live with their parents, and many of them concerned about their futures and not seeing any hope on the horizon.”\n\nStill, Republicans haven’t totally abandoned hope for maintaining congressional control in 2026. Despite the bad night, multiple veteran GOP operatives point to specific ways they can rebound.\n\nWadi Gaitan, communications director for the Libertarian-leaning Libre Initiative, reiterated in an interview that just because nonwhite voters backed Trump at historic levels for a Republican in 2024, that “does not mean they are now Republican voters.”\n\n“Many of these voters who voted for President Trump, who voted for Republicans on the downballot, are actually, many of them, independent voters, or many of them were even Democrat voters who were tired of the Democrat Party and didn’t see the agenda of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” he explained, before warning Democrats that 2025’s results with minority voters will not automatically roll over into 2026. “They’re independent groups that in every election have to be fought for. It’s not baked in for one side of the other, and I think that’s something that Republicans have to remember, and Democrats as well, right?”\n\nUltimately, Republicans’ greatest hurdle heading into next year will be motivating voters across all demographics to turn out when Trump’s name is not on the ballot. The president himself suggested this week that his absence was the top reason behind the GOP’s failings on Tuesday.\n\n“They say that I wasn’t on the ballot was the biggest factor,” he told reporters at the White House. “But I don’t know about that, but I was honored that they said that.”\n\nAnd two other senior Republican operatives, familiar with Trump’s political operation, say the president will remain a “juggernaut” fundraiser, with one issuing assurances that the president will help the Republican committees “spend whatever’s necessary to hold on to Congress” next year.\n\nAfter reentering office in January, Trump slowed the pace at which his political team raked in the donations, but, as the seasons change, so has Trump’s mindset. The president and his team have held at least three fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago since the government shutdown began in October, and he will travel back to Florida on Friday evening. White House officials did not immediately say whether Trump would host more fundraisers this weekend before returning to Washington.\n\nStill, even if Republicans have plenty of cash to spend this cycle, Gaitan suggested that GOP candidates will still face the challenge of reassuring voters that the president is actually improving their economic prospects. Exit polls suggested that affordability was, by far, the top issue for voters on Tuesday, and Republicans will be forced to balance selling the president’s agenda while acknowledging inflation and other increases to the cost of living.\n\n“Republicans, they’re going to have to do two things: They’re going to have to make what their agenda for the future is clear,” Gaitan said. “What is it that they’re going to do for all Americans when it comes to the economy, when it comes to healthcare, when it comes to immigration? And second, apart from sharing a clear vision from the future because they are part of the governing party, they’re going to have to make it very clear on what it is that they’ve already done for Latinos and all Americans.”","summary":"Republican operatives admit they received an “ass kicking” on Tuesday night, and alarm bells are ringing that crucial gains President Donald Trump made in 2024 with key demographics were wiped out.

On the 2025 gubernatorial campaign trail in Virginia, however, race was dropped from the common talking points as Obama and other Democrats rallied around former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a White woman, in her battle against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Jamaican immigrant and Marine veteran. Earle-Sears would have been the state's first Black female governor if she had been victorious Tuesday. Former Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is in the midst of his 2026 Senate campaign to replace outgoing Sen. Mitch McConnell, advocated that identity politics should be dropped from public discourse and replaced with discussions on merit, while noting Democrats employ race rhetoric when it's most advantageous.

So if you don't mind — just for a second, I've got to speak to y’all and say that when you have a choice that is this clean: When on the one hand, you have somebody who grew up like you, went to college with you, understands the struggles (and the) pain and joy that comes from those experiences,\" Obama said, continuing that Trump \"has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person — and you are thinking about sitting out?\" A year later, Obama called on Virginia voters to snub the Black female candidate in favor of Spanberger. OBAMA INSISTED BLACK MEN VOTE FOR HARRIS BUT NOW STUMPS AGAINST VIRGINIA'S BLACK LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR \"There is absolutely no evidence Republican policies have made life better for you, the people of Virginia,\" Obama said in his speech from the Virginia campaign trail Saturday. \"I mean, they've they've devoted enormous energy to trying to entrench themselves in power and punishing their enemies and enriching their friends and silencing their critics. They they put on a big show of deporting people and targeting transgender folks. They never missed a chance to scapegoat minorities and DEI for every problem under the sun.\" Obama, specifically, has a lengthy list of invoking identity politics while on the campaign trail or in public settings, while Democrats since his presidency have amplified their promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the highest echelons of government down to school classrooms until Trump signed executive orders barring such programs from government. \"I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,\" Obama said in 2016 of the Black community supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed presidential run. \"You want to give me a good send-off, go vote.\" Former President Joe Biden also focused on identity politics during his lengthy tenure in the nation's captial, including vowing he would nominate a Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court as he went through the merits of candidates. Biden ultimately nominated now-Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court in 2022. OBAMA ENDORSES SPANBERGER, ATTACKS REPUBLICANS IN VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE ADS \"While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity — and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court. It's long overdue, in my view,\" Biden said before announcing Jackson's nomination. Race, however, was left out of the 2025 gubernatorial race in Virginia as Earle-Sears faced off against Spanberger, with Cameron saying Democrats \"played it down\" as it did not benefit their party. \"The leadership in the Democratic Party certainly discounts race when it's not somebody from their campaign or not somebody on their side of the aisle that is in the election. And that is what you saw here, is that they discounted it and they played it down, it didn't have much significance,\" Cameron told Fox Digital in a Thursday Zoom interview. \"I do think the Democratic Party historically has focused on the identity of candidates. And that's why I tell folks that we don't need a country that's built on diversity, equity, inclusion. We need a county that's built on merit, excellence, intelligence and integrity. And that should be the case … not only in the corporate space or in industry, but in politics as well. Does a candidate connect with people? Does a candidate have the values of a particular community? That should be the focus,\" he said, adding that Republicans are all-in for supporting candidates with merit over identity. Fox News Digital reached out to Obama's office for comment regarding his previous remarks on race and identity politics compared to the 2025 election but did not immediately receive a reply. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Winsome-Sears campaign for any post-election comment Thursday. UNDERCOVER VIDEO EXPOSES WHAT SPANBERGER’S CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER REALLY THINKS OF HER: 'WHAT THE F---' Spanberger's campaign was rocked by an undercover video showing a campaign organizer lamenting the race pitted a \"White woman who was in the CIA\" against \"a Black woman.\" \"CIA agent, literally, which is crazy, like yeah, vote for the CIA agent, guys, like what the f---,\" a campaign organizer for Spanberger said in a video with an undercover journalist in September that was first reported by Fox News Digital. \"I don’t know what happened. We’re in, like, the darkest timeline,\" she continued. \"Our only choices are between a Black woman, which ordinarily all for, but this time you think we should bring back slavery, Winsome.… Even with that, it’s like either vote for the Black woman who thinks that slavery should be brought back or vote for the White woman who was in the CIA.\" Only two states across the country held gubernatorial elections this off-season election in 2025: New Jersey and Virginia. Earle-Sears was the only Black candidate to run for governor out of the four major-party candidates running in either state. Cameron said that his tenure as Kentucky attorney general, as well as his run for the Senate, focus on his merit and policies, while encouraging that example be used by all politicians going forward. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \" I want folks to focus on my values when I was the attorney general, certainly,\" he said. \"I won, I think, 113 of 120 counties, and people didn't care what I looked like. They cared about my values. And so I'm optimistic that when it comes to the future of this country, people, here in Kentucky, and I think in Virginia, and a lot of places is: Do you stand with the America first agenda? Are you focused on standing with president Trump? And that's certainly something that I'm focused on in my race here for the Senate here in Kentucky.\"","summary":"Former President Barack Obama campaigned for White candidate Abigail Spanberger in Virginia after previously criticizing Black men for not supporting Kamala Harris in 2024.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-once-urged-black-men-back-harris-he-democrats-reversed-race-rhetoric-legacy-2025","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/obama-spanberger-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 17:19:16","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":376843860,"title":"This Progressive Group Was Declared Dead Last Year. It Racked Up Wins on Tuesday.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nTuesday was a banner day for progressive prosecutors. Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner was elected to a third term, defeating Patrick Dugan. Krasner had already bested Dugan by 30 points in May’s Democratic primary. Dugan secured the Republican nomination as a write-in candidate, rendering the general election a rematch of the primary. But Krasner’s victory was even more resounding the second time around—he beat Dugan by nearly 50 points.\n\nKrasner was not the only progressive prosecutor to win reelection this week. Stephanie Morales, of Portsmouth, Virginia, also secured a third term, receiving more than twice as many votes as either of her two challengers. In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was elected to a second term. He won more than 70 percent of the vote, beating two challengers. In Brooklyn, Eric Gonzalez didn’t even have to campaign to be reelected. Gonzalez, who was first elected in 2017, faced no challengers in either the Democratic primary or the general election.\n\nThese results stand in stark contrast to a narrative that circulated last fall. In 2024, two high-profile progressive incumbents, Los Angeles’ George Gascon and Portland’s Mike Schmidt, lost to more-moderate challengers. News accounts of these elections proclaimed that the losses were a “significant setback” for the progressive prosecutor movement, evidence that the push is “under siege,” and even signaled its end. Similar accounts prevailed when San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin lost a recall election in 2022. The conventional wisdom appeared to be that postpandemic increases in crime had led to a backlash against criminal justice reform more generally, and progressive prosecutors in particular.\n\nHowever, even before Tuesday’s victories, there were reasons to doubt this pessimistic account of the progressive prosecutor movement. Eli Savit and Karen McDonald, two progressive prosecutors elected in Michigan in 2020, were both reelected in 2024 and are now both running for Michigan attorney general. Progressive prosecutors in Tucson, Arizona, and Austin, Texas, were also reelected in 2024. Perhaps most impressively, Monique Worrell, who was appointed Orlando’s chief prosecutor on a progressive platform in 2020, won that office again in 2024, despite being removed from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023 and having to run for her old office as a challenger rather than as an incumbent.\n\nIt’s worth asking why, despite these electoral successes, people keep predicting the end of the progressive prosecutor movement. It’s not because those prosecutors losing reelection are more widely known than those who are winning. A recent study by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at the University of California, Berkeley, found that Krasner and Bragg are more well known than Gascon, Schmidt, or Boudin. In fact, the study found, Krasner and Bragg are the most well-recognized progressive prosecutors in the country.\n\nIf the most widely known progressive prosecutors in the country are being reelected, then why is the national narrative about progressive prosecutors so pessimistic?\n\nOne explanation may be that the movement is not as successful as it was in the recent past. Prior research found that during 2014–19, progressive candidates fared far better than nonprogressive candidates when challenging incumbent prosecutors. Progressive challengers prevailed in their elections 55 percent of the time, as compared with 30 percent of nonprogressive challengers. Progressive candidates performed even better in open-seat elections—that is, races in which no incumbent is running for reelection. The typical open-seat candidate wins 36 percent of the time. But when progressive candidates ran for an open seat, they won 90 percent of their elections.\n\nAfter they take office, progressive prosecutors no longer enjoy such dramatic success at the polls. But that doesn’t mean that progressive incumbents have been unsuccessful. To the contrary, it appears that progressive prosecutors win reelection at a rate comparable to or even higher than other contested incumbents.\n\nAnother reason for the pessimistic narrative may be that those progressive incumbents who have lost elections have sometimes been replaced by prosecutors with dramatically different politics. The UNC/UCB study found that the prosecutors who replaced Gascon, Schmidt, and Boudin are perceived as significantly less progressive. In other words, those election losses resulted in large ideological swings, which could be interpreted as important setbacks for the movement.\n\nI suspect that the pessimistic narrative may also be attributable to the reinforcement it receives from those who oppose the progressive prosecutor movement. The center-right think tank R Street Institute, for example, published an op-ed titled “Last Gasp of ‘Progressive DA’ Movement?,” which used the negative poll numbers of George Gascon as an opportunity to criticize the movement as “focus[ing] too much on reducing jail populations and refuting public fear of crime, rather than ensuring community safety.” The organization appears to be pushing its own, more moderate and technocratic prosecutor model, the pragmatic prosecutor, who “doesn’t choose sides between punitive crackdowns or lenient approaches. Instead, they reimagine justice as a complex ecosystem that requires strategic, targeted interventions that draw from the strengths of both philosophies.”\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, the think tank responsible for Project 2025, has also been quick to use electoral losses to declare the progressive prosecutor movement over. Heritage has made no secret of its intense opposition to the movement. An entire page on its website is devoted to “rogue prosecutors,” a term it uses to refer to progressive prosecutors. Heritage published a commentary after Boudin’s recall election loss, titled “Recall of Chesa Boudin in San Francisco Shows Rogue Prosecutor Movement for Failure It Is,” that not only criticized the policies of progressive prosecutors but also declared that the “bloom is off the rogue prosecutor rose” and that voters had turned against the movement.\n\nIt is no surprise that those who oppose the policies of progressive prosecutors would also cheer their losses. But political opponents should not set the public narrative for one another. The success or failure of a movement should be measured according to reality, rather than the wishful thinking of partisans. The facts show that although the progressive prosecutor movement is less successful than it once was, claims that the movement is at an end are clearly overstated.\n\nThe movement is continuing to fare well in some American cities, including those hospitable to progressive politics more generally. It should not be surprising that two progressive prosecutors were reelected in New York City the same night that city residents also selected a democratic socialist as mayor. And just as the progressive movement sometimes loses other elections, progressive prosecutors should be expected to sometimes lose their elections too. For example, the night that Gascon lost his reelection bid, California voters also passed a ballot measure imposing harsher penalties for shoplifting and drug possession, and they voted for Kamala Harris at a much smaller margin than they did for Joe Biden in 2020. In other words, his loss was one of several indications that the state’s voters were less progressive than in prior years.\n\nIn short, the conventional wisdom about the progressive prosecutor movement is wrong for a relatively boring reason: The progressive prosecutor movement is a political trend. A single election doesn’t define a movement. And although a political trend may ebb and flow, there is reason to think that this movement will endure, at least for the immediate future.","summary":"It was a banner day for progressive prosecutors.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/democrats-prosecutors-2025-election-nyc-alvin-bragg.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/bb7eb81b-fb18-4877-89fa-9e016be25e3f.jpeg?crop=2203%2C1468%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 17:10:37","author":"Carissa Byrne Hessick","authors":["Carissa Byrne Hessick"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.178},{"id":376813098,"title":"BORIS JOHNSON: Until BBC boss Tim Davie either comes clean on how Panorama doctored Trump's speech - or resigns - I won't be paying my licence fee","text":"So where is Tim Davie? What has happened to the Director-General of the BBC? It rather looks as though he has decided to go to ground.\n\nIt is now four days since we learned of a jaw-dropping report into the Corporation's Left-wing bias, and yet no one has come forward to explain. No one has apologised.\n\nNo one has even come close to resigning. It won't do. On behalf of millions of loyal BBC licence payers (£174.50 per year, just for the right to own a TV), my message to Mr Davie is: Come on, Buster; We pay your wages.\n\nCome out from your bunker in Portland Square. Come out from your tint-windowed limo. This thing is an absolute scandal, and it is not going away.\n\nIn case you missed the story, which has of course been studiously ignored by the national broadcaster, Mr Davie has long been in possession of a report by one of the BBC's own former independent advisers on editorial standards, called Michael Prescott. I remember Mr Prescott from his days as a reporter on the Sunday Times. He always seemed to be a straight shooter, and in any case the facts of his report speak for themselves.\n\nAmong his more eye-popping discoveries was a Panorama programme broadcast in the run-up to the US election last year, in which the BBC flagrantly doctored a speech by the then Republican candidate, Donald Trump. The BBC was so desperate to make it look as though Trump incited a riot, that they electronically fabricated the evidence.\n\nIf you watched the programme last year, you would have seen a clip of Trump addressing the crowd on January 6 2020, and apparently winding them up in the most inflammatory terms: 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and I am going to be with you, and we fight, we fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you are not going to have a country anymore.'\n\nIf you were watching, you would have assumed – since this was the BBC's flagship news programme – you were getting the ipsissima verba of the President, with nothing added or taken away.\n\nI expect a lot of people did watch it and were confirmed in their view of those infamous events, namely that Trump did try to stage a sort of coup.\n\nA reasonable person watching that Panorama would have been given pretty good evidence that Trump genuinely did set out to provoke those QAnon loonies with buffalo horns to storm the Capitol building. Panorama showed the President of the US urging his followers to march on Congress and 'fight like hell', and you would have assumed that he was indeed directly responsible for the violence in which several people died.\n\nThis matters because the BBC broadcast the programme just as that closely fought election of 2024 was coming to its climax and when lefties around the world still hoped and believed that Kamala Harris was going to win.\n\nIt matters because that doctored clip was – one assumes – widely shared and was perhaps influential with at least some voters in the US.\n\nIt matters above all because back in 2020, Donald Trump had said no such thing. What he actually said was: 'We are going to walk down to the Capitol, and I'll be with you. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.'\n\nThat was what he really said, but of course the Panorama team didn't like it at all – particularly not the bit about 'peacefully and patriotically' – because it did not fit their narrative about Trump.\n\nSo, they scratched their heads, and watched the speech again and again, and finally they decided to go to the very end – 54 minutes later – and they took the stuff about fighting the outcome of the election, and they spliced it together with the stuff about marching to the Capitol, so as to create the impression they wanted.\n\nWhat Panorama viewers saw was not what Trump said, but a Frankenquote, a fiction, entirely invented by the BBC to suit their political agenda. They had to make it up because the truth is that Trump did contest the result of the election – wrongly, in my view – but he did not actually incite the riots.\n\nThe proof is that the Democrats brought dozens of mainly spurious lawfare cases against Trump, after he left office, in the hope of preventing him from standing again. But he was never charged with incitement. The evidence just wasn't there.\n\nSo the BBC made it up, shamelessly putting words of a highly damaging kind into the mouth of a man who is once again this country's most important ally.\n\nTim Davie needs to explain that whole Panorama programme – why they chose to run a hatchet job on Trump, on the eve of the election, with ten interviewees attacking him and only one defending him, when Kamala Harris got the kid glove treatment.\n\nWhile he is at it, he needs to address all the findings in Michael Prescott's report.\n\nWhy is there systemic bias in the BBC's coverage of Israel and Gaza, with the BBC Arabic service seeming to serve as a sort of mouthpiece for Hamas?\n\nWhy does the BBC routinely suppress proper discussion of the trans debate?\n\nPrescott cites the po-faced and sometimes hilarious acceptance of trans ideology, like the heart-warming all-outlets news story of a wrestler whose morale was boosted mid-career by sudden and dramatic success in the ring – without pointing out, of course, that the wrestler in question was born a chap but was now wrestling against women!\n\nDon't the public need to know that essential fact, in a Reithian kind of way?\n\nInstead, the Beeb is guilty of suppressing the truth, and fabricating falsehoods, and the Prescott report proves it.\n\nNo one has been held to account for Panorama's lies. All inquiries are treated with a bored contempt – as if it were somehow impertinent to ask. The organisation has clearly broken trust with the public, on key issues of public concern, and no one at the BBC has suffered so much as the tiniest reproach.\n\nContrast the ridiculous punishment of the newsreader Martine Croxall, who has been officially rebuked – because when her autocue asked her to use the ridiculous phrase 'pregnant people' she rolled her eyes and corrected it to 'women'.\n\nThe BBC has chastised Ms Croxall for telling the plain unvarnished truth about human biology, while Panorama is currently getting away with ludicrous Left-wing falsehoods.\n\nIt is time for reporters to stand outside Davie's house, in the time-honoured way, and shout at him: What is your response to the Prescott report?\n\nWhen did you first know that Panorama lied? Why did you do nothing about it?\n\nA few days of that and Davie should eventually emerge from his foxhole, and when he does, he should either give a convincing explanation for the Left-wing bias at the BBC, or else resign in favour of someone who will stop the rot.\n\nUnless he does so I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.","summary":"So where is Tim Davie?

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nNew York is viewed as a reliably Democratic state, with New York City, as well as other areas such as Albany, Buffalo and Rochester, having kept it blue in most recent federal races. On Tuesday, voters elected Hochul-endorsed Democrat Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s mayor.\n\nHowever, Republicans have made some inroads with some Empire State voters recently. Former Vice President Kamala Harris received less than 56 percent of the vote in New York last year, the weakest performance for a Democrat in decades.\n\nA Republican has not won the state’s top spot since Governor George Pataki was re-elected in 2002.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nStefanik’s Friday announcement confirms previous speculation that she was going to enter the race, with some polls dating back to June revealing data on a potential match up. In her announcement, she said that the state has become the “most unaffordable state in the nation with the highest taxes, highest energy, utilities, rent, and grocery bills,” under Hochul’s leadership.\n\n“I am running for Governor to make New York affordable and safe FOR ALL,” Stefanik wrote on X.\n\nHochul, who won her election in 2022 by a smaller-than-expected margin, is running to keep her seat next November. She had taken up office the year prior following the resignation of then-Governor Andrew Cuomo. She is facing a primary challenge from Lieutenant Governor Anthony Delgado, though early polling suggests she has an advantage among Democratic voters.\n\nHochul campaign communications director Sarafina Chitika told Newsweek in an email Friday, “Sellout Stefanik is Donald Trump’s number one cheerleader in Congress and his right-hand woman in his war on New York: gutting health care, jacking up costs with expensive tariffs, and cutting funding for our police, schools, and hospitals.” \n\nStefanik is known as a strong President Donald Trump ally, and according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, as of September, Stefanik voted with Trump 100 percent of the time.\n\n New York Governor Kathy Hochul is seen on October 26, 2025 at a Zohran Mamdani Election Rally. (Maureen AdarveSTAR MAX/IPx 2025)\n\nEarlier this year Stefanik was named to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, however her nomination was pulled over concerns about the House’s slim Republican majority.\n\nChitika continued: “Apparently, screwing over New Yorkers in Congress wasn’t enough; now she’s trying to bring Trump’s chaos and skyrocketing costs to our state. While Stefanik puts Trump first and New York last, Governor Hochul is lowering costs, cutting middle-class taxes, and fighting for the New Yorkers Stefanik abandoned.”\n\nThe most recent poll released in October by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, found Stefanik leading Hochul by one point, 43 percent to 42 percent, and Delgado by six points, 43 percent to 37 percent.\n\nThe poll surveyed 600 New York City voters and 300 New York State voters, weighted to account for population, from October 22 to October 26, 2025. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nThe poll appears to be an anomaly from previous ones that show Hochul with a much greater lead over Stefanik. A Siena College poll of 802 likely voters from September 8 to September 10, 2025, showed Hochul up by 25 points, 52 percent to 27 percent, with 17 percent undecided. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.\n\nAn internal poll paid for by Stefanik’s leadership fundraising committee conducted by GrayHouse, found Hochul leading Stefanik by five points on an initial ballot, 48 percent to 43 percent, but Stefanik led on an informed ballot 46.4 percent to 45.9 percent. It surveyed 1,2550 New York likely voters from September 20 to September 26, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.\n\nPolymarket, an online prediction market where users can place “yes” or “no” bets on the likelihood of world events, currently estimates the likelihood of a Democrat winning the state’s top office to be 85 percent, with a Republican candidate at 14 percent. It does not specific which candidates, just their party affiliation.

He knew my audience was filled with diehard sports fans who would also, likely, be open to hearing from him,” Travis wrote in his newly released book Balls: How Trump, Young Men, and Sports Saved America.\n\nSince then, he’s interviewed Trump 10 more times, attended events with the president, and now, in his book about woke sports and who he calls the “sports fan-in-chief,” he revealed what he believes is the president’s secret to political success and legacy building.\n\nReflecting on Trump’s 2024 comeback against Vice President Kamala Harris, Travis wrote about Trump’s worry-free style and aggressiveness, seen most publicly when, after being shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, he rose with a fist to yell “fight, fight, fight.”\n\nSaid Travis in his book published by Hachette Book Group, “Trump didn’t just win the election; he moved all 50 states redder, from New York to California, Florida to Washington, and all points in between. How did he do it? When it got right down to it, Trump had balls. And the Democrats didn’t.”\n\nTravis, who anchors OutKick, now owned by Fox, and co-hosts the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, said the assassination attempt and Trump’s genuine ties to sports were all that many men needed to see, and why he did so well among men in the election.\n\n“If it had happened in a movie, none of us would have believed it was real,” he told Washington Secrets of the shooting.\n\n“The election was effectively over then, and I think that reaction will become more legendary as the passions of the present political world fade.

Gavin Newsom and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n“Everybody will be lining up, and we’ll see just how many people are going to contest the Republican nomination, and to what extent the Trump popularity is going to carry JD, who obviously will be running, and Marco,” said Travis.\n\nBeyond 2028, though, he believes Trump’s legacy will have legs far into the future, as has former President Ronald Reagan, whose two terms influenced a generation of high school and college students to become conservatives.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nTrump may have even more going for him, said Travis, citing the president’s overwhelming influence in politics since 2015 and additionally his ties to sports and players.\n\n“There was an article out recently that I was reading that said most kids become huge sports fans between the age of eight and 12, and that era of their life imprints on them far more significantly than later in life. In other words, if you haven’t become a big sports fan between eight and 12, you might in the future, become a big sports fan, but that’s the age when really it happens for most people, and that’s when the allegiances are cast. And, you know, think about the number of kids out there in the same way I was thinking about it in the context of the Trump presidency, and certainly my boys overlap that in some way as well. But that’s what I’ve seen with their own fandom, is that that’s a function of kind of how all that is going,” he told Secrets.","summary":"There are two things that OutKick founder Clay Travis knows better than most: Sports and President Donald Trump.

The idea, beloved by white supremacists, alleges that Latino migration to the United States is meant to replace white people.\n\nWhile Hochul does not have the highest approval ratings, recent polling has not been in Stefanik’s favor. A September survey from Siena College of the possible matchup showed Hochul with a commanding 52% to 27% lead over the Trump acolyte.\n\nThe last time New York elected a Republican governor was over 30 years ago, when George Pataki defeated incumbent Mario Cuomo in 1994. The four governors who followed Pataki have all been Democrats.\n\nNew York is not fond of Trumpism. In the 2024 election, former Vice President Kamala Harris defeated Trump there by a 56% to 43% margin.\n\nStefanik may need a win after losing out on her U.N. job, but Albany may not be the way.","summary":"Republican Rep.

The next day, the San Francisco Chronicle blared: “S.F. threatens to sue if Trump brings in National Guard.” Then, on Oct. 23, “Trump reverses his decision to send troops to San Francisco,” as ABC News put it, after Trump posted that conversations with the city’s mayor and tech moguls had swayed him.\n\nIt was another example of how Trump’s shifting policy positions, racially inflammatory statements and threats frequently fuel a flurry of headlines, reflecting what some psychologists are calling “media saturation overload” or “Trump stress disorder.” \n\nThis barrage of information may seem like overcommunication from a hyperactive administration. But it is much more than that.\n\nScholars have found that the constant, often conflicting and at times false information coming out of the White House and shared via social media posts and the conventional news media causes members of the public to see truth and fact as relative and makes them more likely to dismiss those who disagree with them as untruthful. This leaves doubt about what’s real and what isn’t. \n\nThis citizen paralysis creates what philosopher Hannah Arendt described in “The Origins of Totalitarianism” as a general public “for whom the distinction between fact and fiction … no longer exist.” When lies are truth and truth is derided as lies, Arendt wrote, ordinary people lose their bearings and can be manipulated for totalitarian objectives. \n\nMeanwhile, many journalists have openly acknowledged fatigue with the pace and nature of the Trump administrations’ news cycles, amid frequent newsroom layoffs, mergers and closures. \n\nI am a longtime journalist and now scholar of journalism and race, trained to see the methods and aims behind political leaders’ press operations. And as I show in my forthcoming book, the Trump administration’s rhetorical strategies echo the playbooks of authoritarian and white supremacist organizations such as the Third Reich and some factions of the modern alt-right movement. They are intended to narrow the scope of who belongs as an American.\n\nHeadlines at ‘muzzle velocity’\n\nThe Trump administration’s rhetorical strategies include claiming victim status while often laying blame on immigrants or other scapegoats in ways that I believe betray racist intent. At the same time it has overwhelmed journalists and the public with breaking news. \n\nThis strategy was laid out by Steve Bannon, an influential Trump supporter and strategist in his first administration, during a 2019 PBS “Frontline” interview, when he described the media as “the opposition party.”\n\n“They’re dumb and they’re lazy, they can only focus on one thing at a time,” he said. “All we have to do is flood the zone. … Bang, bang, bang. These guys will never – will never be able to recover. But we’ve got to start with muzzle velocity.”\n\nBannon has long been associated with the alt-right, a movement known for rhetorical tactics that minimize and obfuscate its true aims.\n\nA strategy forged in Trump’s first term\n\nAs I detail in my book, “American Otherness in Journalism: News Media Representations of Identity and Belonging,” Trump and his key advisers have been developing, refining and ramping up their news media manipulation for a long time. \n\nAn early example of this is the way the administration used these tactics through Trump’s public responses to the fatal violence at the August 2017 Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. \n\nThe two-day rally was organized by a white nationalist blogger and attended by members of neo-Nazi, white supremacist and far-right militias protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville park. They marched with tiki torches, flew Confederate and Nazi flags and chanted antisemitic and racist slogans. \n\nAmid violent clashes with counterprotesters on the second day, a neo-Nazi sympathizer drove into a crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring many others.\n\nMy study of television news coverage of Unite the Right found that the majority of news reports focused on the contradictory and inflammatory statements that Trump made about the antisemitic and racist protesters. Trump’s Aug. 15, 2017, press conference remark about blame on both sides after what happened garnered the most news media attention: “I think there is blame on both sides,” he said. “You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides.”\n\nExploiting chaos\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding what he meant created a cycle of news stories implying and denying that he sympathizes with white supremacists.\n\nThis is-he-or-isn’t-he intrigue spurred a surge of what fits the description of Bannon’s “muzzle-velocity” news headlines: “Trump declares ‘racism is evil’ amid pressure over Charlottesville” followed closely by “Trump defends White-nationalist protesters” and “Why Trump can’t get his story straight on Charlottesville.” \n\nWith the focus on Trump’s comments and what he might have really meant, the news media ultimately missed covering at the time the long-term threat posed by these white supremacist and other extremist groups.\n\nEchoing a playbook from the past\n\nScholars have identified the fascist roots of these “post-truth” strategies: strongmen leaders uninterested in establishing leadership through honesty and transparency. \n\nA recent scholarly analysis of Trump’s leadership concludes that the second-term president is overwhelming the public into “organized despair” by pitting races against each other while targeting minority groups as scapegoats, a tactic that hearkens back to 1930s Germany. \n\nA 2019 analysis of Trump’s narrative style describes how he presents himself as a “strongman” fighting invisible forces of censorship and suppression. It also points out that this was part of the appeal of fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler. \n\nResearchers of Nazi propaganda identified key tactics in the German press such as name-calling and lumping together groups seen as opposition – communists, liberals and Jews – until public understanding of those groups blur into phrases like “enemies of Germany.” The messaging was constant and immersive, carried in local and national newspapers, radio, film and posters.\n\nA key part of Trump’s rhetorical strategy is using race without directly referring to it. For example, Trump has described cities with large nonwhite populations such as Washington, D.C., and Chicago as “out of control” or “dirty,” contrary to actual crime statistics. He’s also questioned Kamala Harris’ racial identity, suggesting she “happened to turn Black.” And referring to Black football players who had been protesting systemic racism by kneeling during the national anthem, Trump said, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” which many observers interpreted as racist because he was insulting people of color for the act of protesting racism. \n\nThis racial coding has been used by white supremacist groups to mask their true intent. They also use less overt labels such as “alt-right” or “pro-white” as a “rhetorical bridge” to the mainstream public.\n\nIn the case of the NFL protesters, the plausible deniability became an actual denial. Trump perfected this move when, during a 2020 debate with Joe Biden, he said, “Proud Boys – stand back and stand by,” referencing another group accused of thinly veiled racism. \n\nDrowning in headlines\n\nI believe that the endgame for this strategy is authoritarian power that greatly narrows the scope of who truly belongs and has rights in this country as an American.\n\nThis media saturation – drowning the public with a thousand Trump-generated headlines – allows his administration to keep dominating and controlling national attention.\n\nBut the media-consuming public can use the tools they have to encourage news outlets to better inform the public by identifying the media saturation strategy and reporting on why leaders are using it.\n\nOtherwise, if news consumers let the headline overload do what it’s intended to do, and become overwhelmed and paralyzed, they become pawns in what I consider a ploy to make America less egalitarian and less democratic.","summary":"The unrelenting diet of chaotic, contradictory headlines that Americans face today echoes an antidemocratic playbook from the past.","url":"https://theconversation.com/overwhelm-the-public-with-muzzle-velocity-headlines-a-strategy-rooted-in-racism-and-authoritarianism-267491","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696963/original/file-20251017-56-dr8aok.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C313%2C3008%2C1504&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 13:17:42","author":"Angie Chuang,Associate Professor of Journalism,University of Colorado Boulder","authors":["Angie Chuang","Associate Professor of Journalism","University of Colorado Boulder"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.187},{"id":376763960,"title":"Zachary Levi says he’s 'graylisted' by Hollywood, vows to keep speaking his truth despite blowback","text":"Zachary Levi isn’t backing down. The \"Shazam!\" star said he plans to continue fighting for his beliefs — even if it means paying a professional price in Hollywood. With his new film \"Sarah’s Oil\" hitting theaters Friday, Levi reflected on how his political views have impacted his career, clarifying that while he hasn’t been completely cut off from work, he believes he’s been \"graylisted\" in Hollywood. ZACHARY LEVI CLAIMS SUPPORTING TRUMP MADE HIM A HOLLYWOOD OUTSIDER \"I might go so far as to say I was graylisted, I guess,\" Levi told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"I’m still getting jobs, and I’m still grateful — very grateful — to be working.

I am pro-health. I am pro-human. I'm a libertarian, I'm not even a conservative. I think that all of us ought to have the right to live the life that we choose to live for ourselves, but also recognizing that, that our individual liberty ends here. And once it starts affecting somebody else's individual liberty, well, then we have a problem. And unfortunately, a lot of the, I think political policies on the left side of the political spectrum don't take that into account.

Speak what you believe to be true and speak it in love,\" he noted. Levi’s latest project, \"Sarah’s Oil\" — produced by Amazon Studios and Kingdom Story Company — tells the astonishing true-life saga of Sarah Rector, a young Black girl born in early-1900s Oklahoma Indian Territory who defied poverty and prejudice to become one of America’s first Black female millionaires — at just 11 years old. The project has been years in the making, and Levi said it’s been worth it every step along the way. \"When I read the script, I was blown away,\" the actor told Fox News Digital. \"It was an absolutely true story about this young Black girl in the turn of the century, Tulsa, Oklahoma … who was intelligent and precocious and spirit-filled.\" ‘SHAZAM!’ STAR ZACHARY LEVI COMPARES AI TO BIBLICAL DISASTER He continued sharing the story about Rector, \"She prayed over [the land] and she believed God told her it was full of oil. And she was right.\" That prayer sparked the discovery of what turned out to be one of the largest and purest oil reserves in North America, propelling young Sarah to instant fame and fortune — and eventually fierce legal battles to protect what was hers. \"I thought, how have I never heard this story before?\" Levi said, before adding: \"Why is it that no one I know has ever heard this story before?\" JOHN RICH SAYS HOLLYWOOD’S PRAISE OF TRUMP PROVES ‘WOKE MONSTER’ IS FADING AS WOODY ALLEN APPLAUDS PRESIDENT Despite its powerful message of diversity, resilience and faith, getting \"Sarah’s Oil\" to the big screen wasn’t easy. \"I thought it would be a slam dunk,\" the actor admitted. \"Hollywood says these are exactly the stories that we want to make.

Considered one of the most powerful women in U.S. political history, she steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus after arriving on Capitol Hill and was elected House minority whip in 2001 and became House minority leader a year later. She stepped down as party leader in 2022.In California, the state holds a so-called “jungle” primary in which everyone is on the ballot. The top two candidates with the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, will advance to the general election. Given Pelosi won reelection in 2024 by 81%, it is likely the top two candidates will be Democrats, offering a rare party vs. party competition.\n\nTwo Democrats had already launched bids for her seat prior to Pelosi’s retirement: California state Sen. Scott Wiener and Saikat Chakrabarti, former aide to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). \n\nOthers, such as Pelosi’s own daughter and San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, are speculated to launch bids, as well. \n\nThe race could also be historic for the district. If Wiener wins, he’d be the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress. If Chakrabarti or Chan wins, either would be the first person of Asian descent to represent the district.\n\nScott Wiener\n\nWiener, 55, has represented San Francisco in the state Senate since 2017, making him likely the most well-known candidate in the district. \n\nIn March, he had said he would wait to run until after Pelosi retired, and it would “be an honor” to succeed her. But he decided he couldn’t wait any longer, officially launching his bid on Oct. 22, fueling speculation that he knew something most people didn’t: Pelosi would not seek another term.\n\nHe’d likely be backed by YIMBYs, a housing movement as well as pro-climate activists, given that he is known for his work on housing in the legislature. But he’s considered a centrist Democrat and has attracted political enemies from both the Right and Progressives, the former due to his pro-LBGT policies and the latter due to his support of centrist leaders such as District Attorney Brooke Jenkins. \n\nIn a statement on Pelosi’s retirement, Wiener spoke highly of the longtime congresswoman and said she was the “greatest Speaker in United States history.” He noted her work on AIDS during the height of the healthcare crisis.\n\n“When so many others wanted to push LGBTQ people under the rug, Nancy Pelosi fought proudly for us to be treated with dignity,” Wiener said. “In her first remarks on the House floor in 1987, she announced that she had come to Congress to fight AIDS.”\n\nHe spoke of his personal experiences, saying in 1987, “a closeted gay teen with a name like a hotdog finally admitted to himself he was gay.”\n\n“It was a terrifying time to come of age as a gay man, and Nancy Pelosi stepped up and used her voice and platform to fight for people like me,” he continued. “I will be eternally grateful to her.” \n\nHe received a prominent endorsement from California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Thursday, who served with Wiener in the state legislature. Bonta told Politico that Wiener takes on “big, tough issues” and would be “an incredible congressperson.”\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti\n\nChakrabarti, 39, is a political activist who made much of his money as a founding engineer of Stripe, a payment processing company. He served as a top campaign aide to progressive “Squad” trailblazer Ocasio-Cortez when she upset then-Rep. Joe Crowley in the primary. He served as her chief of staff and worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-VT) 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nUnlike Wiener, Chakrabarti said last year he would challenge Pelosi and launched his bid in February via a lengthy X post. His campaign launch came after the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency firings and dismantling of several federal agencies shook Washington and the country. \n\nHe said that time made it clear that the Democratic Party needs new leadership and the current leaders are “so paralyzed and unprepared for this moment.” He also said that he disapproved of Pelosi’s decision to whip against Ocasio-Cortez’s bid for the House Oversight Committee ranking member position.\n\n“I respect what Nancy Pelosi has accomplished in her career, but we are living in a totally different America than the one she knew when she entered politics 45 years ago,” Chakrabarti said in February. “In an interview with Ezra Klein after Trump’s victory, Pelosi said the Democrats don’t need to change. I disagree.”\n\nIn a post on Thursday, Chakrabarti thanked Pelosi for her decades of service that defined a “generation of politics.” \n\n“And for doing something truly rare in Washington: making room for the next one,” Chakrabarti said.\n\nPelosi’s retirement has sparked speculation about whether more senior lawmakers will follow suit. A handful of lawmakers, including Reps. Jan Schawkowsky (D-IL) and Danny Davis (D-IL) have already opted to retire. \n\nAs of the June 30 reporting period, Chakrabarti has $244,051 in cash on hand, according to campaign disclosures. His wealth will help him keep pace with other competitors, but given that he has never held public office, he may face an issue with name recognition, although he has spent the last 10 months engaging with voters.\n\nConnie Chan\n\nChan, a progressive Democrat, has served on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors representing the city’s Richmond District since 2021. She is closely associated with the city’s powerful labor unions, which would give her a significant boost if she opted to run to succeed Pelosi.\n\nUnlike Wiener and Chakrabarti, Chan has made no public statement about her intentions for 2026 and declined to comment about her political future at Pelosi’s watch party for the Proposition 50 vote held Tuesday, which passed with 63.9% of the vote, per the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Chan said Pelosi will always be the “lioness” of San Francisco.\n\n“As a proud San Franciscan and member of the Chinese American community, I know we can always depend on her to have our back, and we will always have her back,” Chan said. \n\nChan was born in Hong Kong and moved to San Francisco at the age of 13, growing up in Chinatown. She worked for Kamala Harris when she served as district attorney. \n\nPaired with labor union support, she could benefit in the race from her previous campaign victories, winning her first supervisor race in 2020 by just 125 votes, and if she can capture the votes of Asian Americans, who make up over 30% of the city’s population.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Chan for comment.\n\nChristine Pelosi \n\nThe speaker emerita’s daughter would certainly capture people’s attention if she entered the race, due to the considerable name recognition she would bring to the contest. Although having never held public office, Christine Pelosi has been a member of the Democratic National Committee since 1996 and has served as an executive committee member of the DNC since 2017. \n\nShe is also the co-founder of We Said Enough, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing workplace sexual harassment.\n\nWhen members of Congress retire, people often look to their children or the children of politicians residing in the district as possible successors. In Arizona, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, formerly a county supervisor, entered and won the special election to succeed her late father, Raul Grijalva, this year. \n\nWhen Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) announced his retirement, Democrats considered Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as a possible candidate to run for his seat. The younger Clinton, however, is not running for Nadler’s district, her team told the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Christine Pelosi for comment. She told the San Francisco Chronicle that she was “100% focused on passing Prop 50” when asked about her future in politics. \n\nAlthough Christine Pelosi’s lack of a public office appointment may be a detriment to her campaign when compared to Wiener and Chan, it also keeps her free from being tied to any legislative decisions that could serve as prime targets for ad campaigns. \n\nShe could also follow in the footsteps of her mother, who won her 1987 special election, having served as a party leader but never in elected office. \n\nCalifornians are also eyeing Jane Kim, who serves as the director of the Working Families Party. Like Chakrabarti, she served on a previous Sanders campaign, but in 2020 as his political director.\n\nIn 2022, she told the New York Times that she had not ruled out a bid for Speaker Emerita Pelosi’s seat.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Kim for comment.","summary":"Speaker Emerita&#160;Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) retirement will open up her San Francisco-based&#160;House&#160;seat for the first time in decades, with eyes already turning to state&#160;Democrats&#160;to see who will jump into the jungle primary to replace the political powerhouse.

Recently, Trump was seen slumping during an announcement by Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, who talked about the connections between obesity and dementia.\n\nAs reported by the Irish Star, Dr. Oz, “participated in the announcement of a Trump administration deal with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that will ‘expand coverage and reduce prices’ for popular obesity drugs Zepbound and Wegovy.”\n\nDr. Oz took the stage during the announcement and talked about the effects of obesity as he said, “knees don’t hurt, people don’t have heart attacks, renal failure, dementia. All the things we know are associated with obesity and much more.”\n\nHowever, his words drew attention online for an entirely different reason. While Dr. Oz was talking about dementia and obesity, Trump could be seen slumping over his desk. The irony of the situation led to netizens commenting critically about the President’s health. \n\nDr. Oz linking obesity to dementia while Trump’s slumped over at his desk is absolutely a choice… pic.twitter.com/S2HMRrLX7D\n— Mike Nellis (@MikeNellis) November 6, 2025\n\nTaking to X, Mike Nellis, a senior organizer for Kamala Harris’s campaign, posted, “Dr. Oz linking obesity to dementia while Trump’s slumped over at his desk is absolutely a choice.” Users also came forward with pictures of Trump falling asleep at various events, as one user said, “Self awareness level -348.”\n\nOne user pointed out, “This is a perfect metaphor for the government.” Another one had a direct question for Dr. Oz, “Hey Dr. Oz, Have you checked out your Big Mac boss recently?” \n\nConcerns about Trump’s health have recently surged after the news broke that he underwent an MRI during his second official checkup in six months became public. However, apart from Trump saying that everything turned out to be fine in the MRI results, there has not been much information on the same. When Karoline Leavitt was pushed for more details on this MRI and why such a specific procedure was done on Trump, she dodged the question diplomatically and did not provide a clear answer. \n\nMoreover, Trump’s recent behavior at CBS News’ 60 Minutes also led to concerns. When he was asked about Venezuela and if the US was going to war with them, the President said, “I doubt it, I don’t think so. They’ve been treating us very badly, not only on drugs.

The general American population is increasingly becoming concerned about the fact that there might be something actually wrong with Trump that is not being made public.","summary":"Dr. Oz links obesity and dementia as Trump slumps in front of him.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/dr-oz-links-dementia-and-obesity-as-trump-slumps-just-feet-away-netizens-call-out-the-awkward-irony","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trump-and-oz.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 12:59:20","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":376772742,"title":"Melania Trump Named ‘Patriot of the Year’: What The Award Means and Why She Received It","text":"US First Lady Melania Trump was awarded Fox Nation’s “Patriot of the Year” title on Thursday, a year after her husband, President Donald Trump, received the same honor following his 2024 victory over former US Vice President Kamala Harris.

The campaign to re-elect Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., is deploying mobile billboard trucks with bold, neon graphics portraying his rival, Independent candidate Dan Osborn, as a \"fake Independent\" and part of the Democratic Party's far-left future, along with New York City’s socialist mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and controversial Maine candidate Graham Platner. \"Nebraska Democrats’ brand is too toxic to run a candidate under the party label,\" Ricketts campaign Communications Director Will Coup told Fox News Digital. \"Even though Fake Dan Osborn doesn’t have a D next to his name, he still supports the party’s most far-left beliefs.\" WILL ELECTION DAY 2025 BE REMEMBERED AS THE RISE OF THE SOCIALISTS? Biden is delivering remarks at the Nebraska Democratic Party's 2025 Ben Nelson Gala in downtown Omaha. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn were also invited as featured speakers. REPUBLICANS PUSH TO MAKE MAMDANI THE NEW FACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY Omaha is considered a \"blue dot\" in Republican-leaning Nebraska. Nebraska is one of only two states that splits its electoral votes by congressional district, and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, typically votes for the Democratic presidential nominee. While the district voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Republican Rep. Don Bacon nevertheless won re-election for his U.S. House seat in that same district. Bacon is not seeking re-election in 2026. While Osborn is running as an Independent, Chair Jane Kleeb has affirmed the Nebraska Democratic Party is \"supporting\" his bid to unseat Ricketts, the two-term senator and former Nebraska governor. \"Nebraska Democrats proudly support Dan Osborn,\" will be the message on one of the three mobile billboards. The Ricketts campaign has called Osborn a \"fake\" Independent — another message that will be on display around downtown Omaha Friday. \"Osborn’s campaign is even staffed by the same people who ran Socialist Zohran Mamdani’s campaign in New York. A communist, a socialist, and a Fake Independent: that’s the best the Democratic Party has to offer,\" Coup told Fox News Digital. Mamdani and Osborn share 28-year-old media strategist, Morris Katz, as reported by Vanity Fair. Katz is also the media strategist for Graham Platner, the controversial candidate running for the U.S. Senate in Maine next year. Between 2020 and 2021, Platner posted and has since deleted Reddit posts calling himself a \"communist,\" which he recently said he was \"joking\" about. Platner has faced calls to drop out of his Senate race, and a top campaign staffer resigned after he faced backlash for photos revealing that he had a tattoo resembling the Totenkopf used by Hitler's SS paramilitary forces. NATIONAL DEMS BANKROLL CAMPAIGN OF 'FAKE INDEPENDENT' SENATE CANDIDATE FROM MIDWESTERN STATE An image of Platner with \"communist\" plastered across his face will be featured on one of the mobile billboards, alongside the message \"fake 'Independent'\" on Osborn and \"socialist\" on Mamdani, above a slogan describing the \"future of the Democratic Party.\" Osborn, a union leader who ran as an Independent against Sen.

Will it push wealthy out of New York City?","text":"APWhat is Zohran Mamdani’s new Millionaire Tax? Will it push wealthy out of New York City? \n\nNew York City’s newly elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, has reignited a long-standing debate on wealth and taxation with his proposal to impose a 2% income tax increase on New Yorkers earning over $1 million annually. The plan dubbed the “millionaire tax” is part of a broader progressive agenda aimed at reducing inequality and funding key social initiatives, including free city bus services and a rent freeze across the five boroughs.Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, announced the proposal during his victory speech on November 4, promising to “end the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like President Donald Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax breaks.”The policy mirrors former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign pledge to raise taxes on the wealthy while maintaining most of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Both proposals reflect an ideological shift toward redistributive taxation—but the question remains: Would a millionaire tax drive the rich out of New York City?Concerns of Wealthy Exodus Loom LargeOpponents of the tax proposal, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul, have warned that Mamdani’s plan could trigger an exodus of high-income residents. “I don’t want to lose any more people to Palm Beach,” Hochul told a local television outlet, referencing the migration of affluent New Yorkers to low-tax states like Florida, as per a report by USA Today. Echoing this sentiment, financial analyst Marty Fridson, in a Reuters commentary, described a “possibility, if not the probability,” of high earners leaving New York City to avoid additional taxation. Prominent business figures, including supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, have also voiced concern. Catsimatidis told The Free Press that if the proposal becomes law, his company might consider shutting operations in the city.Live EventsAccording to Mamdani’s team, the proposed 2% surcharge on millionaires could generate $4 billion annually in new revenue for New York City. However, the figure assumes a stable tax base something critics argue could erode if wealthy residents relocate to nearby states such as New Jersey or Connecticut, or even across the Hudson River to Hoboken.Is the Fear of Wealth Flight Exaggerated?Despite warnings, recent studies suggest that fears of mass millionaire migration may be overstated. Research from the Fiscal Policy Institute found “no significant tax-motivated migration” from New York even after previous tax increases.Kamolika Das, local policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, argues that tax rates play a relatively minor role in relocation decisions. “Tax policies just really don’t drive relocation decisions,” Das told USA Today. “There’s very scant evidence to support that claim.”Supporting this view, Lindsay Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative pointed to New Jersey’s 2004 tax increase on high earners. “Only 37 millionaires left,” she said, “but the millionaire population grew by over 3,000 that same year.”The trend, experts say, indicates that wealthy individuals often move between high-tax regions, rather than escaping taxation entirely. For many, quality of life, family ties, and business opportunities weigh more heavily than marginal tax differences.California’s Example Offers a Cautionary TaleStill, not all evidence supports the optimistic outlook. Data from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy found that California lost $5.3 billion in personal income tax revenue over five years following a 2016 measure extending higher taxes on wealthy residents.Jared Walczak of the Tax Foundation acknowledged that while New York’s proposed millionaire tax “will raise revenue,” it could also “drive some people out,” particularly given the city’s already high cost of living.Walczak noted that Mamdani’s proposed rate would raise New York City’s top local tax rate from 3.9% to 5.9%, meaning high earners in Manhattan could end up paying more in city taxes alone than residents of many U.S. states pay in state taxes.Moreover, the post-pandemic remote work boom has made relocation easier for many professionals. “It’s much harder to leave a country than to leave a state, and harder to leave a state than to leave a city,” Walczak said, emphasizing that mobility within metropolitan areas could accelerate if taxes climb higher.FAQsWhat is Zohran Mamdani’s millionaire tax proposal? Mamdani’s plan introduces a 2% income tax increase on New Yorkers earning more than $1 million annually to fund free public transport and rent stabilization programs.How much revenue could the millionaire tax generate? Mamdani’s office estimates the policy would raise $4 billion a year, though critics argue that figure depends on whether wealthy residents remain in the city.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onZohran Mamdani millionaire taxincome tax increase New YorkersPresident Donald TrumpNew York Mayor MamdaniNew York City tax proposal\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Just as the era of the personal essay seemed finally to have been put to rest, a surprising new voice emerged this week in the form of Prince Harry, contributing some touching thoughts and a lot of alliteration to the public sphere to coincide with the run-up to Remembrance Sunday. Unlike his blockbuster memoir, Spare, the essay, which runs to 650 words, seems to be all the prince’s own work and, as well as his observations about the role of veterans, offers us a poignant insight into his life in California.\n\nOr rather, into what appears to be one man’s homesickness for simple British pleasures not readily available in Montecito. Namely, wrote the prince, “stoic spirit”, “self-deprecation and humour”, the “banter of the mess, the clubhouse, the pub”, and a “cuppa or a pint”. And good luck finding an adequate cup of tea in that part of the world. But the misty-eyed list of Blitz-era national characteristics would seem to speak to a more generalised sense of estrangement that brings to mind a line from an EL Doctorow short story about a man “simply dying of the wrong life”.\n\nWhile the royal family pressed on with its grim and overdue task of banishing the former prince Andrew, Harry’s random intrusions into public life look, by contrast, increasingly blameless. One assumes the prince would rather be at the Cenotaph this Sunday, alongside other members of his family – just as one assumes he’d be happier running after pheasants in a field in Gloucestershire than going to an LA Dodgers game – but instead he will be in Toronto engaging with veterans. A few years ago, at this time of year, Prince Harry laid a wreath in a private ceremony at the LA National Cemetery. There is nothing wrong with either of these gestures, but I’ll say it: they seem rather sad.\n\nFinally this week, a satisfying conclusion to the many-year campaign undertaken by David Beckham and his PR team to have his contribution to national life recognised by royalty. Becks: my struggle (to get a knighthood) resulted in a feverishly wished-for trip to the palace on Tuesday to be knighted by the king, all insults apparently forgiven.\n\nYou may recall those insults, which were extremely memorable. In 2017 a leaked email from Beckham to his PR adviser contained a petulant rant in which the now Sir David referred to the honours committee as “unappreciative cunts”, and went on, “it’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago”.\n\nAt the time, Becks insisted the email was “hacked” and the words “doctored”. But glancing back at those sentences I would suggest that the two major indicators they were written by Beckham himself are the slightly strangulated and very Beckham-esque phrase “to be honest” and – at the risk of sounding like a member of the honours committee myself – the grammar of “I would of got something”. Anyway, congratulations to Sir David and Lady Beckham!\n\nAh, George Clooney, the actor who put his byline to a 2024 op-ed in the New York Times calling for Joe Biden to step down – thanks for your contribution, George! – and then went very quiet indeed when Donald Trump was elected, finally surfaced this week in an interview on CBS to clear his throat and offer a qualifying opinion.\n\nI know movie stars can’t win when it comes to airing their political thoughts – annoying when they do, craven when they don’t – but there is something particularly toe-curling about Clooney’s sporadic engagement with politics, and this week’s remarks were no different. “I think it was a mistake, quite honestly,” said the actor in reference to Kamala Harris becoming the default Democratic candidate after Biden stood down. “I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary. Let’s battle-test this quickly and get it up and going.”\n\nI would say nobody asked, but sadly the CBS hack clearly did, and the difficulty for Clooney at times like these is a possible lingering confusion in his mind between who he is (George Clooney) and who he has been paid to imagine himself to be (Edward R Murrow) – a mistake that the 64-year-old’s chatshow auto-chuckle and beaming self-regard thankfully prevents his audience from repeating.\n\nThe new Ryan Murphy show, All’s Fair, has been destroyed critically from all angles, but for my money, Apple TV’s Down Cemetery Road is the bigger disappointment. I expect nothing from Murphy, the former hack for Entertainment Weekly who hasn’t made a decent show since he produced The People v OJ Simpson 10 years ago.\n\nBut you expect something very elevated indeed from the combined talents of Emma Thompson, Ruth Wilson and Mick Herron. Perhaps Herron’s book, on which the show is based, is OK. But the adaptation is hokey, convoluted, stuffed with nonsensical sets (a commuter-belt home in what is supposed to be an alternative community) and, with the exception of Wilson, the worst acting I’ve seen since Megan Stalter’s comic turn in Too Much. If you value your time, ditch Down Cemetery Road and watch HBO’s I Love LA, the best new thing on TV by a long chalk.\n\nThe biggest male movie stars in the world right now are probably Timothée Chalamet and Jacob Elordi, both beloved by gen Z and slightly baffling to those of us who grew up at the Pitt/Cruise end of the continuum. To which end, People magazine revealed its annual Sexiest Man Alive this week and it wasn’t a scowling beefcake, member of the church of Scientology, or gentleman with a complicated history with his ex-wives. Instead, it was Britain’s own Jonathan Bailey, 37-year-old star of Bridgerton and Wicked, and the first out gay man to win the People crown. Even if it’s a silly competition from a dying old media brand, I call that progress.","summary":"Prince opens up in a personal essay before Remembrance Sunday.

Katie Porter's support in the 2026 governor's race dropped after she tangled with a television reporter during a heated interview in October, an incident that rival candidates used to question her temperament. Porter was the clear front-runner over the summer, but by late October she dropped behind Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, according to a poll released Friday by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times. Still, nearly half of the registered voters surveyed remain undecided, evidence that few Californians are paying attention to a race that remains wide open and was eclipsed in recent months by the costly and successful congressional redistricting battle that became a referendum on President Trump. Porter remains the most favored Democratic candidate, which is significant in a state that has not elected a Republican governor since 2006. \"She's the leading Democrat among the various ones that are in there right now,\" said Mark DiCamillo, director of the poll. \"But it's because nobody really on the Democratic side has really jumped out of the pack. It's kind of a political vacuum at the moment.\" The governor's race was frozen in stasis for most of the year, first as Californians waited for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether she was going to jump into the race. It wasn't until late July that Harris announced, no, she was not running. Then, weeks later, Californians became captivated by a special election to reconfigure the state's congressional districts — which set off a furious, expensive and high-stakes political battle that could help decide which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. Now that the special election is over, gubernatorial candidates can \"rev up the public to pay attention,\" DiCamillo said. \"It's the time for someone to break through,\" he said. But it won't be U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla. The senator would have been the top Democrat in the race, but not a heavy favorite, if he decided to jump in, the poll found. Voters gave him the highest favorability rating among all current and potential contenders in the governor's race. After months of speculation, however, Padilla on Tuesday announced he would forgo a run for governor. The new poll found that Bianco was supported by 13% of voters in the state, followed by Porter at 11%. The Berkeley poll in August showed that Porter led all candidates with 17% support, with Bianco in second place at 10%. A Bianco representative said his lead in the polls was evidence that his campaign was resonating with voters. \"It is abundantly clear that Californians are demanding a new path forward,\" campaign manager Erica Melendrez said. \"Sheriff Bianco represents a safe California, an affordable California, an educated California and a leader with integrity and character that ALL Californians can be proud of.\" DiCamillo said Porter's 6% drop over those three months was significant, given that the California governor's race is so tight, but cautioned that it's still early in the 2026 campaign season and a lot of shifting will happen before the June gubernatorial primary. Porter's campaign declined to comment on the drop in support and noted instead that she still led the Democratic field. “Poll after poll continues to show Katie as the strongest Democrat in the race, driven by a growing coalition of grassroots supporters — not powerful special interests,\" spokesperson Peter Opitz said. \"Californians know her record of taking on Donald Trump and trust her to tackle our cost crisis, from skyrocketing rent and housing costs to rising healthcare premiums and unaffordable child care.” Porter came under fire in October after an outburst during an interview with CBS reporter Julie Watts. When the Sacramento-based journalist asked Porter what she would say to Californians who voted for Trump, the UC Irvine law professor responded that she didn't need their support. After Watts asked follow-up questions, Porter accused the reporter of being \"unnecessarily argumentative,\" held up her hands and later said, \"I don't want this all on camera.\" The next day, a 2021 video emerged of Porter berating a staff member during a videoconference with a member of the Biden administration. \"Get out of my f— shot!\" Porter said to the young woman after she came into view in the background. Porter's comments in the video were first reported by Politico. Porter later acknowledged that she mishandled the television news interview, but explained that she felt the reporter's questioning implied she should cater to Trump's supporters. Porter also said she apologized to her staff member, saying her remarks were \"inappropriate,\" that she values her staff and could have handled that situation better. Her Democratic gubernatorial rivals seized on the videos. Former state Controller Betty Yee called on Porter to drop out of the race, and businessman Stephen Cloobeck and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa attacked her in ads about the uproar. While difficult to assess, the negative news coverage and publicity surrounding those incidents appear to have taken a toll on Porter's reputation. No other candidate experienced a similar shift in support. According to the new poll, 26% of California voters had a favorable opinion of Porter, compared with 33% who saw her unfavorably — with the remainder having no opinion. That's a major drop from when she was running for the U.S. Senate last year, when 45% of voters had a favorable opinion in February 2024 and 27% were sour on her. Political scientist Eric Schickler, co-director of the Berkeley institute that conducted the poll, said Porter looks vulnerable, and that makes the governor's race a more attractive contest for current candidates and those who may be considering joining it. Aside from Porter and Bianco, the poll found that 8% of voters favored former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, a Democrat; the same percentage backed conservative commentator Steve Hilton. Villaraigosa had support from 5% of voters, Yee 3%, and California Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond 1%. Cloobeck and former Democratic legislator Ian Calderon registered less than 1%. Another potential candidate — billionaire developer Rick Caruso — was backed by 3% of voters, the poll found. Caruso said Monday night that he still was considering running for either governor or Los Angeles mayor and will decide in a few weeks. Schickler said the results of Tuesday's election may be a sign that moderate or business-friendly Democrats — including Caruso — may not fare so well in a state as Democratic as California. Voters across the nation delivered a sharp rebuke to Trump, electing Democrats in major races in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia and passing Proposition 50, the California ballot measure designed to help Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 election. \"Somebody like Caruso, his narrative would probably look a lot stronger if Democrats still seemed on the defensive and in disarray,\" Schickler said. \"But after Prop. 50 passing, big Democratic wins in New Jersey and Virginia, I think the argument for a need to change what we're doing dramatically, at least in a state like California, is less likely to resonate.\" The Berkeley IGS/Times poll surveyed 8,141 California registered voters online in English and Spanish from Oct. 20 to 27. The results are estimated to have a margin of error of 2 percentage points in either direction in the overall sample, and larger numbers for subgroups.","summary":"A new poll shows former Orange County Rep.

Obama’s enthusiastic showings for both candidates was a test of whether his sway over the Democratic Party still remains after his support for Harris failed to boost her to the White House a year ago and angered black male voters who felt unfairly accused of sexism.\n\n“Nostalgia is an important part of politics,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on several presidential campaigns. “Of course, everybody’s excited to see Obama in a time when Democrats feel exhausted by President [Donald] Trump and Republicans who seem to have no guardrails or guidelines to what they do.”\n\nStill, Ceraso doesn’t believe Obama is the reason Democrats swept the board in Tuesday’s elections, calling Obama “comfort candy.”\n\n“I think comfort candy isn’t bad when you’re fighting and resisting against a president that none of us like,” Ceraso said.\n\nOverall, despite the blemishes on his record from last year, voters and experts believe that nearly a decade after leaving office, Obama remains the party’s most effective communicator, as the party rebuilds an offense strategy against Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nObama urged voters to send a strong message to Washington that voters are dissatisfied with Trump’s leadership amid a government shutdown, rising prices, and massive economic uncertainty.\n\n“It’s like every day is Halloween, except it’s all tricks and no treats,” Obama cheekily said of Trump.\n\nThe gambit paid off, with both women winning by double digits against their Republican opponents.\n\nVoters told the Washington Examiner that Obama’s support brought “joy” to Virginia Democrats and that he was a “fantastic and inspiring” leader — a sharp contrast from last year, when Obama faced mounting criticism over lecturing black men for not supporting the vice president against Trump because of sexism.\n\n“I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama said in Pittsburgh in October 2024 about lagging support for Harris. “Because part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”\n\nThe former president reportedly talked with New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Saturday, for the second time this year, and offered to be a “sounding board” to the new mayor, whose campaign has electrified left-leaning Democrats, yet worried establishment-minded leaders. “Your campaign has been impressive to watch,” Obama told Mamdani, according to the New York Times.\n\nOFF THE ROAD AND UP IN FLAMES: INSIDE WINSOME EARLE-SEARS’S LOSING CAMPAIGN\n\nThe former president remains one of the most popular Democrats and the most popular living president, according to a Gallup survey released in February. Former President Joe Biden is rated as the least popular living president, the survey also showed.\n\nDemocratic strategists largely agreed that Obama remains the best communicator for the party nearly a decade after he left the White House, but that may be by default.\n\n“So just to be blunt: We don’t have anyone else. Nobody wants to hear from Joe Biden next, nobody wants to hear from Kamala Harris,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist.\n\n“The Clintons have handed off the torch. Obama is still someone for whom there is great affection,” he later added. “The fact that he showed up and did massive rallies, drawing numbers that only he can, at that level, certainly helped to juice turnout.”\n\n“President Obama helped tremendously in getting these Democratic governor candidates over the line, I think for a lot of moderates, and especially the many Obama-then-Trump voters out there, seeing him back on their screens brought people back to a place of stability and basic decency,” Randy Jones, a Democratic political consultant, added. “I think folks remember what his White House felt like, and in a moment like this, that’s so chaotic, that contrast is extremely important for Democrats to highlight.”\n\nEven Obama’s outreach to Mamdani, Jones claimed, was more likely his attempt to support future stars who can counter Trump than an attempt to remain relevant.\n\n“I think the former president of the United States is probably shocked and dismayed about the trajectory of the nation that he served, and he’s willing to do what he needs to do to try to turn this around,” said Jones. “And if that is making a phone call to Zohran Mamdani, regardless of what some in his party might say, I think he’s going to be willing to do those things. I can’t imagine it’s an ego play. I think it has to be a strong desire for a return to a nation that he is proud of.”\n\nTrump’s low approval ratings played a major role in the backlash from voters in New Jersey and Virginia on Tuesday. The president currently has a 37% approval rating and a 63% disapproval rating according to a recent survey from CNN/SSRS. Dissatisfaction with Trump was also a major factor in Obama’s pitch to voters to back Democrats by rejecting the GOP.NEW JERSEY ELECTION POST-MORTEM: WHAT CAUSED CIATTARELLI AND OTHER GOP LOSSES?\n\nYet, some Democrats cautioned that the party still has much work to do in raising up another communicator who can meet Obama’s star power.\n\n“It’s sort of a double-edged sword. It’s always great to have a figure like that who can break out and still draw such a huge crowd and have such a positive legacy,” said Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris. “Somebody like Obama, who it seems like Trump’s so good at sucking up all the media oxygen. Obama’s pretty good at getting attention whenever he wants it as well.”“But I will say, in the current moment, my reaction every time they kind of trot out Obama is … it is a bit of a statement that there isn’t that new figure or leader,” he added.\n\nCeraso also remained unconvinced that Obama’s presence on the campaign trail was the difference-maker, saying that Spanberger, Sherrill, and Mamdani “won these elections because they were the right messengers at the right time,”\n\nHe continued, “And I think we undermine them as Democrats when we say, well, so-and-so came in that might have helped … no, their campaigns built the infrastructure.”\n\nStill, as the nation’s first black president, Obama holds space in the American narrative in ways few other American leaders can. Much of Trump’s first and second presidential tenure has been in reaction to Obama’s historic 2008 run.\n\nGOP FUMES JAY JONES’S ACTIONS HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES AS HE RIDES BLUE WAVE TO SURPRISE WIN\n\n“There are few people who get under Donald Trump’s skin like Barack Obama. So, always enjoyable to see that,” Shroff said. “So much of Trump’s existence does seem to just be in counter to Obama. He defines himself through Obama, from wanting the Nobel Peace Prize and being obsessed with that, to wanting the love of mainstream media, he just sees himself as always getting less than and being treated unfairly in reference to Obama, who he seems obsessed with.”\n\n“So I do think that part of Obama’s relevance is that Trump and the MAGA movement is defined, so much in opposition to Obama and of course, what he represents as the first black president,” he added.","summary":"Former President&#160;Barack Obama&#160;proved Tuesday he still has cards to play when it comes to motivating Democrats to vote in elections, even though he couldn’t quite get then-Vice President Kamala Harris across the finish line last year.

Padilla elects not to run for governor, leaving a cloudy field of candidates","text":"In 362 days California voters will choose a new governor. That’s just around the corner in political terms, given the expense and organizational lift a statewide campaign requires in the nation’s most populous state.\n\nThe winner almost certainly will be — as certain as anything in politics can be — a Democrat. If nothing else, the passage of Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-decade congressional district gerrymander, confirms anew that California is a one-party state.\n\nBut which Democrat?\n\nAs the 2026 election cycle gears up — candidates can start filing paperwork next month — the field of would-be successors to Newsom is becoming even cloudier.\n\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who political media had been portraying as leaning toward running for governor, abruptly dropped out of consideration Tuesday during a Washington press conference to discuss the federal government shutdown.\n\n“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for governor of California next year,” Padilla said. “I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight.”\n\nHad he opted-in, Padilla would have been the immediate frontrunner. By opting-out, he adds himself to the list of seemingly heavyweight contenders who decided governing California isn’t an attractive career move.\n\nLt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the first to go, dropping out in August, four months after announcing her candidacy. She was followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who wrote a book to explain how she failed to win the presidency last year. Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also exited, acknowledging she probably couldn’t succeed.\n\nPadilla’s decision leaves a handful of announced Democratic hopefuls still running, but none with anything close to dominant status, along with a few more potentials who have yet to declare one way or the other.\n\nOf those who have announced, former Congresswoman Katie Porter had an early lead in polling, although under 20% support, but she was heavily damaged when videos surfaced of her harsh reaction to a reporter’s question and snapping at one of her staffers. Porter apologized but the incidents undermined her likeability, no small thing in political terms.\n\nAt the moment, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra seem to have the best prospects among the declared candidates, but once again we’re waiting for other potential candidates to get in or get out.\n\nAll eyes are on businessman Rick Caruso, who’s weighing whether to seek the governorship or run again for mayor of Los Angeles. He lost his first mayoral bid to Karen Bass, but her popularity has waned due to her handling of the city’s disastrous fires.\n\nAustin Beutner, a businessman and former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, has already declared that he’ll challenge Bass, which puts some pressure on Caruso to make his intentions known.\n\nWealthy investor Tom Steyer, who ran for president in 2020, pumped millions of dollars into his own campaign for Proposition 50, sparking speculation he might run for governor.\n\nCaruso and Steyer could easily finance campaigns for governor, freeing themselves from the chore of raising money and thus incurring political debts to supporters. That alone would make them viable candidates.\n\nFormer state Controller Betty Yee and Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of schools, are still declared candidates but don’t appear to be gaining traction.\n\nFinally, there’s some buzz in political media about Bay Area Congressman Eric Swalwell, after one private poll included his name.\n\nUntil the field becomes clearer, political media, would-be campaign contributors and California voters will just have to twiddle their thumbs.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"A handful of announced Democratic hopefuls still running, but none has anything close to frontrunner status.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/07/walters-padilla-elects-not-to-run-for-governor-leaving-a-cloudy-field-of-candidates/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sut-l-padilla-court-005.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 10:45:11","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":376705078,"title":"The likely House GOP California redistricting survivors","text":"California’s Proposition 50 is a direct response to the Texas legislature creating five more safely Republican or GOP-leaning seats to help protect President Donald Trump’s party from losing the House majority next year. The Trump White House has pushed for GOP-favorable House remaps in several other states, too.\n\nIn California, though, Proposition 50’s passage is set to make its House districts a much deeper shade of blue.\n\n“In past elections for Congress, a lot of times, a district would vote for the Democratic candidate, and for Trump,” said Fabian Valdez, a data analysis guru in Long Beach, California, with extensive experience consulting on redistricting.\n\nBut chances of such split-ticket voting are thinner now, with the new lines taking effect after the 2026 midterm elections, Valdez said in an interview.\n\nDemocrats haven’t been shy about naming their political targets: Reps. Ken Calvert (R-CA), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), and David Valadao (R-CA). The passage of Proposition 50 means each will see their current House districts redrawn to various degrees, adding in blue precincts and chopping off reliably GOP-voting precincts.\n\nStill, House Republicans in California have some reason for solace in Democrats’ efforts to change the state’s delegation from a wide 43 to 9 over Republicans, to an overwhelming 48 to 4. The new map will leave a few House Republican survivors in districts already varying shades of red.\n\n“In each of those past four elections, a Republican won four out of four times” in those districts, Valdez said, citing his analysis of how the districts would have voted in congressional races from 2018 to 2024.\n\nThe incoming maps will make more red the current districts of Reps. Vince Fong (R-CA), Tom McClintock (R-CA), and Jay Obernolte (R-CA). The Southern California district of Rep. Young Kim (R-CA) also becomes more Republican, but she could face competition for the seat from current House GOP colleagues.\n\nThat’s because under the new congressional map configurations, some of the five House Republican lawmakers getting turfed out could run in a different district. Even if that means challenging an incumbent in California’s June 2026 all-party primary (more on that below). So, two or more House incumbents could end up facing off in the November 2026 general election.\n\nIn the wake of the new House maps being adopted, ambitious politicians on both sides of the aisle are recalibrating their political plans. These are the red puddles in a sea of blue that will emerge when new House districts take effect on Jan. 3, 2027, when the 120th Congress opens.\n\nKevin McCarthy’s old district gets even more red\n\nVince Fong already holds California’s reddest House seat. It will lean even further in the Republicans’ way under the new map.\n\nFong won a May 2024 special election for California’s 20th Congressional District, covering the eastern Central Valley from the Bakersfield to Fresno areas. The new House maps don’t significantly change its geographic contours. In 2024, Trump beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris there 64% to 34%. The new version would shift 1.4 points to the right, per a recent Los Angeles Times analysis, using results from the 2024 presidential election to calculate the margin of victory between Democrats and Republicans in the redrawn districts.\n\nFong succeeded former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the district. McCarthy quit Congress when Republican House colleagues ousted him from the chamber’s top job in October 2023, after only nine months. Fong, then a state Assemblyman representing a similar political turf, easily won the open seat.\n\nVeteran lawmaker’s district largely intact\n\nTo the north and east, far away from liberal coastal California, Tom McClintock also should be in good shape to hold a tweaked version of his district’s current version, covering the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nParty registration in the new 5th Congressional District will be 44% Republican to 29% Democratic. That makes sense, as it will stretch hundreds of miles along the Nevada state line and west into California’s agricultural heartland. Like McCarthy’s old district, this has long been conservative territory.\n\n“Much of the Central Valley and North State is dominated by agriculture, and many of the farmers have felt that Republican ideas speak to them,” said Kerida Plaza, a PhD candidate at the University of Rochester, where she plans to write her dissertation about the history of Republicans in California between 1970 and 2016.\n\n“Every time a Republican candidate wears cowboy boots and plaid in a direct-mail piece, they are speaking to the sensibilities of rural farmers,” added Plaza in an email interview.\n\nMcClintock, first elected to the House in 2008, will have the distinction of having represented another huge swath of California. He was a state assemblyman from 1982 to 1992, then again from 1996 to 2000. And then a state senator from 2000 to 2008. McClintock’s long stints in California’s capital of Sacramento were interspersed with several unsuccessful runs for statewide office.\n\nBack then, McClintock, 69, represented state legislative districts based in and around Thousand Oaks, a suburban Ventura County community just north of the Los Angeles County line. When a House seat in the Sierra foothills opened up in the 2008 election cycle, McClintock shifted north, successfully running for office there, and has been ensconced in California’s northeastern and central realms ever since.\n\nCongress’s AI specialist set to keep his seat\n\nJay Obernolte will see his current district, covering the Mojave Desert region of San Bernardino County, stay largely the same, but with some new territory on its eastern flank. The district, taking in fast-growing Los Angeles exurbs where costs of living are (for now) lower, won’t just extend to California’s state line with Nevada, as is currently the case, but also Arizona.\n\n“It’s like 85% his old district,” said Valdez, per his Proposition 50 redistricting analysis.\n\nAnd it will grow more Republican. GOP registration in Obernolte’s new district is 38% to 32% for Democrats. Yet, that only tells part of the political story, since in the 2024 presidential election, Trump would have beaten Democratic rival then-Vice President Kamala Harris there 58% to 39%.\n\nObernolte stands out in Congress for his engineering background, with an emphasis on artificial intelligence before it went mainstream. The former high school valedictorian in 1992 obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in engineering and applied science from the California Institute of Technology. In 1997, he earned his Master of Science in artificial intelligence from UCLA. Branching out academically, Obernolte, in 2020, finishing up six years in the state Assembly, earned a Doctorate in Public Administration from California Baptist University in Riverside.\n\nObernolte is the only former video game developer in Congress. With the rapid growth of AI in recent years affecting virtually all walks of life, Obernolte has become an unofficial and bipartisan tutor to less tech-savvy House colleagues on the technology. As chairman of a bipartisan House AI task force in 2024, Obernolte helped craft a comprehensive road map for how Congress can respond to the tech that’s triggered fear and excitement globally.\n\nOrange County GOP vote sink\n\nThe biggest open question surrounding House Republicans and California’s rejiggered House maps concerns Young Kim. The former congressional aide and state assemblywoman won an Orange County-based House seat in 2020. Her current district covers eastern Orange County and some surrounding communities.\n\nIn the new 40th Congressional District, Republicans have a voting registration edge over Democrats 40% to 31%. That’s effectively a “vote sink,” redistricting parlance for the majority party (in this case, the Democrats) conceding a district to the opposition to make bigger gains elsewhere.\n\nThe new district is a throwback of sorts to Orange County’s mid- to late-20th-century role as a bastion of conservative Republicanism. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, former statewide officeholders in California, ran up some of their top White House race margins in Orange County.\n\n“During and after World War II, many people moved to the Sunbelt, which includes Orange County, and these people were often conservative leaning,” said Plaza, the PhD candidate.\n\n“Sunbelt conservatives often worked with and were influenced by conservatives in other parts of the West and the South to push back against the eastern wing of the party,” said Plaza, now in western New York after Sacramento experience as a top aide to now-Rep. Kevin Kiley during much of his six-year state Assembly career. “Typified by characters such as Nelson Rockefeller, the eastern wing of the party was known to be more moderate.”\n\nThe 40th Congressional District lines will shift somewhat, and Kim, 63, would seem in a strong political position to slide into it. However, with other House Republicans seeing their current districts torn out from under them, one is running for the newly created seat, and another still might.\n\nRep. Calvert said on Nov. 5 that he is running for the 40th Congressional District seat. He was first elected to the House in 1992, and now represents an inland district stretching from the southern Riverside suburbs to Palm Springs. Calvert, 72, over the past two election cycles, ran in more politically competitive turf than much of his congressional career, the result of redrawn seats by California’s independent redistricting commission (which, under Proposition 50, will be suspended for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 election cycles).\n\nIn a Republican-majority House, Calvert has significant influence as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees Pentagon spending. Yet, that’s all threatened by the Proposition 50 maps, which completely dismantle his current district, parceling many of the most Republican-leaning areas into surrounding Democratic majority seats.\n\nSo, Calvert’s best political option for continuing his House career is to run in CA40, against Rep. Kim, even though it’s not his traditional home base. The district might also be tempting for Darrell Issa, who now represents a district covering southern Riverside County and inland San Diego County.\n\nIssa, 72, won the 48th Congressional District in 2024 with nearly 60% of the vote in the suburban and rural region. But redistricting will pour tens of thousands of new voters in from bluer areas, including Palm Springs, Vista, and San Marcos, while removing some redder areas such as Santee and Lakeside.\n\nIssa could have an incentive to stay put and seek reelection in the district, despite its more unfavorable shape. In the 2024 presidential race, Harris would have beaten Trump by a relatively slim margin of 50.26% to 47.14%.\n\n“The reality is [District] 48 is winnable by Issa,” said Valdez, the redistricting data analyst. “It’s not like it’s a slam dunk for any Democrat running for that district.”\n\nTRUMP BLASTS EARLY AND MAIL-IN VOTING, COMPLICATING CALIFORNIA GOP VOTER PUSH\n\nIssa’s biggest advantage if he moved north to run in the new 40th District is money. As in, he has lots of it, as one of the richest members of Congress. The car alarm magnate has not been shy about funding his prior campaigns and could, in theory, do it again in the Orange County-based congressional district.\n\nIt’s an open question whether three House Republicans will run against each other for the same House seat. But with the extent of the political musical chairs forced by Proposition 50 now coming into focus, nothing can be ruled out.","summary":"California‘s new congressional maps could leave only four of the Golden State’s current nine House Republicans as winners in what’s become a high-stakes game of political musical chairs.

They are the on-screen villains in films such as Don’t Look Up and Glass Onion. They are the bogeymen of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and have been the primary target of his ire ever since he became a millionaire himself. A celebrity or politician may safely purchase a Lamborghini, but once we’re in private jet territory, things start to get a little dicey.\n\nLikewise, Zohran Mamdani just became the mayor-elect of New York City by promising to use the government’s knife to slash prices and by complaining about the ultra-wealthy. “I don’t think that we should have billionaires,” he said in an interview, “because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality.”\n\nTo celebrities and politicians who benefit from such simplification, the cure for the wealth gap in the United States (as if it were representative of an illness) is for billionaires to give their money away to those less fortunate. They’re unlikely to do so voluntarily, and that’s where the government would step in. \n\nThis reasoning falls into what free market economist Milton Friedman called the fixed pie fallacy: “Most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another.” If there is only so much money to go around, then if we simply redistribute it through taxation and entitlements, all will be well.\n\nBut this ignores the fact that billionaires tend to accumulate their wealth by creating value. Think of Elon Musk, who cofounded seven companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. Without Mark Zuckerberg, there would be no Facebook. Without Jeff Bezos, there’d be no Amazon. Even musical artists such as Taylor Swift have brought joy (quantifiable in cash) to their millions of fans. \n\nNot to mention the fact that many billionaires are serious philanthropists (for better or for worse — we’re looking at you, Bill Gates). Zuckerberg, who was witness to Eilish’s speech, has already donated billions to charity and pledged to give away much more.\n\nSure, billionaires ought to give away much of their wealth (as long as it’s not going to climate justice). But that doesn’t mean their riches are ill-gotten gains or that the government should decide at what point a wealthy person becomes too wealthy. On the contrary, as David R. Henderson writes for the Hoover Institute, “Allowing billionaires to exist makes the rest of us better off.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election season, Eilish, who endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, posed a question to her fans: “Do you like freedom?” Unfortunately for Eilish, freedom and her socialist leanings are incongruous.

But there was another US election – one you may not have followed - which is far more worrying for Donald Trump.\nBenedict Brook in New YorkUS Correspondent\n\nNovember 7, 2025 - 4:25PM\n\nShare via Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Whatsapp\n\nÉcoutez cet article\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\ntheaustralian.com.au\nWSJ Opinion: What’s Next for Trump and the GOP After Democrats Win on Election Day?\n\nDemocrats win races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, exceeding expectations and sending a warning sign to Donald Trump and...\n\nAll eyes were on New York on Tuesday when Zohran Mamdani swept to victory to become the city’s next mayor. \nPrior to polling day, Donald Trump had implored – nay demanded – New Yorkers not to vote for the Democrat Socialist.\nNew Yorkers paid little attention. Mr Mamdani’s victory was resounding. Although, it’s not a hugely surprising result that a city which has always been progressive lurched left. \nThe focus on New York, however, has taken attention away from another election. And that one is far more concerning for the White House. One data analyst has said it shows a significant number of potential Republican voters are now “deeply uncomfortable with Trump”.\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nCandidate Surprised by Army Son on Eve of NJ Election\n\nJack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, had a...\n\nIn New Jersey, the governorship was up for grabs. \nThe state, which in parts is essentially a dormitory suburb of New York City, had been steadily moving Republican. \nA year ago, Mr Trump came within 6 percentage points of snatching the state from Kamala Harris. Of all the nationwide US elections last week, this was the Republicans’ best hope.\nThere was a real chance that Jack Ciattarelli could snare the governor’s mansion from the Republicans. After all, he had become within a whisker of doing just that in 2021’s governor election.\n\nDemocrat Zohran Mamdani had a stunning win, but it's the Democrats’ win in New Jersey which will worry Republicans more. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File)\nThis was how the story was supposed to go: enough people in New Jersey, less progressive than those New Yorkers just over the Hudson River, would embrace Donald Trump’s law and order and tough on immigration policies, would celebrate his demonisation of diversity and the “radical Left”, and would continue the “America First” march towards MAGA.\nBut the story had a twist: The Democrats’ Mikie Sherrill won in New Jersey. \nAnd it wasn’t even close. She won bigly.\nMs Sherrill, a former naval officer, took 56.3 per cent of the vote to Mr Ciattarelli’s 43 per cent. \n\nNew Jersey Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill.

But there were hopes New Jersey would be a win or, if nothing else, would show the Republicans closing in. \n“Last night was a disaster,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News bluntly on Wednesday. \n“It was an electoral blowout. The left showed up in big numbers last night, and common sense conservatives did not. \n“If that happens a year from now, we face disaster in the midterms”.\n\nThe Democrats won in a New Jersey landslide. Picture: NBC.\nWhy Trump thinks the losses happened\nDonald Trump had his own thoughts on the losses. \nReason one, he opined, was the shutdown. Which appeared to be an acknowledgment that efforts to characterise it as a “Democrat shutdown” are not resonating with swing voters.\nReason two: “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT,” said Mr Trump, all in caps and referring to himself in the third person. \nTrue, Mr Trump’s name was not on the ballot, but the Republicans have a problem if the only way they can get enough people to vote for their party is if his name is literally printed on the paper.\nAs former House Speaker and Republican elder Newt Gingrich told Fox News, Mr Trump’s grouching “does not solve anything for Republicans”. \n“His name is not going to be on the ballot in 2026 or 2028 either. If Republicans do not learn how to connect with, motivate and turn out more Americans, we are in for a huge Democratic comeback in the next election”.\n\nThe New York skyline as seen from the major New Jersey city of Newark. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n‘Double, triple MAGA’\nOnline, many MAGA commentators have suggested the problem in New Jersey was the candidate wasn’t MAGA enough. \nOne of those people is former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. That's the guy who has said Mr Trump should defy the constitution and run for a third term and that moves should be made to deport Mr Mamdani following his election win. \nTo avoid a drubbing at 2026’s midterm elections, he told US political website Politico, “It’s going to be very simple: You’re either with MAGA or you’re not”.\n“You double and triple down with Trump. If you’re not prepared to do that, you’re going to get smoked, because you’re not going to see Trump voters come out, like in Virginia, just like in New Jersey.”\n\nIt was not a great election for US President Donald Trump. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP)\nBut the data coming out of New Jersey doesn’t suggest that would be a path to Republican redemption. \nAn NBC poll of voters in New Jersey found 55 per cent disapproved of Mr Trump’s presidency. \nThe biggest issue was cost of living – that’s despite Mr Trump continually saying he’s essentially solved that problem. Clearly voters aren’t buying it.\nBesides, Mr Ciattarelli made sure MAGA talking points were part of his pitch. He mused that when he mentioned bringing back plastic bags, a MAGA hot topic, he got more of a reception at rallies than if he mentioned cutting taxes. \nHe railed at “open borders,” slammed transgender athletes and campaigned with very right wing personalities. \nBut he seemingly confused sentiment at rallies for sentiment at polling stations. \n\nSenator Ted Cruz says Republicans need to appeal to more “common sense conservatives”.

(Photo by Shannon Finney/Getty Images for Semafor)\n‘Deeply uncomfortable with Trump’\nMs Sherrill, who will become New Jersey’s new governor, is no Zohran Mamdani. She is centrist and establishment. And in New Jersey that appeared to resonate. \nNBC election analyst Steve Kornacki, the US version of Antony Green, said the concern for the Republicans will be “the Sherrill landslide has potential ramifications that extend well beyond the borders of New Jersey”.\nShe triumphed, for instance, in well-off suburbs and commuter towns.\n“These are traditionally Republican areas populated with college-educated, white-collar professionals who are deeply uncomfortable with Trump,” he said.\n“Their verdict was decisive: They wanted to vote against the party of Trump.”\n\nThe destruction of the East Wing of the White House has not helped people make ends meet. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\nThen there were Hispanic voters. Many moved towards Mr Trump for the election. But in New Jersey that group swung straight back to the Democrats seemingly alarmed at the White House’s zeal for deportations contrary to Mr Trump’s insistence they would only go after the “worst of the worst”. \nRepublican politicians in New Jersey have also cited Mr Trump’s destruction of the White House’s east wing as a reason for the party’s drubbing. It may not affect New Jersey directly but it suggests the US president is having fun elsewhere when people have bills to pay.\nAnd his threat to scrap infrastructure projects in New York – to punish that city – but which impact people in New Jersey as many work in Manhattan.\n\nMore Coverage\n‘Disaster’: Trump says he’ll cut off New York\nBenedict Brook in New York with Bianca Soldani\n‘Bad start’: Trump warns new mayor\nBenedict Brook in the US and Brielle Burns\nTed Cruz’s warning that “common sense conservatives” weren’t voting will weigh on party strategists fearful that however much Mr Trump’s actions may excite MAGA, other Republicans are reviled.\nWhile Mr Mamdani’s win in New York may be getting all the headlines, Jack Ciattarelli’s loss just a few kilometres away may be the real warning sign for the Republicans.\nThe party has exactly 12 months to work out what to do before the crucial midterm elections in November 2026.\nRead related topics:Donald Trump\n\nMore related stories\nUS Politics\nUS strike kills three in Caribbean\nThe US military has conducted another strike in the Caribbean under Trump’s orders, killing three people, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.\n\nUS Politics\nWall St panic, $58 trillion ‘heart attack’ hits\nWall St is in turmoil and the global economy is shaken as a very uncomfortable truth about the US comes to light.\n\nUS Politics\nWorld’s first trillionaire made in wild scenes\nWe may soon see the world’s first trillionaire after shareholders approved a massive pay package for their CEO.

How did he do it? By motivating men, young men in particular, and sports fans who were fed up with the insanity of men winning women's sports championships. I wrote about the victory in my new book, \"Balls,\" which was released on Tuesday. The book addresses the landslide Trump victory, but it also asks an important question when looking forward prospectively: Now that Trump, unfortunately, isn't able to run for reelection, how do Republicans ensure that the Trump MAGA coalition extends, and even grows, beyond his own presidency? THE RESULTS ARE IN: 2025'S BIGGEST WINNER AND LOSERS FROM THE OFF-YEAR ELECTIONS In 2024, the two most conservative voting groups in America were male senior citizens and young men under the age of thirty. This has never happened before in any of our lives. It was a cultural transformation overnight. Trump also won record support among White, Black, Asian and Hispanic men as well, but that same momentum didn't extend to 2025. Indeed, Tuesday's voting results paint an ominous picture of what 2026 and 2028 could look like if young men aren't motivated to show up and vote like they did in 2024. Consider the numbers: in 2024, Trump received 1.968 million votes in New Jersey and 2.075 million votes in Virginia. While he lost both states by narrow margins to Kamala Harris — by roughly 5% — he received more votes than the Virginia Democrat candidate for governor, Abigail Spanberger — who won Virginia with 1.961 million votes — and the New Jersey Democrat candidate for governor, Mikie Sherrill — who won New Jersey with 1.792 million votes. So how did both Democratic gubernatorial candidates win election comfortably despite receiving fewer votes than Trump did in their states a year ago? Yes, partly because it was an off-year cycle and overall turnout trended down, but they won comfortably because roughly 600,000 Trump voters didn't show up to vote in 2025 who did show up to vote in 2024. NEWT GINGRICH: REPUBLICANS HAVE ONE BIG THING TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR 2025 WIPEOUT Who are these voters? Young men, sports fans, blue collar workers, the Trump MAGA base that will come out to support Trump when he's on the ballot, but won't show up when he's not on the ballot. So will these voters return in 2026 and in 2028 when Trump isn't on the ballot? That depends on how well future Republican candidates speak to these voters. Some of y'all will think I'm crazy for telling you this, but as soon as the 2026 mid-term elections are over, expect a pivot so rapid it will make your head spin — Democrats in 2027 will all argue that Trump's unique political gifts end with him, that MAGA is over without Trump as its leader. Yep, from \"He's Hitler!\" to \"He's the most talented Republican president in any of our lifetimes,\" almost overnight. I'm telling you, it's coming. Because Democrats are going to bank on Trump as a political unicorn, a candidate so talented that only he could power a coalition as substantial as he won in 2024. MARK PENN: DEMOCRATS WIN THE MOMENT, BUT LEFT-WING TILT THREATENS THEIR FUTURE So what do Republicans need to do to extend and even grow Trump's appeal with young men? I think it's a combination of three things, wed the policy and the personal together, as Trump has been uniquely talented at doing. 1. On the policy front, the 2024 election was about the economy, the border, and crime It was as easy as EBC. Trump won the arguments on all three of these fronts. So far, Trump 2.0 has ended the border as an issue by ending illegal immigration and driven crime down to record lows in many states and cities. His challenge on the economy is that Biden was so bad, it's taking time to clean up his mess. With record high stock prices and record low gas prices, Trump is delivering for all of us with stock market assets and all of us who have to fill up our tanks. DEMOCRATS SEE MANDATE AFTER 2025 WINS — REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A MIRAGE But there's a lingering anger over how much goods cost. Even I feel it each time I buy a Chick-fil-A meal for my family and it costs over $50. For fast food, really! Prices went up so fast under President Joe Biden that the sticker shock is still real even in 2025. Trump has stopped the rapid price increases and, in the case of some purchases like gas, has actually brought them back lower than they were during Biden, but that bitter aftertaste of inflation takes time to wear off. So far it hasn't. 2. Focus on men in women's sports Is it the most important issue in the country? No. But it crystallizes the absurdity of Democrat policies for young men and sports fans, who provided the fuel to Trump's record win in 2024. If you believe a man should be able to win a women's sports championship, how can I trust your opinion on anything? As I wrote in \"Balls,\" this issue, combined with EBC, won Trump the election in 2024. I think that will still be the message in 2026, too, because, amazingly, Democrats have doubled and tripled down on defending men in women's sports all over the country. This issue isn't going away. 3. HAVE FUN and BE ENTERTAINING. My two favorite moments of the 2024 campaign were when Trump dressed up as a McDonald's employee and as a garbage man and rode around in a garbage truck. Was it absurd and ridiculous? Of course. But the number one gift Trump has that he receives zero credit for is this: HE'S FUNNY! Yes, politics are serious. But they should also be fun. Trump is a happy warrior and happy warriors win. The two most successful Republican presidents of my life were Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. Both were, in many respects, professional entertainers. They knew how to cut through the noise and were authentic in the way they did so. Trump isn't perfect, none of us are, but he's the most comfortable president in his own skin that any of us have ever seen and he has tremendous political instincts. You can spend a hundred million on an ad campaign and not get the free media attention that Trump did, scooping out fries and talking with voters at the drive-thru in Pennsylvania. That style of politicking is unbeatable. Heck, I would argue the best version of Trump is the one you get in fast food restaurants. He genuinely loves getting out and interacting with people. That's a skill that can't be taught, but it can be emulated. We used to ask the question, which candidate would you rather have a beer with? While Trump doesn't drink — as he's jokingly said, can you imagine what he'd say if he drank? — he's authentic and real. As artificial intelligence takes over much of the country, I believe authenticity will become the most important political key to the realm. Young people in particular, who are steeped in social media artificiality fed to them constantly on their phones, have an innate sense of when they're being poll-tested and marketed to, they sniff it out better than older voters. If you want them to show up and support you, you have to win their trust. Which is why I truly believe the election was over when it came to male voters when Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In that moment, having escaped death by half an inch, Trump, whose critics had labeled him a phony, rose up and screamed, \"Fight, fight, fight!\" three times. At that instant, the election was over for male voters. It was the bravest presidential moment of my life. But it was also one of the most authentic. In times of great peril, your own personal character is revealed. In those perilous milliseconds, Trump became a legend and won the election. He proved once and for all he had \"Balls.\" And so far no Democrat has proven that they do. So long as that remains the case, Republicans aren't going to lose men.

And that momentum shift might affect calculations on both sides of the aisle, as unprecedented redistricting efforts play out in states across the country.\n\nAt least two states had votes with direct bearing on Democratic redistricting. In California, Proposition 50, the ballot measure allowing state lawmakers to counter redistricting efforts by Republicans in other states and draw a new congressional map with five pick-up opportunities for Democrats, passed by more than 27 percentage points. And Virginia, where Democrats increased their majority in the House of Delegates, is now likely to seek voter approval for a redrawn map that could net Democrats as many as three additional seats.\n\nBut Tuesday’s results might also prompt Republicans to rethink the wisdom of creating aggressive new maps that would eliminate Democratic districts – but also dilute heavily Republican ones – in order to create more districts that lean Republican. If the Democratic turnout energy and vote margins seen in this week’s elections are an early glimpse of next year’s midterms, then Republicans’ efforts to redraw themselves into a more secure House majority might not go as planned.\n\n“Republicans are pursuing a highly risky strategy on redistricting,” wrote former Republican and independent congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, in a post on X. “By diluting the GOP base, you are less likely to win any given seat, so the worst time to redraw is during a strong [Democratic] cycle.”\n\nExperts say Republicans appear unlikely to wind up creating a “dummymander” – the term for when a party redraws a map too aggressively and it backfires, allowing the other party to win seats. In Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio, the four states where legislators have already redrawn maps to add a total of nine new GOP-leaning districts, Republicans probably won’t end up with worse outcomes than if they had not redistricted at all.\n\nBut they might end up winning fewer of these new districts than they had hoped, says David Wasserman, senior elections analyst for the Cook Political Report. And other states that have faced White House pressure to redistrict, such as Indiana, Florida, and Kansas, might now be dissuaded from doing so. Incumbent Republicans in districts that President Donald Trump won by 20 points might be looking at new districts where Mr. Trump’s margin of victory was in the low double digits – still an uphill climb for a Democratic challenger but not an impossible one in a wave election. And they might not be willing to cut it that close.\n\n“Even that might not be agreeable to Republicans under these circumstances,” says Mr. Wasserman. “Republicans might tread more carefully.”\n\nCompetitive districts in Texas\n\nCongressional maps are typically redrawn every 10 years, following the release of updated population estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. But an unprecedented mid-cycle redistricting effort took off this past summer after Mr. Trump urged Texas Republicans to create five more GOP-leaning districts.\n\nTexas passed its new map in August, following a walkout by Democratic legislators, who decamped to Chicago in protest for about two weeks before returning home. And while the new map definitely gives Republicans an advantage, not all of Texas’ newly gerrymandered seats are locks for the GOP – especially if Democratic turnout is high.\n\nTwo of the five newly drawn congressional districts are solidly Republican: the 9th and 32nd. The latter went from a district that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by a 24-point margin in 2024 to a district that Mr. Trump would have won by 18 points.\n\nThen there is the new 35th District, which was redrawn without parts of Austin and instead now expands into the rural and suburban areas southeast of San Antonio. The district had voted for Ms. Harris by 34 points in 2024, but under its new boundaries would have gone for Mr. Trump by 10 points. “If Democrats find a good candidate, that’s not an impossible seat to win,” says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.\n\nFinally, there are the 34th and 28th Districts in South Texas. Currently represented by Democratic Reps. Vincente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar, respectively, these are districts that Mr. Trump won in 2024 by five and seven points. Under the redrawn lines, Mr. Trump’s margin of victory in both would have been about 10 points, according to Cook Political Report calculations.\n\nBut there’s no guarantee that the Republican candidate in any of these districts next year will perform nearly as well as Mr. Trump did in 2024. In the last two districts in particular, the president saw some of his biggest swings in the country because of gains he made among Latinos, who make up 83 to 90% of the voters there. And Tuesday’s election results suggest those gains might not hold. In New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, seen as a test of Mr. Trump’s standing among Latino voters, Democrat Mikie Sherrill more than doubled Ms. Harris’ 2024 margins in majority-Hispanic cities.\n\n“Some of the Republican gains with Latinos will last, but not all of them,” says Mr. Kondik, suggesting that these two districts could be “more defendable” after this week’s results. “In 2018, the Democrats did win a handful of seats Trump had won by double digits, and I think it’s quite possible they will next year, and Cuellar or Gonzalez could survive.”\n\nMore motivated to redraw lines\n\nThe fate of these Texas districts, as well as those in other Southern states, might also be impacted by the Supreme Court’s upcoming ruling on a challenge to the Voting Rights Act. Passed during the Civil Rights era to ensure equal access to the ballot box, the law also prohibits electoral practices that dilute the votes of minority communities, such that they are effectively locked out of power. Texas’ new map immediately triggered accusations of Voting Rights Act violations, because the new districts break up Latino communities. But if the court finds it unconstitutional to intentionally create majority-minority districts, Republicans could redraw as many as a dozen seats in their favor across the South.\n\nSome analysts suggest the GOP might be more motivated to pursue mid-cycle redistricting in the wake of Tuesday’s results. Democratic victories across the board could make Republicans feel “more desperate,” says Mr. Kondik, and conclude that gerrymandering might be their only chance to keep control of the House. At a news conference on Thursday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana mentioned redistricting as a reason he still feels bullish about his party’s ability to maintain control of the lower chamber.\n\nBut Democrats could be more motivated as well.\n\nVirginia, where Democrats flipped 13 seats in the House of Delegates, appears ready to follow California’s lead in redrawing its maps, adding two or possibly three Democratic seats to counter Republican efforts. The newly elected House of Delegates needs to approve the move before a constitutional amendment is presented to voters.\n\nStill, others appear to be drawing different conclusions from Tuesday’s election results. The president of the Maryland state Senate posted on X that this week’s sweeping victories demonstrate that Democrats can win without needing to “rig the system.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican speaker in Kansas announced he didn’t have the votes to call a special session to address redistricting, though the matter could still be addressed later.\n\n“A lot of people are looking for a reason to stop” the redistricting arms race, says Julia Vaughn, executive director at Common Cause Indiana, an anti-gerrymandering organization. While Indiana legislators are a “cautious bunch” and have been wary of the White House’s pressure to redraw the state’s two Democratic districts from blue to red, she says, Republicans there are set to consider new maps during the first two weeks of December.\n\nStill, Ms. Vaughn predicts they’ll think carefully in the wake of Tuesday’s results.\n\nIn trying to eliminate Democratic seats, “they could overplay their hand and make life more difficult for Republican incumbents in other parts of the state. ... Tuesday will cause that kind of thinking to weigh on the minds of folks here,” she says. “It’s a balloon here in Indiana. You squeeze it and the [Democratic] voters have to come out somewhere.”","summary":"Some Republicans might grow wary of creating new congressional maps that give them pickup opportunities but make some GOP seats slightly less safe.

Democrats were stuck with a radical and unpopular adherence to gender ideology, and Republicans pointed out their extremism and the harms of their policies. But this just made the Republicans sound nuts.\n\nAs a result, Republicans backed off from the matter late in the campaign.\n\nHere are some of the basics of Virginia Democrats’ gender policies:\n\nA repeat Tier-1 sex offender named Richard Cox was regularly allowed into female high-school and local rec center locker rooms in northern Virginia, where he leered at and exposed himself to women and girls. This happened not because of oversights by staff, but because of the explicit, intentional policies of Democrats at the county and state level.\n\nGov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) didn’t create these policies, but her party did, and she has repeatedly pledged and demonstrated allegiance to the ideology behind them. For instance, she voted for a bill to make it a federal crime to discriminate on the basis of gender identity.\n\nThat is, she believes Cox is a woman, and that anyone who would deny this, or deny his entry in female locker rooms, is guilty of bigotry and discrimination. She believes the people who objected to Cox entering female locker rooms are the criminals.\n\nAnd that’s not the extent of Virginia Democrats’ gender insanity.\n\nLoudoun County schools suspended two boys who expressed their discomfort with a girl (who identified as a boy) in the boys bathroom.\n\nA few years ago, the same school district covered up a sexual assault in school because the assaulter entered a girls bathroom wearing a skirt, and so it would have triggered an uncomfortable debate over transgender bathroom policy. The father of the victim became irate at the cover-up and was, for his righteous anger, turned by Democrats and the media into a terrorist.\n\nDemocrats in the state legislature pushed a bill to declare it child abuse if a parent doesn’t affirm their child’s new identity. And the sponsor of that bill was on the ballot.\n\nThrow in the growing problem of boys playing in and winning at girls sports, and their adherence to gender ideology ought to be a big negative for Democrats. One Democratic voter I spoke to in McLean, Virginia, a Catholic woman in her 70s named Linda, said of gender ideology in northern Virginia schools, “That’s a real problem. I’m just glad my kids are grown adults and out of the school system.”\n\nShe continued, “It’s unimaginable … I feel sorry for all the parents today, really, with this transgender stuff.”\n\nAnd yet she voted for the entire Democratic ticket, adding that she didn’t really know where the candidates stood on the topic.\n\nMost Virginia voters, 51 %, told pollsters that the transgender agenda has gone too far. \n\nEvery Republican voter I interviewed on or just before Election Day mentioned transgender matters as their very first area of concern. Notably, the parents were typically indirect, or even apologetic about it. “Issues with the schools” was the euphemism (or code word) some parents used.\n\nThat same reticence showed up among the GOP candidates in the home stretch. In her final campaign appearance here in the exurbs of Washington, D.C., the Republican nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, didn’t bring up the topic at all — even after her campaign focused on it earlier in the fall.\n\nClearly, the polling showed her that she should drop the topic.\n\nThat may sound counterintuitive, considering that most voters agreed with her. But there’s a consistent rule of politics behind it: Whoever seems obsessed with social matters, on either side, loses.\n\nThe other persistent dynamic at play is “immunity by insanity.”\n\nWhen you describe it accurately, that Cox exposed himself in high school girls locker rooms because Democrats’ policies gave him the right to be there, you sound crazy. When you say Democrats were pushing to take daughters away from their parents if they wouldn’t affirm their daughters’ new identities as boys, then you sound crazy.\n\nDemocrats, of course, didn’t talk about gender ideology on the campaign trail. They even hid and kept a low profile for their transgender lawmaker, Danica Roem. Democrats felt they didn’t have to answer the accusations and could just avoid the matter altogether.\n\nSo Republicans in the end stopped saying these things.\n\nDemocrats have an analogous problem when it comes to President Donald Trump‘s corruption.\n\nTrump is making hundreds of millions off of meme coins, literally worthless digital “tokens,” and he just pardoned a crypto billionaire, yet says he doesn’t remember doing it. This would be the biggest presidential scandal in most years, but Democrats have been unable to make any of his crypto behavior stick.\n\nVirginia Republicans realized in the final days that even though they had the public on their side, they couldn’t harp on the matter.\n\nA year ago, the Trump campaign faced a similar problem. When Trump said in a debate that former Vice President Kamala Harris favored using taxpayer dollars to fund sex-change operations for transgender prisoners, the liberal media erupted in laughter, as if the charge was insane.\n\n‘THWARTING TRUMP’: VIRGINIA VOTERS SWING THE PENDULUM BACK\n\nThe charge was not insane. But the GOP knew how to hit the matter: an ad showing the accusation coming from the mouths of others, including Harris’s.\n\nIt’s an advantage both Trump and many Democrats have: Their actions and positions are so crazy that it’s hard to attack them without sounding insane.","summary":"MANASSAS, Virginia — Sometimes in politics, the other side is doing something so bad it makes you crazy to even talk about it.

This announcement has elicited a wave of appreciation from California officials and fellow politicians, acknowledging her long-standing service.\n\nAt 85, Pelosi made history as the first female Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and broke ground as the first woman to helm a major political party within the legislative branch.\n\nRELATED: Nancy Pelosi to step down from Congress at the conclusion of her term in 2027\n\nHere’s how prominent figures are responding to the news:\n\nPresident Donald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump didn’t hold back when commenting on Pelosi’s retirement, labeling her as “an evil woman.” He stated:\n\n“I consider her an evil woman, and I’m relieved to see her stepping down. Her retirement is, in my view, a favor to the country. I believe she was a significant burden, causing both reputational and material damage. Her tenure, I thought, was detrimental.”\n\nFormer Pres. Joe Biden\n\nFormer President Joe Biden took to X to express her gratitude to Pelosi, saying she has “devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful.”\n\n“I often said Nancy Pelosi was the best Speaker of the House in American history – it’s why I awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. When I was President, we worked together to grow our economy, create millions of jobs, and make historic investments in our nation’s future. She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful. Jill and I wish Nancy and Paul all the best.”\n\nFormer Pres. Barack Obama\n\nFormer President Barack Obama posted a series of photos on Instagram of his time with Pelosi during his presidency, saying, “She made us proud to be Democrats, and will go down in history as one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had. Nancy, thank you for your leadership and your friendship.”\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom posted to X Thursday morning, saying Pelosi inspired a generation.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi has inspired generations. Her courage and conviction to San Francisco, California, and our nation has set the standard for what public service should be. Her impact on this nation is unmatched. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Wishing you the best in this new chapter-you’ve more than earned it,” said Newsom.\n\nState Senator Scott Wiener\n\nState Senator Scott Wiener, who announced last week he would be running to fill Pelosi’s seat, called her “an icon of American politics.”\n\n“In her years of public service, Nancy Pelosi made every day count and moved mountains for San Francisco and our nation. Her example is a guiding light to me and millions of others as we face the extreme challenges ahead,” said Wiener.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff\n\nSen. Adam Schiff released a statement saying Pelosi will go down as the “greatest Speaker in American history” saying her work in Congress delivered “affordable health care to millions, created countless jobs, raised families out of poverty, cleaned up pollution, brought LGBTQ+ rights into the mainstream, and pulled our economy back from the brink of destruction not once, but twice.”\n\n“Despite that steadfast advocacy on the world stage, there was never any question as to the Speaker’s commitment to her home: San Francisco. Today, no visitor to the City will be able to miss the enduring mark that her work has made: from the restored and beautified Presidio, the expanded Golden Gate National Park, improvements to BART and the construction of the Transbay Transit Center, and a cleaner San Francisco Bay that is better protected from the ravages of climate change,” said Schiff.\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee\n\nFormer congresswoman and Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee, who spent decades alongside Pelosi in Congress, said in a statement that the former speakers’ “bold leadership paved the way for so many women and so much progress.”\n\n“For decades, I had the privilege of serving alongside Nancy as her congressional neighbor, working together on our shared values for San Francisco, the State of California, our Country and the World. As the first woman Speaker of the House, Nancy shattered barriers and opened doors for women across the country,” said Mayor Lee. “She never let us forget the work we were doing was for the children and our future. As she prepares for her final year in Congress, she leaves a standard of principled leadership that will endure. I know this next chapter of her life will continue to be filled with joy and more time with her husband Paul and her beautiful family.”\n\nFormer Congresswoman Gabby Gifford’s\n\nFormer Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords called Pelosi a “steadfast gun safety champion for decades” and her support of gun legislation was crucial in the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\n\n“Our nation is stronger and safer because of Nancy Pelosi’s decades of leadership, and I have been fortunate to call her a mentor and friend,” said former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. “She guided us through historic times, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the first federal legislation in almost 30 years to tackle the gun violence epidemic. Speaker Pelosi established the nation’s first gun violence prevention task force following the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, fought tirelessly for lifesaving background check legislation and never shied away from criticizing the corrupt gun lobby.”\n\nSan Mateo County Board of Supervisor and former Congresswoman Jackie Speier\n\n“She will go down in history as the most significant speaker of the House ever. I enjoyed it so much just sitting back and watching her magic. She would say things like we don’t agonize; we organize. She would say things like policy is our purpose, children are our mission, and politics is how we get there. I would write these down on a pad of paper and remember them,” said Jackie Speier, San Mateo County Board of Supervisor and former congresswoman.\n\nFormer Congresswoman Anna Eshoo\n\n“Incredible leadership in the house of representatives and simply put there is no one like her. I don’t think that we will see the likes of her really for generations to come,” said Anna Eshoo, former California Congresswoman.\n\nFormer Congresswoman Anna Eshoo is one of Pelosi’s closest friends; she remembers meeting Pelosi at a dinner party in the Bay Area almost five decades ago, way before they even thought about running for public office.\n\n“My beautiful friend, my sister friend. Well, she is remarkable. I remember so many years ago when we were young mothers, I told her ‘Nancy you are destined for something great,’ and she kind of mocked me, ‘you have direct line to upstairs,’ and I said ‘no I feel that I see that for you,”‘ said Eshoo.\n\nPelosi was first elected in 1987. Becoming a force for the Democratic party.\n\n“She reshaped the democratic caucus in the house of representatives. It was Nancy Pelosi who said we need to have more women at the table. She raised the fund and went around the country to encourage women to run,” said Eshoo.\n\nOne of her biggest political accomplishments: The Affordable Care Act.\n\n“You could ask every single member who was the most responsible for that happening? Was it the president, was it this one? It was Nancy Pelosi,” said Eshoo.\n\nFormer San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown\n\nFormer Mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown said Pelosi will continue to be an influential powerhouse.\n\n“Barack Obama was the first Black person to be elected to the presidency. Who orchestrated his nomination and the democratic caucus and the democratic convention? Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi did that and she carried with her Kamala Harris who ended up becoming the vice president many years later,” said Brown.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a significant political development, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: California Politicians Celebrate Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s Trailblazing Career as She Announces Retirement first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/california-politicians-celebrate-nancy-pelosis-trailblazing-career-as-she-announces-retirement/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Nancy-Pelosi-retires-California-leaders-politicians-express-gratitude-for-former.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 05:46:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.405},{"id":376674696,"title":"MAGA Host Megyn Kelly ‘Drools Over’ Gavin Newsom — Admits She’s Smitten With His Height and Hair","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom has gained another fan, and it’s none other than MAGA host Megyn Kelly. The popular host, known for her brutal commentary, has noticed more in Newsom than just his social media trolling of President Trump.\n\nRecently, she told The Daily Mail that Newsom is easy on the eyes. “He’s got the right hair. He’s tall,” said Kelly, who has been married to her second husband, author Douglas Brunt, since 2008. “He’s a good-looking guy,” she added. “People like handsome politicians and, though I’m not a Gavin Newsom fan, you can’t take that away from him.”\n\nThe conservative commentator shared her thoughts on the California governor with the site, expressing her hopes for a second Kamala Harris run in 2028. “On team blue please God let it be Kamala Harris again. Would we be that lucky? Please Lord, if I’ve done anything to please you ever, please make it be Kamala Harris again. If I’m a good person, God will reward me with another Kamala run,” she said. However, for quite some time, Newsom has emerged as a favorite among Democrats, and the admiration comes just ahead of the next presidential election.\n\nI saw someone said Gavin Newsom had an advantage because he looked like an American President you’d see in movies and I can’t stop thinking about it. pic.twitter.com/KZWQBXRYDS\n— 📎 Lilith Lovett 📎 same @ on 💙☁️🦋 (@LilithLovett) November 8, 2024\n\n“He’s been trying to train himself with his podcast, and he’s a far-left man who could get through the Democrat primary,” Kelly admitted.\n\nKelly hasn’t always been easy on Newsom. In September, when he used a clip from her show to make his point that “Trump’s base is splintering,” she lashed out at him while also criticizing Trump’s use of “the National Guard against American cities.”\n\nInstead of “tweeting about me,” she said on her show in response at the time, “he should be thrilled to receive President Trump’s offer” to “help” with California’s “crime problem.” Newsom, as usual, began a trolling spree against Trump, and he mimicked him with sarcastic posts in Trump’s all-caps style. Kelly called her “good-looking” nemesis’s tactics “pathetic.”\n\nTrump’s base is splintering.\nMegyn Kelly: “You can’t just send the National Guard into random cities…It very clearly is not constitutionally permissible. He cannot do it.” pic.twitter.com/GjXdvE3yRA\n— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) September 7, 2025\n\n“It doesn’t work. It’s not clever,” she told The Daily Mail. “The reason it works for Trump is it’s Trump, it’s authentic to him, it’s original, it’s funny, Trump’s funny. Just trying to imitate somebody, it’s not interesting. Maybe it makes him feel good because he gets a few more clicks,” she continued, but unlike his hair and height, “it does not move the needle for him at all.”\n\nKelly, however, poured cold water on Donald Trump’s desire to run for a third term. She shared that her “dream” presidential candidate for 2028 is Vance. “I think it’s going to be JD Vance. And my prayer is that his running mate is Marco Rubio. I think they’ll clean up, those two together. I think that’s a dream ticket.”\n\nMAGA supporters have claimed again and again that they would leave no stone unturned to make Trump win the 2028 elections. Even though the 22nd Amendment does not allow a consecutive third term, Trump supporters have said that “they would find a loophole and make it happen.” However, earlier this month, Trump put out a statement hinting that he would not run for the presidential election. Trump on possible third term: “I’m not allowed to run.

And the bear roared back,” declared Newsom. “Tonight, California sent a powerful message to Donald Trump. We will fight for our democracy. And we will win.”\n\nAs of this writing Wednesday afternoon, the “Yes” side received nearly 64% of the vote. That’s a thumping no matter how you spin it.\n\nFor reference, in the Nov. 2024 presidential election, Vice President and former California Senator Kamala Harris received 58.47% of the vote.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Newsom was reelected with 59% of the vote. And in 2021, Californians rejected the recall of Newsom with 62% voting to defeat it.\n\nAs an editorial board that opposed Proposition 50 and supported Newsom’s recall, there’s really no serious way to spin this other than a triumph for Newsom and a rejection of Trump.\n\nOf course, reality hasn’t stopped some Republicans from trying to make excuses or generate bizarre explanations.\n\n“The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “All ‘Mail-In’ Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,’ is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!”\n\nWe’re still waiting for President Trump to provide a shred of evidence that the 2020 elections were stolen.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, has taken the opportunity to try his hand at being a national political influencer by appealing to other Democratic states to do what he pulled off in California.\n\n“We need the state of Virginia, we need the state of Maryland, we need our friends in New York, in Illinois, in Colorado, we need to see other states…meet this moment head on as well,” he said. “To recognize what we’re up against in 2026.”\n\nTime will tell whether that plays out. For the sake of the country, we hope to see the gerrymandering games end. In July, we wrote, “Gerrymandering is a longstanding political art form. But mid-term redistricting efforts move our system in the wrong direction. Republicans are the real hypocrites here. If they’re serious about protecting independent redistricting efforts, they should publicly oppose changing the rules in Democratic California and Republican states, too.”\n\nAlas, that didn’t happen. Republicans started this gerrymandering spat in Texas and are now playing the victim because California responded. It’s absurd.\n\nBut, regardless, Newsom has successfully offset what Texas Republicans did and proved he can galvanize donors and voters alike to deal a blow to Republicans. That was his play to national Democrats and he won. The California GOP, meanwhile, has been left looking like an amateurish operation.","summary":"Proposition 50 win cements Newsoms status","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/11/06/proposition-50-win-cements-newsoms-status/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LDN-L-NEXTMAPS-0823-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 04:03:31","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.489},{"id":376571500,"title":"Trump Celebrates Pelosi’s Departure from Congress: Calls Her ‘A Savage","text":"Nancy Pelosi, the trailblazing former Speaker of the House, revealed on Thursday her decision not to seek re-election in 2026. This announcement puts an end to the ongoing speculation about when the influential political figure would choose to step away from the political arena.\n\nRepublicans have openly expressed their satisfaction at the news, as Pelosi has been a formidable opponent to them for many years.\n\nAt 85, Pelosi has been a prominent presence on Capitol Hill since 1987, and she holds the distinction of being the first and only woman to serve as Speaker of the House. She is also the second-highest-ranking woman in U.S. political history, following former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a heartfelt message shared on social media, Pelosi expressed her gratitude as she looked forward to her final year in Congress. “With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,” she stated. “As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress.”\n\nPiloting the House as its first female speaker from 2007 to 2011, Pelosi played a pivotal role during much of President Barack Obama’s initial term. She reclaimed the gavel in 2019, during President Donald Trump’s tenure, and continued to lead until 2023.\n\nShe was awarded the gavel again in 2019, under President Donald Trump’s first term, a post she held until 2023.\n\nShe will go down as one of the longest tenured leaders in the US House of Representatives after leading the House Democrats for 20 years. She is by far the most powerful female in congressional history, and arguably in US politics history.\n\n‘She’s a savage who understands how to earn and use power,’ acknowledged Mike Davis, an attorney and rabid Trump ally. ‘Republicans should take notes.’ \n\nRepublicans are ruminating on the announcement that their longtime nemesis has finally decided to give up power.\n\n‘The retirement of Nancy Pelosi is a great thing for America,’ Trump told Fox News. ‘She was Evil, Corrupt, and only focused on bad things for our country. She was rapidly losing control of her party, and it was never coming back.’\n\nThe president and Pelosi feuded extensively over the years. Trump has called Pelosi an assortment of degrading nicknames and alleged she’s corrupt. \n\nPelosi led two impeachment attempts against the 79-year-old president.\n\nShe also famously tore his State of the Union speech in half in front of millions of Americans watching at home in a defiant act of opposition during Trump’s first term. \n\nTheir relationship hit new lows after the January 6 riots, during which Pelosi was in the Capitol before being evacuated to a nearby military base. \n\nDuring the riot, the pro-Trump protestors broke into the Democrat’s office and rummaged through her belongings, videos of the incident show.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson suggested Pelosi’s decision to call it quits was illustrative of how far left the Democratic Party had shifted. \n\n‘The old guard has been repudiated, and the radicals are taking over the Democratic Party,’ he said Wednesday morning at a press conference. \n\n‘Even the famous San Francisco liberal is not far enough for the neo-Marxists,’ Johnson said, adding, ‘and we commend her for her service.’\n\nThe former speaker also played a central role in the Democratic Party’s soul-searching amid President Joe Biden’s shaky presidential campaign. \n\nShe reportedly insisted that Biden step aside, and during TV hits, she publicly urged the aging president to reconsider. \n\nJill Biden, who has had a 50-year friendship with Pelosi, later called the ex-speaker’s conduct before the election ‘disappointing.’ \n\nIn 2022, tragedy struck when Pelosi’s husband, Paul, a venture capitalist, was attacked at the couple’s San Francisco home and beaten in the head with a hammer. \n\nThe assailant was later arrested and charged, but the incident’s violence underscores the rise in political violence over the course of the congresswoman’s 38-year career. \n\nThe daughter of Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., a former congressman from Baltimore, Pelosi was a part of a political dynasty of sorts. \n\nThough her path to the peak of congressional power is a story uniquely her own. \n\n‘I often said Nancy Pelosi was the best Speaker of the House in American history — it’s why I awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom,’ Biden said in a statement. \n\n‘She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful. Jill and I wish Nancy and Paul all the best.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNancy Pelosi, the trailblazing former Speaker of the House, revealed on Thursday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Celebrates Pelosi&#8217;s Departure from Congress: Calls Her &#8216;A Savage first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-celebrates-pelosis-departure-from-congress-calls-her-a-savage/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trump-rejoices-at-Nancy-Pelosis-decision-to-finally-quit-Congress.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 02:37:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.069},{"id":376576108,"title":"James Carville says he’d bet money Dems will win 2028 presidential election — then pack Supreme Court","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville’s predictions have a checkered history, but he declared he would bet money that a Democrat will win the presidency in 2028 and proceed to pack the Supreme Court.\n\nAs Carville and his co-host Al Hunt took questions on Thursday’s episode of “Politics War Room,” one inquired what could have been done during the Joe Biden presidency to “prepare for the possibility of Trump winning a second term.”\n\nWhile Hunt argued that new laws and guardrails would not have made much of a difference, Carville outlined how the next Democratic president could wield power differently from his predecessors.\n\n“I’m going to tell you what’s going to happen. A Democrat is going to be elected in 2028. You know that. I know that,” he said. \n\n“The Democratic president is going to announce a special transition advisory committee on the reform of the Supreme Court.”\n\nCarville suggested further of this committee, “They’re going to recommend that the number of Supreme Court justices go from nine to 13. That’s going to happen, people. That’s going to happen to you. They’re going to win. They’re going to do some blue ribbon panel of distinguished jurists, and they are going to recommend 13, and a Democratic Senate and House is going to pass it, and the Democratic president is going to sign it, because they have to do an intervention so we can have a Supreme Court that the American people trust again.”\n\nCarville assured listeners, “So just keep that in the back of your mind. And I would bet a lot of money that that’s what’s going to happen. A lot.”\n\nCarville conceded in Janurary that he was wrong about the 2024 election, after repeatedly predicting then-Vice President Kamala Harris would win, and that the results boiled down to the economy.\n\n“I thought Kamala Harris would win. I was wrong. While I’m sure we Democrats can argue that the loss wasn’t a landslide or take a little solace in our House performance, the most important thing for us now is to face that we were wrong and take action on the prevailing ‘why,’” Carville wrote.\n\nCarville previously wrote an essay for the New York Times headlined, “Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win,” and said during a pre-election interview on MSNBC that Harris would beat Trump because Trump was “stone a– nuts.”","summary":"Democratic strategist James Carville said on Thursday’s episode of \"Politics War Room\" that he would bet money that a Democrat will win the 2028 presidential election while also packing the Supreme Court.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/06/us-news/james-carville-says-hed-bet-money-dems-will-win-2028-presidential-election-pack-supreme-court/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/114941777.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/buTkiuyC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 02:31:35","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.261}]}
